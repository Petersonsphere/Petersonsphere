Digestive flow.

The Yogis discovered that there are certain things that are not us that become us. They called this fact of metabolism, Agni, or, the digestifier.

Ex: I eat a sandwich and it becomes cells, skin, blood, etc.

The other thing Agni does is digest [[Information]] and turn it into [[Jnana|understanding]]. There is a faculty of the [[Mind]] that hears information and transmits it into understanding.

All of this is governed by the [[Manipura Chakra]].
