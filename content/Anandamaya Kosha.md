The bliss body. Layer 5 in [[Panchakosha Theory]]. The part of us that's divine. The part which is in some cultures called the [[soul]].

It's the part of humanness that isn't contained in the other parts.

You aren't just a body, or a collection of energy, or your emotions, or your thoughts. Even if we combine the first four layers, we still don't have a complete person. This is the thread of you-ness that stays constant that runs through all of the other layers.
