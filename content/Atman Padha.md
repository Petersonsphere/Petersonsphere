(aat-man Puh-dah)

The path of the self. What is the nature of a human being? What makes up a person?

Alot of our difficulties & suffering in life comes from not realizing who we are. As we discover who we are, we find ourselves unshackled from the things that hold us back.

Thoughts like, "I am a failure," or, "I am unlovable," or, "That person is better than me," all stem from not understanding what we really are. As we discover what we are, we won't feel that way anyway & will conquer things like [[low self-esteem]].
