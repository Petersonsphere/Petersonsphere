Class of drugs that depress the [[Central Nervous System|CNS]] via the amino acid [[neurotransmitter]]: ([[Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid|GABA]]). [[Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid|GABA]] is a major inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain. Benzodiazepines increase the activity of [[Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid|GABA]], thereby producing a sedating effect, relaxing skeletal muscles, and inducing [[sleep]], anesthesia, and amnesia.
