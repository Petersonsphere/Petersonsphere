(Bruh-muh-moo-hoo-ruh-thuh)

The hour of Brahmamuhurtha begins one hour and 36 minutes before sunrise, and ends 48 minutes before sunrise.

It is a time that is very conducive to mental activity, like [[Studying]] or [[Meditation]].

Religious traditions from all across the world acknowledge that the early hours of the morning - around dawn (3:30am - 5:30am or so) are very conducive to mental activity (which is why the first set of prayers start then).
