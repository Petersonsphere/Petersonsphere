(Bruh-muh-moo-hoo-ruh-thuh)

A time that is very conducive to mental activity, like [[studying]] or [[meditation]].

The hour of Brahmamuhurtha begins one hour and 36 minutes before sunrise, and ends 48 minutes before sunrise.

Religious traditions from all across the world acknowledge that the early hours of the morning - around dawn (3:30am - 5:30am or so) are very conducive to mental activity (which is why the first set of prayers start then).
