Cosmic consciousness.

A sea of formless consciousness. Entirety. Beyond imagination. Infinite. Unchanging. Pervades the whole universe. The unity from which life evolved & to which it returns.

"What is Brahman like?" - Neti neti ("not this, not this"). If you can describe it, it isn't Brahman. It's neither hard nor soft, neither light nor heavy, neither here nor there, neither light nor dark. Any word you can use to describe a manifestation can't describe Brahman.
