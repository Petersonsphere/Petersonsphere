*Example situation: a serial procrastinator who usually is able to get things done at the last minute is currently under high stress from many impending urgent tasks, and their usual strategy of using urgency to create motivation suddenly stopped working. They are feeling overwhelmed, paralyzed, and find themselves unable to act despite high impending consequences.*

###### Memory
For each task that you mentally "sign up for", some part of your mind is keeping track of it. The more things your mind is keeping track of, the less energy it has to complete actions.

An uncompleted task in our mind ties up cognitive energy. As our cognitive energy gets tied up with more tasks, we're left with less energy for action.

As we get tied up with more tasks, things become more urgent. Usually, we rely on urgency to give us motivation to give us tasks.

[[Buddha]] explained the concept of a [[Karma|karmic]] drain. If you make a promise to someone, or if you have a desire that's unfulfilled, then that is something that will have to be "finished off" in some way. Incomplete desire is what gets us stuck in the cycle of birth & rebirth, & traps us.

The more stuff you sign up for, the bigger load you're going to have cognitively, and potentially the bigger load you're going to have spiritually as well. If you find that you have lots of tasks to do and find yourself more and more paralyzed, understand that this is the principle of cognitive drain (& maybe [[Karma|karmic]] drains).

###### How to address a cognitive drain:
There are 2 ways to address cognitive drains:
1) Through satisfaction
	*Checking a box off the "to-do list". If I need to remember to get milk at the grocery store before going home today, once I have gotten the milk, that part of my mind gets freed up; now, I can point that energy at something else.*
2) Through grief
*There are lots of [[Karma|karmic]] & cognitive drains that we can't check off - things from the past can't be undone. If you have cognitive drain for something that isn't easy to "check off", you can grieve it.* Grief is the process we're talking about when we talk about "letting go," or, "detaching". We accumulate desires as we live our life. Each desire burdens our mind a little bit more & "fills up that space", leaving us with less "space" to accomplish what we want.
	*The best example is addiction. When you're addicted to something, we need a lot of willpower, or cognitive strength, to overcome it. People who go through addiction will go through a 12 step process. One of the 12 steps is called "making amends", where they stop & think about all the people you have wronged through the addiction - they sequentially make amends with all of the negative karma they have accrued. Then, they pick up the phone and start making phone calls - they'll track people down and apologize / do whatever they can now to make amends to fix the damage they've done in the past. People who go through this process of making amends are more likely to become sober. What does apologizing to someone 5 years ago have to do with being able to resist alcohol at the next social gathering? Those two things seem unrelated. We actually aren't sure how it works, but the people who try to deny the past are much more likely to stay addicted - either by trying to forget about it, or by trying to convince themselves that they did nothing wrong. The principle of [[Karma|karmic]] / cognitive drains seems to be borne out in scientific outcomes.*

The nice words you tell yourself that you're going to say to other people, or the dreams you let yourself dream - each of these is a [[Karma|karmic]] tie. In the cycle of [[reincarnation]], each of our desires is viewed as a chain that binds you. The book you want to write, the social media post you want to make, or the action you want to do for someone else - each of these things is a chain that binds you. There 2 ways to become unshackled from these desires is to *complete* them or to *grieve*.
