On the science of attraction

There are 7 Empowerment Areas:

- Mental development (wake up genius, creativity). Awareness. Intelligence.
- Business (achievement). Ambition.
- Financially
- Relationship (stable family )
- Social life (social leadership & influence. Connection). Not flirtatious. Stable.
- Physically (strength, stamina, dexterity)
- Inspired (having inspired mission)

We're looking for the areas we're not empowered in. But it's your perception. They fluctuate.

See. Hear. Smell. Taste (touch). We see further than we hear. Hear further than we smell. Etc.

Priority. Blood & glucose to forebrain (executive center). More objectivity. More clarity. Strategic planning. Mitigating risk. Executing plans. W/o impulses & instincts. You're more powerful. Identify values (online questionnaire). Prioritize your life. Delegate lower areas. Live by design, not duty.

Disempowerment: putting people on pedestals & living by their values, or looking down on people & trying to get them to live by your values. Look across @ people w/ reflective awareness.

What he does in his "Breakthrough Experience" program: dissolve emotional baggage of the past & fantasies of the future. Judgments of putting people up or down. Putting people in your heart.
Judgment, volatility, & being polarized in perception blocks intimacy & love, which is not attractive.

Don't be too humble to admit you have what you see in others. Or too proud. You'll have a feeling of lack of intimacy & emptiness.

Find the wounds of the past relationships & clear them. Otherwise you'll avoid behaviors that are associated with what you want.

Link what you're doing (behaviors) to your values.

Your soul is the authentic you.
