**[[Desire|Desires]]** come from the **[[Indriya]]s**, are **transient** in nature, and **don't drive** a lot of **motivation**. 

I don't have to have an experience to get a desire; I just need a sensory experience / impression. Marketing bombards you with sensory impressions.
	I want a Yacht, even though I have never stepped foot on one. They seem cool & it seems like people have fun on them. How is this thought possible? I got the idea that a Yacht would be nice through my [[Indriya]]s. Even though I "want" a yacht, I don't wake up every day, thinking about it: "I'm going to work extra hard today because it will get me one step closer to the Yacht."

The satisfaction [[Desire|desires]] lead to is **temporary** in nature.
	*When someone else gets a promotion, you want a promotion, then after you get a promotion, you're only satisfied for a little while.*
