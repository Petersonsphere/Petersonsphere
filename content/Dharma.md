(Dhar-muh)

Sanskrit word for duty, or, responsibility.

In [[Arjuna]]'s conversation with [[Krishna]], Arjuna is experiencing lots of negative emotion. Krishna explains to Arjuna that it's his duty to fight.

A lot of our actions by pain & pleasure. Our [[mind]] leads us toward some things ([[raga]]) & away from other things ([[dvesha]]). If we live in terms of [[raga]] & [[dvesha]], we end up suffering.

Dharma makes it easy for us to freely choose the hard path in life.
Example - someone points a gun at you. You have lots of [[dvesha]]. Now imagine someone points a gun at your child. The negative consequences have increased, but now it becomes easy to step into the path of the gun, rather than away from it.
Example - studying for grades vs studying to learn (to impact the world).

If you're trying to do something in life, think about what your dharma is.
When you discover your dharma, the things that your [[mind]] doesn't want to do become vitally important. It's not longer about using willpower to overcome your negative impulses. You actually don't have a choice when you do something in service to your dharma.

How do you find your dharma? It's naturally tied to your [[Karma]].
