(Dh-yaan-nuh)

(not a verb) A state of mind. The 'no-mind' state.

It isn't something you can do. You can't 'do' dhyana. You can enter into dhyana by doing [[Dharana]]s.

Example: like going to sleep. All you can do is go to bed, & then sleep is a state of [[Mind]] that happens to someone who goes to bed.
