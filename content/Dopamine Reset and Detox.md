The problem we're trying to solve is: "we're not motivated" to do something. Even though we know something is good for us, we aren't learning from our mistakes; we aren't able to "find" motivation.
- One of the big contributors to this is technology use, because it messes with our dopamine system (through [[Tolerance]] - too much easy dopamine). Why do something hard when you can doom scroll & get that dopaminergic spurt?

Resetting our motivational system has to do with getting rid of the [[Tolerance]] we've built up. Life gurus & silicon valley CEOs have popularized the idea of doing a "dopamine fast", but the truth is, you can't cut dopamine out of your life - it's a chemical signal secreted by your neurons, and it does a lot more than what the [[Reward Circuitry|mesolimbic circuit]] does (reward, behavior, & reinforcement).
- Dopamine is also used by another part of our brain to do motor movements. For example, people with [[Parkinson's disease]] will have death of dopaminergic neurons in a part of the brain called the [[Substantia nigra]]. When those neurons die, people with [[Parkinson's disease]] can't walk or move their hand fluidly.
- Dopamine is also important for our [[Gastrointestinal|GI]] tract. It moves food through our stomach to our intestines.
We aren't going to be fasting from [[Dopamine]]. We're going to reduce the steady amount of [[Dopamine]] that we're constantly getting by abstain from particular activities so that our [[Tolerance]] can go away. Then our [[Reward Circuitry|reward circuitry]] will rebalance itself and our [[motivation]] will increase. Our ability to enjoy things and our reinforce certain behaviors will also go up. Our ability to learn from our mistakes will be restored.

#### What do we need to abstain from to reset our dopamine?
Caveat: What we're going to talk about is based on clinical observation because we don't have studies that measure the [[Tolerance]] to [[Dopamine]] levels in brains. We do have the studies for substance use disorders (like opiate [[Addiction]], or heroin [[Addiction]]), and the clinical features look a lot like dopaminergic activities, like playing video games.

We want to cut out activities that give you easy access to dopamine.
#### Avoid or Limit
- Substances - they directly stimulate the [[Reward Circuitry|dopamine circuitry]]
- Bad Technology Use - no video games, no social media, no content aggregating sites (like reddit, twitter). Get rid of them.
- Porn, masturbation, & unhealthy sex - you don't necessary need to be celibate during this period (depending on what's going on); that's more of a judgment call. But, what we tend to find is that the kinds of people who have difficulty with motivation also have difficulty with these kinds of activities. Usually people don't know why they're using it; they fall into this easy way to get dopamine.
- Unhealthy foods - combinations of carbs & fats. The kinds of foods people fall prey to binge eating (oreos; tubs if ice cream). People can get into addictive relationships with food.
- Shopping & Gambling - gambling can stimulate your [[Reward Circuitry|reward circuitry]] at the cost of all kinds of aspects of your life. Steer clear. Shopping [[Addiction]] is also something we're seeing more of where people manage their internal emotions thorough buying stuff on the internet.
- Thrill Seeking Behaviors - sometimes people engage in risky behaviors for the sake of risky behaviors. High adrenaline activities are addictive. Some people, like people with ADHD, or people who are prone to [[Addiction]] have a particular propensity towards thrill seeking. Cut it out.

#### What to expect (symptoms)
When you detox from things like opiates, you'll experience things like diarrhea, sweatiness, tremors, headaches, it's gonna be awful, you'll feel pain throughout your body.

Some patients that have been through [[Opiod]] detox & [[Dopamine]] detox have actually said that [[Dopamine]] detox was harder.

1) Boredom
The first thing you can expect is **boredom.** Your primary symptom will be boredom. You're going to be bored. For 72 hours. The kind of bored that keeps you itchy. 
- **Avoid phone use during transitions**. Notice how much you reach for your phone when you
- Go to the bathroom ... you take your phone with you.
- Something gets boring on the tv show you're watching ... you kind reach for your phone.
- Get in / out of the car
- Moving from one room to another
When there's any kind of transient boredom, we tend to satisfy that with technology use. You're going to need to have to be bored.

2) Negative Emotions
The second thing, which sometimes people are unprepared for, is **negative emotions**. We use the things mentioned above to distract ourselves & protect us from experiencing negative emotions (see [[Resistance]] for more info). You're going to experience more negative emotions because your numbing agent is now gone.

*Storytime - 
- At a hospital, we discovered that people with eating disorders unit (anorexia / binge eating disorder, etc.) are very likely to cut (use self injurious behavior). Even though they were getting treating for one thing, there was also this other problematic behavior which was hard to control.
- *In the Borderline Personality Disorder unit (BPD - people who have experienced a lot of trauma), people had a real problem with cutting outside of the hospital, so we had to monitor that closely. We found that those people were all sneaking out at night & getting high (they had addictions).*
- *Then, in the addictions unit, when we forced people to be sober, they started having eating use disorder. They start being restrictive with what they eat; they lose weight; we have to give them IV fluids and stuff because they aren't drinking enough water*
Each of these groups of patients had a particular way to deal with their emotions. If someone was struggling with negative emotions, they could take control of the situation through disordered eating. If someone struggled with negative emotions from trauma, they could stop that thinking in the [[Mind]] by cutting, or doing self injurious behavior. Or, the one everyone is familiar with, I can get high and forget about my worries. In psychiatry, we see this experience of whack-a-mole. When we take away one coping mechanism, we see a rise in others. This is why in psychiatry, we have such an emphasis on [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]], now. If we can give this person another way to cope, then they won't have to engage in the negative behavior.

3) Coping mechanisms
The key thing to remember when it comes to dopamine detoxing - **when you take away your numbing agent, be prepared for more negative emotion, and be prepared for reaching for some other kind of unhealthy coping mechanism.** This is what trips people up, because, even if they can conquer the boredom, they can start to feel [[Depression|depressed]], [[Anxiety|anxious]], & lack of [[focus]], so they need some kind of relief to ride that out.

#### Tips
The duration you want to shoot for to dopamine detox is 2 weeks.

1) Structure your day
- If you don't structure your day, boredom will take over and you'll crack. You want to fill your day with as many activities that are as thoughtful and engaging as possible.
- Connect with nature
- Some people go camping. This solves this problem on it's own. You're away from technology. When you come back, you have to learn to set limits, but generally speaking, this is a good opportunity to go hiking, fishing, etc. There's evidence that shows that looking at the horizon does good things for your stress levels. 20 minutes of access to green space will lower your cortisol levels. Plant aerosols & phytochemicals (the compounds plants release) balance your mood & anxiety (by activating your [[olfactory receptors]]).
2) Improve skills - during dopamine detox, we want to fill our time.
- Cooking, for example. Plan ahead so you don't slip into eating unhealthy food when you're in a bad mood / low energy.
- Read Books - remember that when you first start, it might be hard. It's okay to not succeed, get bored, set it down. Try again the next day. Keep trying again every day. In the first 72 hours, it will be really difficult. By day 5 or 6, people can usually start to get into books. Sometimes audiobooks are a little easier to get into - go for a walk with them.
- Structured social activity - you don't want to be socializing with people who are drinking or gaming, but social groups (exercise classes, escape rooms, board game groups) are very healthy to engage in.
- Focus on responsibilities - focus on work / school with greater intensity. The time will fly by.
- [[Urge Surfing]] - during this time, you will have very powerful urges to relapse. You don't need to beat / conquer the urge. You just have to not give in to it. The urge will rise; as long as you don't give into it, it will reside on its own, eventually. In the same way that you get bored of a book, the [[Mind]] gets bored of the urges. The mind always gets bored of the desire to do one thing.
- Limit phone use
	- Turn of all notifications you don't absolutely need.
	- As best as possible, keep your phone away from you, physically. We've developed physiologic motor dependence on our phones. Walk around your house without your phone. We want to reduce access to it. If you're at work / school, keep it in your desk / backpack.
- Turn on greyscale
- Uninstall apps; log out of apps so that logging in is more difficult (which will give you more opportunity to [[Urge Surfing|urge surf]])
- Community support - sometimes when going on a dopamine detox, it can be helpful to let some people know what you're doing (ex: "don't invite me to play video games for the next 2 weeks", "I'm going to be leaving my phone in a different room for the next 2 weeks, so I probably won't be very responsive", etc.). You can even enroll your degenerate friends on hikes instead of getting high.
