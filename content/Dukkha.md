(Doo-kh-uh)

Sanskrit word for suffering.

Dukkha isn't on the axis of emotion. It's on a different axis of peace vs suffering.

People seek pleasure & avoid pain. Even if we're good at this, hedonistic people still can feel discontent, like something isn't right. We have a cosmic [[dukkha]].

###### Story of **Krishna and Arjuna**
There's civil war. Arjuna (an archer) despairs about fighting in battle (against guy who taught him right & wrong, guy who taught him to be an archer, people he loves, like his cousin, grandfather, etc).
[[Krishna]] & [[Arjuna]]'s conversation becomes the [[Bhagavad Gita]].
[[Krishna]] helps him understand that his [[dukkha]] doesn't have to do with the situation, it has to do with his attachment to the situation (his expectations about the situation). To be free from his [[Dukkha|dukkha]], he must let go of his attachment.
This also might be the first recorded example of psychotherapy.

###### Story of Buddha
Everything in Buddha's life was accomplished; everything was going well, but he woke up one day & felt he was unhappy. When you feel unhappy, your mind says "I'm missing something... when I get the thing I want I'll be happy". You get the thing, you're happy for a little bit, but then the cycle of discontentment repeats itself. Buddha reached the end of the road. Had everything. That's when he started his journey to overcome [[Dukkha|dukkha]] & find [[sukha]].

There are two guarantees, or, fundamental "rights" in life: Death, and [[Dukkha|dukkha]].

Suffering comes from our attachment to expectations.

###### Suffering comes from our attachment to expectations.
Example 1 - Think about the woes high schoolers suffer. You grow up, you change, your perspective expands. None of the stuff from high school is different, you just become detached. It doesn't bother you as much. Even if you're accomplished (popular, for example), you still worry about losing what you have. Even success can come with suffering as long as there's attachment.
Example 2 - The Bridezilla. Wanting the perfect day; the perfect wedding; getting upset because one thing goes wrong. Suffering comes from how much we care about things. How much does it matter a decade latter if the appetizer at your wedding wasn't right? Some insane people actually carry that resentment (attachment) for a decade.
Example 3 - a parent with a child who has cancer. Some parents are able to grieve their children better (grief is a process of letting go).

You need something really powerful to grieve a loss, or overcome an addiction.

The antidote to dukkha is [[Dharma]].
