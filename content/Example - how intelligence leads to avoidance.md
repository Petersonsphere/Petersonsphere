*Smart kids don't have to study much; constantly complimented about how smart they are. Being smart becomes part of their [[ego|identity]]. Then they get older & things get harder. As they start to encounter things that are **more difficult** (things that require more effort), they **pull away** because failure means that they aren't smart. 

Then they end up narrowing what they're capable of. Everything gets piled onto the identity of being smart. Instead of being a kid who plays sports and music and is smart, all they're left with is the identity of smartness.

Then they end up [[resistance|self-sabotaging]]. Because, if they tell themselves, "I'm really smart" and then they study with 100% effort and get a B, then that experience challenges their identity.

So, they just wait till the last minute to study instead. That way when they get the B they can just say to themselves, "Well, I'm a smart kid who is just lazy. If I would have studied harder, I definitely would have gotten an A. I'm just a talented genius who's cursed with a lack of discipline.

Then they end up in college, being unable to study at all & get terrible grades.*
