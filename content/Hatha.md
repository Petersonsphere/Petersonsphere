Hatha practices are focused on the Body. Focused on [[Asana]] & [[Pranayama]].

The Hatha Yogis believed, unlike [[Raja]] Yogis, that you don't have to do any of the other Yoga stuff (to attain enlightenment). They believed that you could purify & perfect your body & mind so much that you can attain enlightenment.
