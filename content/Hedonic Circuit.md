  - Hedonic Circuitry
---
Found in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex]]. The circuit of **liking** things. Enjoyment happens in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex]]. The primary [[Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] are [[Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid|GABA]] and [[Opiod]]s.

Substances of abuse like Alcohol and opioids make people enjoy things more (it isn't reward or fulfilment).

The hedonic circuit is a different circuit than **wanting** things. **Enjoying** something isn't going to make you **want** it.

#### [[Prediction reward error processing]]
The discrepancy between **enjoying** something & **wanting** something is called [[Prediction reward error processing]], or 'prediction reward error'.

Most things you do, you like, therefore you want. For much of our life, we assume the hedonics & dopaminergic go hand in hand (we like watching tv / playing games, therefore we do it).

When it comes to [[motivation]], if you have [[Prediction reward error processing|prediction reward error]], then those two things don't go hand in hand.
- *For example, despite the fact that hedonics activate and you enjoy going out with friends, you never really want to go out.* - People will use words like 'social anxiety' to describe this; or people will toss out terms like 'cognitive bias' to describe not wanting to do something that you like.

###### Problem 1 [[Prediction reward error processing|prediction reward error]] causes - it can have a **psychological** effect
This discrepancy between liking & wanting can make people feel really bad about themselves, like there's something fundamentally broken with them. They assume they have something wrong with them psychologically. Like there's something wrong with you, but all of the other humans are doing a good job.

###### Problem 2 [[Prediction reward error processing|prediction reward error]] causes - people go looking to ***create*** motivation (externally)
People will go looking to *create* more motivation. Take a nootropic. Try to recruit friends to go to the gym with. But, the problem is in the brain. If these two circuits are fundamentally disconnected, no amount of looking for motivation will create it.

It sounds weird, but, the more that you can mentally accept the idea that,
- *"I'm just never going to be motivated to do this; I don't need to want to do it, but I'm just going to do it anyway,"*
It isn't ideal, but at least you will stop looking for motivation & having your brain disconnect, anyway.

Looking for motivation ("how do I want it more?") won't work. Instead, "**take a step back**" ([[Vairagya]]) & acknowledge that no amount of cognitive supplements or reading self help forums / videos will ever cause you to want to make you want it. If you can "**let go**" ([[Satya]], [[Dukkha]], [[Reframing Goals to Actions]]) of looking for this magical thing called "[[Motivation]]", and just accept that "this is something my brain may never want; despite the fact that I'm 100% sure I'm going to like it".

**Somehow, the acceptance that you have a disconnect between wanting something and liking it can actually motivate people**.
- Because then they stop looking for the magic pill, or waking up and having the inner fire to go to the gym. We're out there looking for unicorns without realizing that there's a horse right here. Sure, a unicorn is better and prettier and more magical and more wonderful, & a horse is simpler, but it's actually what's right here.

Acknowledging that something will be **good for us**, and also acknowledging that we **won't want to do it**, interestingly, somehow makes it easier to do. Once you know what you're dealing with, it actually gives you power over it. What we like & what we want may never line up. Oddly enough, this is actually okay. Once we realize that the brain isn't quite going to *learn* from it's errors (from it's ability to predict things poorly). Then, we can just acknowledge that & be prepared for it, which paradoxically makes it easier to act.
