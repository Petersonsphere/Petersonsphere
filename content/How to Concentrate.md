The ability to hold a particular thought in our [[mind]] is the cornerstone of [[Motivation]]. The ability to hold one thought in the [[mind]] will result in [[Motivation]]. The problem is that we're never actually taught how to concentrate.

*Example: teachers and parents tell a kid "you're so gifted, you just need to 'study more', or, 'work harder', or, 'apply yourself more'. So, the kid will sit there and stare at their textbooks while their mind wonders. The parents & teachers think this is studying, so they quit nagging the kid, but in the mind, the kid is distracted. Maybe the kid pulls his attention back and reads a paragraph every now and then & learns a few things, but because the kid gets easily bored of it and lets the mind wonder very easily, internally **the kid recognizes this as a waste of time** and starts doing something that's mentally more engaging instead. Nobody ever teaches the kid, "by the way, studying isn't sitting down & keeping your mouth shut and staring at the page for an hour so that we don't bother you", because that's what they actually **enforce**; ... "by the way, this is how you get your mind to focus ... if your [[mind]] get distracted, this is what you should do to bring it back".* 

Shaping thoughts is something society is really good at. We have entire fields, like advertising, which know that, if you bombard someone's thinking, you can actually shape their behavior. We see this in social media as well. You can shape user behavior by eliciting certain kinds of thoughts. Content algorithms will shape your thoughts over time. We're seeing more online radicalization through a process of content exposure. The challenge is that we know how to shape someone **else's** thoughts, not our own. We're up against powerful tools that shape our thoughts; we aren't taught how to resist those impulses; how to stop being on autopilot; how to concentrate.

We're going to focus on 3 fundamental movements of the mind:
1) The ability to **direct** the mind
2) The ability to **let go** of something in the mind
3) The ability to **hold** something in the mind

###### Concentration is like training a dog ... "**Stop** ... **come here** ... **Sit. Stay**."
If I want to focus on [[studying]], I need to tell my mind to go in a particular **direction**, and have it go there. Then, what can happen, is I can get distracted. When I get distracted, I need to use a second movement of the mind - **letting go** of that thing. I need to **drop** an object in the mind so that it is free to be directed to another place. Then, what we all want to get good at it, I need to **hold** something else in the mind.

[[Thought Control Meditations]] are like doing training reps to do this.
