Humans have **variable** aspects (height, voice pitch, hair color, etc).
There is naturally occurring variability in attention. This is characterized in hunters vs. farmers.

**Farmers** - creatures of **habit**. Wake up at same time. Have routine. Is disrupted by changing circumstances.
**Hunter** - Attention is more **dynamic**. Thrives on change. People who get bored easily. Struggle to do the same thing every day.
Some humans needed highly variable attention to integrate different stimuli.

Geneticists looked into hunter gatherer societies & discovered that the genes for ADHD seem to be highly **inheritable**.
- *Societies with more hunter gathering had more ADHD genes within that society compared to societies with more farming. This suggests that something is positively selecting for variable attention, or, highly dynamic attention.*

There's still debate about this topic. However, some studies have looked at large, global populations & found that, over the last 5,000 years, there has been negative selection for ADHD genes. This suggests that, maybe at one point, having highly dynamic attention

But we do know that there are **variabilities** within people's **attention**.

The **diagnosis** of ADHD is environmentally dependent. The same child in 2 different situations may or may not receive an ADHD diagnosis.
- The student-teacher ratio in schools heavily influences the diagnosis of ADHD. Lower teacher-student rations = higher likelihood of ADHD diagnosis.

**There is an intersection between the environment we exist in & whether or not our ADHD causes a big problem.**
	Some patient struggle in some environments, but thrive on others. ADHD is a natural fluctuation of attention, which causes us problems in some areas, but can actually be advantageous in others.

For a time, it was theorized that people with ADHD was strictly an advantage. People with ADHD have something called [[Hyperfocus]].
- *Ex: kid playing with Legos for 6 hours straight.*
	- *Some argue that even [[Hyperfocus]] is an impairment in our [[Attention]], because we don't control it. We can't turn it on, like a switch, it's something that will happen to us; sometimes we'll lose track of time because we should be doing something else, but instead we end up [[Hyperfocus|hyperfocusing]] on something else, which doesn't help us.*

Generally speaking, we defined ADHD as an impairment of function. It's something that interferes with your life. At the end of the day, whether you have ADHD or sub-clinical ADHD (as a consequence of a society that's shortening our attention span - we're all a little bit like this since we're constantly bombarded with notifications and stuff) & you struggle focusing, all human cognitive fingerprints are different. To be successful, you need to account for your unique attentional fingerprint. Are you a hunter in a farmers world? Or a farmer in a hunters world? Are you capable of [[Hyperfocus]]? What triggers that? What gets in the way of it? Are there particular aspects of your fluctuating attention that become worse in some environments?
