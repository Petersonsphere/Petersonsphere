aliases:
  - HPA axis
---
Complex set of direct influences and feedback interactions among three components:
the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the adrenal.

3 parts of our brain & body that govern stress.
H - [[Hypothalamus]]
P - [[Pituitary]]
A - [[Adrenal Glands|Adrenal]]

The Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis is the major circuit that regulates stress by the release of [[Hormone|hormones]] such as [[Cortisol]].

Stress starts in the [[Hypothalamus]]. It secretes a chemical that travels down to the [[Pituitary|pituitary gland]]. The pituitary secretes [[Cortisol]], which travels all around the body, and also affects the [[Adrenal Glands|adrenal glands]].
