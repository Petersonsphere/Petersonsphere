Different sensory organs can be used for anchors for meditation. Generally speaking, our sense organs pay attention to things that are outside of us (pulling our attention away from the self).

The practice of [[Pratyahara]] is the practice of systematically taking our attention, removing it from the world, and pulling it internally. We can use sound to accomplish that. We can plug our ears and listen to the sounds within.

We're going to block our ears (with our fingers, or you can use earplugs) & we're going to notice awareness of internal sounds.

What we'll notice:
- Respiratory system - A sense of our breath, as it travels in our lungs or throat. What are all the sounds in the breath that you notice? The sound of your breath in the front of your nose is different than in your throat, which is different than in your lungs.
- Cardiovascular system - What can you hear about your heart? It makes a lot of different noises. There are different tones / pitches.
- [[Gastrointestinal]] system - What can you hear about your digestive system? Air? Gurgling? Movement? You may be able to hear different things.

With our ears plugged, notice what sounds come from our body. At the very beginning, those sounds will be very very loud. If we think about it, those sounds exist all the time. We're breathing all of the time. That's creating the friction of air going through your windpipe, through your trachea and into your lings. The friction of that air is constantly making a sound, but we often aren't aware of it because our attention is directed outward. As we practice, we're going to learn to recognize these sounds. As we practice and move into advanced stages of this practice, we're going to learn to tune into these sounds without plugging our ears. As we know what to look for; as we refine our attention & it moves from being diffuse to being focused like a laser, we will be able to detect sounds without plugging our ears. As we look for the sound, we're going to be training our attention to be like a laser. To pick up and notice things that we weren't able to notice before. And the only way to notice them is to be in full control of our attention. As we're in full control of our attention, a lot of things in life become easier. We won't get distracted by things; notifications; we'll be able to block out external noises; snoring.

Sit up straight, plug your ears and practice:
Do a round of 30 seconds. Break ~ 10 seconds. 
Do a round of 30 seconds. Break ~ 10 seconds.
Then, do another round for 60 seconds. Break for 30 seconds.
- *Since this round is longer, it will be harder and require more focus to bring the sounds to the surface for the full duration.*

Notice that you can't pay attention to everything. You can focus on the one that pulls you into your internal attention in the strongest way.

Repeat this for 5 - 7 minutes a day for 1 - 2 weeks.

In an advanced version of this practice, after you've practiced for a week or two, you can just close your eyes and listen to the sounds without plugging your ears.
The sound of the breath is pretty easy to pick up. As you practice, you'll be able to tune into your heartbeat. When you do that, you're engaging in [[Pratyahara]]. You're withdrawing your senses from the outside world & tuning in internally. A lot of different things will come with it. Your desires will start to weaken. For experts, melt away almost entirely.
