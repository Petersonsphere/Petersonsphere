Meditation technique in which we let the [[Mind]] lead us.

Good for curious people who might have trouble keeping their [[Mind]] in one place. They may find it easier to follow their [[Mind]] when they give it a task.

Example: Notice the temperature of the air of your breath. Where does the breath travel in your body?
