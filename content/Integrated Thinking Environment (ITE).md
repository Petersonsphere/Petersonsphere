The Code of Hammarabi (the law) is a [[representation]].

Represent thinking.
Use that to inform.
Use that to act, or shape the world.

Lots of data is being recorded.
Instead of adding [[complication]] (add meta data fields).


Most people represent meta-data through how they organize their notes (folders, tags, & link relationships).
