(Kuh-r-muh Fuh-l)

[[Krishna]] explains to [[Arjuna]] in the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]] that he doesn't need to worry about what's going to happen, because as a human being, all you're entitled to is the action itself. This is the concept of Karma Fal.

[[Karma]] is the word for "action", and Fal is the word for "fruit".

As a human being, you don't *deserve* any fruit from your action, you only *deserve* the action itself. This isn't a natural way for us to think because as a society, we're very outcome oriented (KPIs, grades, # of likes, $, status, etc.). This is problematic because it leads to [[Dukkha|suffering]] & worse performance.

[[Krishna]] explains that if you devote yourself to your actions, you'll actually have the best outcomes.

The definition of success never stops expanding when success criteria is external. The goal post will always move. 

If you devote yourself to action, that actually leads to success & peace. The successful person is the one who gets up & tries every day. This also leads to peace. The successful don't focus on targets. Even in the face of rejection.

Karma Fal helps you live in the present & detach yourself from outcomes.
