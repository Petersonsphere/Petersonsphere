(kar-muh)

Sanskrit word for the causative principle, or, action. The principle of cause & effect.

The yogis believed that all actions have effects and that all effects have causes.

Karma also represents the energy principle, or, the idea that any amount of energy can only be transformed and not destroyed. If I throw a ball up in the air, it has to fall down. If I make some kind of effort in the world, it must bear fruit.

The path of Karma (to enlightenment) involves doing good deeds & purifying yourself through selfless action & making the world a better place. Belief in God is not required. Meditation is not required.

###### How to find your [[dharma]] by exploring your Karma
Your [[dharma]] is intrinsically linked to your karma. Finding the right dharma has a lot to do with your life circumstances. Your dharma & karma are both evolving processes.

Karma presents itself to you. You can't foresee it.
Example - someone has a medical emergency on a plane. There's a doctor on the plane. That's the doctor's dharma. The situation of finding a patient on a plane was a karma (wasn't determined by the doctor).

One exercise to explore your dharma - write one page on what you think is wrong with the world.
The exercise can't be done in your head. You have to actually do it. In clinical experience, by the end of the page, many people end up writing about things they don't expect. Limiting to one page forces your [[mind]] to navigate towards one direction. You may find a particular [[dharma]] evolving. You can use this exercise as a compass.

An exercise to explore your karma - think about little things in your life that you know you should do, that you could do, that you would do. Think about tiny things, not big things. You probably aren't ready for where your karma is leading or your big dharmas, yet. You need to do the tiny dharmas of your life to get you moving in the right direction so that your karmas will present to you the larger dharmas when you're ready.

###### Standard Rubric for what your dharma is at different stages of life

The Eastern perspective on this is the [[ashrams]], but there's a western perspective on this too.

In Western psychology, [[Erik Erikson]] said life is divided into different stages & people have different psychological growth points at different stages of their life
For example, teenagers' primary "psychological goal" is to figure out what their identity (who they are). People who are 50 - 60's primary goal is to look back on their life & muse on whether they've done enough, & appreciate the impact they've had on the world. If we fail at these goals, we can suffer or get stuck.
