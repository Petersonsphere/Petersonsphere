When trying to [[studying|study]], on some days you can read a page once and everything sinks in. On other days, you can read it 10 times and little sinks in.

Assertion 1 - the more calm the active [[mind]] is, the easier it is to learn.
	Studying in a burning building isn't effective because your [[mind]] is thinking of a lot of different things. The more the [[mind]] is distracted, the more activity there is in the conscious mind, the hard it is for things to sink into the [[citta|unconscious]] .

Assertion 2 - the yogis believed that all knowledge comes from within.
	This posits that it isn't the information in the page or the # of repetitions (of reading) that's important; it's actually the calmness of my [[mind]] that determines how many times I need to read the page. If the knowledge was just on the page, then we should only have to read the page once. However, our experience of studying is that a "light bulb goes off", which is our discovery of that knowledge inside of us. Knowledge is a thing that is inside our mind, which is then recalled.
The yogis looked at things like creativity & being able to invent stuff. Does that come from the outside world or the inside world? They reached a radical conclusion which is that, even when you read external information (such as in a book), it isn't that you absorb the information, but that it triggers your pre-existing knowledge of that subject. Is the "light bulb" on the outside or the inside?

Use the hour of [[Brahmamuhurtha]] to [[studying|study]] if it works for you.

Take aways:
The more we can calm down conscious thoughts, the more knowledge actually sinks in. Learning is actually recalling knowledge from our [[citta|unconscious]] [[mind]] to our conscious mind.

## Vidya and Jnana

Understanding what makes people successful can be done through [[vidya]] & [[jnana]].

When we ask "why is that person successful & I'm not?" The answers we give are things like "I'm not motivated / disciplined", or "I'm lazy". These are umbrella terms. They're unsophisticated ways of us looking from the outside at someone and saying "that's the reason". It's like saying lightening is caused by Zeus. The Zeus of today is discipline, laziness, and motivation.

If we want to understand what makes someone successful, all we have to do is ask them & listen to them; that will give us the answer.
The [[linguistic cortex]] is what helps us choose words. When successful people are asked how they change their lives (like an alcoholic who sobers up), they'll say things like, "I woke up one day and I realized; I just knew; I discovered, ... etc." The words which they use are not words of motivation, discipline, or energy. They use words of ***knowledge***.
In [[addiction]], it isn't the people who *want* (desire) to be sober more that are able to do it. The first week or two of getting sober, the desires to relapse are way stronger than the person who isn't sober. The answer isn't in desire. The answer is in knowledge.

[[Jnana]] isn't transmissible. It's the difference between being in love & reading a romance novel. The yogis believed that [[jnana]] is closer to the [[truth]] than [[vidya]]. No amount of objective knowledge will give you the taste of a strawberry. [[Jnana]] is about understanding. There are no books or podcasts about [[jnana]]. All we can do is make books & podcasts about [[vidya]]. And this is why people who don't get better, don't get better. Subjective understanding that creates behavioral change which transforms you as a person cannot be put down into any kind of medium.

When you wake up in the morning, there's a part of you that tells you what you should do. This is what [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] called the [[super ego]]. Our [[mind]] conflicts between the the [[super ego]] & the [[id]]. If our willpower is strong, [[super ego]] wins; if willpower is weak, the [[id]] wins. [[Jnana]] removes this conflict entirely. Once you [[Jnana|understand]] something, your natural impulse is to do that thing. If you burn your hand touching a stove, you don't have to use willpower to touch the stove again. Once we learn our lessons in life, it's easy to move in the right direction. Once you gain [[jnana]], you don't need willpower.

###### Pay attention, muppet!
How do we gain [[jnana]]? The first thing that we must understand is that all [[jnana]] is founded in **experience**. We must experience these things to discover them. Once we experience something & make it subjective, it isn't about transmitting it to someone else or convincing someone else. It's all internal.

If you want to eat healthy, **pay attention**. Pay attention to how you feel when you eat particular foods. Pay attention to yourself. What does it feel like to eat the food? What does it feel like afterward? To have that food coma & be completely wiped out for the rest of the day? As you gain understanding of this, you will naturally gravitate away from eating unhealthy food.

If you waste an entire day binging on movies / video games, instead of passing out at the end of the day & not thinking about your day at all, sit there and see how you feel at the end of the day. Notice that you may feel guilty, ashamed, etc. As you gain understanding of it, that understanding will naturally remind you how you felt. Naturally, what we try to do when we stay up till 4am playing games is we're avoiding thinking about our day. We're making a mistake, and we *know* we're making a mistake, but we try very hard to avoid *understanding* the mistake we're making. In cycles of addiction, the more we *know* we're destroying our life, the more we chase those thoughts away. We strive not to be aware. We strive not to understand; by turning into the addiction more.

If you want to behave in a way that other people see as [[discipline]], it begins with understanding.

[[Meditation]] techniques like [[Ajna Chakra Sadhana]] will help you cultivate a capacity of understanding.

If you want to actually digest information and read & assimilate more, that will be more of the [[Manipura Chakra]] path.
