The [[7 Chakras]] come out of Kundalini Yoga.

The Kundalini Yogis realized that we have this vital energy that flows through our body called [[qi]], or, [[prana]], and that we have energy nexuses (Chakras) which govern different faculties. By purification of these Chakras, you can attain particular qualities - fix certain parts of your body or mental functioning, and eventually purify the Chakras to the point that you become enlightened.

There isn't actually evidence that the Chakras exist. People have been trying to find evidence for qi or prana for many years and haven't found it, yet. However, the Yogis figured out that these different dimensions (or, Chakras) involve different parts of our brain. The Yogis stumbled upon different practices that cultivate different circuits in  our brain.

For example, [[Anahata Chakra]] practices may effect our [[default mode network]].

It is a hypothesis that the various meditation practices can be mapped out onto neuroscience, but the research hasn't been done, yet.
