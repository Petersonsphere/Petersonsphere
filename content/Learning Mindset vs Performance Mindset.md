"The one of the most memorable lectures that I had during my psychiatry training was actually on the first day from the Chief of Anesthesiology at Massachusetts General Hospital gave a lecture on mindset. He started out by saying "each of you are talented; it's really hard to get to be where you are. From this point forward, you will fall into two camps - depending on your mindset, you will deal with challenges and [[failure]]s in different ways. He introduced the concept of a [[fixed mindset]] and a [[growth mindset]]."

We can be motivated towards a goal and work towards it, but what ultimately determines whether we [[Success|succeed]] will be determined by how we handle [[failure]] along the way. We can give up, or we can take [[failure]] as a learning experience. This is easier said than done.

How do we know when we should quit? How many times do we need to fail before we realize, "should I try again? Or was this not meant to be?"

Managing [[failure]] is an important part of managing [[motivation]].

We're going to lean on two major sources of expertise.
One will be the work of the psychologist [[Carol Dweck]], who talked about [[mindset]].
The other will be the [[Yoga|Yogic]] perspective, where the Yogis discovered very similar things.

Carol looked at different kinds of students & their performance. She blended together a lot of traditionally different fiends - looking at aspects of social psychology, aspects of personality psychology, aspects of developmental psychology. When she put them together, she realized that there are 2 kinds of kids - the [[fixed mindset]] / performance mindset and the [[growth mindset]] / learning mindset.

Kids with a [[fixed mindset]] are taught that their success are based on things like intelligence or talent. Kids who, if they succeeded, it was due to some kind of inborn trait - something that they carried with them no matter what. These were also kids who valued effort less. If they get good grades, it's because "they're smart" (& vice versa). These kids are more likely to give up in the face of [[failure]]. Why? Because if success & failure is due to something like intelligence (which isn't a variable quality), then that's unlikely to change across "games". They have a deterministic outlook towards the future, where destiny is predetermined based on inborn traits.

The second group of kids have a [[growth mindset]] / learning mindset. They don't care whether they succeed or fail, what they're focused on is growth. When they were raised, they weren't praised based on their intelligence; they were more likely to be praised based on effort. They viewed their success as based on things like practice & effort. When they lose a chess game, they think it's because their opponent is more experienced, not because they are less intelligent. They're more likely to try again after [[failure]].

Based on how we're raised (what success & failure is attributed to), it changes how we look at the world, perceive information, & changes our motivation - especially as it related to [[failure]].

[[Carol Dweck]] was the person who discovered this in the west, but this concept was understood thousands of years ago through the concept of a [[samskara]].

A [[samskara]] is an experience which carries some kind of emotional energy, which gets called up when we're faced with various circumstances. A kid who gets praised internalizes something, & that internalization will become their [[mindset]] through which they navigate life.
	*When you internalized something as a kid, like a failure, what were the emotions you carried with that failure? How were they processed? How did your parents support you with that failure? Did they say to you, this is because you're smart / stupid? Or, you did a good job because you worked hard? Or, even though you failed this time, you still worked hard & I'm sure you'll do better next time?*

Does your motivation tank in the face of a setback? If you fail, what happens in your [[mind]]? Do you get engaged with it? - "oh, this is something I need to learn, let's try again." Or, does failure lead to avoidance? Mindset is formed as a [[samskara]]. [[samskara|Samskara]]s are not permanent. They can be digested & new ones can be laid down. Our [[personality]] can change over time. Whether you find yourself in the [[growth mindset]] or [[fixed mindset]] "camp", you can reframe into the other.

This happens through intentional cognitive reframes.
First, we need to **notice** our instinctive **reaction** to something like failure. Where does your mind go? What does your [[mind]] think?
The second thing we need to **notice** is what **effect** your instinctive reaction thoughts have **on** your **motivation**. What does your reaction do to your mind's ability to try again? Do you view it as a setback or a [[failure]]? Even those terms are borne of these two different mindsets.

Once we notice these things, we can catch it & re-frame. When you catch your thoughts, imagine that you were intercepting the thoughts of one of your friends. What would you tell them?

As you become aware of your thoughts, you will notice a natural change in motivation.
	*As we combat the perception that failure is deterministic, we will naturally increase our motivation.*
