(Muh-nas)

The emotional part of the mind. The yogis figured out that the way in which we experience emotions is discrete from other parts of our mind.

This is where we experience emotions. They are automatic / reflexive. They happen fast.
It's where our likes & dislikes come from
	*For example, trying some food for the first time. It isn't an intellectual calculation. There's a part of our mind that's reflexive. It will automatically say, "oh, I like peanut butter," or vice versa.*
