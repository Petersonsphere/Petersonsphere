(Muh-nas)

The **emotional** part of the mind.

The yogis figured out that the way in which we experience emotions is discrete from other parts of our mind.

This is where we experience **emotions**. They are **automatic** / **reflexive**. They happen fast.
It's where our **likes & dislikes** come from (it generates preferences). It's very judgmental.
	*For example, trying some food for the first time. It isn't an intellectual calculation. There's a [[Parts of the mind|part of our mind]] that's reflexive. It will automatically say, "oh, I like peanut butter," or vice versa.*
