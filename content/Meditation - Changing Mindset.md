What does the process of cognitive restructuring look like? How do we shift from a [[fixed mindset]] to a [[growth mindset]]?

This isn't really a formal meditation practice. It's a technique. It's also a bit of a shotgun approach. The sentences that cause our cognition to be restructured are personalized.
	*It depends what you need to shift. Do you need to shift the idea that you have to be perfect every single time? Or, do you need to let go of comparison in some contexts?*

The best we can do is offer lots of example. Pay attention & see what resonates with you. Try to find the right words for you to shift your cognition.

First, let's understand how mindset shifts happen. Think of our neurons like neurons. Neurons that fire together, wire together, so our neuronal patterns develop into [[Habit|habits]].
