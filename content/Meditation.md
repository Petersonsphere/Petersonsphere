## Meditation Overview

There are different traditions of meditation. [[Mindfulness]], which is growing in popularity today, is a just tiny fraction of meditation. Different [[Meditation Styles]] & practices have different benefits & are suited for different kinds of people.
	For example, some people have difficulty focusing their mind to focus on one thing. Those people can be given an [[Inquisitive Meditation Technique|inquisitive meditation technique]]

There isn't one word in Sanskrit that means 'meditation'. There are 3 Sanskrit words that get translated as meditation.
1) [[Dharana]] (verb). Focusing technique.
2) [[Dhyana]] - Entering into the no-mind state.
3) [[Samadhi]] - transformation; enlightenment.

## What is Meditation?

Actually, the more that your mind wonders, the better you are going to get at meditation. Every time your mind wonders and you bring it back, it's like doing a push up for your mind. You're training your mind to come back to one spot. It's the most important skill of meditation ([[dharana]]).

The goal of meditation is to attain states of [[moksha]]. Sometimes, to attain [[moksha]], we will enter into states of [[samadhi]], which is a sub-state of [[dhyana]].

See [[The Meditation Process]].

The [[samadhi]] state grows out of [[dhyana]] like dreams grow out of the sleep state.

When you get good at [[dharana]], you get better at focusing & [[studying]]. Studies show that the [[health benefits of meditation]] take ~ 8 - 10 weeks to kick in, which is also when you start to enter [[dhyana]] more regularly. Perhaps because your neurons are rewiring (this is a hypothesis).

Sometimes, after meditating for a long time, sometimes years, people will become different people. Examples of cosmic changes: being happier, being less attached, enjoying life more, being more focused (cosmically). These come out of the state of [[samadhi]].

Successful entry into [[dhyana]] involves finding the right [[dharana]].

###### Where Meditation Began
[[Meditation]] began ~6,000 years ago in India with a group of people called the [[tantra|Tantrics]].
