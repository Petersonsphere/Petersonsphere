## Meditation Overview
Meditation began ~6,000 years ago in India with a group of people called the [[tantra|Tantrics]].

There are different traditions of meditation. [[Mindfulness]], which is growing in popularity today, is a just tiny fraction of meditation. Different [[Meditation Styles]] & practices have different benefits & are suited for different kinds of people.
- For example, some people have difficulty focusing their [[Mind]] to focus on one thing. Those people can be given an [[Inquisitive Meditation Technique|inquisitive meditation technique]]

There isn't one word in Sanskrit that means 'meditation'. There are 3 Sanskrit words that get translated as meditation.
1) [[Dharana]] (verb). Focusing technique.
2) [[Dhyana]] - Entering into the no-mind state.
3) [[Samadhi]] - transformation; enlightenment.

## What is Meditation?

Actually, the more that your [[Mind]] wonders, the better you are going to get at meditation. Every time your [[Mind]] wonders and you bring it back, it's like doing a push up for your mind. You're training your [[Mind]] to come back to one spot. It's the most important skill of meditation ([[Dharana]]).

The goal of meditation is to attain states of [[Enlightenment|moksha]]. Sometimes, to attain [[Enlightenment|moksha]], we will enter into states of [[Samadhi]], which is a sub-state of [[Dhyana]].

See [[The Meditation Process]].

The [[Samadhi]] state grows out of [[Dhyana]] like dreams grow out of the sleep state.

When you get good at [[Dharana]], you get better at focusing & [[Studying]]. Studies show that the [[Health benefits of meditation]] take ~ 8 - 10 weeks to kick in, which is also when you start to enter [[Dhyana]] more regularly. Perhaps because your neurons are rewiring (this is a hypothesis).

Sometimes, after meditating for a long time, sometimes years, people will become different people. Examples of cosmic changes: being happier, being less attached, enjoying life more, being more focused (cosmically). These come out of the state of [[Samadhi]].

Successful entry into [[Dhyana]] involves finding the right [[Dharana]].
