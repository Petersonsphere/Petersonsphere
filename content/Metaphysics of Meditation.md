###### [[Brahman]]

The yogis discovered / believe in [[Brahman]].

Brahman oscillates at different frequencies & creates different manifestations.
For example, when Brahman concentrates & coalesces, it becomes energy. When energy concentrates & coalesces, it becomes matter.
In a small amount of energy, there's an exponential amount of consciousness.
In a small amount of matter, there's an exponential amount of energy.
When consciousness oscillates at different frequencies, it creates different manifestations.

###### [[Bindu Visarga]]

The yogis believe that all of this energy / consciousness is situated at the top of your head called [[Bindu Visarga]]. They believed that the universe was created out of [[Bindu Visarga]], which is an infinitely dense piece of matter and consciousness that then explodes and creates the universe. The universe, after exploding from [[Bindu Visarga]], expands until it reaches a terminal point, and it then eventually collapses back into [[Bindu Visarga]].

###### [[Karma]]

The yogis also discovered the principle of [[Karma]]. The yogis also applied Karma outside of the physical realm. To things like, the place & time of your birth have causal effects. Everything that happens in this life is an effect from a past cause. And furthermore, the seeds you sew (the actions you take) in this life not only bear fruit in this life, but effect things outside of this life.

The theory of Karma suggested lots of stuff in science / physics (genetics, electricity, down syndrome, etc). They basically believe that [[Newton’s Third Law]] is a universal principle. All causes yield effects & must have antecedent causes.

The Big Bang sounds like [[Bindu Visarga]].
[[String theory]] sounds like the [[Mantra|system of mantra]].

You can find the idea of [[Schrödinger's cat]] in yogic thinking. The sea of [[Brahman]] doesn't have any form that can be described. When we observe something, Brahman coalesces into a particular manifestation. The universe exists as a potential. Through observation & action, it collapses into a reality.

Physics is about science, reducing things to mathematical equations / laws, and experiments. You'll have to use your judgment to determine whether the yogic worldview & the tradition of science / physics are talking about the same thing(s).

The yogic perspective is not about convincing people through science, it's about understanding through experience (like experiencing [[Samadhi]]). Sometimes when people meditate, they have memories that are not from this life. You have memories of this life, but you were a different person in the past.

A utilitarian / pragmatic stance on this stuff is concerned with whether thinking this way is useful or not useful; not whether it's "real" or "not real".
