An open awareness meditation technique where we watch our thoughts pass, like a river.

###### How did the explosion in [[Mindfulness|mindfulness]] today happen?
Through research. In the 60's & 70's, there was a large interest in the West on [[meditation]]. All these gurus started travelling to the West & teaching [[meditation]] & a lot of people liked it. Then, a group of researchers who were fascinated by learning it in their personal lives wanted to understand the science behind it. But, they faced a problem, which is that not all [[meditation]] is the same. [[Om Chanting]] is very different than noticing the flow of your thoughts like a river. How can we study this scientifically when there's a lot of variability?

They took the core components of all of the specificity from the various meditative traditions to try to find the most basic re-occurring components. They called this [[mindfulness]] & studied that. This is how research is done. The problem is that we lose a lot of the specificity in the process. It's like trying to understand the health benefits of pasta vs potatoes vs bread, in medicine, we do studies on carbohydrates. This is efficient because it's the common element between the potato, pasta, & bread, but the downside is that some things are lost when we're only thinking about carbs.

The other thing that happened along with the explosion of [[mindfulness]] was an anti-religious movement. A lot of these meditative traditions are grounded in spirituality, but scientists didn't really know how to approach that. The old texts on meditation (& [[Buddha]]'s teachings) were always saying that the goal of [[meditation]] is [[enlightenment]]. As science & secularism has grown, we've stopped talking about [[enlightenment]] & have lost a lot of the spiritual roots of [[meditation]]. You don't have to be spiritual or religious to want to meditate, but in the scientific process, there has been a sterilization of a lot of the roots & benefits of [[meditation]].
