Intentional thought.

Motivation is the ability to hold one idea in your [[mind]] for an extended period of time.

Motivation relies on our sense of [[ego|identity]].

The people who we see as "disciplined", or "motivated" are the people who are able to hold specific thoughts in their head for an extended period of time. The difference between a disciplined person, and a person who is perceived as "lazy" is the amount of time they spend thinking about the behaviors that they want to be engaged in.
