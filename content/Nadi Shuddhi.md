Meditation technique of alternate nostril breathing.

Stimulating. This practice cleanses the [[Nadis]]

Place your index and middle finger on your forehead & keep them there the whole time.
Use your thumb to block the left nostril. Inhale through the right nostril; while holding the breath, block the right nostril with the pinky finger & exhale out the left nostril. Then just reverse this:
Inhale through the left; hold; block the left with your thumb & exhale out the right.
Repeat infinitely.

(todo - lookup recommend time & meditation effects)

*Just remember to always switch nostrils before exhaling.*

Fun fact: the nerves from the left nostril activate the [[Parasympathetic Nervous System|PNS]], and the nerves from the right nostril activate the [[Sympathetic Nervous System|SNS]].
