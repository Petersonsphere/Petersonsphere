###### [[Sakshi Bhava]]
The yogis noticed that we have a capacity to observe our own mind. There's a part of self (the truest self) that's outside of the mind. There are mental functions like thoughts & emotions; then there's an observer outside of that. In [[mindfulness]], we call this consciousness [[Sakshi Bhava]]. It is not a part of the [[Mind]] because it is able to look at the other [[Parts of the mind]].

The observer & the observed are two fundamentally different things. When you look in the mirror, you see a [[Representation|reflection]] of yourself, not yourself. A photo of you is an [[image]] of you.

These observations led to what we will call [[Consciousness]].

We have various states of [[Mind]] and those states of [[Mind]] have varying degrees of [[Consciousness]].

There are various states of mind.
Some states of [[Mind]] have different degrees of consciousness or mental activity.

    Normal Waking Activity: [0.1, 0.9]

Normal Waking Activity:  + Mental Activity, + Consciousness
Sleep:  - Mental Activity, - Consciousness
Dreaming:  + Mental Activity, - Consciousness
DayDreaming:  + Mental Activity, - Consciousness
	*When we "get lost" in a day dream, we have mental activity without awareness.
	When we "snap out" of a daydream, we move from a state of mental activity without awareness to a state of mental activity with awareness.
Meditation ([[Dhyana]]):  - Mental Activity, + Consciousness
	*Example: Watching the dawn / dusk. Putting your feet in the ocean. Conscious, but low mental activity.*

The following are examples of states of [[Mind]] on a *spectrum* between *mental activity (mind)* and consciousness.
The left states are higher states of [[Mind]] (and lower states of consciousness, and the right states are higher states of conscious (and lower states of mind).
[[Psychosis]] > [[Panic Attack]] > [[Heart Break]] > [[Vairagya]] ("Take a step back; realizing the relation was bad, etc. Realizing we are not our thoughts / reality is not our thoughts, etc.") > [[Flow State]] > [[Dhyana]]

[[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]] noticed [[Thought fusion]]. One of the goals of [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|CBT]] is to train people to move from states of [[Thought fusion]] to states of [[Thought diffusion]]. This is also one of the goals of [[meditation]].

The realization that the [[Mind]] is not our true self is important, not only for optimizing our performance, but is clinically useful for any mental illness. Studies have been done on everything from [[Depression]] to [[Anxiety]] to [[Schizophrenia]] to even [[Trauma]], demonstrating that [[Meditation|meditation]] is an effective treatment for all of them.
