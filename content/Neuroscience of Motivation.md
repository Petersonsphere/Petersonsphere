We confuse [[motivation]] with [[Discipline]] and control and willpower. When we think of discipline, control, and willpower, we think of forcing ourselves to do something. But, motivation is an intrinsic desire to do something. You don't have to force yourself to do anything.

Different parts of the brain are responsible for creating that intrinsic motivation.

###### Aspects of motivation & where they map to the brain
Our [[Hedonic Circuit|Hedonic Circuitry]] is in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] & is governed by [[Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid|GABA]] & [[Opiod]] neurotransmitters.

Our [[Reward Circuitry]] is governed by [[Dopamine]] & is found in the [[Nucleus accumbens]]. The primary circuit is the [[Reward Circuitry|mesolimbic circuit]].

When we think 'motivation', we think, "should I do this? Is my brain telling me this is a good idea or not?" This is [[Effort computation]].
[[Effort computation]] is in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex]]. There isn't a discrete [[Neurotransmitter]] that's involved there.

The [[Emotional circuit]]s of the brain don't have discrete [[Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] either, but include the [[Limbic system]] (emotional circuitry in the brain), & also involve the [[Amygdala]]; these things connect to and influence all of the other parts of the brain. Emotions are very powerful drivers of behavior.


As we start to better understand these different parts of the brain, we'll start to better understand [[motivation]] and we'll gain better control of it.
