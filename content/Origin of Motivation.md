Many people say, "I know what I need to do, but I can't bring myself to do it. I'm lazy / undisciplined. How can I find motivation? Become disciplined? Stop being lazy?"

The reason this problem is so common is that we aren't taught what motivation is, or where it comes from. A lot of people think about motivation as desire. A lot of people look at someone who is "highly motivated" vs another person who isn't, most people conclude that the motivated person "wants it more". They will use the language of desire. But, **motivation and desire are completely different things**.

Lots of people want all sorts of stuff. I might want a yacht. But I'm not motivated to go out and work towards one. This is seen most often among people who are lonely. If you ask them, "how much do you want companionship?" They will say "10 out of 10. I want anything in life but to be lonely". And yet, they're still not motivated to go out and find it. There's something in their desire that actually gets in the way of following through & acting in accordance with what they want. Their motivation is missing, but their desire is intact.

We have two different words for motivation and habit. Motivation is when you have a thought in your head that overcomes habit. If I have a habit of sleeping in every day & eating pizza for breakfast, motivation is what allows me to overcome my habit. 

[[Habit]] is automatic thought. [[Motivation]] is intentional thought.

In these old texts on [[yoga]], you won't even find a word for motivation. It's bizarre, but what the yogis discovered is that what we call **motivation is simply the ability to hold one thought persistently in the mind**. When you can keep your [[Mind]] concentrated on one thing over a period of time, it will result in what other people see as motivation.

Example: New Years resolutioner has high motivation in early January to work out. 10 out of 10 in January. Maybe a 7 out of 10 early February, then it's like a 3 out of 10 if it isn't already a 0 by mid March. Why?
- Because there's fluctuation in what their [[Mind]] is focused on.
	- On January 1st, they're laser focused on the working out. Over time, different kinds of thoughts literally trickle into their mind. On January 15 they start to think about other things ("it's cold outside"). In February they stop thinking about working out as much. They might start thinking about watching T.V. Or whatever else. What we see on the outside is them less "motivated", but what's happening on the inside is that their [[Mind]] is not concentrated on that one thing. There isn't one thought anymore that dominates their mind. The more you think about something, the more that you will begin to act in that way.

The yogis discovered that what we call motivation, they called a concentrated mind, or a **one-pointed mind**. They developed practices  ([[Dharana]]). The training of your [[Mind]] to focus on one point. When we learn how to do [[Dharana]], we can tell our mind, "Mind, do this." and our [[Mind]] is trained to actually obey. If we want to exercise & lose weight, we simply keep our [[Mind]] on that one point. By default, our [[Mind]] doesn't actually know how to focus. When you pay attention to how your [[Mind]] works, at one moment you are thinking about one thing, then the next moment, you're thinking about another thing. It's like a light bulb with light diffusing light in 1,000 different directions (vs a flashlight, vs a laser).

(Clinical Example)
Gamers might think of themselves as unmotivated. They're actually very highly motivated. Motivated to play games. When you ask a gamer, "when you try to study, what does your [[Mind]] do?", they always say "I think about playing the game I like." There's a tight connection between what the [[Mind]] is focused on and what you end up doing. The more the [[Mind]] is one-pointed towards the game, the more motivated they are to play it. Gamers don't lack motivation, it's just pointed in the completely wrong direction.

**Actions are cultivated out of our thoughts.**
Motivation is all about the concentration of the mind. A one-pointed [[Mind]] results in consistent action & follow-through.

[[Dharana]] allows us to cultivate our thoughts in a specific direction. The people who are the most successful in the world are the people who are able to hold one thought in their [[Mind]] in one place and keep it there. As they hold the thought in their mind, their actions follow through & move in the same direction of their concentrated thought. A strong [[Mind]] has all of its attention on one spot. A weak [[Mind]] is one whose energy is dissipated in 1,000 directions, and so no task is ever completed.

If you want to find motivation, don't worry about the external stuff - how to find a job, or how to go to the gym. Start with what's happening in your mind. Train it to sit in one spot. Teach it to follow you. And then you'll be motivated.
