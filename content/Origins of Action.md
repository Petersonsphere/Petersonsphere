Actions come from 3 places

1) Instinct / reflex - don't require training or practice. We have natural abilities which are *reflexive*.
	*If you put a newborn dog in water, it will know how to swim. Infants naturally know how to drink milk & swallow. Squeeze the palm of your hand. Your fist's grasping reflex activates.*

2) Training - when we train an action over and over, it becomes what we call a [[habit]].

3) Thoughts - 
	The last time you ate food, how did you decide to eat whatever you ate? Where did that action originate from? Chances are, it originated from your thoughts.
		There's an old saying: *Watch your thoughts, they become your words. Watch your words, they become your actions. Watch your actions, they become your habits. Watch your habits, they become your character. Watch your character, it becomes your destiny.*
		The [[Yogis|Yogi]]s really [[Jnana|understood]] that **the origin of all action is thought**.
		Our society isn't really structured this way. Our society is focused on outcomes, productivity, metrics (grades, as opposed to [[Jnana|understanding]], for example) instead of the *origins* of action.
		Today, we see people struggling to *[[Motivation|motivate]]* themselves, or *accomplish more* (focus is on the end result) instead of focusing on the birth of the action.
		We gain [[vidya|knowledge]], but we don't train the [[mind]] itself - how to do the equivalent of pushups & sit-ups for the [[mind]]. Training the mind starts with the skill of concentration, or, [[dharana]].
