###### A hierarchical theory of [[Personality]]. Our [[Personality|personhood]] is composed of different elements.

Pancha means "five". Kosha means "sheath" (as in, a sword sheath).

The yogis discovered that people are made up of 5 layers, or, sheaths:
1) [[Annamaya Kosha]]
2) [[Pranamaya Kosha]]
- *It's common for people to go to doctors & say there's something wrong with them, but doctors find nothing wrong with their physical body (x-rays, lung function, hormones, blood sugar, etc.). The problems could be in the energetic body.*
3) [[Manomaya Kosha]]
- *This is where we get into the mind. The yogis discovered that, when we look at our mind, there are different qualities of stuff. An emotion is a different thing than a thought.*
4) [[Vijnanamaya Kosha]]
5) [[Anandamaya Kosha]]

###### On accomplishment
The yogis have given us panchakosha theory as a practical guide for understanding what we're made; this helps us clean out the various bodies we are composed of & optimize their function.

We all want to accomplish things (get a job, find love, move somewhere, etc).

Oftentimes, advice to accomplish things has to do with the outside world. We look for external solutions to external problems.
- *Example: "Read this dating advice guide; join a club & find more hobbies; join this dating app, etc.*

A coach who is able to successfully work with people across a plethora of professions is able to do this because what the coach works on is 'the self'. No matter what you want to accomplish in life, the most basic tool you have to accomplish it is you.
- *Ex: Programmers & surgeons use different tools, but the most important tool they use is the self.*

You need a body & [[Mind]] that is free from distraction. That is energetic. A [[Mind]] that can focus. A body that is healthy, pure, functions well, & supports you. You need a [[Mind]] that is able to be empathic; which can listen, focus, & attend to other people.

###### How to Optimize your 5 Layers
The Yogis discovered different practices to optimize each layer.

Practices to optimize / support:
- (physical) [[Annamaya Kosha]]
	- Do [[Surya namaskar]]
	- Get [[Sun exposure]]
	- [[Diet]] & [[Exercise]]
- (energetic) [[Pranamaya Kosha]]
	- [[Pranayama]]
	- Do [[Yoga]] or [[Tai Chi]]
	- *Tons of studies have been done on yoga versus exercise. Yoga outperforms exercise when it comes to curing clinical illnesses. This is kind of weird, because it's essentially mostly just stretching. But if you take two groups of people and teach one of them stretching and the other yoga, the yoga group will do way better in terms of health improvement than the stretching or exercise group. Why is that? Scientifically, we don't really know, because scientifically, we don't have evidence that the energetic layer exists. What we do know however, is that [[Yoga]] is designed to support your energetic layer And we do know scientifically that when we do practices that support our [[pranamaya kosha]], we actually get healthier than when we do purely physical practices.*
	- (emotional) [[Manomaya Kosha]]
		- [[Psychotherapy]] to clean out the emotional [[Mind]] (see [[Knowledge and Mind]])
		- "Emotional Nutrition" - At the end of the day, think about what kind of emotional nutrition you get throughout the day. Who do you hang out with? Etc. Create influences that are emotionally supportive & positive.
		- Spend time in nature
		- Journaling, self-reflective practices, some forms of [[Meditation]].
		- *Example: our [[Ego]] is filled up with junk. Meditation practice on the self / true identity help us realize who our true self is & we dissolve our pride / envy / [[Ego|ahamkara]] / comparisons, etc.*
	- (intellectual) [[Vijnanamaya Kosha]]
		- Control the [[Indriya]]s through [[Pratyahara]] practice.
		- You can do things like [[reading]] or philosophical stuff. Give yourself intellectual stimulation. Expose yourself to new ideas & concepts.
		- *When we look at things like [[Dementia]], the [[Mind]] doesn't wear out from use; the [[Mind]] rusts. If you don't use it, you lose it. People who are mentally active & continuously expose themselves to new things are protected against [[Dementia]].*
	- (soul/spiritual) [[Anandamaya Kosha]]
		- [[Lacking purpose]] / [[Lacking purpose|lacking meaning]] can be a spiritual deficiency if there's nothing materially wrong & you have spiritual hunger / emptiness / incompleteness. [[Meditation]] can help you understand your connection with the divine as you discover the true nature of yourself & find your [[Dharma|dharma]].

###### [[Shuddhi]], or [[Shuddhi|Shuddha]]
Each of these layers is unclean in some way. When we think about a [[heart attack]], it's because the three [[Coronary arteries]] get blocked & our heart can't get the nutrients that it needs. In life, problems with function start with blockages and uncleanliness.

We can do [[shuddhi]] practices for each of these layers (the stuff discussed above are some of these [[shuddhi]] practices).

No matter what your goal is in life, you have to be pure to accomplish it. Your performance towards a goal depends on your function as a human being.
