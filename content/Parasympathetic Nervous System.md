"Rest & digest" mode of the body.

Governed by things like our [[Vagas Nerve]].

When it's activated, heart rate slows; blood pressure decreases; and, blood goes away from the arms, legs, and particular parts of our brain (danger / survival centers) to internal organs.

It can become very active when you eat a lot of food and go into a "food coma".
