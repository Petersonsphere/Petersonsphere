A condition that affects the way your brain processes information. It causes you to lose touch with reality. You might see, hear, or believe things that aren't real. Psychosis is a symptom, not an illness. A mental or physical illness, substance abuse, or extreme stress or trauma can cause it.

In clinical psychiatry, psychosis is a state where people really believe their thoughts.
- *For example, someone who experiences paranoia that the FBI / CIA is tracking them*
In this moment, their thoughts actually become their reality. They lose perspective on what's real & what's false. Their thoughts dominate them.
