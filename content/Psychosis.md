In clinical psychiatry, psychosis is a state where people really believe their thoughts.
	*For example, someone who experiences paranoia that the FBI / CIA is tracking them*
In this moment, their thoughts actually become their reality. They lose perspective on what's real & what's false. Their thoughts dominate them.
