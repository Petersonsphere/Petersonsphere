Tl;dr:
Step away from outcomes & focus on what you need to do today. Change your goals to be very very small actions you can (and will) take.

Our society is very goal oriented.
	If you graduate from high school & that's what's on your resume, you're worth a certain amount of money; from college, a different amount of money; from medical school, a different amount of money.

###### Your Brain Will Sabotage Big Goals
When you set a New Years resolutions to get in shape, your brain actually starts to work against you. The brain is incredibly efficient at [[behavioral reinforcement]].

When we set big goals, the mind has a vision to get in shape (sexy beast). After a few days of spending effort on the gym & coming home & looking in the mirror, you don't see much change; the reinforcement that your brain sees when it thinks about the sexy beast image is that "we're putting in all of this effort & not seeing much change". So, it starts to sabotage your motivation ("this behavior is not achieving the reward, so you don't need to continue").

We don't move towards large, abstract, long-term goals. This is how we get stuck in life. We can do things that involve instant gratification. This is because the brain sees the behavior, and sees the reward right away.

*Example*
	*An addiction patient comes in with high initial motivation to achieve a big sobriety goals ("I wanna be sober for one year. That's my goal"). The problem is that sobriety isn't something you can do. Sobriety can happen. It isn't something a motivated person can come in and do that day. I'm gonna do sobriety today and then have accomplished my goal for the year.*
	*The people who are successful at sobriety forget about being sober for a year. What they try to do is be sober today. Just in this hour. Or in this minute. They can tunnel down even further. They have a very present focused approach.*

From a yogic standpoint, how can we let go of the future & focus on the present?

Imagine that you're paralyzed from the waist down. You have a lackey who will do anything that you instruct them to do, but they aren't very smart. Now, imagine what your goal is. Now, what would you have to tell this lackey in order to accomplish that goal?
You can't just tell them, "Hey, find a job." They aren't smart enough to do that. Or even to "update your resume". You have to instruct them in every action that's is a step to finding a job.
	"Okay, sit down at the desk. Turn on the computer. Open up your resume. This is where the resume folder is. Double click it. Let's take a look. Now we gotta read it. Okay, on the first line, let's change our address, that one's old. Now let's take a look at education. On this specific line right there, we need to change this one thing."
Then you can move onto the next step. This exercise gets very very specific.

**The more that your goals are not actions that you can perform, the more stuck you will be in life.**

The more you can break things down into their tiny constituent components (one after the other), you will also be recruiting that instant gratification circuitry. At the end of the day (or the hour), it is possible that the brain can look at an updated resume.
