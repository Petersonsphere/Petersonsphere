Thought is representation.

The map isn't the territory.

The word "rock" isn't actually a rock. A reflection of yourself in the mirror is not yourself. A photo is only an [[image]] of you.

Nothing's ever the same, maaaaannn.

Questions:
Are representations [[nominal]]?
Are representations pragmatic? (importance of having a [[telos]])
