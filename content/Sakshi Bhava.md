(Saak-she Bh-uh-vuh)

Is translated as "witnessing attitude". This sort of gets translates into [[mindfulness]].

We have this capacity within ourselves to look at ourselves. 

This consciousness (the witnessing attitude) that can look at the mind is not a part of the mind because it is able to look at the other parts of mind.
