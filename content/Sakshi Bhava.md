(Saak-she Bh-uh-vuh)

The capacity to observe other parts of our self. Literally translated as the "witnessing attitude". This sort of gets translates into [[mindfulness]].

We have this capacity within ourselves to look at ourselves. 

This [[Consciousness]] (the witnessing attitude) that can look at the [[Mind]] is not a [[Parts of the mind|part of the mind]] because it is able to look at the other [[Parts of the mind]].
