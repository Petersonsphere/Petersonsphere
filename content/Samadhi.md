(Suh-mah-dhi)

Translated as 'a temporary state of enlightenment'.

A sub-state of [[Dhyana]]. A state when the [[Mind]] is completely gone & you're operating completely at the level of [[Consciousness]].

With prolonged periods of Samadhi, people get transformed & the way they view the world changes.
