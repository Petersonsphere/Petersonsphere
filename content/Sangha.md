(Sun-ghuh)

Sanskrit for "community", or orbit, consisting of the people who you spend the most time with.

If we want to build the right kind of life, we need to take the right actions. To take the right actions, we need to have the right kinds of thoughts. Building the right kind of community will shape your thinking, actions, and life in the right way.

###### The relationship between thought & action.
You can't take an action without thinking about it first.
	You can't eat chocolate without thinking about it, first. A person who doesn't know chocolate exists will never eat it.
The right kinds of thoughts lead to the right kinds of actions.

Thoughts come from 2 places - the outside ([[indriya]]s), or the inside. When we have experiences from our [[indriya]]s, those form memory impressions in our unconscious. See [[System of Mind]] for more.

If you want to become successful in someway, you have to focus & cultivate your thoughts in specific ways which lead to specific action in the outside world.

Cultivating the right sangha leads to right thoughts, which leads to right action.

First, let's look at what effect community has on you.
Look at the effect of your actions when you interact with different people.
	Sometimes, parents might tell a child frequently that he/she has so much potential to encourage the kid. But what effect does this have on the kid? Does the kid go out & start to live to their fullest potential? No. In fact, usually that kind of interaction has the opposite effect & the kid actually feels stupid & ashamed. The kid hears "What's wrong with you? You have so much potential, it's so easy. You could do it if you just tried, stupid."
	
You have to be careful about the friends & people you surround yourself with.

Oftentimes you'll see groups of people that keep themselves in mediocrity. This is common in gaming communities. Groups of people get high every day & play tons of games every day. That's what all your friends are doing, so you'll do it to. Everyone in the group likes each other & they get along well & have lots of fun, but will these groups of people cause you to grow in the right direction? These are groups of people that enjoy being stuck together. Even though they're your friends, they hold you back.

Sometimes the right sangha is the one that makes you feel bad. If you encounter someone who is doing something that you know you're capable of, & you aren't doing that, it causes you to retreat from that. You might feel ashamed. The community you need to be a part of might be the one you're pulling away from.

If you spend time with the right kind of people, you'll cultivate the right kind of thoughts, and the right kind of action.

You have to be very careful & pay attention to each group of people in your life, & ask yourself, "when I hang out with this person, what do I actually do?" A lot of times, you'll have relationships where you & your friends always philosophize & think deep thoughts, but then the next day you get up & do nothing with your life. That may not be the right sangha, even though it feels good. And the right kind of sangha may actually feel bad. Maybe you hang out with a group of people who take care of themselves physically, and you don't; you might feel embarrassed hanging out with them, but those are the people you need to be hanging out with if getting in better shape is one of your goals.

The yogis discovered that a good [[Meditation|meditative practice]] absolutely requires a very solid sangha. You can't meditate all on your own. You can meditate for a few days, but your [[mind]] is going to get bored & will wonder. If you aren't in a good community of meditators, you're going to get lots of [[indriya]] exposure that has nothing to do with meditation. It's very hard to meditate on your own.

Qualities for the right kind of sangha:
First, a good meditation sangha **prompts you to practice**.
	This is very important, because you may not feel like meditating. Attending a sangha that meets once a week is good because even if you fall out of your practice, you're on an automatic track to meditate for at least that day.
Second, they teach you the intellectual stuff, or they'll have discussions about meditation.
	If you engage your curiosity through discussions on meditation, you're going to be populating your [[mind]] with thoughts of meditation. Ergo, you'll be more likely to meditate.
Third, a good meditation sangha tailors its practice to you.
	If you're having difficulty in meditation, or don't know what kind of technique to do next, the perfect sangha is a place where you can explore that. Where people can help guide you on your personal journey through that.
