(Sat-yuh)

The observation of truthfulness, a [[Yama]] in [[Raja Yoga]].

[[Niyama]]s are an important part of [[Raja Yoga]], spirituality, and personal growth.

We know that people who meditate regularly are a little bit better at life. Their less prone to [[depression]], [[anxiety]], [[addiction]]s, are more able to [[focus]], & have improvements in [[memory]].

When we look at spirituality, there are lots of phrases that people say, like "learn how to live in the present," "learn how to detach," "learn how to let go." When we talk about these vague concepts, people always tell you to "**learn to** ..."; they won't tell you "**how to** ... live in the present, etc".

The yogis discovered that when you adopt these practices ([[Yama]]s / [[Niyama]]s) like Satya, they actually facilitate a lot of the spiritual goals people talk about, and they result in concrete improvements in life.

Here's a Satya practice: Go for as long as you can without telling a lie.

Practically, what goes into not lying? And, if you stop lying, how does it start to shape your life? Why do we even lie in the first place?

Satya will do 3 things:
1) Increase our awareness of the present moment
2) Once we commit to Satya, our actions will begin to change
3) We'll learn to actually let go when we become truthful human beings

If I tell you, "go for as long as you can without telling a lie," think about how that changes your mind. Suddenly, you're paying a lot of attention to what you say. Life stops happening on autopilot, & your awareness comes down to the present. Every time you tell a lie, you're either going to do it intentionally, but most of the time, chances are you don't know you're doing it. You really have to pay attention to everything that comes out of your mouth. At the beginning, it can be quite cognitively intensive & exhausting. The reason it's exhausting is because, in those moments, your brain is rewiring. You're teaching your brain a new skill. That new skill is to be aware in the present moment. To be aware of your thoughts & words.

This practice is helpful in treating people with [[addiction]]s. What they say when they relapse is they didn't even know how it happened. They had been sober for 300 days, then suddenly on the 301st day, "I don't know what happened." A week bender goes by, & they feel like all of their sobriety goes out of the window.

In the neuroscience of meditation, one of the mechanisms through which meditation improves sobriety is by increasing awareness of the present moment & internal signals. A lot of times these internal signals, like sadness, or unhappiness, or feeling ashamed about yourself, or a particular desire will actually drive people to use a substance to calm those things down. There's good evidence that, as you increase awareness of the present moment, it gives you control of your addictive impulses.

So, the first way Satya helps is by forcing you to pay attention to what's going on in your [[mind]] & to what you say.

The second way Satya is helpful is that it shapes your actions.

If you're not allowed to lie, and you really commit to it, and you stick to it, what would change in the way you live your life? We allow ourselves to do many of the things we do that aren't great for ourselves or others *because* we're going to lie about them. If you actually commit to not lying, you'll start to see subtle behavioral shifts. You'll catch yourself - "well, if I do this, I'm going to have to lie about it". When you practice Satya over time, your life will start to change and it will get shaped in such a way that you don't have to lie about it.

The third way Satya helps people is that it helps them **detach**. If I commit to not lying & start to share things with other people that I would have lied about, then the consequences are going to happen. I'll open myself up to the consequences that I used to lie about. If we think about why we lie in the first place, it's all about control. If you think about the moments you lie, what are you getting out of that? If you tell the truth, another human being is going to respond to you in a certain way. So, you try to control that other person through a lie. Because if you tell them something else, they'll respond -this- way. The more you lie, the more you're gonna try to control other people.

How do we cultivate some of these concepts like, "letting go," or, "surrendering"? How do we cultivate those? It's as simple as not lying. When we let go of not lying, we face the consequences of our actions. We no longer try to control other humans & we absolve ourselves of the consequences of our actions. This is what we mean by "surrender". Letting go means that you're going to do what you're going to do, and the rest of the world will respond in whatever way it does. Surrender / letting go gives you freedom. Letting go means, "I'm going to study for 6 hours a day" and, if I fail the test, so be it. If I pass the test, so be it. That's what we mean by letting go.

The [[Niyama]]s aren't about morality. The yogis were very scientific. They weren't actually very religious. It's not about faith. Their model is about experimentation & hypothesis testing. What they discovered is that if you start living a truthful life, all kinds of things will happen. You'll become more aware of what's going on in your mind, which is literally how you live in the present moment. It shapes your actions, because you can't lie about them later, and you surrender control of the consequences of your actions. You'll no longer be as manipulative in your relationships. You'll give other people in your life the right to judge you, and when you let go of that control, you'll be incredibly free.
