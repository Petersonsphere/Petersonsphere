#### [[Stress Physiology]]
How long should you meditate?
Studies show that meditating 20 minutes a day every other day over 8 weeks seems to be enough to shut off the [[Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) axis|HPA axis]].

Meditation, from a hormonal perspective, can effect things like [[ADHD]] (by reducing [[cortisol]] in the brain).

Meditation reduces the severity of [[autoimmune conditions]].

In meditation, we're trying to prime the [[mind]] to be active.
We want [[eustress]] to enter [[Flow State]].

Meditation works through your hormones & through [[Stress Physiology]].
As we train the [[mind]] in meditation, we're creating a hormonal balance; for a lot of people, that means de-stressing because we face a lot of stress in our society, but some people need to stress up a little bit.

#### [[The Autonomic Nervous System]]

The yogis & traditional Indian & Chinese doctors realized that there are times when our Sun (or, yang ([[Surya]])) is more active, and there are times when our Moon (or, yin ([[Chandra]])) is more active.

There's no evidence that yin & yang exist in the body, but pysiciological correlates in the [[The Autonomic Nervous System]] are the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]] & the [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]].

For people with too much [[Chandra|yin]], like a low energy depressed person, we want a [[stimulating meditation technique]].

For people with too much [[Surya|yang]], like a car accident victim, we want more yin.

#### [[Central Nervous System]]

Developed [[frontal lobes]] are associated with maturity.

There can be a war between [[frontal lobes]] & the [[limbic system]] - a war in the [[mind]] between your emotions and your logical self.

For example, you might feel scared or afraid, but your head is telling you "everything's okay, you have nothing logically to be worried about".
Or, if you're feeling lazy, your [[mind]] might be saying "we need to get up & do this thing," but you don't feel like it.

A lot of people's limbic system control their frontal lobes. As you meditate more, there's good evidence that your frontal lobes start to gain dominance over your limbic system. It doesn't mean you don't feel emotions. Your emotions can be put into context & you can overcome them.

###### Empathy
We haven't discovered an "empathic" circuit in the brain, but the [[Ventral Medial Prefrontal Cortex]] (also part of the frontal lobes) involve empathy. We know that people who meditate regularly develop greater empathy & compassion towards themselves & other people. We aren't sure of the neuroscience of this, but we see effect of it (or, the clinical benefit).

 ###### [[Association Cortices]]
The ability to be [[Vairagya|detached]] is governed by control over the [[Association Cortices]]. Meditation helps us gain this control.

Example: You text someone & they don't text back for awhile. My brain starts to think "they don't like me, ... this relationship is one-way, ... did I offend them? ..."etc. People who regularly meditate have fewer of these kinds of thoughts, are able to see the big picture, and aren't as bothered by events.
