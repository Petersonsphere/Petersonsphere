"Shoulds" - things you *should* do.

"Shoulds" come from our conditioning. They come from internalizing the expectations of other people, which are outside of us. Society, parents, other people. Our level of motivation towards things we should do is very low.
- *That's why you say they're things you -should do- instead of things you -do-.*
Many people's goals are just a bunch of -shoulds-.
