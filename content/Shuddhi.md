Cleansing.

The yogis discovered that optimal function of the body and mind cannot happen unless they are clean & pure. This is one of the [[Niyama]]s of [[Raja]] Yoga.

Think about your life. Which days are hardest? Brain fog can be so debilitating that you can't study at all. Shuddhi is a way to clear sluggishness of the body & mind. The more pure the body & mind becomes, the better it will function.

Think about how you feel after you've showered. Nobody's ever said "I feel terrible after I shower. I can't think about anything. I can't think about anything after the shower's over." To the contrary, nowadays people are propagating the idea of "shower thoughts" on social media which are these profound thoughts that people have in the shower. It's almost like the cleansing experience of the shower is conducive to profound mental thinking. People feel a little bit invigorated & refreshed after showering. Pay attention to how you feel the next time you shower.

###### The importance of a clean environment
Clinically, psychotherapists find a correlation between how [[depression|depressed]] a person is & the more messy their room gets. The more depressed they get, the messier their room gets. One of the best things a [[depression|depressed]] person can do is clean their room. If they can get a little burst of energy & they clean a little bit, they feel a little bit better, & then they have a better chance at getting another little burst of energy where they can clean a little bit more. If they spend a whole day cleaning their entire apartment, the next time they come into the psychotherapy office, they usually feel awesome.

This is also the case with [[ADHD]]. If people with [[ADHD]] have a cluttered house, they can't concentrate. For many patients with [[ADHD]], in order to work, they must fastidiously clean their entire place. The current neuroscience finds that this is exactly the case. A clean environment literally leads to more optimal mental function. To understand this, let's understand how our brain attends to things.

There are two aspects that control our mental attention - top down & bottom up (sensory stimuli).
Top down thinking is when you send an order (which comes from the [[cerebral cortices]]) to all the parts of your mind to fall in line, calm down, and focus on one thing (like study, for example).
Bottom up stimuli is like when you're walking and you see a snake. Your top down activity gets interrupted. In this case, our [[visual cortices]] tells our [[cortices]] to cease activity. We're going to stop thinking about whatever you were just thinking about, because there's a snake.
There's a constant communication between (or sometimes, a war) between your top down circuit & your bottom up circuit.

You might understand this well if you've tried to study in a noisy place. When your bottom up circuit is getting bombarded, you can't study optimally.

Research have found that if you try to do top down thinking in a visually cluttered environment, the [[visual cortices|visual cortex]] is active, and it takes a portion of your mental energy to suppress all those visual signals.

###### Physiology
One of the most important functions of [[sleep]] is clearing out [[adenosine]] from our cells. If we're not able to clean our brains through [[sleep]], it's hard to function the next day.

We also see this in [[neurodegenerative diseases]]. The common problem in these diseases is that our brain is not able to clear out these proteinaceous material things. Our neurons get cluttered with junk. Our inability to clear that junk out of the brain results in neuronal death and [[dementia]].
Some of the promising treatments for these diseases ([[ashwagandha]]) will help clear out the proteinaceous material. There's a promising drug to prevent the development of [[dementia]] which increases the clearance of toxic substance from your neurons.

###### Psychotherapy
When someone has trauma, they take emotional junk & suppress it deep into their unconscious. It manifests in unhealthy ways. Through the process of [[psychotherapy]], we try to recall those repressed memories & let them vent so they can be cleaned out. Oftentimes, we'll have moments of emotional catharsis, where emotions well up and people have this cleansing, or realizing feeling. Even though these feelings are intense, afterwards, they feel lighter. They feel clean. That's the word their mind uses to describe this experience.

The yogis were onto something when they discovered that shuddhi is an important part of optimal functioning of the mind. In order to meditate properly, we have to start by cleansing the body & mind. We now have a bunch of scientific evidence for this stuff.

###### Practical tips
- Personal Hygene - shower every day. Brush your teeth. Do your laundry. Keep your body clean, generally.
	- This also involves things like getting rid of things like constipation. Constipation causes toxin buildup, low-grade inflammation, & negatively affects our mood. This is done by eating the right foods.
- Cleansing your space.
	- You can light Himalayan Sage. Some people use certain kinds of incense.
	- Getting fresh air into your home.
	- Going out for walks is cleansing.
		- Plant aerosols (the compounds plants release) have beneficial effects on mood & anxiety (by activating your [[olfactory receptors]], which balances your mood & anxiety).
	- You can use certain kinds of purifying music. This varies based on culture or which religious tradition you're from. A lot of cultures have purifying vibes, so, think about that sort of stuff.
- Mental cleaning
	- Even through technology. Getting your inbox to zero is one of the most important productivity things you can do. Have a clean desktop. Have a phone that doesn't bombard you with different kinds of stimuli.
- [[Psychotherapy]] - you can work with a trained psychotherapist to unburden yourself from some of the thoughts you hold in your mind.
