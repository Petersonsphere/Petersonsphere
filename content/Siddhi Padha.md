(Sid-dhee Puh-dah)

The path of accomplishment.

We have intentions, desires, & goals, but things get in the way. We may be undisciplined, or unmotivated; or, we may fail to cultivate the right environment.

We hear from people who meditate a lot that they become more successful & optimize their performance.

There is a relationship between [[intention]], and [[manifestation]].

How can we cultivate a particular kind of mindset, environment, & cleansing practice so that our mind is focused and pure? Then, the things we want in life will become manifest.
