*Preface*
Remember that classic, traditional meditation isn't about improving our focus or improving our [[Anxiety]]. It is about understanding the nature of ourselves, and the nature of reality.

The truths discovered in meditation aren't designed to be taught but learned through experience. So the path of meditation involves understanding the basic nature of things, to see what is actually true, how stuff works. And this starts with something so simple as attention - what is the relationship between seeing and tasting? Between enjoyment and taste? How do these things work?

There is a general principle from [[Indriya|Indriya]] & [[Pratyahara]] which is that our attention gets divided between different [[Indriya]]s.

We're going to explore the relationship between attention and [[Indriya]]s.

The technique is relatively simple & you can modify it towards your preferences. We will be apppreciating what happens to our awareness as it gets split or condensed between the [[Indriya]]s. The goal is to explore the relationship between attention and [[Indriya]]s. We want to understand what happens to our attention when it is divided between multiple senses.

We're just going to do a series of activities based on one [[Indriya]] & engage other [[Indriya]]s at the same time.
Examples:
	- Listening to music with eyes open vs closed
	- Eating while watching or listening to something
	- Taking a bath with or without music
	*If you enjoy music more with your eyes closed vs with your eyes open, what does that mean about the enjoyment of music? Where does the enjoyment of music come from? If the enjoyment comes from the music itself, then what difference should it make whether my eyes are open, or closed? If our attention is partially responsible for our enjoyment, then the question is, what % is it responsible for? 50%? 10%? 90%? Because this could potentially revolutionize the way we live our life. If we want to understand where enjoyment and happiness come from, you have to dig into the [[Indriya]]s because they're the things that cause us to eat unhealthy food, or seek out particular kinds of enjoyment. If the enjoyment of a cookie isn't entirely in the cookie, then do you really need to eat the cookie? If you want to understand why you're directed towards particular things, and how to get control over these things, do this kind of divided attention (or, focused attention within an [[Indriya]]) practice.*

The more you pay attention, the more subtlety you have in your focus, the wilder the answer will become. Because you may think  you know the answer - based on past experience, or logic - but the real answer is far wilder than you may realize.
