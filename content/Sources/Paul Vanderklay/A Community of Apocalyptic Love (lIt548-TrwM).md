 Hi, this is Paul and this is Rough Draft for Sunday where I run through the current version of my Sunday sermon Coming back to California after a few weeks of vacation north of here in Idaho, Montana Washington by Puget Sound and then Oregon Coming across the border Smoky, California has the swim sort of apocalyptic feel it had last year. It always makes me think about Prophecy from the book of Joel I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and billows of smoke Right now all around Cala all around Sacramento to the northeast and to the west We have these huge fires burning The Sun will be turned into darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord Now we think about that now. This is the second year. We've had both the pandemic and the fire-filled skies and the smoky skies now what's interesting about this verse that I always think about it's right in the middle of this passage which is quoted in Peter's sermon on Pentecost from the book of Joel and Afterwards, I will pour out my spirit on all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your old men will dream dreams Your young men will see visions even on my servants both men and women I will pour out my spirit in those days I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire and billows of smoke the Sun will be turned into darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord and Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem There will be deliverance as the Lord has said even among the survivors whom the Lord calls and of course in Acts 2 these are people who have gathered for the feast of Tabernacles of little tents of Pentecost in Jerusalem from all over the Jewish diaspora and they're gathering there and Peter gives his sermon Now we've got fires on every side. They've got a pandemic that just won't seem to go away Traveling over Lake Shasta and you look way down and try and see the water all the reservoirs are low And everyone is nervous. Will we get enough rain this year to refill those reservoirs? You drive back into Sacramento and fields are fallow because some of the rice farmers basically could get more money from selling their water than from growing rice and And You know, that's sort of the way things are right now and then getting back you had the fall of Kabul Which for those of us who are old enough to remember the fall of Saigon? Just sort of looked and felt eerily familiar and there's all the finger pointing and blaming now fueled by social media Was who was to blame LBJ or JFK or Nixon or is it Bush Trump or Obama? Biden and this one picture that I caught on social media of the Taliban With their with their guns out putting people against a wall a wall that had been painted by the United Nation with sustainable sustainable development goals. Well, it doesn't seem like the Imagined sustainability about human welfare that the West has to offer Isn't being bought by many people around the world Now the sermon that Peter gave on Pentecost was given in the backdrop of the first great Roman imperial dynasty and over my vacation too, I took time many of if you notice I Tom Holland is a favorite author of mine. I read his books on the rise and fall of the house of Caesar and And I'll tell you no reality show soap opera has anything on these people In fact, if you read about their lives, it's way way more than anything You could ever imagine even making reality TV in North America today and against this backdrop Peter says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of Your sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit The promise is the promise is for you and your children for all who are far off all whom the Lord our God will call With many other words he warned them and pleaded them save yourself from this corrupt generation Those who accepted his message were baptized about three thousand were added to their number that day They devoted themselves to the Apostles teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of the bread and prayer Now we've been in this series about the Apostle Paul and Many times I've noted that Jesus in fact did overthrow the Roman Empire He just didn't do it in a way that anyone expected people were expecting Judas Maccabees or Alexander the Great dominating and conquering their enemies at the cost of the blood of their enemies and Jesus didn't do that and Jesus method the only bloodshed was his own on behalf of his enemies and The Apostle Paul has a very big part to play in this transformation The last time would I which I preached was about four weeks ago Paul was up in Antioch and Pasidian Antioch in Asia Minor and He was preaching there and sort of what we got in acts 13 was a version of the Apostle Paul's stump speech He always goes into a town appears in the synagogue probably preaches a similar thing perhaps a little bit adjusted to local situations and then What follows is also a repeated pattern in the book of Acts? Now in the next town Paul takes his stump speech and he does it again now Luke doesn't rehearse the stump speech again because he gave it in chapter 13, but What becomes the pattern of Paul's journey and though his manner of missionary technique follows through At I at Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual see Luke is basically signaling to us This is what his usual practice was went as usual into the Jewish synagogue There he spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Greeks believed But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the other Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there speaking boldly for the Lord who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders or again We've seen this pattern of miracles and preaching beginning in the synagogue and usually a splinter group will move out and continuing then to focus on that group The people of the city were divided some sided with the Jews others with the Apostles There was a plot afoot among the Gentiles and Jews together with their leaders to mistreat them and stone them But they found out about it and fled to the Lyconian cities of Lystra and Derby and to the surrounding country Where they continued to preach the gospel and again if you're curious about the kinds of things he would say in the synagogue read chapter 13 In Lystra they saw a man who was lame He had been that way from birth and had never walked now some of you who know your Bible's well will be hearing an echo Particularly of let's say Jesus in Jerusalem when he finds the man born blind He listened to Paul as he was speaking The man looked directly at him saw that Paul looked directly at him saw that he had faith to be healed and called out Stand up on your feet At that the man jumped up and began to walk now again in a city this size Everyone likely would have known that man that man probably sat at a prominent entryway to the city lame and begged So everybody in the city would know just like there are some homeless people on this corner that everybody in this neighborhood knows because they're always On the corner. They're always making noise in a case like this this this man was likely begging every day and now Peter heals him When the crowd saw what Paul had done they shouted in the Lyconian language now The Roman Empire had conquered this whole hodgepodge of all these little kingdoms and places in the ancient world and The focus here probably wasn't a Jewish synagogue in this community And so they're addressing him much more from the Greco-Roman point of view When the crowd saw what Paul had done they shouted in the Lyconian language the gods have come down to us in human form Barnabas they called Zeus and Paul they called Hermes Because he was the chief speaker The priest of Zeus whose temple was just outside the city Brought bowls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them now again, if you do any reading of Roman culture and Roman religion This is pretty much standard operating procedure in order for a miracle like this to take place Certainly these men must be gods in human form and it would be terribly dangerous not to honor these gods in human form once They're known because these gods could turn around and perhaps smite the city and so seeing this miracle again This is a departure from the kinds of things that you would see in the Gospels because that's obviously Done in a much different context now suddenly They're about to offer a sacrifice on behalf of Paul and Barnabas now some of you might say well What a wonderful ministry opportunity well Paul and Barnabas really didn't quite see it that way But when the Apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this they tore their clothes now. That's a sign of Distress and it's demonstrating to the people they're not happy at all and Rushed out into the crowd shouting friends notice what he can they call them friends. We're all friends here Why are you doing this? We too are only human. We're not gods like you We are bringing you good news telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God Who made the heavens and the earth and the seas and everything in them now? We get a sense of Paul's take and how he talked to the Romans and how he talked to the Greco Romans in The past he let all nations go their own way And if you flip ahead and look at his sermon in Athens, you'll see similar Themes coming out in that sermon as what you see here in chapter 14 In the past he let all nations go their own way yet. He has not left himself without testimony He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons now again If you read the Sermon on the Mount you'll notice that Jesus says a very similar thing This is how God shows his perfection and generosity and this is the kind of perfection that Jesus disciples should have that kind of generosity He provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy Even with these words they had a difficult time Keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them that tells you something about how deeply entrenched the cultural practices and the religious practices of the people were But again, we might say well, isn't this what we want from the world? This is success and well, I remember back in February I think 2017 perhaps we have this man from India who set up a Lifesize size figure figure of Donald Trump because Donald Trump demonstrated success. He had business success He was a billionaire and he won the presidential campaign That must mean he's a god and so you stop and you you worship him as a god but Well, what are we to say about the Taliban? How are we to manage these outcomes power Popularity success a claim are these things in themselves? Testimonies to what is true and what is real? Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium Apparently there weren't many living in Lystra and they were determined to make sure that Paul and Barnabas at least in their minds Get the treatment that any fraud should because obviously they didn't believe Paul and Barnabas They didn't believe Paul and Barnabas and they won the crowd over the crowd who was Not really terribly happy at hearing that this wasn't Zeus and Hermes who had come down in human form who was resisting their Sacrifice and now well mobs can be switched almost on a dime They stoned Paul remember they were trying to stone Paul and Iconium they stoned him. Well, what does that mean? That means they picked up rocks and they started throwing rocks at him and they kept throwing rocks at him Until they think he's dead You might wonder at this point. Well should Paul and Barnabas have simply said yeah, we're Zeus and Hermes go ahead Let's have a barbecue No, they weren't about to do that They wanted to impress upon them something that obviously the crowd was not in a position to understand at that point So they stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city thinking he was dead But after the disciples had gathered around him They must have at least gather at least a certain amount of following or those who had come with him He got up and went back into the city the next day he and Barnabas left for Derby this reminds me of Ananias and when Ananias is told to go and pray over Saul and Ananias complains and the Lord says I'll show him How much he has to suffer? This in fact is Paul's ministry to Lystra, what do we think of that was it a success? We see the beginning of the challenge of Evangelizing the pagan Romans and in fact his whole project at all every time he goes into a city a Mod there's there seems to be a fight that breaks out of one kind or another Either he splits the synagogue and and some begins Meeting together as later we would call Christians Here in this case. Well, what was the purpose? What happened in the city? Should he have just accepted the accepted the sacrifice and enjoyed the barbecue with the rest of the city? Should he have set them straight and said we're not gods We want to tell you about the living God something that they obviously didn't want to hear What do we see happening in all of this stuff? You see Jewish synagogues are deeply divided about how to regard Jesus and the resurrection Jewish believers are deeply divided about what to do with the Mosaic law We're gonna see that in the upcoming weeks and how it's been used to differentiate them from paganism God fears. These are Gentiles who had been Worshipping with the Jews saw Jesus as a fulfillment of the twilight that they experienced in the synagogue and they would often become early converts to Christianity pagan Romans struggled to understand the power Demonstrated as something different from what power demonstrated to them in paganism And they're all just trying to sort this thing out It seems deeply apocalyptic So then how is the world changed Rome was not conquered by showing better miracles by providing people with more entertainment spread in circuses Nor satisfying their hunger for novelty and political hopes It was patiently Sacrificially, it was patient sacrificial Apple Apocalyptic love Demonstrated by believers like Paul and Barnabas who put their lives at risk Both speak both to speak on popular truth while loving their enemies that saved the world This was the thing that happened in Paul's stoning in some ways We see an echo of Jesus crucifixion now this time it didn't kill Paul But he didn't get up from the stoning and start cursing the city he continued to work with the challenges that he had and in fact What began to impress upon the people bit by bit by bit was this apocalyptic apocalyptic love this revelatory love of loving one's enemies of turning the other cheek of Doing the right thing even when it didn't seem to pay Now times are weird and I know in Sacramento a lot of us are feeling Way more than done with the pandemic. We've got the fires all around us. We've got a crazy recall election underway There's all sorts of things happening and for many times are hard and people are stressed out and they've sort of had enough Things are always sort of that way 1975 and again and again, I think that the times we live in remind me of the 1970s but even in an apocalyptic climate you get good days and bad days and good years and bad years and Christians endure such things we love even when we're unloved we give even when we have little to give We tell the truth even when it costs us and when we are weak He is strong This is what discipleship means This is how we live in fat years and lean years and good times and bad times when the Sun refuses to shine and when the Sun comes out and the rains come and the reservoirs fill Now Paul didn't immediately resolve his Resolve with his words this conflict in the synagogues the conflict in the churches the conflicts in the Empire Paul would go to his grave well go to his grave at the hands of Nero the last of that dynasty But the seeds that he planted were in the church and it was the church that affected the change over the long term He helped establish communities that embodied the spirit of Christ first given at Pentecost and slowly personally those communities transformed an Empire Confused about God's love and power That's what changed the world. That's what conquered the world now Here we are apocalyptic August He helped Paul and we've continued in this work to establish communities that embody the spirit of Christ first at Pentecost and slowly personally those communities transform an Empire that is continues to be confused about God's love and power So go and do likewise even in apocalyptic August
