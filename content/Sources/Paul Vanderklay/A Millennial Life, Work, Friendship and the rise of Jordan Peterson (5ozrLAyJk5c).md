 Hi, this is Paul and today I Joey has been on one of our videos before Joey came to our second Sacramento Jordan Peterson meetup and I've been bugging some of these guys at the local meetup to come on the channel sometimes and I had James on a while ago but I've wanted to have Joey on for quite a while so Joey I'm really glad that you could come and why don't we just begin by having you introduce yourself a little bit. Sure, so yeah like you said I've been coming to the meetup group right now for about a year and a half it's been super enjoyable it's literally I have never done anything like it in my whole life. I've had some philosophy classes in college where occasionally one class out of maybe ten you'd get a decent conversation going but ours consistently every single time we It's like you'll have at least two or three good 20 minute sections that are just like blowing your mind making you think about things differently so it's been a lot of fun. My background is very very standard as far as most things go so I'm from the Midwest I'm from Chicago specifically I grew up in the suburbs very very you know my family used to joke around that we were the cleavers from Liva to Beaver because we didn't really have any major problems we didn't really have any like major issues or things like that no arrests no divorces no not like it was a very very standard kind of boring upbringing. When I was super young the suburb was relatively less developed so there was lots of places outside to go and explore there were big fort not forest preserves but there was just big open land with forests that me and my friends would run around in you know when you're a little kid you don't really need that much to feel like a lot but as we got older everything around us got developed and turned into houses and Nick mansions and things like that and so the the city got well the area got more and more boring as we got older and older so then my high school years were incredibly dry. I was a pretty bright kid I didn't challenge myself academically probably as much as I should but I didn't really have a ton of opportunities to do so either at least in my own estimation you know there's part of that's your your parents kind of have to set you up for that you kind of have to like and they have to know about it and my parents are both very very well put together very successful people my dad does my dad one of the hardest workers I've ever seen probably the hardest worker I've ever seen my mom's great too but like they just they didn't go to college so they didn't know how the system works and how you could how you need to go in and out and control you know kind of control your destiny like the public school system just doesn't really have the best interests in mind for you so that's kind of where I ended up I hated hated hated high school because I was so bored just daydreaming all day long every day and then I would go home and have at night I would I would have recurring dreams of a full school day that had nothing interesting happen and I would get stuck in this loop where my my school week would end up being like nine days long effectively and it was it was horrible and so yeah I was I was so disappointed with the whole school system just point with school in general that like essentially I was I was going to college planning on dropping out my mom got cancer right before I left for college so that was another thing so I didn't want to go too far away it was a good prognosis we didn't think there was gonna be any complications but you never know so it was one of those things I didn't want to spend too much on cop I didn't want to spend too much in college I didn't want to go too far away and I didn't want to over invest myself into it because I thought well I'll be here for a year because my parents are more or less pushing me into it and then I'll drop out afterwards got to college was pleasantly surprised made one really good friend right off the bat where did you go to college University of Wisconsin Whitewater it's a small school in the southeast side of Wisconsin it's about 110 miles or so from Chicago proper so it was it was an hour and a half drive from my house it was really really close by they gave me a good scholarship because I had really high test scores the school had really low test scores I got in pretty easily and then yeah they wanted to keep me around so that worked out really well got got to go to college for super cheap essentially made one one really good friend early on he only stayed for a year but it kind of changed my whole perspective on how friends work and how how you need to form social groups and that was that was maybe the start of my journey in figuring out how how I wanted to be as an adult which I guess is what you're supposed to do in college so to that end it was good the education again it wasn't a great school I wasn't challenging myself nearly as enough so I didn't get the best of my education but then coming out of that school because I was in the Honor Society and by I was in the Honor Society they asked me to join and I just clicked the checkbox that said yes I was in the Honor Society I got recruited through that Honor Society to join a software company the software company's name was Epic it was in the in Madison Wisconsin they were doing healthcare software and so I graduated in 2009 during the middle of the Great Recession all my friends were having really tough time getting jobs really tough time getting good jobs and this one essentially just fell into my lap I started work on a day that I was planning on moving down to Florida and just figuring shit out down there but like it's that I and so I started at the software company it was a good job it was challenging I spent a lot of time working my my weeks were incredibly long I I said yes to a lot of things that I probably should have been smarter about I over committed by the end I think in the last month I worked it was something like including travel time and so some of the travel time I'm sleeping but it's still it's not real not real sleep I think I worked something like 150 90 120 and 130 hours I mean that's including travel time so but that's a lot of work that was a lot of work and I came back and my I had a I had a boss who was like you know she was two years older than I was or something so like we were all just babies pretending to be consultants and she I missed one meeting that I had told another manager that I wasn't gonna be able to make because I was working these crazy hours and I was gonna be in another meeting and some email got exchanged or something and I just got chewed out for like half an hour and I just kind of walked away and I'm like I'm done with this and so I did got got convinced by my cousin-in-law to move out to Santa Barbara for a sales job which it was actually a decent company it was a smaller company there was some real opportunity there so it wasn't like it wasn't I got suckered into it it was it was a real sales job I was just too young and I didn't know like I didn't know the product I didn't really have any interest in the product and I didn't do very well so about a year into that they asked me to move to the warehouse because I had a degree in operations management it actually would have been a great fit for me the company was just too small to really even support an entire person back there so I hopped on LinkedIn I started looking around I had been getting emails for people wanting me to do epic work and I'm like never again never again never again I start talking to some people and I had job offers for four times what I was making at the software company and five times what I was making at the sales job within the first week the issues lasted less than 15 minutes like it was height of Obamacare they just needed bodies in the seats and you couldn't you couldn't do the job without the certification I had so it was a little bit like an oil boom type situation ended up doing some consulting work my first first job was for a hospital in North Carolina it went really well we got a few things done then a project got delayed they didn't really have anything for me to do so I just didn't renew you know it was shaking hands all good exits stuff like that then I ended up at Sutter Health worked there for about two years that was a great project loved the people I worked with a lot of good a lot of good times lived here for was flying up from Santa Monica for a while then I ended up moving here full-time here meeting Sacramento here yeah here me in Sacramento made a ton of really good friends just like an incredible number of friends we've talked about that at the meetup group several times maybe we'll talk about it more later but I tried moving back to Chicago a few times and it just didn't take it's like no I can't do this I can't leave my friends and so now I've just got such a good non-familial social group that my mom came out recently and met some of my friends and she told me you can't come home you have to stay here so now I'm staying here I had been doing the consulting thing on and off taking little breaks in between gigs now I this last time I ended work in June 2018 so it's been a year and a month and I told myself I was gonna do some cool new stuff and I was gonna take a proper sabbatical and not just take time off and part of it's been this Jordan Peterson group part of it's been trying to invest in figuring out in what exactly is going on here is the whole that phrase figuring out what we're doing figuring out if there's a way to scale it figuring out if there's a way to make a non-explicit of living off of it you know if I can if I can help people and and have a job out of it that would be great I don't know if that's gonna be possible figuring out what I want to do on my own because I think at some point I need to run my own show I don't think I'm I'm the employee type forever I just think I would get I would feel the lack of freedom so I'm trying to figure that out and then the super cool thing that I've been doing is I've been trying to get into a sport called highlining which is slacklining but it's in between cliff faces anywhere yeah so you know it's just the kind of thing you just happen to get into it so but it's um it's essentially a one inch thick wide webbing it called a webbing it's kind of like a ratchet type material from a ratchet strap it's about one inch wide it's 50 to 500 feet off the ground even high you know whatever whatever you can put it in between and they'll be anywhere from about 20 meters to I think the world record right now is 1,000 8 1,080 meters long it might be I might be way off on that but like it's so some of these are just really cool projects that people are doing I'm not there yet I haven't walked on the line yet because it's incredibly hard been doing a lot of training in the gym and getting a lot of the moves in the gym and then now it's become a weekly thing too right after I'm done talking to you I'm gonna head out to the park and we'll get 12 to 15 people that show up to this little event we've got lines of all different sizes all different lengths difficulties and then people just hang out in the park and practice their their slacklining and they do some yoga they do some acro yoga and they do all this other fun hippie stuff that I never heard of in the Midwest and yeah and that's where I'm at now and yeah I don't I don't really know where to go from there so all right well you live you live in an area of people in Sacramento will know this but nobody else will know anything about it you live in an area of Sacramento called Midtown yeah and Midtown is sort of this the place in Sacramento where a lot of a lot of men and women your age who are single tend to live in fact my son who comes to our meetup will be moving to Midtown this month and sometimes when I go to Midtown because we have a church plant that's in Midtown sometimes when I go to Midtown and I walk around I think this is this is sort of like college with jobs instead of classes pretty much and so was that part of how I mean you found that peer group when you moved to Sacramento and yeah it's a lot of it's a lot of people that would be derogatorily called yuppies it's young professionals it's a lot of college educated people it's probably very similar to Washington DC even though I've never been there because of the government focus so it's young people who aren't making an extraordinary amount of money but are making decent livings and are secure within their financial situations so I think the culture is a little bit different because we don't have we don't have like San Francisco or New York type vibes where there's some people making millions of dollars and throwing money around and then there's other people making no money and like I just I've been in those cities there's a different vibe to it to everything there's a lot more outward cultural signaling from just different groups like the way you dress is way more distinct in those cities I feel the way you you act and talk and people you hang out with it's all like way more even though it's subconscious it's way more planned we're Sacramento I think it's a lot it's it's a lot more of the ideal what you were talking about college experience it's a lot more of the ideal people actually diverse people coming together and interacting politely you don't always agree you don't always do any of that stuff but it's it's very strange for a California city and I've lived in a few so now you were you raised with religion growing up did your parents go to church your parents go to church so my parents were both raised with religion I wasn't the Catholic Church scandal was hit my mom really hard she doesn't really like talking about it so I don't know the details but like the hypocrisy was always a very big issue for my mom so she didn't like the hypocrisy aspects of the church so she just wasn't a very big fan my dad I think went to Catholic high school went to Lutheran churches but then a Catholic high school just because it was the neighborhood in Chicago because they both grew up in Chicago they were Chicago born and raised so that that was kind of their background and then as they got older I don't think they attended church very often if at all my grandparents who we saw the most did stopped going to church so like then my parents did too I didn't even find out I was baptized until I was about 16 years old but going through like you know you have your drawer every kid has every kid in the family has one drawer and you go through that drawer and there's all the different stuff and documents and stuff I'm going through it when I'm 16 and I come across a baptism certificate and I can't remember where did this come from and my dad was yelling back you know not yelling but we're just joking around he's like if you go to hell it's not my fault all right fair enough so we got a good laugh out of it but it was just like so I'd say my dad my dad leans more towards agnostic my mom leads more towards uh I would say like non-believer um like he sees the church as more of an institution than um the religious aspects of it okay now somewhere along the line you discovered Sam Harris when did you first learn about Sam Harris and what were your impressions so I think that goes back to that philosophy class I took so I graduated high school early because I hated it so much but my mom said I had to take two community college classes while I was working at Best Buy which was the right decision and Best Buy was not enough no offense to anyone who works there working in the warehouse I was just putting in hours and I was trading hours for a little bit of money and I wasn't I didn't even need the money so it made it way worse because I would have paychecks stack up at the front I would get four of my paychecks from eight weeks at the same time and like the people who worked there like didn't know why I wasn't collecting my paychecks I didn't I didn't have any hobbies I didn't spend any money anyhow um so during that that um that class I took that philosophy class at a community college and it was actually really cool because the uh the philosophy teacher I had despite it being a philosophy class was a uh young earth creationist so the and he was very polite about it and he was very like into the rules of arguing with philosophy he wasn't like the most uh he wasn't he didn't have like the greatest background like he didn't have encyclopedic knowledge of much but he liked the rules he liked the game and he liked the core principles of what you teach in a philosophy 101 class so he was actually a great person to go back and forth with through him I discovered uh Christopher Dawkins who I just loved his not Dawkins um Christopher Hitchens who I just loved his sense of humor too much because he had a little bit of that troll a little bit of that too smart for his own good a little bit of I'm gonna poke and cause trouble but you can't get that mad at me because I didn't say anything that bad and that's that's my personality so so I I really fell in love with some like his YouTube videos and stuff that was maybe back in 2005 I don't know yeah maybe it wasn't even YouTube videos maybe it was other stuff because I don't even know if YouTube was around back then um found Sam Harris through him um I'm a big fan of I'm a big fan of a lot of Sam Harris uh especially his stuff 2015 and before um he was very big I think in like the post-911 stuff I think his work on Islam um was very critical in the right ways and it was very critical not just uh not just of the religion of self but of the people who refused to look at it to be critical of it and I think that work was very important um I think he got a lot of conversations going on why do you think you were attracted to these what Jordan Peterson would call celebrity atheists um so in the midwest um outside of Chicago Chicago has a very global global feel it's like any other big city but the the suburbs are very midwest culture midwest culture is nice but pushy um so in the mid like my experience of the midwest is everyone wants to ask you questions not just to be nice not because they're interested but because they want to know what you're doing you'd get a lot you'd get a lot of the the the Christian type folk and it was a lot of the evangelical type folk were the the most outgoing about it so it was probably inversely related to how um how much they cared about actually talking about it and how like how much they cared about pushing their religion on you was inversely related to how much they were actually willing to have a conversation um and I would like I said I was a pretty bright kid at a young age like you weren't gonna you weren't gonna convince me of anything by telling me you were gonna have to convince me um so I had a lot of a lot of people be pushy in my life trying to tell me to do this that or the other and their arguments to my even even as a young like a very very young child were inadequate and so I pushed back against it and so then when I found people who are really good at pushing back against that specific type of argument I was very attracted to them. So how somewhere along the way I mean you made your way to a Jordan Peterson meetup which meant that you found Jordan Peterson what what what how did you find Jordan Peterson what grabbed your attention why did you decide to come to a meetup in a church of all places? Well I found Jordan Peterson first um and I found him probably through some of the comedians that were on YouTube probably through that whole Twitter atmosphere that you know that jokes around a lot and um and then whenever whenever something blows up on campus they're all over it um so there's the famous red suspender video and um I've always been a big Orwell fan um as far as authors go I've read the most Orwell I don't even really like reading books I feel like my theory on reading books I think kind of said this in the last video my theory on reading books is I don't like giving my mind away to another person for that long of a time uninterrupted I prefer articles I prefer um even just Twitter arguments or Twitter threads because they're shorter more compact and then I get to deal with the argument as opposed to a narrative um that's trying to convince me of something but Orwell I really really like and um when Jordan Peterson went out there and when he had people screaming at him and he's you know just standing there wearing the red suspenders and talking back and talking back about how free speech is my most important value um I think it's the most important American value I think that's why it's the first amendment I think it's incredibly vital to our society incredibly vital to our culture and when he would sit stand there in front of everyone and not back down and speak to the crowd even though there was a reasonable chance that not only could could the crowd have have violently consumed him like let's let's say I'm over emphasizing that let's say that wasn't really a possibility it feels like it at the time when you have that many people yelling at you stood up to that stood up to all of the other um all the other consequences that could have come his way said that if they were going to send him to if they were going to find him he wasn't going to pay it if they sent him to jail he was going to go on a hunger strike and he just wasn't going to do this and he wasn't going to do this for free speech or more specifically against compelled speech and that's the kind of person that even if I don't agree with them I have to respect them so uh that that's where he came on the board for me after that I found the rest of his videos and I mean they're enthralling so that's just kind of I went from there okay and I had I'd actually met some of your friends because I started making videos and then people started reaching out to me I had lunch with uh Taylor who's whose uh water bottle I used as an illustration downstairs it's still in my house and I still haven't done it yeah you had lunch with him he convinced me to come and go uh come and do it and I think he only came to one he did yeah he came with his his I think it was his roommate at the time who's still a good Matt one of our other good friends I think the two of them went then they convinced me to go no he came to two because he went to one without me and then he went went to one with me and Matt didn't come to the second one right neither one of neither one of them has been back since it's more about timing than anything else but I don't take it personally yeah so he they convinced me um they're both um they're both churchgoers um they're both very very good people people I respect very much both for their opinions and you know just as who they are as human beings and so he's like you need to come to this you'll you'll enjoy it we were talking about Jordan Peterson a lot outside of that um we talk about Joe Rogan a lot too so it was like that kind of sphere of what we were talking about he convinced me to come um that was maybe that was literally the first time I had ever been in a church besides weddings and funerals or the baptism that I didn't know about yeah I was very nervous about that like I don't like it um one of the things that a lot of us have said about holding the Jordan Peterson meetup in a church is there's the inherent importance of it even if holiness might be too strong of a word but it's like this is important this is an important place to be people come here to listen to important things and do things that I don't know just like that means something so we're there's an inherent level of respect we have fun but we're we're trying to be serious about it while having fun and just it it ends it ends up being a very very healthy environment for the kinds of discussions that we're having I think so so you talked a little bit about this already but what did you find that I mean obviously it's gripped you in a pretty significant way you've you've been to pretty much unless you had a scheduling conflict you've pretty much been to every meeting and you very quickly became you know we don't really have a formal structure within our group but there are you know there are those who kind of represent the core of the group who have taken on much more leadership in terms of activities and deciding topics so so what what about this do you think really grabbed you and what role is it playing in your life I mean so part of it's the camaraderie I never played any sports I had I always had lots of friends growing up but it was always like okay I would have one best friend at a time and then friends they were all good people I still you know I would still be friendly with all of them even the ones I don't talk to very much but I never really had that the we're in this together kind of feel you know if we would go out for a night I could trust my friends to back me up if some trouble had happened but if I was one town over and they got a call well they would be like oh well is the ambulance coming that's great you know it's like maybe I'm selling them short too but that's kind of what it felt like we didn't we didn't really have the the like serious camaraderie that I think this group has the that we're gonna do stuff together that like when one of us is having trouble like they reach out to the other people and we talk to each other like we talk through things as opposed to just trying to come up with quick solutions to things I think that's a very Midwest thing as well as like oh if you have a problem well here's how I would solve it and that's the end of the conversation but like you don't explore the problem anymore so you don't even have the words to describe your problems very well so that's it's that's one aspect the other aspect is just it's very mentally challenging it's very it's very interesting to talk about working in the IT world I encountered a lot of hard problems but none of them were like oh that's super fascinating like I'm I'm really enjoying exploring this area of my mind like it wasn't it was more mathish problems so now trying trying to actually talk about stuff in depth with archetypes in a narrative in a story just like that whole thing just kind of layers things on top of each other so it's it's very cool have you has your have your opinions about religion at all in this process? Um so I mean before I was I was probably openly disrespectful of it um I was openly disrespectful of religion in the way that I felt attacked by it I felt that people who were wearing their religion outwardly forward were trying to impose it on me were trying to control my behavior were trying to claim authority that I didn't think they have because they're claiming authority from above that I didn't believe in so when you try and claim that doesn't make sense to me um so you know that seems that seems tyrannical to to a person that's only encountering the middle school boy evangelical version of religion um Jordan Peterson's famously used that against Sam Harris is that Sam Harris has a middle school atheist opinion but I think that most of the people that atheists come into contact with that it'll actually try and change their mind as atheists come into contact with people who have middle school opinions of religion so watching your channel talking to you talking to some of the believers in our group actually discussing things without getting offended actually like not just trying to we I think we were joking about not just trying to slam dunk on each other and you know come up with these verbal quips because we have three hours it's way more fascinating yeah I mean the other that that's that's what the groups made me feel um Jordan Peterson even before I came to the group um the way he describes history the way he describes psychology the way he describes narrative structures and archetypes and things like that um which I didn't even really use the word archetype before I heard of Jordan Peterson um so the way he puts all of those things together and he uses music a lot too the way he constructs a symphony when he's talking to people about it has intrinsic meaning like there's something there that's so important and I think I think he was talking to Harvard Harvard or Stanford Stanford um and he was like saying that like if you you you kids are so privileged and so smart that if you learn how to use your words properly and how to construct arguments in a way that makes sense and how to tug emotions not abuse them but use them use them appropriately and string things together and and use facts as well so don't abuse statistics don't abuse facts don't abuse emotions put all that together you get something that is so enjoyable and so beautiful and impossible to look away from and you become so much more powerful within your own mode of being you you're not just riding along with life because I don't people might pick this up from the story I told maybe they won't but I felt like I was railroaded like my life just kind of happened to me I wasn't doing it Jordan Peterson convinced me I needed to flip it around it's like I'm smart enough I'm like this is true of most people but maybe not all people but like I'm I definitely feel that I'm personally smart enough I'm personally creative enough I'm personally interesting enough that I need to take control of my own life and I need to push it forward so that's that's where the sabbatical came from that's where the I'm changing my life came from that's where my involvement with this group comes from and uh when you put all that together one of the important things that's in that sympathy is culture and I never modern public public school education especially what we're dealing now with social justice it's just like become so explicit now is people that look like me and have my genitals don't have a culture and that's just a it's not true it's factually untrue everyone has a culture and b my culture is just as important as anyone else's and I've never explored it before I've never really looked at it I've read ancient Roman history books but that might be a little bit too far back maybe instead of these ancient books I need to read some more books from the 1800s from the 1700s from I need to diversify my own understanding of my own culture and my own history and it's important now when you take it with religion because that was the original question that I've gone in a huge circle around sorry but when you take that with religion okay maybe religion is a little bit more than that middle school evangelical version that was getting pitched to me maybe religion is groups of people coming together to talk about important things to hear about important things to support each other to be there for each other to form something a little bit bigger than a family and a little bit smaller than a tribe and maybe that's super super important so I was laughing at religion like this is the faith line I've used again and again in our meetup group I used to laugh at religion I'm not laughing anymore I'm taking it very seriously now now you talked about you're taking a sabbatical you've been doing some things that you never thought you'd do before you're living in you're living in kind of a sweet place to explore because there's a tremendous diversity of people in midtown and from all over really all over the world and they're like you say you don't have you don't have billionaires so most people are I mean to afford a place in midtown you've got to be you know doing okay most of them well but not over the top it's yeah right now now you've taken a sabbatical and you're doing some exploring and in the video that we did before when we had the five of us I mean you've kind of got a vision for and and I for starting other meetups and I know because you know some of the other events that we've gone to you've come along and this this coming Sunday I should probably mention that this coming I should probably make a different video but this coming Sunday will help the the Alameda the new Alameda meetup start in the Bay Area and so so what's what's kind of behind that because that's a that's an interesting move for you know especially one of the things that I caught my attention when we're making the other videos when you were saying well if if you're just kind of a person out there and you want to meet up and you can't really start one find a pastor and and talk to them and I thought oh my I don't know how that will go bold gotta be bold so I guess I was talking to James so James has been on on the show before he's the uh severe apology no philosophy professor psychology psychology neuropsychology no that's his degree I think he's the philosophy professor at whatever he's a professor at a local college yeah um and we were talking in one of the meetings like in public so we were having this kind of back and forth in front of people and we got to the conclusion that if this group is so great for us and it means so much to us aren't we obligated to share it with other people and the answer we both reluctant we both came to was reluctantly yeah we kind of need to um so we've been trying to figure that out um I'm I'm disappointed in myself with how fast that's gone um part of the sabbatical was uh my health wasn't in great shape before I went on it so I've been focusing on that um I need to be in tip-top shape to do the to do the high lining thing that I was going to do because you don't you don't just walk on those if you're some guy um I have lost about 20 pounds I've had been getting in shape um I've just been feeling a lot healthier I've been getting my diet under control um ironically the Jordan Peterson kind of the carnivore thing just made me rethink my diet a little bit too which is a whole nother story that some people have different opinions about but um yeah so then I mean the next thing is is how do we how do we expand this how do we take this magic that we have in our group that forms these bonds that does these things and how do we spread it out and how do we do it in a way that is sustainable because I can't devote I can't devote 40 to 50 hours of my own time towards this project and then try and go back to work where I'm going to work 60 or 70 hours a week I've done that before it literally kills you you can't work some people can work that hard I'm not um so we are we have we've we've started some websites where we don't have much functionality on them um we're not I'm not even going to share them yet we'll share them at a future date um but we've got the domain names we're coming up with some ideas um I've been very working hard very hard I've been working very hard on my personal social commitments um so one of the things I do that's very beneficial is I do a happy hour every two weeks um our friend group does lots of events like this where we have stuff that happens sporadically but dependably um so that every other Friday an invite goes out to 70 or 80 of my closest friends and 20 of them show up and then they show up every other Friday and they know that they have somewhere to go and somewhere to be to be with people who care about them um another some of my other friends do uh we call it Framley so friends and family dinner every single Sunday every single Sunday that they're in town they host dinner everyone's welcome anyone you vouch for is welcome to come it's amazing it's amazing like it's why my mom says I can't come back home I have to stay it's a big thing for a mom to say so like I so that's that's my own experience I've invited some members of our Jordan Peterson meet up to join join me in those events they have done it it's been great I've been hosting my own smaller discussion groups on the side in my own house that's those have been fun too um it's has some overlaps some of my my other friends some of my Jordan Peterson friends um but it's now like okay I'm so so blessed to use that term so privileged to use the other term in this aspect of my life how do I share it with people and yeah I'm I'm I'm very much struggling in figuring out how that scales um and I guess now we're going to be talking over a thousand people I'm welcome to hear their inputs and uh I will ignore most of them but I will listen to some of them there won't be a thousand comments that no there won't be a thousand comments but there'll be two or three yeah well there'll be more than two or three there'll be two or three that I want to listen to well so so part of you know so I've been listening I've been re-listening to some of the biblical series again and you know part of figuring out why Jordan Peterson has had the impact that he has had and the splash that he's had you know one of the one of the points he makes again and again is you you need to have a goal and you know that what that goal does is begins to orient you and it gives you a direction so if if you know what are what I mean you already mentioned how boy you want to help help others have and I think help others have the kind of meetings that we're having and I think probably with some of the trips that we've taken and some of the other groups you're appreciating how I think how special our group in Sacramento is and how complicated it really is to get a good meetup going it's you know there's there's certainly methodology but but there's also always something of I mean there were certain elements of our group that are really hard to reproduce because of course I was making videos and that gave a certain critical mass to at least initial people I think we got really good very early on on sort of having the right people with the right mix and we very quickly I think established a very healthy culture that has facilitated what we've got going that doesn't happen everywhere or every time but but you've seen how you know so so you're saying okay you've got this career that obviously you could jump back into but you don't want to jump back in like you had been before the sabbatical has you know has to change you in a way so that when you go back I need to maintain my physical health and my mental health when I go back yeah which I was holding on to my mental health okay in my job not great but now my physical health and my mental health is literally the best it's ever been in my entire life I know it's not going to stay that way when I start working but I'd like to get close to close to that optimize yeah well what do you what do you see I mean because part of what I've really appreciated about the group and about you in particular along along with some others you know as a pastor of a small church a mostly aging church the the community that I'm most aware of and the issues that surround the people I work with most often tend to be issues of of retirees in Sacramento in various from various ethnic groups various socioeconomic classes but one of the things that I've really appreciated about the group is that I've learned a lot about the challenges that you know you're you're a little bit older than my kids but I've learned a lot about the challenges that your generation is facing and and challenges in terms of questions of finding marriage finding a mate questions of career one of the things that I every time I come away from a meetup and I listen to many of you talk I just hear how much the world has changed since I was your age and it's going faster it's not so so what what are I mean what are you learning and what are what are some of the maybe some top takeaways that you've seen in this and and maybe some of the things that you've now had some perspective on because of your sabbatical and because of the life that you've lived for the last year or two in Midtown so I'm I actually probably learned a lot more from from my consulting gig because my consulting work was so strange for somebody my own age most people even who get into consulting will end up consulting and then working for one firm for a set amount of time before moving on to one other firm that they move work for a set amount of time my my work was all six months to two years and I spent the majority of that time not working for a specific firm but we're working as a supplemental employee in the hospital that I was working at so when I when I'm talking about cultures and when I'm talking about like religious culture specifically that's that's specific to your local non-work culture but in terms of work cultures I've seen hundreds because even within those those jobs my my specific role was I was helping with front desk software for for hospitals and clinics so I would go not just to not just to a hospital not just to an IT room but I would go to a region that I had never been to then go to a sub region that I had never been to and then go to the front desk clinic and then work with somebody who works at a front desk in a clinic and again this is not disparaging them at all but they are a different sort of person than the person that most people who are in consulting would work with at the same time since I started college I've moved over 40 times wow exactly 40 times so this current apartment I'm in is the is the first place I've stayed in for more than a year since I left home the first time how many years has that been um 12 yeah 12 now but this was still true this was true when I hit 29 so in 10 years I moved an average of about four times a year wow it's nuts this is and some of that was you know move back home stuff like that but it's picking up all your stuff leaving what you had behind and being somewhere new so I was completely ruthless so and I think that's what our generation's feeling is our generation's feet are being taken right out from under them everyone's being encouraged to go with everyone if you're above average intelligence if half the kids are going to college by default you're getting down to people who are of average intelligence are still being taken away from their homes going to college somewhere else having a new experience which is not a bad thing but it is a thing and their roots are being taken away then when they're done with college they don't want to go back to their own town that like I was saying has nothing for them to do they want to go to a big city that has stuff to do and people to see so now you have all these displaced kids with a ton of debt no friends because they moved away uh like no family because their family's back in their old town what are all these people supposed to do well they drink that's what they do they drink they go on tinder they join co-ed sports leagues with just a random assortment of people that they have some things in common with but not very much they maybe make four or five good friends I'd say that's average for somebody my my age is when they look around in their local community they have four or five good friends some of them have none some of them have just the people they work with some of them are very very fortunate like me and they have 50 of them that's fantastic how do I get more people to go from zero to five or from five to 50 because every time you're becoming a friend every time you're becoming a friend with somebody they're becoming friends with you too so they get an extra friend you get an extra friend everyone wins and but it doesn't work if you don't have anything underneath it yeah yeah so wow this is that you know and of course the the group of people you are describing are actually the successful people yeah we we're not talking about the person who maybe went to community college and didn't make it so remains living at home you know this is sort of the the mythic person living in their mother's basement covered with cheeto desks you know cheeto desks playing computer games you know may also have a successful job but they're just yeah and but but to me you know this is a this is a radical transformation from what even so I graduated Calvin College in 1986 the expectation for me was by that point you're you're hopefully you know ideally you found a mate or at least are working hard on that and within the next five years you will you will find a mate get married begin to settle into a career purchase a home you know begin having children that that is a wholly different thing than you are describing pretty much and and what's what what what's interesting to me about that is that obviously if in the narrative that I lived you start to do those things in your 20s then by your 50s where I'm at well then you the kids have grown they've gone to school they're going to college or have gone to college and and so in a sense there's kind of a generational handoff yeah and that's inherently meaningful there's no way around it when you have your own kids your life has value like meaning yeah maybe you don't feel it you know like there's certainly people that have kids and still get depressed or something but they're wrong I mean they have children like there's something important happening there where the rest of us we're we're making enough money we're paying our rent we're putting a little bit into a retirement account that we don't think is going to be there we're going out drinking we're trying to hook up on tinder or hooking up on tinder each of which is equally miserable I mean a lot of people are entering into very successful relationships a lot of people are getting married a lot of people are having children the percentage of people who aren't doing any of those things we know it's growing we know it's growing and we know that's a disaster it's a disaster for the culture it's a disaster for the country it's a disaster for each individual person who lives a life that's so much more empty than it could have been yeah the video games will be there when we're older and the video games will be better when we're older yeah the netflix will be better when we're older the hbo will like we'll have 40 years of super high quality entertainment but you only get to be young once yeah you only get to find you only get to find somebody who you want to have that all other family structures aside you want it you want you only get to meet that person and have children with them and grow old with them once and if you miss that opportunity it's devastating it's devastating and it's sad and I'm I'm 32 my family ages well so I've got a little bit of time but I don't have the all the time in the world yeah so it's it's something that I worry about yeah well and it you know one of the things that strikes me as a as a pastor is that in many ways churches churches geared up and an institution up for example Calvin College for the Christian Reformed Church was in a sense the Christian Reformed mating ground my grandparents met in Christian school my parents met at college I met my wife at college these institutions and norms you know you had rules pertaining to sexual behavior all of this was designed in a sense to yield the type of life transitions that would continue to facilitate this handoff from generation to generation that included a family structure and all of that what's happened is that these you know not only have these these institutions have pretty much failed been disrupted and many of even those who were raised in church basically have you know abandoned them for what's happened in the general population which is a lot worse yeah and you see you see how hard I'm laughing but there's two groups of people have been who have been able to avoid that fate one of those is the expressly extremely religious Mormons I talk about Mormons a lot in the group I'm not Mormon I have an affinity for them because they seem to be doing the culture thing very well for all of their other flaws yeah but Mormons are doing like very very conservative religious groups do that well the other group of people that do that well is second-generation or second or more so legacy people who go to elite institutions for college so if you look at people whose parents made a lot of money whose parents went to these important schools the ivy leagues the big names the flagship state schools and then their kids also went to those schools those people for some reason I'm not saying it's a conspiracy but it's a conspiracy but those people their children are finding mates in college and getting married in college and then those people are linked to somebody who not only has a very similar family structure do they do because they are legacy second or third or more generations of high achieving people and they're linked to another high achieving person that's right and and actually in terms of a lot of the reading I've been doing on marriage for the last 10 years you know the trend lines are two groups are going to wed those with a lot of money because the economics then you know the economic legal apparatus says well if you're living with someone you're just an idiot and the highly religious yeah it's those two groups and there's been in in the country marriage among the working class and the poor have simply cratered yep and now increasingly the middle class that in past generations there was enough there was enough well and then the working class and the poor even though they're not getting married they're still having children the middle class now is not getting married and not having children right there's devastating effects to not being married when you're having children I'm not underscoring those at all but the the effects on people who do neither I worry I worry that you're we're going to end up with a large over-educated lower upper upper middle class of people with nothing in their lives and that's not a good recipe for anything positive so you know that's invest in health care in nursing homes because there's not going to be and and psych meds and therapists yeah because that's I mean no I agree that's that's whoever's producing the medication that is technically not heroin but is just heroin no that's that's a you know and again I've I didn't have much of a window into that reality before the meetup started and listening to so so James and I you know are are married in the group you know we're kind of James is about 10 years younger than I am James and I are sort of the married guys but men most of the group is either single never married or divorced and this you know I I agree with you and one of the things I've really learned is this this is a social crisis that it's again one of these social crises that is sort of a slow moving thing it's in fact so slow that it's almost imperceptible when it's when it's among the poor in the working class who are in fact continuing to have children um those crises tend to be more obvious because children growing up in that sort of chaos the culture then looks to things like schools to try to remediate that those difficulties well and what and what have we just been talking about too we've been talking about culture and we've been talking about how certain cultures have avoiding have avoided this but what is American culture especially 20th and 21st century American culture if it's not the American middle class engine that powers everything right and just what what happens next do we turn into a country like Brazil where the disparities even greater than we can imagine here probably where the racial disparities and the racial politics are even worse than they are here again I don't know everything about Brazil so I'm sure there's exceptions to this but in general that seems to be what it how it works down there there's armed guards everywhere there's like there's gated communities everywhere there's there's separation between two obvious classes of people maybe more obvious classes like more than two but at least two and that's not that wasn't the American promise that wasn't what we were promised as kids that wasn't what we were told as kids if we act like this is what we're going to get um and just moving to California which is it's supposed to be the most progressive place in the country like California is supposed to be the place that had everything figured out if it was just for all those goddamn Republicans in the middle of the country ruining everything like if it wasn't for them everything would be fine California is a solid blue state I mean it has some red aspects to it and yeah okay Republicans block some things but I I pay as much like I I pay a lot of money for my apartment I go outside there's people sleeping in the streets I go into my go into my alley there's human feces all over the place like I can't walk to my gym that's four blocks away because the bridge that it goes under has been turned into a literal toilet you can't even breathe so I drive I drive to a gym that's four blocks away to work out like in the Midwest I would have laughed at myself but here it's just how it is and so that's how it works so we live in the country or we live in the state with the most homeless population okay well maybe it's the weather well we have the most income disparity well maybe it's something else maybe it's oh there's not enough housing well we have the worst housing like we don't we don't build enough Chicago Chicago whenever there's a housing crisis skyscrapers shoot up and there's no housing crisis in a year we've had a perpetual housing crisis for the last 20 years we have the highest income disparity Berkeley spoke like the most liberal place in the entire country largest discrepancy between black and white test scores that's a big problem if if they're not able to solve the problem that all of these little tweaks and fixes are supposed to do if they're not able to put all the money that they have into it and solve the problem how is anyone else supposed to solve the problem um and it that sounds horrible but I think the answer like that sounds like an unsolvable problem but I think that's because we're trying to solve things the wrong way we're trying to solve things by making a better society that would produce better individuals but the Jordan Peterson message and the message that I've started to believe in is that we need to make better individuals and the society will take care of itself and well it's it's it is you know my history has been working with the black community and many of the issues that we are now seeing in in white communities white middle class communities are beginning to echo what we've seen generationally in the black community now obviously the black community america had a a long and yes horrible history first of slavery then of jim crow and discrimination then the move up to the northern and western cities and their own brands of ghettoization and segregation I mean that's been that's been that was the focus of my father's ministry and to a degree my ministry here too and the the black community certainly hasn't been able to solve some of the challenges that have faced them and in fact as a country instead of seeing those situations get resolved we've seen them spread into other ethnic groups often immigrants coming interestingly enough immigrants coming from places like Mexico and Latin America and many of these immigrants not having those problems and actually you know coming and becoming some of our best citizens and becoming hugely you know huge contributors to our society and other groups other groups going in the other direction yeah and they're they're coppering culturally the least successful by by the measures that people talk about publicly the least successful members of our society but why does that happen like we all know that the suicide rate is much higher in the white community than it is in the black community so they are doing something they like they're not worse off in every single measure and they're not a monolith so I spent a lot of time working in the south and that's one of the things is almost no one from California has even been to the south like they have no idea what's going on down there I've I've had a disproportionate number of bosses and supervisors and managers that that were african-american I've had a disproportionate number of bosses and managers and supervisors who are women I've had a disproportionate numbers of bosses and supervisors and managers who are lgbt so like I've seen it all I've I've I've and I'm a charismatic person I'm a person that people can talk to and I'm leaving quickly so they tell me stuff that they probably shouldn't and so like I've just experienced it I've experienced that the black community is as diverse and there's as many groups within the black community as there is in the white community and some of those groups are doing much better than other groups but we have to talk about them as a monolith that's disrespectful towards that's disrespectful towards but african-americans as a community that's disrespectful towards ourselves as people who we assume are capable of solving problems we're not going to solve a problem if we are prejudice against people and identify things as single groups when we should be splitting them out even further to identify things that are good like modes of being that are correct and modes of being that are incorrect or counterproductive to a certain goal however you want to say it because again no I'm fully on board with the idea that no person is like an incorrect person that kind of I don't know just have to I have to hedge that I feel like for some reason because I feel like was coming off harsh but everyone wants to improve everyone else's life generally and so why are we why are we doing it so poorly well and I think you're I mean your story in itself I mean you could see before your sabbatical you could see oh I you know you're you're you're a you had a decent education you've had terrific career experiences you're young you're aging well you're I mean all of these things but you had in a sense pause and say oh I need to address things in my life and and it's it's that it's that rather mysterious from the inside motivation and impetus that is you know is is it's not the only thing and obviously you know from all the videos I do about philosophy and everything it's a rather mysterious thing but that it's also an essential thing in terms of people deciding okay it's time for me to well I need to take care of my body I need that means eating right that means having discipline I need some discipline with respect to this gets into a lot of Christian stuff with respect to my desires I can be destroyed by my desires and we're we're now as a function of our success this hasn't been true of many many many probably most generations and most of the people have ever lived as a function of our success and a function of our context we can destroy ourselves fairly quickly and destroy our legacy by virtue of our desires running amok and so suddenly we have to and our deference to them so like we didn't just end up here all of all of the people that I'm talking about that have are having trouble including myself had parents a lot of us had very good parents but something happened culturally it got too easy my parents didn't really worry about me not being able to find a job they didn't really worry about me not being particularly motivated because I was passing all the tests I was I was getting through all of the hurdles because the hurdles got so easy but when they were younger they saw oh if you get a high school education you'll get a job if you get a college education you'll get a good job if you get either you'll get a house that's how it worked it was so easy like it it worked so well that we lost track of the fact that it doesn't work anymore and if I copied the way my dad did things my dad does like my family does very well for themselves they're very comfortable they take care of my sister who lives at home like my sister has special needs she lives at home but they're the three of them are doing fantastic like they're set when I have kids it's going to be a whole other story my income stream is going to be all over the place I'll have years where I make quadruple what I'm going to make and then I'll make nothing for three years I like I that's going to be difficult to figure out a house is going to be a lot harder for me to afford it's going to be a lot harder to keep once I afford it because I'll be asked to move around I can work I can work online anywhere but I'm going to be asked to move so that I can be somewhere in person is that good is that bad I don't know but like it's it's just it's a it's a wild set of it's a wild set of things and so something I've been talking about with a lot of my friends like the discussion groups that we've had and then this these are more younger people or more and for the record I'm 32 so like about 30 that's that's about 30 that's that's probably about the average age of people that are coming to to the discussion groups I host we've talked about it as as taking the crown essentially is our grandparents fought so hard like in the war in the great depression they got through all of these hard things even though the technology at the time maybe didn't call for those things like they didn't need to be a great depression there didn't need to be a war but it happened they fought through it they set up everything so that it would quote never happen again and then it got too easy and that's not to say that no that people didn't work hard they did but it the tracks got too set the struggle didn't feel immediate enough people weren't scared so they didn't set things up to keep going so now we have a bunch of boomers who didn't take responsibility for the the stewardship of the culture that builds that all these things are based on and they're not holding on to the crown and we have millennials that didn't even know that the crown exists and so now I'm telling my friends that we need to go out we need to take that we need to take that crown that mantle that leadership whatever you want to call it and we need to build stuff for ourselves we need to build new stuff that's never been built before we need to build new organizations new ways of communicating new ways of supporting each other new ways of supporting our lifestyles and it's going to be very strange and it's going to be very hard and it's going to be very disruptive but it would be exciting I guess well and and I think you're right about that that's a I've never heard you kind of put it that way before and I think that's helpful part of it is you know so I pastor a I pastor a small dying aging congregation well you know the building and I mean the building is just kind of the external thing the institution with and institutions aren't really things institutions are these you know shared mental things I mean marriage is an institution it gets expressed in behavior and it gets expressed in in symbols like rings churches are institutions and they get expressed in buildings and media collectivized agreements and so on and so forth collectivized agreement yeah that's right that's right and and so you know one of the things that we that I've seen is especially in places like California immigrant groups are investing in institutions and when you know a hundred hundred years ago or so when Dutch immigrants came to America they you know these people made far less money than we do and and they they built churches and they built schools and they they had this vision of building and so then the following generations were blessed by those institutions but the the amount of disruption and you know like you described the you know people moving all over I live across the continent from my mother and my sister I mean there's been so much change and dislocation that I think you're right and that we we don't even know quite what we need to build and you know for me the you know on one hand I've got this church and I remember I don't remember if it was you or somebody else at the meetup asked me one day well what what happens when we have more people coming to the meetup than you have coming to church and I thought yeah that's a really good question and I'm not sure what it means what happens when the meetup group starts out donating the people that go to the church yeah um you know and and so you know that all of these questions are out there and I mean we're I mean the meetup is a year and a half old and and we're still trying to figure out what it is and what we're doing and and what kinds of practices and institutions within it yeah to create so that you know so no it's it's a it's a big deal we should probably wrap this up any any well I just on the note of the church I think um I think both the church and the group have been very lucky that it is a Jordan Peterson based group because I think everyone within the Jordan Peterson group is incredibly respectful of the church and we want to help in any way we can and we want to support the church in any way we can and the people that are in it even though we've never met most of them but they let us use their building and we're so appreciative of it like we're we're gonna we're gonna try and do whatever well I won't say whatever we can but we're gonna try and do whatever we can reasonably do to to help the church continue outside of that to wrap up I I don't have anything specific but well we will talk again I've got some you know I've been wanting to get Joey online for a while and and I've actually got some topics that I think we might do some conversations with we'll probably bring James back and probably other member too and because there are sometimes some things I want to talk about because I listen in the meetup and I hear ideas and it's like I can't say it like you guys say it and you guys have more authority to say it because you're living it and and so you know I but I think these I mean what you just described you know I've heard loud and clear and I've watched happen and these and and I don't see I don't see I you know right now the the culture is you know we've we've been fighting over Trump and now we've got a you know we're gonna have a democratic primary for the next you know for the next while and we've got climate change and immigration and we've got all of these things that we're fighting over but the kinds of things that that you've described to me are very important things for our society to wrestle with because these things actually threaten so much of what has made you know I lived overseas for a for a for a for a while and I when I returned from the Dominican Republic I had a much deeper appreciation for a bunch of these things that a bunch of these things that America has which are these institutions that have afforded so much of the blessings that we have and and but these institutions aren't easy to describe they're encoded in our and Jordan Peterson talks about this well they're encoded in our action we we can kind of represent them in speech but these things are above us and beyond us and the only thing what was the term wrestle with God what was that that's a Jordan Peterson term well not a Jordan Peter it's a much older term than that but it's a one he's repeated often the wrestle is that Israel or what that's well that's when Jacob wrestles with with God when basically Jacob is has his back to the wall and God's you know all along God has been saying he's going to bless him and Jacob all along has been saying well sort of on my terms and so when when everything is on the line God shows up and say all right you want to take me on let's let's do it and they fight and and Jacob won't let him go until he blesses him and God basically touches his hip which means and cripples him which means that now the last that's right the last thing that Jacob could rely on in order to get away from Esau which would be to run away from him now Jacob can't even do that and in a sense God is saying now will you trust me and of course Esau comes and it doesn't unfold as Jacob fears and you know so so this these these things we wrestle with are beyond us but as Peterson says you know this is this is this is what Israel means to wrestle with God but let's let's take that a step further in wrestling with it we don't actually have to solve all the problems all the politicians want to talk as if we're just going to solve this problem we're going to move the money here and then the problem will be over and I'm going to be the one that saved everybody but no it's just it's just with it's the act of wrestling with the problems themselves will make us all individually stronger and better people and then we will be the kind of people where these problems just get better on their own we don't get to be the individual hero that is going to get all the acclaims and is going to get all the awards and is going to get the office and stuff like that like it's just not that's not going to be how we solve the problems that are coming we're going to be we're going to solve the problems that are coming by being honest with them by wrestling with them and by more Jordan Peterson terminology like confronting them forthrightly and with courage yeah and like and also individually and together I mean it's it's both and because we can I mean that's that's the that's the complex dance of of this which is you can you know you can do all kinds of things to let's say out compete the crowd but that doesn't rescue the society from the two-tiered I lived in the Dominican Republic tiny little overclass and huge underclass where you have to have guards everywhere because I mean this is this is not what we want as a country it's not what anyone wants it's not even really what the overclass wants no no not at all and and America has had has had well and and yeah it's complicated to talk about but this is yeah anyway I was I was the other point of that story was I was being a coward about this you've been asking me to come on to this to this show like for over a year you've been asking me and I've been saying no and and it's it's it's literally because I was being cowardly I was worried something might go wrong something might I might say something that puts me in jeopardy in the future and I've I've had some things happen to me recently that we've discussed I'm not going to discuss them on the podcast but I've decided I'm not going to be a coward anymore and I'm going to confront these things and so Paul I will wrestle with these problems with you I'll wrestle with these problems with whoever wants to tap in with us and and we'll see where it takes us and we'll just I guess trust Excellent excellent well thank you Joey this this has been great I will send this to you and I assume I know you want me to share and I will and and and I look forward to you know I look forward to some more conversations like I said I've got some ideas in my head and you'll be getting some emails from me about some other conversations because this this and we don't even have a name for it it's it's the problem of the generational handoff this is a big deal and and I think it's something we need to talk about so yep anyway thank you Joey I'm going to stop recording what's that thank you thank you I'll stop recording so just hang on
