 Hi this is Paul. I saw this video with Adam and Justin Brierley. Justin Brierley is an English radio producer, commentator, host who has been doing a wonderful show that I've actually been listening to for many years now called Unbelievable and he's had many many Christians, atheists, skeptics, people from different religions and he interviews them and they get to stake their case. I've always enjoyed the show. The most annoying thing about the show though is it was a radio show that said these frequent commercial breaks which always annoyed me and YouTube has just been a wonderful thing because things go on and on and Justin's been doing more interviews. He had a Jordan Peterson episode last year. He's got Brett Weinstein talking with Alistair McGrath who's a scholar I very much appreciate and so Adam had him on his show and it's been sort of interesting. You know Adam started out with Think Club doing a lot of Jordan Peterson clips and YouTube sort of changed their policies and so Adam's been doing a lot more conversations and debate type things although Adam debates, I'm gonna be on his show next week and Adam debates, it might be this week by the time I post this, Adam debates are good conversations. Adam really tries hard to keep the conversation productive and Adam is an atheist. He's not an anti-theist and so he you're just in a Rodney King-esque way he wants us all to get along but I was watching this conversation they did with Justin and Justin said something that I thought I I want to I want to talk about this because I think a lot of people listening to me and listening to this conversation would get a little bit lost by what Justin has to say here so see if my new software regime works. Yes well I would say I love the fact that you want to collaborate and I think we're much better off trying to find points of commonality than simply slagging each other off. So I had Jonathan Hite on my show earlier this year and he's you know he's really popular among many Christians especially evangelical Christians because I think he takes religion seriously and he takes the you know he has obviously written books more or less on the way that you know religion can have a very positive impact on psychology and morality and everything else and so he you know in that way he's he's a breath of fresh air him and Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson to the Richard Dawkins and the Sam Harris's and the Christopher Hitchens who are so anti-theistic and simply want to tear it all down. So in that way I appreciate that and I would say yes let's collaborate but again it's just at that point where ultimately we've still got a difference of opinion which is what is reality ultimately centered upon founded upon and I want you to meet that reality. For me it's a person called Jesus Christ and you know I'm not going to be I'm going to be happy if we can have some measure of agreement because we both appreciate the value of religion in the world especially Christianity but I'm not going to be satisfied fully until you Adam have come to the same. I love how Adam laughs there. It reminds me towards the end of the book of Acts Paul gives his plea to is it Festus and Festus just laughs he's like you think you can convert me right now. The same view as I have you know that I'm just talking honestly here I might I read because I really believe that Jesus Christ is the center of history the center of moral philosophy is the center of everything that's my worldview that's that's why I'm a Christian you know I'll always feel we've only got halfway there if we if we're just agreeing on you know we can kind of come up with similar moral frameworks from both different perspectives or whatever and so I'm just talking honestly you know that's that that's just the way it functions for me. Well I'm being honest with you too and I hope I don't come off as too patronizing I have I have four more questions and these are probably the most. So you know it's it's a good conversation and I think that kind of honest conversation and putting their cards on the table is really good thing you know Justin says you know what is reality ultimately centered upon founded upon I want you to meet that reality and for me it's a person called Jesus Christ. That is a biblical way of talking that is a that is a very respectable Christian phrase to use but it is I think for many people many of the people that listen to my channel I think it just doesn't make much sense because of the materialist worldview and Justin knows this Justin part of what so I was so glad to see Justin's written his own book and he's done his own video he has his own talk because he sat through how many of these conversations time and time again and so he knows all of the arguments and he hears it he hears it trotted out but but this way of framing it is so hard for I think a lot of people to understand the center of history and moral philosophy of everything I've always felt we've only got we've only got halfway there until you become this and then and then of course Adam laughs now this this language isn't totally foreign to us in fact in many ways this language is phenomenological and you can find it in this the song that immediately comes to mind I didn't know even who sang it but it's just ringing in my head from the from the 70s by Harry Nielsen I can't live if living is without you and how how many times and how many places and how many ways doesn't a romantic partner become the center of someone's world and so we access that and it's it's part of that reason that that so many Christian songs and so much Christian material sort of go there in terms of Jesus being the center of my love and all of that stuff and sometimes Christian worship and evangelical churches and contemporary music can turn into love songs for Jesus and there's there's I am I am not I'm not saying that that is a bad thing that is an appropriate thing in fact it's probably more appropriate for a Christian than someone singing a song like this but I'm not going to throw stones at this guy either what I what I mean by this point is that this is a way that we use language and it's a way we understand it but for many people for whom the primary reference for Jesus Christ they're skeptical about Christian claims of his divinity to say that he is the center of history is is a little bit simplistic a little bit misleading especially when you see what let's say the Apostle Paul does with Christ in the New Testament now I think another way into this is actually the morality conversation which is a conversation that Adam really loves to go to I've had some conversation with Adam on objective morality I'm sure it'll come up next week when I talk to Adam because I you know if you talk to me about this stuff I'm going to immediately begin to ask you to clarify and up the resolution on your terms because I have some skepticism with respect to the framework that we are approaching all of these things with and many of these words are just sort of out there and taking for granted now what we're seeing is that they're out there and taken for granted on the on the skeptic side or on the modernist side that everybody knows what objective means everybody knows what morality means I don't think so I think we are using those words as shortcuts of referral and in fact we use these words within communities and just like Justin's language of Christ is the center and I want you to meet him that's used within a community and it's perfectly legitimate within the community but outside of the community it's just going to be problematic and I think a way into this is to in fact listen to this good bit of the conversation that happens towards the end where Adam really starts to get into the morality question so you've talked in previous conversations about morality being arbitrary this comes up quite often when you're making a case for the theistic worldview can my question is can an arbitrary morality survive in the real world and if it can't isn't morality by necessity objective well depend I mean so it arbitrary so what I would mean if I was saying that that morality might look arbitrary is if as I say if evolution in one culture develops a you know a misogynistic view of women if that's the direction that culture goes and in another culture it develops a view that men and women are equal if all that we got to go on is is what evolution happens to hand us you know as our moral framework then it looks pretty arbitrary as arbitrary as whether we developed five fingers or six physically you know there's it's going to be pretty arbitrary which now if you're saying you know in your view those inferior moralities the misogynistic societies or whatever inevitably die out through some evolutionary process and produce you know a society where people are equaled and valued and so on then then obviously it's not arbitrary in that sense you know there's there's a way in which if morality always take if evolution always produces these optimal outcomes then then no it's not arbitrary but I would say it's only firstly I don't fully buy that story that evolution has this always produces these optimal outcomes and secondly you still have to judge what counts as an optimal outcome you know the why is the flourishing of all sentient life the optimal outcome for Sam Harris or why do some people place the emphasis on humans in particular why is that the optimal outcome that humans flourish in culture you know another you know a Peter Singer would say well you're being very speciesist if you're going to put all of the emphasis on humans what about all the other sentient creatures out there so there are lots of different standards you know that we might choose as as our kind of you know that we want to be the optimal point and the point for me is that if there is some standard out there it transcends all of these biological and evolutionary categories we've got to look for where this what this standard is and if we think we found it it leads on to the very natural question what's it grounded in if it's not the I mean we're circling back obviously to where we bag began here but that that would be my view is it's it's it doesn't feel to me like you can just get your your optimal sort of you've still got to that's a philosophical kind of decision you make and when whether evolution brings that about well it may or it may not you know sometimes we might have to act against our evolutionary instincts actually to to actually act in a moral way in the end well I think sometimes you do definitely have to have to do that an example that I sometimes use is and you're you're exactly right the what the what the goal is what the yardstick is is is paramount if you're designing a moral system to to produce some kind of outcome you know that whatever that outcome is is going to affect how you design the moral system if you if you're let's just say you're designing an airplane okay there are a lot of different ways that you can design an airplane but if you're designing an airplane for speed or designing an airplane for you know efficiency in trafficking people you would design those airplanes completely differently but those those different goals speed versus efficiency are are in the end there are there their objective there they are objective they would make the actual design features an objective yeah absolutely and that that I think is the way in which Sam Harris gets to objective morality because he says here's the goal you know some kind of flourishing of human creatures and so on and and then you you can objectively tell that if you do this and if you do the other that you're progressing towards that just like you know if your objective is to make the fastest airplane then you can objectively create the best conditions for that airplane to fly fast but of course that's the whole point that's that's that's the glaring sort of thing in Sam Harris's whole philosophy is that he's chosen he's made a kind of he's article of faith in the whole thing is this idea of human flourishing and and and the whole point is but where did you get that principle from and and I would say exactly as you've you've said once you've got an objective fast airplane an efficient airplane whatever then of course you can measure things and I've no problem with that you know science can be really helpful in measuring things but the point is we have that objective is going to be something that lies outside the scope of science it's it's going to be something we philosophically have decided is the right way of going about things so so yeah I mean it's it's like if it's a bit like a game of chess sometimes atheists tell me morality is just like a game of chess there are good moves there are bad moves and we don't need to appeal to a supernatural being to know that it's just it's just obvious and the point is yeah there are for the objective of that game which is to you know capture the the king or whatever but you've still got but they're only good and bad insofar as they relate to an objective okay and in morality you you have to establish that objective before you can start to talk about things being good or bad in the first place so until we get that kind of a you know any you know if we decide that you know the best kind of morality is for white Aryan individuals to rule the world that's our objective they're going to be objectively good ways to get to the outcome and Hitler probably was on to some of them you know but if we've decided on a very different objective there's going to be another whole set of objective ways in which we can get to that outcome and and so for me it all still boils down to something that that that sits outside of of about particular system because we have to decide in advance what what's going to be the objective do do you at fundamentally accept the that we want to maximize human well-being it seems like Christianity was designed to maximize human well-being in the sense of yes but but it might not be the same conception of well-being that a Sam Harris or because again some people think that well-being is essentially having the maximum amount of pleasure let's say the maximum amount of freedom or whatever it might be to do what we want that might be their conception of what human well-being ultimately looks like but Christianity may say actually there's there's a different conception of human well-being and actually it turns out that actually some things actually being limited so for instance your sexual freedom or the you know other other elements of your life there may actually serving others doing things that are actually in some ways not immediately obviously beneficial to you may actually be something that God wants to create in your life in a way that molds you and shapes you into a better type of human into a person who is more in a deeper way a more fully flourishing human and from that point of view I'd say there's there's a sense in which you want to establish what this well-being is to start with and Christianity I think is a is the ultimate way to achieve well-being because I believe at the center of it as I said before there's there's this person Jesus Christ who offers this himself and that for me is is the ultimate path to to true human well-being and flourishing but obviously that's going to look very different to Sam Harris's definition of human flourishing or whatever it might be yeah I so this has been a fascinating talk and I so again I think Justin ended that with with almost the same thing that he had said earlier but in the context of the conversation I think it was very helpful to see exactly how this works and I love this meme I think I think Eric from the discord server made it up you established a value hierarchy without simultaneously creating it you established a value without simultaneously creating a hierarchy please tell me more I love the little Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka face and and so what what happens here is that your your goal that which is at the top of the hierarchy organizes the rest of the elements the top value would not only govern but it will limit and in you know listening to this conversation again I think about John Vervecky as he illuminates what a problem is you know problems always come with constraints and so so you have your objective and I think Adam had a great example there with the airplane you have your objective you want to build an airplane that goes fast or you want to build an airplane that carries the maximum number of passengers for a minimum amount of fuel all of those constraints are going to actually give shape to the morality but there has to be a goal for that morality and as I argue with the the challenge video from from Jeff that I just finished making right before this one there's a so there's a constraint there's a value hierarchy and and what's so helpful is if you basically have something at the top of your hierarchy which is which is incorruptible now now again in all fairness Platonism attempts to do this because your forms are incorruptible but but Christ then becomes a very interesting orientation for a community the partly because the the dynamics of personhood that we've been exploring in other contexts and in other videos if I have all these little sub personalities within me and what it means to become a fully formed human being means that these all these little sub personalities all these different elements the unions will talk about my shadow all of this stud suddenly now becomes well formed within me that I become a coherent person well in terms of Christ being the center of my world also becomes helps me become a coherent person just like with the love song let's say so this your beloved is is what your life is well everything in your life is going to orient towards that beloved and not losing that beloved so therefore if something happens to the beloved if she rejects you if she betrays you if she dies even if she just annoys you now suddenly everything else in your life is going to be is going to is going to get disrupted and disorganized and so this language about Christ being the center it has to be understood within these hierarchies and again Jonathan Peugeot does such a wonderful job in terms of talking about some of these things but but they all form around it one of the things that that I often say with respect to a lot of people point to bounded sent and centered set bounded set and centered set actually are always in dynamic relationship with one another the center creates the boundaries and when the center moves the boundaries readjust and so bounded and centered are actually two ways that look ways of looking at one system and the top value aligns all of the other values and this is one of the ongoing difficulty secularism actually has because it has a very difficult time with ultimates if you're if the center of your moral hierarchy if the center of your universe is here within the age of decay let's say if the beloved is the center of your universe or if being a moral person is the center of your universe while your your shadow is going to become a very big problem because your shadow is always threatening this image of your moral self and that's why that which orients your universe in a sense has to be outside of the weather of the age of decay so that it can properly orient you and and again other systems do this such as Platonism which in a sense sets the forms above things so that actually everything down below is much more durable because unlike let's say making your beloved the center of your world something happens to your beloved well then you know perhaps they die well what does the rest of your life look like well then you'd what long and pine and and maybe you die yourself now now one of the things that that Adam points out is and this is true also of Jordan Peterson system they try to make survival be the center of the center of the system that which pursues survival but one difficulty that you have with that is again if you go back and look at the metaphysical club the variable was in fact finchness for Darwin finchness the categorical was the variable and again I I highly recommend John Verbeckis course and all of this because when he walks through these things you begin to get a sense of how complicated this really is because and John's concept of relevance realization is really helpful because it's like okay so what's important is survival survival of what if you have well survival of my identity well then you're putting your identity at the top of the hierarchy that's an awfully unstable thing especially given the fact that we grow old we see things differently we learn different things you don't want to be too rigid in fact you have a very dynamical system and so survival itself really doesn't make much sense as something again at the top of your system it will split the world and all of those issues that for Vickie talks about in terms of problems in terms of relevance realizations in terms of identity of something they all come to bear and it's for that reason that Justin's language that he begins with that that Christ is the center it sounds really difficult to understand but if you if you take your time and unpack it a bit and understand that we're not just talking about a beloved but we're talking about a being who is God then your whole system can be oriented with that and it's very difficult I think in a secular system to be able to orient these things without something above
