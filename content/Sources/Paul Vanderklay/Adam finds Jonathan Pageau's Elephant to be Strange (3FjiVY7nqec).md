 Hi, this is Paul. Jonathan Peugeot has been on something of a tear with his conversations lately. His conversation with Steven Woodford I thought was really important. And then much to my delight and surprise, here he and Adam Friended had hooked up for a significant conversation which I thought was helpful and informative. I've been noticing people on Peugeot's channel urging him on to have more conversations with, I'd say these are people in the IDW space who are, so in some ways Rationality Rules was sort of a chief YouTube critic and debunker of Jordan Peterson and he rode that horse harder and longer than just about anybody else. And Adam is sort of an anti-antitheist and I've had a number of conversations with Adam, Esther has, others have, and Adam's a fun guy to talk to. I've really been wanting to get Adam in a meetup whenever I'm back down in Southern California. I think that's going to happen one of these days. But Adam's an interesting guy because he identifies as an atheist but he's often taking on, I mean he's been trolling Steven Woodford for quite a while. He and Sitch on their Sunday afternoon live streams and I mean Adam's just a really playful guy. He likes to have fun. But during the Jordan Peterson wave, Adam had one of the most important clip channels and sort of morphed into a commentary channel and Adam was really an important figure during the rise of Jordan Peterson in terms of getting Peterson's stuff out there. Often when something before the crash as it were, before the crashing of the wave, Adam and I would sort of be in a race to who could be the first to get the newest Jordan Peterson tidbit out and Adam would work fast. So he's been following this conversation a long time and what's important to remember about Adam is Adam like many of us, you know, Jonathan Haidt was sort of proto IDW. Jonathan Haidt really set the table for what would come and Adam is big on Haidt and he's big on sociology and Durkheim and that's his perspective on religion and Christianity. He sees Christianity as super helpful and as important for setting up the western world and as an incredibly powerful and beneficial religion but Adam sort of stands outside of it. And so what's been interesting is that a year or two ago, and I talked to a number of these individuals so I know it annoys some of you when I keep bringing up that I'm a Protestant but I don't bring that up in a church tribal way here. I bring it up in much more of a sociological way because Protestantism someone just posted a comment on my video, a quote from Jung from his book on Job. Protestants since the Protestant Reformation in many ways were the, they were the liberals. They were the ones who brought science to the fore. Now in American culture the main line is pretty much ghosted because if the evangelicals can be the Republican party at prayer the Democrats are sometimes, at least white Democrats are sometimes the Democratic party at good thoughts and energy increasingly. That's a little unfair to many in the main line but those of you in the main line who continue to really try to hold on to historic Christianity can understand some of that too. So now Jonathan these recent conversations I think say a lot about Jonathan's rise. I mean when I first got into YouTube I had, I was starting from the Freddie and Paul show and had a couple of dozen subs and Jonathan Peugeot had about 2,000 and then he jumped up to 4,000 and when I was still in the hundreds and you know he's got a sub count of about 88,000 which is significant and his influence has gone, I mean he's been a tremendously powerful evangelist as it were for the Orthodox movement in America and I will call it a movement because I think dispersed among the various different liturgical rights elements of Roman Catholic and the Roman Catholic Church and orthodoxy, I mean Jonathan's really been a gateway drug, sort of the bridge from Jordan Peterson into the Orthodox or many of the sacramental churches and even some Protestant churches but he's got enough of a following now and he's strange enough. He's an icon carver and so that for Americans is way out there. He's not a Protestant minister like I am and so he does art and he has his t-shirts and he has his cool art and he's all that going and so he's a little strange for a lot of people in the Christian atheist space partly because we're used to seeing Protestants in this arena and maybe some Roman Catholics like Bishop Baron but Bishop Baron has this persona of being genteel and smooth and erudite and learned, not like Jesse Peterson or William Lane Craig. I mean the Protestants, they're just such a broad bunch in the Christian in many ways and Peugeot sort of comes into this space and he kind of confuses people I think and as I've said before it takes a while to understand what he's doing. You see his movie interpretations and they're very impressive but then when he starts to talk about basically how he fit his world together and my first conversation with Jonathan I sort of pestered him on some of this. I didn't know him well enough or really know his stuff well enough to maybe dig into some of the ways that I would dig into it today but Jonathan basically grew up in a Protestant household in a very Quebec, a very French Canadian context so you've got some heavy Roman Catholic influence there but a certain kind of Roman Catholicism and of course he had his own journey, he was a foreign missionary for a while and in many ways became Orthodox through his art and again Nathan Jacobs who I've had on the channel became Orthodox sort of through his philosophy even through my alma mater Calvin Theological Seminary in Trinidad and I think that's a very interesting example of how he was able to become a seminary interestingly enough. So Peugeot has enough of a following, he's strange enough and he's got enough credibility in terms of interest that I'm not surprised to see more people wanting to talk to him and not just in the sense of they're a fan and they want to, you know they're a fan and they want to talk to him, that's sort of a normal thing on YouTube but what's making you tick because you've got the movie interpretations, you've got the cultural interpretations, you've got the icons, the art going so that's all kind of cool and then there's the Christianity stuff and what was clear from the rationality rules conversation is that people don't peg him too quickly for one of these literal realistic conservative Christians like you might find in other places or maybe some people might see me as and then suddenly they're a little bit surprised how just how I tell people that you know Jonathan Peugeot is in some ways so conservative he sort of comes out the other end for people. Do you really believe in, I mean even my second conversation with Jonathan where we got into angels and demons, you know what's with, it took me a while to sort of figure out the kinds of things he was talking about and sort of like Jordan Peterson kind of sneakily colonized Stephen Woodford, you know after listening to enough Jonathan Peugeot certain of his ideas sort of came together with some of my C.S. Lewis ideas from the book Miracles and really turned some things in my head with respect to what spirituality and spirit is and really began to connect some of those elements for me and you can find that in my conversations about school spirit and some of these kinds of things and so I'm deeply indebted to Jonathan Peugeot for a lot of what has really interested me and engaged me over the last couple of years. Now so he's talking to Adam and I've spoken with Adam a number of times and I really love Adam and but as often happens with conversations, same with the rationality rules conversation, except Adam has a lot less to lose than Stephen Woodford. Woodford much more went out on a limb in his conversation with Jonathan Peugeot than Adam did because Adam's kind of postured himself as an anti-anti-theist and he's trolled Stephen Woodford and he's you know he's had his fun with that. That's just how Adam rolls and Adam's Adam control and he can make fun but it's all said and done. There's you know Adam's an awfully sweet guy and he's not out there for blood. He's in many ways doing similar things to what I do sometimes with some of my more snarky or trolling content. Trying to illuminate some of my thoughts and my thoughts on the subject of the trying to illuminate some of these things in an interesting and engaging way and the thing about Adam is that he can dish it out but he can also take it and you'll see that on the Adam and Stitch live streams and Stitch, Stitch not Stitch, Stitch PSA Stitch. You know Adam can also take it. He can laugh at himself and that's part of the reason that Adam's such a good conversation partner but Adam is very much speaking from and I don't know how much Adam's stuff Jonathan had listened to but I've listened to a lot of Adam's stuff so I and I've spoken a couple a few times and so I pretty much kind of know where he's coming from for with a lot of this stuff and so nothing in this conversation surprised me but probably what I was most excited about in this conversation were again some of the ways that that Jonathan is is having to try to elucidate his framing in a way that people like Adam and Stephen Woodford will understand. Now today I just had a conversation with Guy Sengstock and he said that he was going to talk to Jonathan. I thought wow Jonathan's practically on tour. I think this I'm ecstatic about this. I think this is terrific because I think now Guy Sengstock is a big Heidegger fan so in that sense and Guy Sengstock is a consummate conversationalist. I mean Guy developed that circling protocol and so talking to Guy is a very easy thing to do. He's got tremendous conversational skills so it'll be interesting to see where that comes out and it but I think in some ways some of these more not really adversarial but some of these some of these contrastive conversation that Jonathan is having with with Adam and with rationality rules. I see this as really helpful because I think it's it's showing in many ways it's displacing it's displacing the kind of positioning that Christianity has been placed in by the broader secular frame. I was just this afternoon reading some Justin Martyr and thinking about how so if you look at Justin Martyr probably came from the area of Samaria and but very deeply formed as a Greek and the Hellenistic world and when he becomes a Christian what he what there is for him is via the various philosophies around the Stoicism the you know the Pythagoreans all of these all of these schools of philosophy around what many of these church fathers are able to do are take some of the commonalities Platonism Neoplatonism take some of these commonalities and map Christianity on them and Christianity is a very subversive religion. People sort of take it in because they see what it can do and Jesus very quickly starts to own them so I did a conversation today that I already posted with Nick and I'm just watching this happen. You know I you're not going to start playing with Jordan Peterson and very very deeply without Jordan sort of taking up residence in you and and it seems Jesus sneaking in through on his own and you know Jesus is very sneaky that way too but but part of what we're struggling with is that in talking to Adam or talking to rationality rules there's the sort of the sort of default there's sort of the default materialism that is the public conversation frame in our culture. Okay that's that's the default position and Christians either have to break from it if you go back a couple of weeks and look at the bridges of meaning conversation where we did the panel discussion about Pentecostalism and miracles and that led to the very interesting connection between the all these former Pentecostals now kind of moving to the Orthodox because the symbolism and the and the sort of miraculous of this present darkness. What's the name of the author that becomes a bridge and able to connect them and that was really one of the takeaways from that panel discussion that we had on the bridges of meaning Discord server. How how these things are connecting because Christianity I was we're going we're cutting the cord at home in terms of television and so I'm playing around with the over the air stuff and stumbled onto the Andy Griffith show and that just brings you back into the the pre 9 11 the pre 9 11 pre 9 11 compact where science provided the the ideation for the material below but Christianity provided the ethics or at least the form of ethics that was dominant in in American culture at that time and you know I've been over that history quite a bit on my channel where you know science sort of oh we're going to get all of our science stuff from science and we'll get all of our moral ethical stuff from Christianity and of course with the rise of the new atheists it's like no Christianity is not Christians are not sort of prudish or elitish in terms of their morality they're anti moral and and that's part of the reason why the sexual revolution these are these are going to keep coming up in these conversations because these are the friction points between an implicit worldview which in the case of many in the case of many who are not participating in religion are are not is simply not terribly explored versus Christians like Jonathan Peugeot who very much had to build his own and sought you know some very ancient resources in the church fathers so he's he keeps bumping into materialists and so what Jonathan is doing is really hard for materialists to understand because as Jonathan says here in the in the in the clip I'm about to play Jonathan is reframing everything so let's see let's pull it up and let's let's start it here I gotta get my sound properly going Christianity and the beginning it's just a normal cycle of things well I view Christianity and and different religions as these ethical systems that are uniting people and and allowing people to cooperate with one another that's the way that I see these ethical systems so okay so so that's in many ways one of the one of the hacks that happened in terms of modernity how to not fully displace Christianity so becomes an ethical system well what does that mean well it means it becomes an ethical system becomes sort of an ethical overlay to science and this is where you get sort of these these separate magisteria and where the scientific image looks at science and the manifest image is going to look through Christian values and as Tom Holland I think explored deeply and persuasively Christianity completely colonizes the ethical system and this value of love this value of regard for the weak that this value simply becomes so pervasive that even anti Christians use this value against Christianity as as René Girard noted so for Adam to see Christianity as an ethical system fits completely with the modernist compromise where Christianity is displaced from material considerations but is allowed to reign in terms of a value system with respect basically to to humanism and so that's how Adam sees it well that's because that's the way it's been seen but now Peugeot is going to lean into well what does he think what if we could say that it's not an ethical one another that that's the way that I see these ethical systems so so what if we could say that it's not an ethical system I don't think Christianity and I don't think religions are ethical systems I think that that's one of the problems which makes it hard for people to understand religion because if you think that they're really if they're an ethical system then you don't understand why you have to build an Ark of the Covenant and have two angels with their wings touching and you don't understand why you need to to have you know veils around holy places all of this stuff makes no sense if it's just an ethical system you know the sound on their video should be a little bit louder from here on and trying to get the sound levels right it's perpetual problem with my videos going way back but but notice notice what Jonathan said so the the the temple the veils all of the you know the not just the liturgy the pageantry the vestments if Christianity is an ethical system well none of that makes any difference well now what we're barking what we're we're barking on I'm keepin' it barking at the door metaphors no what we're not the door we're knocking on here is the Wittenberg door because in many ways this was a deep part of the transition that happens in the Protestant Reformation where Christianity very gets very much gets and turned into an ethical system and of course later on as the Enlightenment and the scientific scientific revolution and Darwin come down the line that's sort of the lane that's created for them and you know Protestantism had already sort of had the iconoclasm where you get rid of the vestments and you get rid of the statues and you have the plane you meet in the meeting hall and so what you're doing is you're doing stuff from your head on up and all this tactical stuff and you're doing tactile physical stuff makes no difference and and this is exactly what Peugeot is pointing to at this point that Christianity is not an ethical system because otherwise you don't understand how Christianity colonizes your architecture and your art and and all of these aspects now now even for a tradition like mine that loves to quote Abram Kuyper that there's not not there's no square inch of planet Earth that Jesus Christ doesn't stand over and claim my tradition has a problem here because well is there such a thing as Christian architecture and so Abram Kuyper went went around and so you had you know all these Christian institutions it's sort of what happened in my in my tradition but what Peugeot is noting is that With this reframing it's not just an ethical systems the ethics follow there is there are ethical understanding but it's a far more thorough going reframing and that's what Jonathan is talking about and that's why Jonathan is majoring in the symbolic because Basically via symbolism that's how the frame is moving in and colonizing the rest of life and so what he says right there is now there's another aspect to that I remain a Protestant and what And a little bit later in this conversation with Adam there's another very interesting part that I'm not going to play because I wanted to keep this short and of course it no it will not be short There's a lot going on right here and right here in this moment is where you see Jonathan asserting something that is deeply difficult for for default materialists to understand or embrace because our default worldviews are in many ways highly resistant Highly resistant and in fact necessarily so they're beneath the level of our of our direct cognitive and volitional reach we don't just change our worldview because we choose to It's far lower in the stack than Our conscious selves can really reach down and change in order to change your worldview you know this again going back to Jonathan height you have to retrain the elephant and which is what all of the stuff in Christianity and church and community does Community reshapes the elephant because the elephant moves in packs and herds and so when these two are talking at this level there is no way in the world and I'm saying this as a Christian minister There's no way in the world Jonathan can talk Adam out of his default worldview at this point he might be able to raise questions he might be able to raise suspicions but in many ways a lot of what Jonathan does in terms of his art and his symbolic stuff is gets at any roads or begins to at least show cracks in the plausibility structure of the Default materialist worldview People switch their default worldview very slowly Very slowly Rightly so but but there has to be dramatic reasons for it and if you go back to Jordan Peterson's conversation with David Nassar where we're after the after the Liberty University Convocation you see Jordan you know taking the opportunity to talk to a real live Christian minister who's who's got quite high status given the position he has at Liberty University but also a lot of credibility and he's got a lot of credibility with me at least the little that I've known and seen of him To talk about all these transformations well what does Jordan mean by transformations I did a bit number of videos on that a while ago these these conversions and what happens in a in a in a conversion often is that there is a displacing of the deep of the worldview very low in the stack now now just like where this is in our stack isn't directly accessible volitionally from us Neither is it are we terribly conscious or aware of it most of the time it's days months or years later we look back and say wow I don't believe what I used to believe In other words it's that foundational and low in the stack that we don't we don't see it directly but but that's exactly why these kinds of conversations are so difficult to do and in many ways as Eugene Peterson who was a who was a Presbyterian minister died not very long ago wrote wrote a lot of really interesting books very much a Protestant sort of on that sort of on sort of an old line an old school Protestant who hadn't You know really swung way out to the woke and one of his last things that he sort of got in trouble for was he he was asked about you know he's asked the gay question and he gave sort of an off the cuff answer which was redeemed to was which was deemed a little bit too progressive for His evangelical audience and publishers and he quickly retracted and you know it was rather sad to see a really remarkable career somewhat sullied by that moment of when Eugene Peterson was getting quite up in years but anyway Well how did I why did it get into Eugene Peterson because these things are these things are best you know Eugene Peterson riffing on I can't remember the the poet you know tell it slant You have to go in direction his he'd write these kind of storified commentaries leap over the wall on David and reverse thunder on the book of Revelation and and Eugene Peterson very much got out this idea of you don't approach these things directly because they're not accessible to us it's sort of like logging into what's going on in the world Logging into Windows and wanting to hack the kernel the Windows isn't going to let you down that low in the stack if you really want to change it you're going to have to you're going to have to address the elephant and most of the time we're talking to the rider okay so again that's setting up what we saw here and maybe I'll replay it It's actually more YouTube should be able to just back up instantly from this is one of the problems which makes it hard for people to understand religion is because if you think that they're really if they're an ethical system, then you don't understand why you have to build an Ark of the Covenant and have two angels with their wings touching and you don't understand why you need to have a religious system You don't understand why you need to have veils around holy places all of this stuff makes no sense if it's just an ethical system You know it's actually more than an ethical system it's a frame of reality it's a way to understand value and to understand not to understand but to participate in hierarchies of being Right there and that is if you want to understand Jonathan Peugeot his mission why he became Orthodox his love for the liturgy his understanding of story his understanding of identity participation there's the word again now go back to verveky and you know fancy verveky terms four ways of knowing the four P's Propositional participatory procedural perspectival participation participation is a much deeper way than what had come At least to the conscious level of Protestant confessionalism whereas I believe and I subscribe to these things now that propositional is one of the four but it's much more participatory and so suddenly You get to understand okay why the vestments why the pageantry why the the cathedral why the iconography why the your participating and you're reenacting now There's some there's some really high voltage Protestant Reformation lines running through here so I got a tiptoe a little bit carefully but I want to point them out because this is this is what's going on and this is why sort of this default materialism that is sort of inherited from the mainline Two-channel path where science for the public space think whatever you want supply your own narrative for the private space where that system is falling apart because modernity is going away and I mean that theme I've been playing for a while that's why we can understand the rise thank you Dr. Jim in Idaho That's why we understand the rise of the celebrity atheist the new atheist why the rise of Jordan Peterson why the rise of the woke church and and now in some ways as Jonathan Peugeot has said why now he can have a hearing because he's talking a he's talking about a frame transfer not simply this kind of evolutionary adaptation that has been happening In the WASP protestant world for the last couple of hundred years Okay so that so that so that these hierarchies lay themselves out and create units so it has more to do with identity than it has to do with ethics and if you go back and you listen to his conversation with Stephen Woodford and the gay thing comes up right there is the question is gay an identity or is gay a behavior is same-sex sexuality a behavior Well we've made it an identity and again you have to read some Charles Taylor if you want to take a deep dive into why did we make that an identity and then the question is it a is it actually does it actually work as an identity I was talking to Job on the discord server and he was talking about some of his transgender friends and I've noticed exactly what Job has where I have I have gay and transgender friends and I've noticed that And they approach it very differently from a lot of the young woke activists for them it's a it's a part of their life but one of the things that they've learned is what once it was no longer front and central to their salience hierarchy in terms of a bunch of other behavioral and procedural and and cultural changes It sort of settled down into probably the way that opposite sex attraction is for many of us who have been living with that a long time in our lives and and identity identity gets into the whole agent arena relationship and identity functions within an arena and now we are all in the same place And now we are all embedded within multiple arenas at at the same time I am a Christian with regard to one arena I am a father with regard to another arena I am a minister with regard to another arena I am a citizen with regard to another arena so you have all of these these arenas and hopefully they they they all fit together And what Jonathan is very much doing is trying to is trying to articulate a different frame and talking about why a frame and as he says I don't know if he says it right now but Christianity fits in this frame now again if you read the Church Fathers you read Justin Martyr you read almost anyone from from the ancient world you will see a similar thing You know St. Augustine becomes a Christian after being a Manichaean after getting into Neoplatonism because Christianity seems to seems to fit the best and make the most sense but he's he's within this other frame and and he understands others within this frame and so that's that's what's happening and so now Peugeot is in many ways Bringing in sort of a an attempt to take something like these old frames and say these frames are still here now C.S. Lewis was was working on similar things again if you read his book The Discarded Image you see him walking through the ancient frames and talking about how they how they functioned and and seeing how Christianity You know over a long time fit into that now that that's very much that's very much what happened with the Church Fathers is they they figured out how Christianity fit into that frame now it raises a very interesting question between in terms of the relationship between Jerusalem and Athens and I won't go there but these are deep long old conversations but again so what we see in in this in these little conversations between Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jesus and Jonathan and people who who have the default materialist frame they're they're sort of you know figuring each other out but again that the riders are on top talking but the elephants are kind of bumping into each other and and you know hate to get a little too graphic but smelling each other and and and feeling each other and and well Peugeot just feels different has more to do with who you are what your place is in the world and what's your relationship with others and then downstream from that you have rules and regulations and and let's say ways of acting but in at first it's like we worship the thing that unites us we celebrate the thing that unites us just like a basketball team and again I mean read read Jonathan Heights look at Jonathan Heights talks about you go around the you go around and around you meet around the flagpole you go around the you go around the great mosque on your on your pilgrimage you you come into church and you march together and you do together it's all training of the elephant okay and so you worship or what is what is worship you you you direct yourself to to the thing you know that is at the top of or above the hierarchy itself above the hierarchy of hierarchies and you direct all of your attention to that and so then the rest of your life goes down there and how you act as a function of how the world is and now that's exactly why rationality rules will talk about well so a field with two kinds of seed or or create a fabric of two kinds of cloth or or have the women men straight go outside the camp or I mean again if you the the ethics is always downstream from the frame it's just that if you're living in a culture where your frame is not constantly exposed you're probably fairly Now many Christians in one of the videos that have sort of been gurgling inside of me for a long time is trying to make a bigger exposition of maybe the framing conversation will help me sort of have an organization to it to make it intelligible why different Christian camps behave as they do what's really the difference between someone who's Pentecostal and let's say a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a Christian who's a secessionist Baptist what's really the difference between a a plain church Calvinist and a smells and bells and cathedrals sacramentalist and why that the merging and the overlapping and the longing back and forth between some of these ends of the spectrum but if you if you understand this frame distinction and understand that that Jonathan Peugeot is is proposing a transformation that is beneath the volitional access of the people he's talking to and in many ways very strange to the default presuppositions a little later in this video Adam will talk to him about presuppositionalism and I just had to laugh and Jonathan says he didn't know anything about it so yeah it's a bunch of the Calvinists that have been harping on presuppositionalism for years because and Adam sort of laid out a philosophical presuppositionalism and also certain elements because there's different varieties and stripes of this but but this has been something that's been big in my tradition when by theological terms trying to get at this frame question and of course in many ways that the frame question came to the fore with the advent of artificial intelligence and the development of robots and the reality that you can't just slap a camera in front of a car and have the car know to stop or stay in the lane like increasingly the cars right now know the the machines have to be trained and this is where you know a lot of the the stuff that Jordan Peterson throws at Sam Harris in Vancouver one there's a there's an a priori there's an a priori structure beneath you that that you can't forget well here Jonathan is saying the reason you can't understand me is because I've got a different frame and you know people look at them like a cow looks at a new gate but that's what's happening here so in many ways the the conversation with with Adam was it went a little bit easier that just sort of because of who Adam is Adams a Adams an easy guy to talk to and I haven't talked to to Stephen Woodford so I don't know how easy he is but I'm a pretty easy guy to talk to but that is an easy guy to talk to but this this is what's happening and it's the the L these are Peugeot has become a very strange elephant and you know both he and Adam are artists and so they have that in common but they're trying to figure out Peugeot why why would he why would he be like this well it's it's because of exactly what he just laid out every time you hear I think again these conversations are really helpful for Jonathan because his rider on his elephant is learning with every increasing conversation how to articulate the conflict but again laying it out won't change the person you're talking to our processes are far slower we're we recalibrate far more slowly and we only switch systems I mean the deep systems not just as you know not just I'm a Christian I'm not a Christian yeti yeti all about this level and what Jordan Peterson said in Lafayette College is exactly right I mean that the the chattering rider I'm a Christian okay well we'll see well what do you mean by that aren't aren't aren't I aren't I what I say I identify as skeptical why because I've watched enough people why because my categorizations are different why because my framing is different what so so that's what's going on here so I hope this little this became a lot longer than I hoped it would be but that's the story of my channel
