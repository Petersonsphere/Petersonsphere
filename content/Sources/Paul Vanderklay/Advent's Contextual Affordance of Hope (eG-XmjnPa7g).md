 Hi, this is Paul and this is Rough Draft for Sunday where I run through the current status of my Sunday sermon I didn't have a rough draft last week because There was a guest preacher here at Living Stones And so I didn't write a sermon and I'm not going to have one next week because I will be on vacation So this is the third this is for the third Sunday in Advent. I thought for a long time that one of the deep and Difficult to see impacts that our present media culture has is That the screens not just the screens, but but the culture around us gives us a deceiving message and What it says is that normal life should be easy rewarding beautiful and fun and this constant submersion in screens of beautiful people and and newspaper ads and this this media this this media immersed world that we live in simply says that well what we see and now it's even worse with Facebook and Instagram and What we see on these screens. This is how life is supposed to be and somehow if if I Had a conversation with Byrne somehow if your life isn't fun You're doing it wrong and you have to go out and do it right and I think this is frankly deeply impacting marriages and people and I think in fact it's making a number of people depressed and anxious because they think well the the rather common levels of Of the opposite of easy rewarding beautiful and fun somehow means that again You're doing something wrong and it's a very distorted view of the world Netflix has recently released a movie called a marriage story. It's gotten quite a bit of attention and the story I Haven't watched it yet. My wife and I are gonna watch it actually probably this weekend but it's a story about a marriage that goes unhappily like many marriages do and the couple gets a divorce and There's a there's a scene here There's a fight scene between the couples that if you've been married this might seem eerily familiar or even maybe you've never been married And this is eerily familiar one person on Twitter said is this what everyone is raving about because everybody's been raving about this movie Is this what marriage is like because it looks just like a snippet of what my abusive ex What my abusive ex would do and everyone wonders why I don't want to get married Yeah, and I stumbled across this person on Twitter and she often speaks the The mind of the zeitgeist of many in her situation in her generation another person pointed out the a speech given by the divorce lawyer in the movie that basically says, you know, All of you all of all of us women are victims and all of you men are the problem and Go into a marriage counselor and sit there with the person and and tell the marriage counselor how it's all the other person's fault You can do that for a very very long time and get a whole lot of nowhere now in my youtube Life been talking a lot about this meaning crisis and a few a couple of months ago. I did a Debate conversation with a guy named vowsh Who's who's an online guy and He he was he's into well, basically he's into gender abolitionism And marriage and all these things should go and and we talked about this and one of the things that he said was that you know We need community and people should people should um, people should have much more community together And and that would solve a lot of this anxiety and loneliness and I think he's right about that That in fact, we do need much more community together But then I suggested to him that perhaps the reason we have so much community is our affluence and we in fact choose not to be together And in fact, few research center this week did a very interesting survey that showed that in In asian some asian and african country the majority of people lived with extended family and if you look around That map you'll see that the majority of people Lived with extended family and if you look around That map you'll see very quickly that a lot of this has very much to do with affluence Look at the u.s. In canada. We are moving away from each other And and you know, not just in terms of people in a family, but but but married couples dan savage who's a popular? Uh columnist I think in seattle does it has a column in a magazine about love and sex Has a has a youtube that I stumbled across this week where he basically says monogamy is ridiculous We're not built for it as as human beings and it's a it's an unachievable It's an unachievable goal, which basically means that we should have fairly Transactional temporary relationships with each other. We're with someone else until it doesn't work out and then we divide If we have enough money to live separately Now the church is supposed to to make this all better right well also this week rod dreer who runs a popular blog Um had a had a very interesting article which was basically just a letter from a reader Who went to a southern baptist church and basically said I have much more community with the people that I work with Instead of the people that I go to church with Isn't isn't the church supposed to be you know provide some great community? That's supposed to afford meaning and togetherness and and the reality is that no often we go to church and we just sit next To each other and and that's that's what we want from the place And in fact if you look at some of the comedy sketches by john christ Two of his is more hilarious ones are his his church hunter episode one and two it just shows us as as consumers and we come to church to hear a sermon and And now you might expect me now i'm going to you know beat down on all of you in terms of oh, we need to have better community together, but This stuff is is is more complex than that and and just having a couple more potlucks or this and that doesn't do it and So we have small groups and we have bible studies and we have all of this but Basically, we're trying to figure this stuff out And it's not perfect Now we've known this about people for a long time jean paul sartre had a very famous play called no exit in which Basically he had the line hell is other people and and that play was put on by a by the bbc and it's essentially three people are Are trapped in and in an art museum and they discover they can't get out and there's They're there with two other people and hell isn't You know whips and chains and fire and all of those hell is simply having to deal with other people C.S. Lewis makes a very interesting and similar observation in his book the great divorce We are the problem and what's interesting about c.s Lewis's great divorce is that the gray town where the where the book opens up is very much Like what we see in the wealthier affluent parts of the world where we move further and further away from each other and we try and have a technical fix for this and and you will find a lot of psychologists and people waiting in and saying well, here's here's how you can make marriage work and and peter begosian and james lindsey to to who two people who sort of made their name and in atheist circles and how to have Impossible conversations, but for most of this this is a technical fix. It's not a contextual Interaction if maybe if I can talk to people in a different way and maybe if I can engage in them in a different way We'll get along better and there's plenty of goodness that can be found here But the reality is that all technical fixes are temporary and time Which in a secular world is your enemy will run out? And we all know this now The way the advent season works is that a whole bunch of us use a thing called a lectionary and the lectionary proposes Texts and so lots of different churches all around the world are using these same texts And if you look at this week's text number of weeks ago We preached about isaiah 35 and and luke 146 to to 55 is mary's song And so I decided to pick the new testament text this year and talk about james and and the book of james is well advent is advent is really the Intervention of god in the mess that we've made of this world And and there's a first coming and a coming and a second coming a world that has painted itself into a corner And the promise of rescue from within and without because here's the thing as with c.s. Lewis's The great divorce you can take people from this world put them on a bus and bring them to the next world and guess what? Just like people do in marriages all the time. They bring their problems with them because the problems are not just outside of us They're inside of us and those are the more difficult things to address for us So the real question is how can people be saved from themselves? Now the book of james is an interesting book in the new testament because He was this is um tradition has it that the book is written by james the brother of jesus He was sometimes called james the well, here's the thing james the just or james the righteous and he was the head of the jerusalem church But a lot of people have had mixed feelings about the book of james and and some people really like it because the book of james Is a very energetic book where we are responsible to take matters into our hands and get some things fixed and deal with our sins So the book has very little tolerance for sin, but the book also has very little tolerance for revolution Taking matters into our own hands in certain ways and and it begins with with something that has really annoyed people brother and sisters Whenever you face trials of any kind consider it pure joy and you might wean to ask Well, don't you understand the meaning of the word trials? Why would you why would you even say that to someone who is suffering? Because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance And let endurance have its full effect so that it may be mature and that you may be mature and complete lacking nothing In other words, you're saying if i'm suffering I should endure it And he says that over and over and and in fact, but he's not he's not easy on anyone Let the believer who is lowly boast in being raised up and the rich and being brought low Because the rich will disappear like the flowers in the field for the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the field Its flowers fall he's quoting the psalms here and its beauty perishes and in the same way with the rich in the midst of a busy life, they will wither away and so then we wonder well Well, I thought the goal was to To to get rich so I could have the kind of life I wanted to have until you begin to realize that A lot of these things that we're suffering are in fact a direct consequence of our affluence in the west Now in chapter five we we come to the advent reading Be patient then brothers and sisters until the lord's coming See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop Patiently waiting for the autumn and the spring rains you too be patient and stand firm because the lord's coming is near Don't grumble against one another brothers and sisters or you will be judged and right there you see This duality in james that people begin to immediately like oh good He's getting hard on us and there's there's often sometimes It often happens that someone will come to me and say pastor you need to be harder on people and it's like, okay Shall we start with you? No, no, no, I wanted you to be harder on those other people Well, if you if you really like the hardness I can practice that hardness on you And if in fact I do that they don't tend to like it very much And so james seems to do that don't grumble against one another brothers and sisters or you will be judged The judge is standing at the door. Oh my Brothers and sisters as an example of patience in the face of suffering Take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord because it usually didn't turn out very well for them As you know, we counted as blessed those who have persevered You have heard of job's perseverance and have seen what the lord finally brought about Yeah, job did plenty of grumbling in the means time But the lord is full of compassion and mercy and and this is very much james's posture And what he is saying here is that we should adopt this posture And actually what this posture means is We should adopt it with what we get most frustrating about which is in fact other people Often the people we live with now As that little thing noted that you know what you do What do you do when you are out of resources? And so it's it's no wondering that most of the lot of the people in asia and africa are very poor And they live together because they can't afford to not live together And because when you grow old someone has to take care of you and they might not have social security or or Medicaid that will pay your nursing home expense. So you know what? The kids take care of you and now think that through because there's both a beautiful side to that And a difficult side to that because you're if your children are loving and generous and caring And maybe they're that way because they were you were that way in their youth. Well, maybe that's the kind of treatment You'll get in your old age But if you didn't spend much time with them, and if you were vindictive and petty Maybe your old their treatment of you in your old age will be a torture chamber. This stuff is difficult and it's very real What do you do when you are out of resources? What do you do when you are out of resources and that's where james comes in because the book is about perseverance Usually the little things we can change in our life we change But it's the big things. It's the difficult things. It's the things we can't change And james says learn patience in suffering Patience is the combination of stuck and faith Patience in fact is hard work. It's not passive. It's active. It's disciplined endurance Patience is how in fact trust in god grows Then in greek the word for patience is macro through me. Oh, which basically means something similar to the old english long suffering Patience does not mean you don't suffer patience means you endure Suffering and that's exactly what james is offering you think well well how is this helpful at? Advent because advent is supposed to be intervention and rescue and I thought my life was supposed to be beautiful And fun isn't isn't that what we're promised? You don't find that in the bible From what you get in this world because If you're only if you've only got one life to live you've got a real problem Because the time is short and so if you decide to grab the pleasure Well, that probably means you're going to be by yourself because what other people are Are complicated and they get in the way of your pleasure if you're going to eliminate the sources of pain You're probably going to eliminate the amount of community you have in your life, which all then Usually makes you lonely and anxious and miserable Will you avoid regret will you have time? Now this is where advent comes in because the son of man comes and is one of us And in many ways once he starts opening his mouth in his ministry it doesn't go well Again, i've made this point before that people say well well, you know Preachers should be able to make all of this clear and to make our lives beautiful. Well You can't imagine a better preacher than the son of god And most of the people walked away from his sermons frustrated angry or confused I don't think the problem was with jesus. I think what that illuminates is that the problem is with us But yet he comes and he doesn't just shout out messages from the clouds to us He knows our pain. He knows our temptations even our cruel unjust tortures and death and any reading of the new testament of the trial and Crucifixion of jesus demonstrates that this was something he could have avoided. In fact, that's what his disciples admonished for him And yet he didn't But then the son of man is raised to life again now again if you look at this and say well I don't believe in the resurrection Well, that's going to impact the choices of your life because you want to get all that Fun and beauty and goodness you want to get it all in now, don't you? You've got one life to live and you know what the clock is ticking at some point. You might even lose your hair The son of man will return to complete the story Now Slide needs some editing now one of the things that you might have noticed was The end of verse eight because the lord's coming is near that that opens up a whole big theological conversation That has been raging for the last couple of centuries and and I don't have the time to go into that debate here as to whether or not The new testament writers imagine imagined that jesus coming was near what we say what we see in fact is that it seems that Every generation imagines jesus coming is near But actually what this means is also that we see him And we see him soon and in that death is transformed from a deadline for a bucket list. We can't achieve To the end of a trial we must endure And and i'd say that that we recognize this at many funerals even now as As in our affluent wealthy society where we have this, you know, we have nursing homes and medical care Where we still realize that? When the day comes for many It's a relief Because their struggle is over and what the christian faith offers is a rereading of this verse How the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop waiting patiently for the autumn and spring rains And so john so james's admonition be patient stand firm Advent is celebration of the coming first and second Advent is patient longing for the next We wait in hope We wait in peace It's not ours to repay. Well, there's a lot of there's a lot of uh typos in this uh in this powerpoint Where was the one that I missed there? The sorry, this is rough draft and I do I do edit We wait in peace Not ours to repay We practice joy We borrow it from the promise we borrow it from the future This helps us understand and actually live out what james is saying We celebrate the foretaste Of what is to come
