 Hi, this is Paul. About a year ago, Algo just served this one up to me now. I didn't know that it happened and when it, when the algorithm served it up to me, I wanted to watch it right away. This is now Ayala, I think that's how you pronounce her name. She's been on Benjamin Boyce's channel. She's been on a bunch of other channels. She, she tells her story a little bit in this video. She grew up in a conservative religious, probably Christian home. She was working in a factory and she didn't find that work good at all. And so then she started into prostitution and discovered she liked it. And then she did only fans. And now I don't know what she does, but so she has been on the internet. So she does all this research. She does all these polls. I think she does polls on Twitter. Now that obviously isn't sort of scientific in terms of pollsters, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to judge that whole aspect of what she's doing. She's basically asking people about questions about sex and she's obviously got a YouTube presence. Maybe she, what does she stream on Twitch or something like that? She might do something like that anyway. So she's now got a whole career talking about sex, whereas sort of her claim to fame was she was having sex on the internet and she was an in real life prostitute. And so she's, she's generally sort of been, you know, pro sexual liberation. Let's call it that. And so when I saw her paired up and unheard does a lot of very interesting, good pairs, I really appreciate what unheard is doing. When they paired her up with Louise Perry, I thought, oh, this could be very interesting because Louise Perry, of course, has written that book, the end of the sexual revolution. And so, and Louise Perry comes at these conversations very well informed in terms of feminist ideology and all of that. So I thought this, this could be very, and it was a very interesting video. But when I saw the video right away, I've seen a number of conversations like this. And initially I always pause and say, okay, well, what's, what's really the goal here? Because usually what happens on the internet with these kinds of conversations is you have this sense of participation in an arena and you sort of have these battling principalities and spirits that are going back and forth. And the conversation is presumed to be something like, well, one side will win and then, but then, and what? Because there's no serious, there's no serious conversation to, let's say, roll back the sexual revolution. Now, some of you probably caught the live stream this morning that I jumped into. I was about ready to start recording this video and Luke started recording a video about the ritual video that I made about Jonathan Peugeot's video. And I was very curious to hear what Luke had to say. And so I jumped on there and Joseph jumped on and Chad and a whole bunch of others. And Joseph started talking about law and ritual. And that question about law really made me think about, about this video because one of the things, even though people love to have sort of traditionalist versus liberationist debate back and forth with respect to these things, I don't anticipate any new American legislation with respect to what consenting adults do together. This has, so there's sort of this level at which these conversations are happening, but in terms of the legal sense, there's easily a consensus in America that if you want to sort of ruin your life with bad sexual practice, you can do it. The country will let you. And when it comes to paying for sex or at least being paid to do sexual things, the internet has been just a massive explosion of opportunity for people now who sort of want to try their hand at this. And that's the only fans thing. Now this was on before Israel and Gaza blew up the news cycle, the Russell Brand thing was hot for a minute and Mary Harrington was on unheard with, I think this guy's name is Freddie, Mary Harrington was on unheard with him and Mary Harrington, she's speaking at the art conference in London. I'm super excited to, I hope I get a chance to shake her hand and meet her in person after I had such a wonderful conversation with her. But she said something in this conversation that I didn't forget. Stare yourself as a reactionary feminist. There is something quite unusual about the mood when discussing these kind of sexual crimes at the moment. It's at least it's unusual historically, it hasn't happened before. You might say that it has happened at a previous more religious moment. Now again, they're talking about Russell Brand and how Russell Brand was getting famous and in some ways sort of backward celebrated a few years ago in the UK. And then of course, some of these women have decided to press charges. It's in history, but what's your overall feeling about today's attitude to these kinds of sexual crimes? Very confused. But my attitude is that they are collective view is wildly dissonant. I mean, I think it appears to be more or less completely all normalized now for adolescent girls to follow the Instagram to OnlyFans pipeline, for example. And Mary, nobody has a way with words like Mary, the Instagram to OnlyFans pipeline for young girls. And she talked about normalization. Now, Grim Grizz has often talked about normalization with respect to pornography, with respect to the Friends episode with Joey. And I've noticed once, as so often happens, once somebody sort of names something, then you begin to see it. And Grim Grizz has sort of said, yeah, this normalization itself is a huge issue because what there are in society are norms and stigmas. And there's this whole matrix of social approval of either status gaining for conforming with norms or status losing for violating norms. In a sense, even though this whole status and this whole area of status and shame often sort of gets critiqued in society. Part of what Grim Grizz and I think Mary Harrington are pointing to is that these dynamics in society protect the unwary. Okay. If you think about the Book of Proverbs as sort of a handbook for young men, for ancient Israel teaching, giving them wisdom, basically cluing them into the fact that if you do these things, you'll probably succeed in life. And if you do these other things, they're very dangerous and you may in fact be in trouble. I mentioned on the live stream, I've started watching this show Lioness by Taylor Sheridan, who did the Yellowstone series. And in this episode, the daughter of the protagonist is in a car accident. And in the hospital, as she's recovering from the car accident, it's discovered that she's pregnant and she's 14. And her father comes to her and says, Now you remember that there were, I told you there were two things that could completely derail your future. One was cars, getting in to a car with a teenage driver, and the other was letting boys in your pants. And now you've broken both of these rules. And now you're going to see the consequences on the other side of it. And so what Mary Harrington is saying is that there's been a normalization in the culture. When Russell Brand gets these, gets celebrated for doing all of this shagging and everybody's sort of yuck, yuck. And now, as Mary Harrington says, that suddenly we were celebrating him a few years ago, and now we're going to throw him to the lions because of what we celebrated for him two years ago. And so anybody paying attention to the culture is going to be confused because on one hand, and I've made this point in other videos, on one hand, the ascendant narrative of the culture is liberationism. Liberation, liberation, liberation. But then you have this other sort of tyrannical left element of the culture that is no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no to all kinds of things that used to be okay. And so people watch this and they're sort of confused. I mentioned that a number of years ago in the mid teens, when I started seeing change in the Christian informed church, I began to think about this and thinking there's a real sea change going on, but it's subtle now, but it's going to grow. And so then there was a website called Everyday Feminism that had sort of popped up in media feeds here and there. this is before I was even watching YouTube, and I thought, well, everyday feminism, why don't I go there and see for myself what everyday feminism looks like. It was all this woke stuff. And the more I read the site, I thought, my goodness, the amount of no that's going on in this site is just intense, but it's almost as if the liberationism and the no are, they're going up together, but they're with different things. And it's so, yeah, you're looking to pass society as repressive. You're just repressing, but in a very different way. Start out attitude is that our collective view is wildly dissonant. I mean, I think it appears to be more or less completely all normalized now for adolescent girls to follow the Instagram to OnlyFans pipeline, for example. Yeah, they start out posting semi-naked pictures themselves on Instagram. I mean, there's a well-documented ecosystem of child, erotica consumers and keywords and algorithms that recommend content of that kind to enjoyers of such material on Instagram. And a great many of these girls who just do it for the fun and the likes and the interaction on Instagram then conclude that fine, well, I might as well get paid for it on OnlyFans. And then, boom, all of a sudden, aged 18, they're cam girls. And the world, we seem to tolerate this and we don't seem to view this as a sort of mass digital child grooming. And yet a story like the pseudonymous Alice recounted in The Times report on Russell Brand, who was 16 when she was approached by Brand in Russell Square and who then had a three-month reportedly abusive relationship with him where various other things happened to her. It's treated as a terrific. And I'm thinking, how are we making sense of this cognitive dissonance? I think we're very confused about sexuality. Well, simultaneously, I mean, I was reviewing my go-to cursed sex education book for teenagers from the American culture wars this morning, which I treat as a sort of reference for exactly these kind of cognitive dissonances. And I was reviewing what it had to say about virginity. And it's essentially said that virginity is not a thing because you can you can have so there are so many different kinds of first time that, you know, just just sticking to the cisheteropatriarchal one of penis and vagina sex is neither here nor there. And therefore, there's no such thing as virginity and therefore you can't lose your virginity. And therefore, there's nothing implicitly there's nothing special about sex. But it follows from this that you might as well be having it having it whenever and wherever and wherever. And I think this is which leaves. And that's exactly what Louise Perry talks about with respect to the the disenchantment of it. Well, now it's no big deal. And if it's no big deal, then it's no big deal. Three hundred sixty degrees. And if it's no big deal, three hundred sixty degrees, then in fact, if one of you thinks it's a big deal because you've been a victim of what someone else has done, that's your problem. I don't know why you're you're so you're so bound to these traditional ideas. You should be completely liberated. And what liberation looks from looks like is complete disenchantment. And so it's no big deal. Girls such as the pseudonymous Alice in an invidious position, because they can't say that anything was done to her after after a potentially abusive relationship provided within within this particular rubric, but it was consensual, which is I mean, and that's when it's boiled down to something so transactional as consent. We it's very difficult then to find ways of articulating the intuition that I think a great many people still feel that in fact, consent just isn't enough. And in fact, there is something special about about your first sexual experience, that there is something distinctively vulnerable about young women and that there is a there is a distinctive pattern of sexual predation and sexual vulnerability between a certain subset of older men and very young girls that we thought ought to be paid special attention to. And none of none of this fits within within the received global paradigm of how how we approach and normalize and legitimize and celebrate sexual liberation, which makes responses like this extremely confused and I think probably also contributes to the the pattern of general hand waving interspersed by periodic witch hunts. General hand waving interspersed by periodic witch hunts. Now, often with conversations like this, if you want to know a little trick, start at the end of the conversation sort of memento style and work your way backwards, because often with the conversation, they don't really get to finding out who each other is and getting figuring out enough and getting enough trust to finally be able to be able to be sort of disclosing of oneself in a conversation like this until it gets to a certain point. Now, where I want to start is where sort of Ayala lays her cards on the table and says, what's this about for me? I'll tell you what this is about for me. And Ayala, do you feel that you're an agent of change in this kind of peak of the sexual revolution or this new revolution that Luis is talking about? I feel like I just want to defend people like me. Like, it feels like, like, especially in recent years, it's been increasing. It feels like I'm like fighting against this push of women, sorry, people who feel like they're like, like disrespecting me because solely of my sexual promiscuity and like the way that I like to approach sex. And it feels like there's like more of a sense of like, I'm not going to be able to and like the way that I like to approach sex. And it feels like there's like more shame and judgment about it, like growing. I don't know if it's just because I'm exposed to different places of the Internet or if this is actually a movement, but I feel like really protective of it. I'm like, no, like this is I'm OK the way that I am. And I really want to give that message to anybody who's like me. I like to be like living like me. It can be wonderful, healthy and fulfilling thing. And you don't have to feel shame or like you need to hide. And so if there's people like me out there, I really want to take a stand and have like a bold unapologetic ownership of that. And that feels like the thing that I'm fighting for. Well, that feels like a great place to end. OK, so she she is an activist and she's an activist for people like her who are promiscuous and don't want to feel bad about it. OK, and other people make her first, she said women and then backed off. But yeah, I mean, part of. There's a conversation between myself and Laura in the members only section. It's in the three dollar a month member only section, so it's just didn't know that there were levels, there's sort of a supporter level for 25 and there's a no eight, no ads level for seven. And then there's just a regular membership level for three dollars a month. And I had a great conversation with Laura in there. And in that conversation, Laura basically says, you know, women basically create the terms of a culture. And that makes perfect sense when you think about feminine femininity and its arenic quality. And they do. And so it doesn't surprise me one bit that I feel pressure from women. Now, this would be for a whole ranges of reasons if she's having sex with their husbands as a prostitute, if if other women's husbands are looking at her online or supporting her on only fans or supporting her on Twitch. Well, other women are going to have thoughts and ideas about this and probably they are not going to like it. So it's very interesting the way this thing goes. And again, as Mary Harrington noted, and supposedly this, you know, we're on this sort of project progressive track of liberationism out and out and out and out. And suddenly someone like Louise Perry comes in and says, you know, I don't think that's quite happening the way it is because. This pipeline from Instagram to only fans, that's probably not serving a lot of women as much as what they think it should. OK, now we're going to go back another sort of another step through and listen to where this goes. There used to be quite a high barrier to entry for sex work. You're talking about street prostitution, whereas now with things like only fans, the barrier has been lowered massively. Is is that a good thing? So the Instagram to only fans pipeline that more and more people have access to a potential sex work career? Yeah, I mean, like I know like a bunch of single moms or women with health issues, like women who like are struggling to like feed their kids on their own, who said, oh, I tried only fans and it gave me not even that much money, like an extra three hundred dollars a month. But like now I can pay my rent. Like there's a whole bunch of. What's interesting would be if they could maybe earn three hundred dollars a month with their clothes on, would they opt for that instead? My guess is that most of those women probably would opt for that. And in Sacramento, there was a situation where there was a woman who was doing only fans and she was making a lot of money. She was making enough money so that she could put her children in a very expensive Catholic school. And then some of the other mothers and then usually women who fight these battles. If you ever listen to Bill Maher, Bill Maher's talked about porn. Bill Maher's talked about porn forever. And his complaint is always that, you know, what's the problem with women and porn? Why are why do women get so upset at porn? Think about it. And so this this woman was making a lot of money on only fans, supporting her boys going to Catholic school on it. And her boys got kicked out of Catholic school because she was doing only fans. And it was probably the moms of the other boys that were. Leading this charge to get her kicked out. And so, OK, maybe they're making a little extra money. And so, you know, you anti-capitalist, conservative, traditional sexual lefties out there, why are you begrudging these women their extra three hundred dollars a month? People for whom their lives are really drastically improved by not that amount of money. Typically, people who are really disadvantaged in some way, like disproportionately assist like the poor or people like I would consider to be lower class, people who like were culturally sort of like priced out of the better paying jobs, which is why I think this worked for me so well. Like I grew up. So so people who because of their marginalized disadvantage, you can use all the you can use all the words, didn't have access to better jobs. So they can get naked on camera in front of the Internet and make extra money. And, you know, I just. And this is progress. OK, very, very conservative, no access to education. And so a lot of people like, oh, you should just like go to college and get an education and then get a job. For some people, their lives just don't work like that. And for some people, like like being able to have easily accessible side income that you don't need training for or like the elite approval or like credentials is incredibly beneficial and life changing. I've known so many women for whom this is the case. I take that point, although I do think it's worth emphasizing the fact that the drug and alcohol addiction is extraordinarily common among sex workers, right? Not necessarily the only like the only fans end of the spectrum is clearly, I think we all agree, the much less dangerous traumatic end of it, but that it's also not, you know, representative of the whole spectrum of sex work, some of which is dire and is very, very common for women to end up taking drugs and using alcohol as a way of dealing with the emotional fallout of prostitution. And that means that you're not actually ending up in a better situation at all. You end up potentially spiraling downwards and getting stuck. So, I mean, I completely take your point that there are other forms of work which are dreadful. I think that I can come to I'm not really a radical feminist at all. I think I can comfortably speak for radical feminists, though, and that they tend to be very left wing on that. They don't think that any woman should be in a situation where she can't feed her children unless she's doing sex work. And the left wing would basically say the government should give her money to feed her children so she doesn't have to take off her clothes in front of the Internet. Completely in agreement on that. I do also recognize that we live in the real world and there are situations where that might seem like the best option. I mean, the other problem, of course, being that until you actually start because sort of lay people's understanding of sex industry tends to be very poor. It can be very difficult to know what you will, how you will find prostitution until you've actually done it. So saying at the outset, I think I'm well suited to this. I think it will be fine. You know, I read through my checklist of warnings and I think it's fine. It's not like you go to the job fair and here's the booth for sex work. Well, we don't really have a job for you. Well, we've got some pimps over there that you might want to talk to. But there's this Internet and there's you can take a look at the Internet and you can sign up for OnlyFans and et cetera, et cetera. And. It doesn't work that way. Just just be careful, because you might not feel the same about yourself after you do this kind of work. And men might look at you differently after you do this kind of work. And isn't actually quite the same as actually doing it, because as we would, you know, as we've been talking about, you know, sex has this kind of very visceral effect on people. It's very, very emotional. It can be very hard to to rationalize it. Or even to have insights into your own, you know, your own emotions, your own desires. I think this is particularly true when people are young, young people and much, much more susceptible to. And, you know, there's another aspect to this that they're not talking about, which is that they do talk about the fact that most women who get into OnlyFans won't make much money. And so just like sort of YouTube and all the social media thing, it's like it's not it's not really a bell curve. It's just sort of like getting off of zero is hard. And while you you're better off if you're young, which means you don't really have a lot of wisdom yet. And obviously, it helps if you're very good looking and desirable and attractive and all of these things. And so what if you're not any of those things? What if you're not young? I mean, for a while, there were a bunch of people in living in Arizona who were making YouTube videos about living in their cars. I was watching these videos for a while. I just found it fascinating and found that there are a whole bunch of senior citizens, many of whom were divorced and they're living in their cars and they're in their little community. People are like, you know, if you you can kind of make some money off YouTube, if you sort of take videos of your life and people are kind of fascinated by it. And so, well, there they were. And I'm sure they did a little bit better because at least they weren't going to get any money for taking their clothes off and men could do it too. And at least they'd get something. But my guess is that just a handful of these people living in their cars in Arizona trying to make ends meet actually did very well on AdSense at all on YouTube, because the truth is that. You know, in terms of monetization, in terms of AdSense, I get about a dollar per six thousand views. So. Just get to do the math sometime if you're looking at my channel to figure out all of Andrew Clay's rolling in the dough because of the membership thing does a lot better, even though YouTube takes 30 percent. But so, yeah, even even so, this this idea that, oh, down on your luck, do it only fans, you'll get rich. Well, that's what people think. But what are the costs of this? To to group think, to to influence from other people and so on. So I think that, you know, it's going back to like, yes, I agree, there are some situations where I can see it being the best decision for someone. The problem is that when you. When you make a move towards normalization, desigmatization and presenting this as a perfectly valid career route, you are going to end up with people going down that career route for whom it is an absolute disaster and ruins their lives. And they might not otherwise. If it was. There's the thing about normalization. That again, this is what, you know, normalization means that large numbers of people will try it out. And one of the things that goes through this conversation a number of times is that Ayala might just sort of be at the end of a particular personality spectrum. And there were comments in the comments section that basically said, yeah, you think this is working for you now. How are you going to feel about it 20 years from now? And, you know, I saw this video on Friday and so I had a chance to think about it over the weekend. And, you know, I thought about I thought about the exchanges that someone like me makes in terms of I was 25 and my wife was 22 when we married. And we have five kids and. I saw a meme this morning on a YouTube short. Every time my wife and I have sex, I take a dollar and I put it in an envelope next to the bed. At the end of the year, I take that money and I get her a Christmas gift. So far this year, I've made enough to get her a McDonald's McChicken sandwich. I don't know if these shorts are going to make it through the. I don't know if the shorts are going to make it through the YouTube algorithm filter, but. It wasn't presented to them as the new legitimate thing. They might not have done it. And I think that's the that's the trade off that we're dealing with here. And it's a really difficult one. One point I wanted to make is that there's a lot of like talk about like alcohol and drug stuff with sex workers, which I agree is true. They have like much higher rates of drug use. But also, like if say we have a world where we like dramatically criminalize something like plumbing, like plumbers are really stigmatized and if you plumb, then people are like, I'm not sure I want to date you. We have a bunch of laws about it. And if you get assaulted as a plumber, like you can't go to the police. So I still put you in jail. I would expect to see in this kind of case of the kind of people who would gravitate towards plumbing or people who are unsuccessful in other aspects of their life or like unable to make it in standard life. And probably have a lot of overlap with drug and alcohol use. Like, my guess is that this usage comes out of basically a correlation effect, not necessarily causation. Well, we see it in countries which have decriminalized or legalized sex industries as well. I mean, I think that the I agree with you that clearly the stigma makes all sorts of things worse in all sorts of ways. But also, I'm not convinced that the stigma is an after effect of the law. I think that actually the stigma seems to stick to the sex industry across time and place. And I think it comes back to this problem of, you know, the social sexuality gap requiring a prostitute class of women. Most women don't want to be in that class. It's very hard to persuade anyone to think that that most parents don't want their daughters in that class isn't a bad outcome for those women. And the stigma flows from that. Yeah. A lot of this feels like it's coming out of like, I think, like, I agree with a lot of what you're saying, but like part of me has a resistance to it because it feels like you're sort of implicitly telling women that they should feel bad for these things in some way. Like, like, I wish I could. Now you can see why I played it in reverse, because a little later she'll basically say, this is why I'm fighting this battle. You're more like, yes, some women are like that. And if you're not, it's chill. But like, like, I think that like the stigma is the thing that creates a lot of people, people like drug and alcohol issues here, maybe not entirely, but like generally to a very large degree. And when we talk about the narrative that like sex is extremely meaningful, that makes sex meaningful, like we create the meaning in sex by by discussing this amount of weight. Like when women try prostitution, for example, like I might when you were talking about it, I was like, well, you should just like try it once or twice and see how it works for you. And if you don't like it, then stop. And this to me seems like pretty fine. And if you have. But you already talked about the economic system. In other words, you should try it once or twice. And then if you don't like it, stop. But yeah. But the reason you got into it is you needed an extra three hundred dollars for your family. And so if you decide to stop, you still haven't addressed the three hundred dollar thing. And generally speaking, if there was another avenue besides prostitution where you could make the three hundred dollars and not have to sleep with other men or take off your clothes, you probably would have done that. And in fact, if you're not of a class where anybody is going to pay to have you take to see you naked, which. Most of us, I'm going to be gentle with you now. Most people don't want to see most of us naked. Just saying it's the truth. So, again, Louise Perry's leaning in and basically saying sex work is sort of a work of last resort. But well, if it didn't have the stigma. But now, again, we're back into this unreality of disenchanted sex. And if you go back to that unreality of disenchanted sex, then suddenly all of the other fights you want to fight, wants Russell Brand is a monster, yada, yada, yada. Oh, so you're saying sex is meaningful. And what makes sex meaningful? Because ironically, the meaning of it is attached to all of the enchantment and all of the possibilities that go into the future. I have a bad experience. It doesn't seem to me like it needs to be traumatizing. But if we treat it with this level of gravitas, then it's going to create that trauma in people. And I wish that when I was in a really sex negative culture, I could have heard more messaging about how it's OK to be sex. So now, in a sense, she's saying, I wish I could have gotten into the industry sooner. Actually, promiscuous, if you want to. Like if I had been surrounded by people giving me like the kind of message that you're giving me, I think I would have ended up with a lot more shame and guilt. I know plenty of people who involuntarily. And now the voluntary thing is important, but most of those people, I don't hear being very grateful about the age of their introduction to this aspect of human life. Many of those people spend way more than many of those people spend thousands of dollars a month trying to process what had been done to them. But overall, I acknowledge that it can seem concerning and judgmental, the anti anti-poor and anti-prostitution feminism. But we all know that the real, the really brutal attitudes towards sex workers come overwhelmingly from sex buyers. Like if you look at any kind of review platform where men will describe their feelings towards women they buy sex from, they have, I mean, I'm sure there are exceptions, but we know that men who buy sex are more likely to be sexually aggressive, more likely to admit to rape outside of the sex industry. You know, this is, I think that the effort to, I think the problem with the effort to destigmatise and kind of hope that after that we will somehow kind of arrive at a sex industry that really is just like any other industry, is it is basically based on theory, it's based on faith that all of this, that the stigma is causing the problem, not the stigma is attached to the innate problem, which is actually has much more to do with the fact that most women find prostitution very distressing and most sex buyers don't treat the women they buy sex from with proper respect. So just looking at society as a whole. This next section deals with technology, which is also quite interesting. So what about these sex robots? I mean, that's certainly not what God intended, but it's a lot safer for everyone involved, isn't it? But like, are we optimising for safety? Like, I'm down, there's ways to optimise for safety. So, sorry, there's a lot of points in here. One, like, sure, I like the idea of sex robots existing. I think, like, if men can have, like, an outlet that they need that is affordable and accessible to them, this seems good. I'm, like, generally pro people independently pursuing what they want. And if that's sex robots, then go for it. I'm not really too worried about this having, like, impacts on things. I did a study just recently with 20,000 men and found that the amount that they watched porn and the types of porn they watched was, like, basically not correlated with anything else I tested. Like, very, very... In other words, she's on the porn is harmless side of the argument, which doesn't seem to be... ...minorly. Which was very surprising to me, lots of people that argue that, like, porn use... ...is correlated with things. And so, my guess, like, my intuition is based on this is that, like, widespread use of sex robots would also not significantly impact things. But I don't think we have... This is amazing to me because over in other areas, we have conversations about population collapse. We have conversations about marriage rates going down. The abandonment of marriage by men. And conversation we had, you know, women gatekeep sex, men gatekeep commitment. And, you know, from a lot of what I see, a big part of the problem with men right now is if you continue to lower the cost of sex... ...women are going to get less and less commitment. And now it's interesting, a little bit earlier, she talks about the fact that she had many male clients who weren't getting any sex from their wives. And so they reached out to her. But, you know, they, of course, kept it quiet because they knew full well that if their wife would find out that they were going to a prostitute or... ...were paying someone via OnlyFans or, or, or... And the men don't want to go there because the men have lots of other things that they really care about riding on the relationship. And so this perspective that, well, this is all harmless. I think it just seems so completely naive and myopic with respect to when I talk to people. Well, if we just took away the stigma. Part of the reason people are so... ...they, they, they're so guarded about their spouse's sex life is because they understand that in many ways... ...the, the sexual attraction and the flirtation and the courting is all sort of just the beginning stages of much larger relational commitment levels. Which means that, oh, I don't care if my husband is always getting something on the side. Oh, well, do you care if your husband stops bringing home money for you and your children? Well, those things aren't connected. He can, he can have sex on the side as sort of the, as long as he sort of keeps bringing home the money. It's sort of the, the, the mob boss's wife's trade off. Well, I know that he's involved in prostitution. These things, just watch The Sopranos. And you can, you can watch that. You can watch that dynamic. The problem is, of course, that what women are really in a battle of and of which sex is a part is attention. And so if the man starts paying attention to other sex partners, probably the man is going to start paying attention to... ...well, of course, the pill is involved here. So there would be the progeny of other sex partners if, if those relationships are in fact fruitful. And historically, it makes perfect sense why women would be jealous for the attention of their spouses. Because where the attention goes, there goes the money, there goes the resources, there goes the commitment. And in longer term marriages, then suddenly there goes companionship, financial security, a future, all of those things. And they're all attached to sex. Sex is sort of the head of the spear. Symbolically speaking. But the rest of the shaft follows. I'm sorry. And I think her point here is naive that men, men will simply be going, you know, sowing their oats in all of these other fields. And they're still going to be committed to their children. Ask anyone who's not anyone, but probably most of the people. Well, why wasn't dad around? Well, because basically the heart of it is dad and mom didn't get along or dad lost interest in mom. And so dad decided to chase someone else. And so now dad has relationship two, three, four or five. He has children with some of those other relationships and I'm down the hierarchy. And dad said lots of nice things about I'm still your dad. But now dad has all of these other kids with different women. And now suddenly dad not only has to maintain relationships with these other children who are living in some households, he has to maintain some relationships with the mothers of those other children. And so very quickly, children find that they get ever increasing tiny slices of fatherly attention. The worst this goes. But of course, this is all fruitless sex that they are talking about for the most part here. And so what could be the damage? Good data on this. So I don't have very strong intuitions in any direction. It's mostly like, I'm not sure we'd have to do a study or interview a bunch of people to sort of find out how this is impacting them. So do you think that... Part of the problem, of course, with interviewing people is then you just get what people say. And you're not interviewing his girlfriend 10 years ago who he had two children with and the amount of attention those two children have gotten since he's three girlfriends out down the line. Oh, but these people shouldn't have children. Oh, OK. Well, who will? The skin to skin contact, as you said, that is superior to this kind of digital sex work that we're talking about. Yeah, absolutely. Because it's like it's just it feels really dehumanizing, like I said, for both parties. But like OnlyFans, I'm not dealing with a man, I'm dealing with the collection of men. And what's amazing is that before this is a way to get three hundred dollars. Now, remember, I'm going backwards through the interview. Well, it's really dehumanizing. And of course, if you understand the flow of the interview. OK, it's really dehumanizing. No, but it's an extra three hundred dollars a month. Well, let's see, how many hours would that be at McDonald's? How many hours would that be waiting tables? I'm dealing with like the statistical likelihood of man clicking on this thing. It's very robotic. It's like I'm just treating men for like the money they have to offer. And similarly, the men, this is encouraging men to treat women the same way. Like you have like a billion women and sort of just like like cycling through them. You're not really developing a relationship with any of them. And again, I am pro people pursuing what they want in their own time. I'm happy OnlyFans exists. But I know we can normalize anything. That's OK. We're simply not going to worry about where it goes. But it was much better for my mental health to do it in person. It just felt so much better and more fulfilling to be able to touch an individual person. Are we suggesting that it's sacred, though? I mean, Louise, you started our conversation by talking about how sacred sex is and the act of sex. Would you say that in-person sexual contact is preferable in some way to this new digitized form of sexuality? So I think that if you if you could somehow arrange it so that the only people who were selling sex of any kind, you know, let's say in rural life prostitution, just for sake of argument, were people who, you know, had a vocation, right, genuinely didn't find it distressing, genuinely had like safety systems in place to reduce risk. I mean, we know that the risk is still extraordinarily high for sex work compared with other lines of work. But, you know, there are ways of reducing risk, essentially, if we can kind of. And if the only the only men buying sex were, you know, filtered for non-aggression and all this kind of stuff, you know, like the perfect, perfect system. Now, remember, first, we're talking about mass deployment so that men wouldn't get frustrated with not enough sexual outlets. Now, we're going to severely vet the Johns. We're going to legalize the whole thing. OK, now you're going to have to qualify to be a John and you're going to be the nicest possible John. And it's going to be like Richard Gere and Pretty Women, because that's the ideal. Yeah, you're going to be back with the same problem you had before because you're idealizing all of these things and you're talking about the ideal. And the truth is, none of this is anywhere close to the ideal, because what is the ideal? It's one man, one woman for life. That's the ideal. That's the ideal because it spans intergenerationally and the children get the maximal benefit from the father. And and and and that's the ideal. So now we're going to try to shore up prostitution by, you know, the grim gris has this great clip of me laughing. Because Louise Perry had this conversation with Tammy Peterson and Louise Perry shared that what she saw in terms of trying to get all of these young men to treat women better were long lectures in in Marxist feminism. And this was supposed to somehow curb their libido. Well, I'm sure it curb their libido for the people lecturing them in Marxist feminism. But, yeah, the church had been, you know, warning them of fire and damnation and growing hair on their palms and going blind for for hundreds of years. And somehow now lectures on Marxist feminism and the liberation of the proletariat is opposed to all that'll do the trick. And so now we're going to have this massive situation where only the best Johns get to qualify to have a a an escort. And it's like, what are we talking about? And maybe the problem is that I don't think it's possible to have a perfect, perfect system, because, I mean, all societies have prostitution of varying varying scales. It's basically a solution to the to the socio sexuality gap. The fact that men are much on average, much hornier and much more desirous of sexual variety than women are. Prostitution is a way of kind of bridging that gap by providing men who aren't otherwise getting the sex that they want access to a class of women who are like reserved for that for that purpose. The problem is that the prostitute class of women in all times and places are not necessarily women who are happy to be there and are temperamentally well suited to it and are safe, etc, etc. There's so much more likely to be women who are there because they're poor or because they have some other kind of like difficult life circumstance like drug addiction or pimping or whatever it is that means that they're forced into that situation, because there just aren't enough women who are really happy to do it to meet the demand. And this is the this is the reason behind the Nordic model where demand where the buyers are criminalized and sellers are decriminalized in that it disincentivizes men from buying sex and therefore means that the supply is reduced because the demand is also reduced. And so you end up with fewer women trafficked in particular, but also fewer women who really don't want to be there because of other kind of coercive circumstances ending up in prostitution. So I think that, you know, I can I can agree that there are like perfect scenarios. The problem is that when we're talking about policymaking or or lawmaking or even just thinking about like norms, we're not dealing just with perfect situations. We're dealing with reality. I think I share like Louise's perspective in that, like, I want people to do what feels good for them. But also, it feels like a little unfair. Like, OK, I want people to do what feels good for them. I doubt she'll watch this video. Do you want me to make this video if this feels good for me, even if I'm critical of your position? That doesn't bother you at all. And maybe it doesn't. People want people to do what's good for them unless it costs them something. You can do anything you want with your house unless you're my next door neighbor. And then I want you to clean up your yard. This again, it's back to this individual libertarian idea that, well, just do anything you want as long as it doesn't hurt somebody else. But the point of this conversation, again, is the normalization of certain things and. How many people are going to be hurt by the normalization of certain things? And what's amazing is that we have all of these conversations about normalization and things like that, about all sorts of things that the left just freaks out about normalization of racism or misogyny or we can't have any of that normalization. Oh, OK. That normalization would be bad. OK. But we can have normalization if we're going to destigmatize consensual sexual behavior. OK. Well, how's consent going to really work again? Because the problem is this. The way we the way our takes on things right now. Now, she is about the biggest promoter of this liberationist perspective out there. And so all of this is consent. But the question is, 20 years from now, when she looks back on her life now, how will she feel then? It would not surprise me much. I'm not going to say at all, but much. If given the fact she grew up with conservative Christian values that 20 or 30 years from now, she goes back to those values and then she can make YouTube videos basically saying everything in reverse of what she's saying now. And that will get likes because people can go back and find these videos now and then listen to her. Then we love a turnaround story. And so she could, in fact, just be setting up, you know, her celebrity venture for when her looks are gone, because is she going to have a man that's going to be with her when her looks are gone? When the big thing that she sort of. Presented first were the looks. And again, that's normal. When I married my wife, we were both she was she was actually just short of her 22nd birthday. She was 21 years old and I was 25. I just passed my 25th birthday. So, you know, I was 30, 40 pounds lighter at a full head of hair, you know, went on to have five kids. Yeah. But now. You know, we look across the room at each other and. We smile and. She's still dropped it gorgeous. I think so, and we enjoy time together and, you know, our hope is that we till death do us part. And that, you know, our five children together, there's no step kids along the way that are competing for attention or resources. That's the ideal. I should be fair and let her continue to make her points. If if a lot of the radical feminists had their way and got to protect women against sex work, I would have had much worse options when I was trying to escape the factory work. I wouldn't have had that option. It wasn't it wasn't my first time. I didn't want to do it right. Like, I was not happy about it. I was when I first went into it, I was like really embarrassed and humiliated. But it was but if I would have rather done that than any of my other options. And so, like the idea of like removing this, I'm like, OK, like, I get that you're trying to remove an embarrassing and humiliating option. But if somebody is going to that option, it's because it's the best one out of their other options. And I'm like, I don't know how to convey that. With enough strength, like, like, like these people are making choices based on what's available to them. And it's like from only from the outside where you're like, removing the amount of choices you have is better. I do agree that this is good if the choices are misrepresented, if people are consistently like, I think sex work, I'm going to make a bunch of money and it's not going to be distressed. How do you fairly represent it to people? Because you can't because there are the things that are going to be the most important. You can't because there are these things in life that you cross, these boundaries that you cross. And, you know, like being a soldier, well, I'm going to go into the army and you have this every time there's a big blow up. And, you know, Israel has it right now and America had it with 9-11. And I'm going to go into the army and defend my country. And you're all full of that enthusiasm. Well, four years later, do you feel the same way about being a soldier? You might still say, no, it was the right thing that I did. But you're lots more sober about it because. But you can't know that at the front end, which is exactly Louise Perry's point. I think at all that I would be like, okay, I we should have more education about what actually is involved. And this is true for me. Like when I talk and it's always education is the solution about sex work. I'm like very clear. In my articles about how to do sex work, the first couple paragraphs have these are the downsides. Some people cannot mentally handle this. Please be aware and evaluate if this is actually right for you. And in my opinion, this is the way that we should preface things. But then also, like, trust people to make their own decisions about it. But she also got finished making the point that. It was the best of all possible alternatives because all the other ones were bad. So on one hand, you want to sort of again have sort of the job fair approach. Well, here's sex work over here. Here's being an administrative assistant there. He's this, this, this. Well, people only do sex work if it's sort of the last best option. And number one, if they're at least attractive enough to be able to do that, which already cuts it down to a small part of the population. And I mean, it's just inconsistent the way these two arguments go. But yeah, the access to sex work, even even when it's shitty, is still better than anything else. Like if you're taking that option. There used to be quite a high barrier to entry for sex work. You're talking about street prostitution, whereas. Now with things like OnlyFans, the barrier has been lowered massively. Is that a. All right, we played this already. OK, let's work this disenchantment angle. The problem with trying to view sex is not having any kind of special statuses there at work. All sorts of effects downstream of that, which I think are really unwelcome and particularly unwelcome for women. So I think that the sexual disenchantment, you know, it's a. It's it's largely a rhetorical move. It's largely, you know, a way to kind of affirm liberal ideas about about about sex in the post threat sexual revolution era. And it's, you know, the problem is that the fact that people do this really feel that sex has some unique status is quite difficult to rationalise. It's quite difficult to slot that into any kind of logical argument system because it's quite intangible. If we call it sacredness, do Ayala, do you think that sex is sacred? My guess is that sex is like a greater flexibility in like meaningfulness than maybe what I'm hearing from you. Like, I agree that for some sections of the population or like sociological or social narratives or something like sex is treated like a very seriously. And in other types, it's kind of not. And my guess is that people are much more flexible along the spectrum than you might think. Like, I worked at a factory terrible hours and then I escaped that into sex work being eventually into prostitution. And like from my experience, after I did this, I was shocked that people had placed so much meaning on it in a way that prevented me from escaping like terrible jobs to begin with, because like I didn't go straight into sex work because of that meaning that people placed on it. And then when I did, I was like, fuck that, that meaning that people loaded up onto sex like prevented me from living basically my best life. And I know a lot of other sex workers who feel the same way. And I'm not saying that everybody should. I also know some sex workers who. In other words, it's super disenchanted it for her, which is completely understandable. Tried sex work and then we're like, shit, like I can't not have the meaning here. But there's lots of like changes, right? Like you can shift from one section of meaning to the other. And so I think my problem with this is not that we're saying that sex has a lot of meaning, but rather like eliminating the possibility that we can remove that or that some people, for some people, this is the correct way to approach the situation. It feels also like kind of like double standard for people to be so concerned about me as a sex worker and to be considered this to be like a reflection on my life and stuff. And the factory was horrible. It was horrible. And that was another thing that in hindsight, I also rationalized. Like when I was working at the factory, I was like, this is fine. This is my life. This is what I have to go through. And then after I got out of the factory, I was like, wow, I was actually suppressing so much of myself in order to handle this. And I think we do this all the time. We all go through the thing where like right now we're living lives where probably if we got transferred to an alien planet that had like zero scarcity, we would look back on our current lives right now with a lot of horror. So you just mix us in with like social stuff. I think that this is also true for like the polyamory monogamy distinction. Like you're correct in that like a lot of polyamory discussions are talking about like jealousy issues. But like monogamy also has like dead bedroom problems, right? Like both are relationship structures that require some sort of like negotiation of your desires and what you can achieve in your life. And both of them have like pretty severe downsides. And as a sex worker, I see a huge amount of the downsides in monogamy from men, supposedly monogamous men who come see me because of failures in their monogamous relationships. Like it feels like my overall issue here feels like people are pointing it tighter. What's interesting is the truth is they probably wouldn't come to her because of failures in their monogamous relationship because they wouldn't still be in it. We're working on the what we mean by failures here. I would say they're coming because of shortcomings, but they'd like to maintain the monogamous relationship even though they are stepping out and cheating, which is why, and of course, they're cheating and lying. Because they would really like to maintain the relationship and they're frustrated. And so obviously the relationship has issues. But if the relationship failed, they would probably go and get a girlfriend and get it for nothing. Your laser eye at like the non-standard, non-normal, the deviant types of sexual approaches than they are at the conservative, like socially accepted ones. So talking about your case specifically, Isla, you say that you've got husbands coming who maybe their marriage has broken down. If you were not there to service the kind of the needs that they then had, do you think that they would turn back to their wives? Now, what's really interesting here, if you'll notice right here, YouTube shows the part that's most replayed. And it's this part where she talks about frustrated husbands. And have a frank conversation about their sex life. Or do you think that you are offering them a way out? Well, I see. So my data set is basically I would ask the guys that I saw, are you married? And if they said yes, then I'd ask, so why are you seeing me? So I get like sort of, you know, it is like a little anecdotal here. But the general sense that I got was that most of them had wives that weren't interested in them anymore. Basically, wives that had like a bunch of kids or like were, you know, had health issues, that basically just their sex drive was zero. And sometimes I would ask like, well, have you considered like bringing it up to her? Like, have you talked with her about it? And the majority of the responses I see made 60, 70% were like horror. They were like, they're like, I don't want to destroy my entire life. When like, it was common for guys to be like, if I bring it up with her, I think she would leave me. Doesn't that suggest that actually, if you weren't there to counsel them, that they might actually go and speak to their wives about it? The point is that by allowing these kind of sexual avenues by which married men can go and find a kind of proxy sexual partner, that they don't have to confront the real emotional issues at the heart of their relationships. This is like possibly true to some degree, but like my intuition is not that this is the case. A lot of the men had been sexless for 10 years before finally trying to find a sex worker. Like most men don't feel great about the sex, like making their wife unhappy, like potentially to do this. Like it is pretty high cost. A lot of them are risking like damage to their life. Most guys I talked to, I got- Okay. So they're risking, this is where the, you know, this is where the big replay moment is coming. Damage to their life. Well, what do you mean by that? Well, now, okay. Well, let's play the stigma thing out again. Well, what if we destigmatized cheating? We decriminalized it. We won't get arrested for cheating. What if we destigmatized it? What if we just didn't care? What does that serve? Does that serve men? Does that serve marriage? And especially does it serve children? Because the argument I made before is that the reason, I think part of the reason that men or women are jealous for their husbands, men are jealous for their wives too. Part of the reason that people are jealous for their partners is because they know that um, attention and sexual interest is a gateway to an entirely different life trajectory. And in that sense, a prostitute seems like a reasonable thing because a prostitute, well, you're not gonna, you're not gonna have a life trajectory with them. Oh, but what's funny is that the reasonableness of it, well, you're not gonna have a life trajectory with them because they're a prostitute, is because of the other stigmas. In other words, we, generally speaking with these stigma issues, we used to, I usually like to say, well, stigma is bad. Oh, okay. But actually the stigmas sort of work together in different ways in the stigma economy. So if you would destigmatize prostitution on the side of the demand side, the Johns, and you destigmatize the other, well, probably prostitution will kind of go away, but so will family life because what you're going to have then is a never-ending attentional marketplace. And what, what commitment actually does is begin to say, well, yeah, I run through it in marriage ceremonies all the time, forsaking all others. In other words, if the, if the idea is, well, I'll be with you until a better deal comes along, that's not good for the kids. And that's not good for the partners. In other words, what you do is you make a commitment and that commitment is bound both ways. Go, go ahead and look back at my conversation with, with Bausch a number of years ago, because, well, let's say you get a horrible disease and are paralyzed or have dementia and I have to stick with you. Yeah. But the opposite is true too, that if something bad happens to me, you should stick with me and we'll care for each other. I remember when my, I've told this story before, when my, when my father died and my mother said very quickly, and I'm not getting remarried and my sister and I kind of look at each other like, where's this coming from? And she's like, I'm not going to take care of another old man. I gladly, I gladly take care of your father, but I'm not going to get involved with another old man and have to care for some other old man for the rest of his life. You know, no thanks. Fair enough. But the impression that they had made at least some effort, not some of them. No, I'm not going to say that every dude was like this. Some guys were like, fuck it. Like, I don't give a shit. Like our relationship is totally separate from this and I'm just going to like fuck other people because that's what I want. Like I had totally admit that there were some guys like this, but it was not the majority. In fact, I got the impression that seeing these men actually like probably helped save them from divorce because like their other option was not talking to their wife. Their other option was leaving their wife because they couldn't talk to their wife. Right. So it was sort of like this safe, tiny outlet that allowed them to make. And I don't want that point to go, there's the big replay. I don't want that point to go unnoticed because it is a fair point, but it's limited. Maintain longer, more dedicated relationships. Presumably their wives would have left them if they'd known though. So this is a secret, secret encounters. Yeah. Monogamy. There's another big point. Monogamy clearly has its downsides too that everything in the whole entire world has trade-offs, right? That's like a fundamentally conservative insight. I think though that, and I completely take your point that there are some people for whom polyamory is great. There are some people for whom sex work is great. There are some people who are just temperamentally much more suited to non-conventional sexual lives. And this is where we get the reality check that I started talking about at the beginning of the video where society isn't rolling back. And it's going to be very interesting to see where in fact society goes because the libertarian, the liberationism might not win all of their points because at some point their arguments just get stupid, but the libertarianism has tended to win. And that's probably, that means buyer beware or young person beware. And you can't sort of rest your laurels that the government is going to put down stipulations. What seems to happen in a pluralist society is that the government in some ways pulls back. And so what that means is that wisdom institutions had better do a better job at preparing people. Now, I think that's it for this video. The whole video was, the whole conversation was good and I hope I've been fair to all sides. And again, a point that I want to make in many videos, it is technology that is moving this forward and has moved this forward dramatically just in the last 30 years with the internet. And technology is going to continue to move forward and we're going to need more and more wisdom and more and more communities of wisdom to figure out how on earth we're going to survive this because technology is just sort of shredding it all. So leave a comment. Let me know what you think.
