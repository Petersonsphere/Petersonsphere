 So, So, So, So, So, grill country has some special So, grill country has some special guests today. Joining us we have our regulars of Joining us we have our regulars of course Sherry and Jed, but then we also have Paul Vanderklaai. And of Paul And of Paul Vanderklaai is channel. And James court is have a rooster And James court is have a rooster scroll broadcast, who I've done interviews with, and we have interviews with, and we have interviews with, and we have gathered a lot of people here. We've up this this combination This combination has never worked together but various sub combinations have in the past. So we're here today to discuss our thoughts on. Alexander Dugan's, political Alexander Dugan's, political thought and his idea of the fourth political theory or your asianism and how we think that. be concerned about it? Is there anything good about it? What parts of it should should uh are not so good? And uh yeah so that's kind of the general framing of the discussion here. And that's one I always like to um open it up to like kind of initial thoughts from any of my guests if they want to go ahead and say something to open. I plan to do more listening than talking because I don't feel like I know much about it so I kind of came here to learn so all right if I don't say much that's why. All right so I'm gonna go ahead and jump into the point uh at kind of before we started recording I discussed that I I was interested in talking a little bit about the definition of racism that um Dugan gives in chapter two of uh fourth political theory and he uh let's see if I can write it oh there we go okay he says the fourth political theory rejects all forms and varieties of racism and all forms of the normative hierarchicalization of society based on ethnic religious social technological economic or cultural grounds societies can be compared but we cannot state that one of them is objectively better than the others such an assessment is always subjective and any attempt to raise a subjective assessment to the status of a theory is racism so what do we read that real quick yeah yeah you want to reread it yeah just go ahead and reread that okay sure it's important and I want to make sure the fourth political theory rejects all forms and varieties of racism and all forms of the normative hierarchicalization of society based on ethnic religious social technological economic or cultural grounds societies can be compared but we cannot state that one of them is objectively better than the others such an assessment is always subjective and any attempt to raise a subjective statement to the status of a theory is racism okay so it's always subjective and any attempt to raise it above subjectivism is racism well he's essentially what he's saying is that if you any comparison where you would suggest that there is a hierarchical ordering of cultures is inherently racist okay so if you wanted to suggest for example like that that let's say Putin's Russia is uh morally superior according to whatever standard of analysis you're using to um uh to the ancient Aztec culture that engaged in human sacrifice you'd have no basis of making that judgment and it would be racist to do so it would be racist to do so because because it's always subjective yes right and so I think I mean it becomes difficult and I think this is where Dugan is such a challenging uh thinker to follow is if you were to use that paradigm in other elements of his thinking especially what he has to say specifically about liberalism which for the record like I also have problems with like I'm you know I think that liberalism is is a very flawed system but then then there becomes really no we've kind of we're still we still have not navigated through kind of that postmodern morass of total subjectivity right where where do we have kind of it still seems to to diminish is really a subject object relationship right and and the ability to make you know meaningful value judgments maybe not always the correct ones but at least a meaningful statement of value um whether that's on race or other areas of his theory and so that's you know I mean obviously like let's say from like a perspective of a Christian I am you know fairly comfortable saying making a value judgment that a society that engages in human sacrifice uh is morally problematic but if you if you're going to be called a racist on the basis of doing that then you you've really eliminated any meaningful and valuable critique you've also made the definition of racism even less meaningful than it is under like standard woke ideology like it's yeah any any value judgment of any kind becomes racism under that definition yeah I think he's he uh so I think it is important to you know juxtapose the fourth political theory with what he sees is the the problematic which is the first three political theories which is liberalism you know beginning in the 18th century and then two reactions uh reaction from the left which was communism and a reaction from the right which was fascism I think he would say that racism calling something racism is inherently you know uh subjected to liberalism and its reactions and in a fourth political theory concepts or categories as racism need to be effaced along with many other categories ethnos and uh and things of that nature um and something he states early later he talks about how we need to get in the way he brings up Heidegger and maybe this be jumping a little forward but to speak to your subject object uh discernment there he says we need to get to the place prior to this the split between subject and object and that's part of Heidegger's project was to get to the originary inclination of philosophy and during the pre-socratics he says what question was being asked you know during the time of Heraclitus and he says there's a problematic between juxta or um making a decision between feces foosies and logos but the problem is is that and the reason I think Heidegger fails is that that proper way to do that is through contemplation and not thought well he calls the fourth political theory in practice contemplation so he wants to reverse right he says some crazy stuff later on but right exactly but the but the problem yes and and he's politicizing both like theology and contemplation in the process of doing that like and explicitly doing so and thinks it's a good idea yeah well he says explicitly that um we need to get to the root he has this idea of radical subjectivity so in getting to the root he says why not the head you know why don't we're talking about the head divine and spiritual matters he says this is very deep and he doesn't go into why he says we need to get to the root to the chaos so he's all for and injecting chaos into the system right by by dismantling the the hierarchies that are based on this dichotomy between theory and action subject and object mentality and activity so he's saying that postmodernism did that right he said post modernism blurred the line between theory and practice but he said they they didn't go far enough by blurring the line on the but i think he goes i think he goes a little he goes i mean i understand the idea of using postmodernism as much as he hates modernity and liberalism i understand the embrace of postmodernism as a deconstructive tool against those things and i and in terms of in here's what i agree with about it here's what i agree with his his basic thesis about the first three political theories i accept on face value the idea that there needs to be a fourth political theory i think is is is correct and his critique of both liberalism and modernity are essentially right but i don't actually see a fourth political theory that actually develops within the course of his text that i can distinguish from postmodernism itself well and i think that that's my and his claim that we stand for tradition and the absolute is he is totally ridiculous based on his what he's working from and and you can't and you can't do that and at the same time defer any notion of logos which he does well but and i think that this is just what makes the book and what makes dougan particularly challenging on this is you can read the entire fourth political theory and come away with the question of what is the fourth political theory so that's what i wanted to right but the thing is he's also important to read though because for the same reason important to read marx because like even though you may disagree with the marks at the end of the day like marx's critique of capitalism is spot on the problem is what does marx leave you with yeah other than his critique and i think that dougan runs into the same problem in the fourth political theory well and i i'll probably be a little bit more pointed in my remarks with with dougan in in certain respects because i i think that um and this is coming like obviously full disclosure i'm progressive you know what i mean like i i wouldn't call myself a liberal but i definitely um am one of the people who thinks that the the the arrow of time moves forward that's defensible at a you know scientific level that is how entropy works right is that directs the the forward motion of time and so we're we we can't go backward and i i do think that retrieval is possible in the past and there are certain elements of the past that shouldn't be lost but i i do find you know myself you know as a reader of dougan consistently feeling like left with the impression that in his full scale is sold on liberalism which in certain respects i i can agree with i i think that it uh it essentially like what it what it negates often is the accomplishments of liberalism and the fact that liberalism is growing out of a christian context yes go back into tom holland's work in in in dominion there really isn't an area of western and now even global culture that has not been thoroughly inflected by christianity so what we're looking at in liberalism whether it's uh in its most post-modern or early modern you know mid-modern iterations it's a christian system well to get right to the core jed to reject to utterly reject the any possibility of a humanity that is truly universal is to reject christ you're also he's also ignoring the russian tradition of sober nose which is to look it's to look at to what is in common instead of what is different for a source of unity and love and so that's going to be where where i will camp out and i'll probably bring it out but i james is james i've seen some of your videos and your material on on dougan is really helpful at an informative level beginning to grapple with this thought because it's pretty subtle and complex i mean it's it's an intent he's an intimidating writer my critique from the christian perspective is not as a progressive christian but really as like a question to me is okay maybe there is a fourth political theory out there but my question is what does that what does that actually have to do from a christian's perspective with christ's teachings on the kingdom right and he says he gives an answer to that in in the negative and he says that the anti-christ will be born out of what started as christianity he sees liberalism in its late phase as the underpinnings of of the anti-christ right which latches on it parasitically feeds off of christianity right and he explicitly states that we need we have two forms of time we have the the the arrow of time i think if you walk look at a clock it's ticking the appropriate time and he says we have time from a spiritual perspective which is the inverse and he brings in flervowski's imaginary numbers so the square root of negative one is i so from from the material's perspective things look fragmented they have a beginning a middle and an end but from a spiritual perspective that actual clock goes backwards right he's pretty you know it's pretty esoteric stuff when he's talking about that but he's saying that liberalism based in the degradation of christianity and its reactionaries communism and fascism fall within this proceeding towards the anti-christ in order to abstract yourself in order to get out of the logic of this you need to go back you need to think the new and that's why he brings heidegger's dasein right dasein means uh being there right so it doesn't it doesn't just go backwards though because eternity connects the both right correct it attaches the past and the future to yeah there's and it's most properly rooted in the presence and he's saying that we need to replace both presence the past and the future this whole idea of this projection of this temporal understanding of our being you know which is this universal unipolarity he calls it right he says that each dasein each culture you know has its own dasein dasein is its own interpretation of time as such that's what you kind of reflect someone's being someone's why do you think he why do you think he just chooses to associate heidegger's idea of of dasein as as being related to culture ethnos which is certainly not something that heidegger did yeah yeah no i mean i think you know the being in the in the works being in time you know a culture or ethnosis being is related to how they metabolize time uh past present and future right so it's it's it's different uniquely different ways of of appropriating one's being in terms of how they appropriate time in a sense which is abstract in a sense because we think of time in a very scientific rationalistic you know sensible way i can see there is such an urgency on okay so that like being resistant to liberalism as in terms of like the myth of progress would make sense of like why that becomes so important to him particularly if you're relating it to how uh to how a people group experiences time but i don't but the thing is though that's still that's like i don't i don't understand the idea of of making like the essential like subject of history a people group from a christian perspective that just doesn't seem to work to me yeah could we um could we try to steel man dugan's argument just for my sake well one thing i will say in his favor really quick is that dugan does have like early on in the text like he he is very much he does have the humility to say this is my attempt at a fourth political theory and he does invite other people into the project yeah it says it's open source yeah there's no right there's no you know there's no preconceived notion of it and it might fail he says it might not even you know hoping he's trying to fight unipolarity which he says is just the progression of liberalism and now in this this monstrous neoliberalism this form this global liberalism that is not exporting love universal uh human rights per se it's it's it's a simulacrum of these ideas of love and human rights it's using that to spread this tech and it has a to do with technology and what technology does i have no argument with his critique of liberalism or modernity whatsoever like i think i'd like to hear from you then because yeah that's kind i mostly agreed with him there i just thought where he went in with his own ideas i thought was deeply problematic yeah so i my my issue is kind of simple on this one is less spiritually driven i think that he like in his critique of marxism i think he's ignoring the fact that the reason why liberalism has been most successful is because it comports best with the market and capitalist economy right and so and i think that and in my own political thinking just to be pretty clear i think that economics is what drives politics not the other way around and so dougan would agree with you in terms of for liberalism he says that's exactly the case yeah it becomes the driving engine of it but and it is and so i think that the question to me also like and this isn't he's not an economist so i'm not holding him account accountable for not hitting economic thinking with with more depth when he's trying to tease out his fourth political theory but i think that that relationship between liberalism and capitalism and global capitalism at this point is the reason why liberalism maintains its ascendancy as a global system right and even in some senses like you know we don't really have any marxist states even even china with you know trying to say that it's somehow loosely communistic it is still existing within the structures of the global capitalist system and it's still being driven by the the needs and demands of the market itself and so you know some of the reasons why liberalism appeals that way is because in a sense it's it's it comports so nicely with laws of like supply and demand and the ability to generate demand through free choice or the appearance of free choice these kinds of things and so the the the at least the illusion that liberalism gives as the liberated individual comports incredibly well with a capitalist society right and and and so i think that some of what we're what we have here is you know in trying to attain to a political theory which i'm less interested in as a Christian i'm more interested in the kingdom but in terms of political theory i do think that that's an that's an aspect that has to be understood is that the reason why liberalism has succeeded so well is because it is completely interwoven with capitalism and he he does make those points it's just that that's not really developed and i don't think enough weight is given to the fact that this is the reason why you know even even within Russia within their structure right now is it kind of lends itself to more of an oligarchic state because that's what works best within within its within Russia's position within global capitalism which is a precarious position and part of the reason why he's so vehement in his critique of liberalism and understandably so but i think that what what gets missed is hey a lot of this is also being driven by things that aren't immediately transparent to the political system because in a lot of ways capitalism drives the politics of liberalism but do you think don't you think that that's what's under fire right now is capitalism no i think the capitalism is i mean i think it's in in a disintegrating state but i think it's ever been do you think he's essentially correct in saying that the political subject of liberalism is the individual and and and is there is is this conception of the individual as the proper political subject for liberalism connected to its say parasitic involvement with this particular this particular brand of constructive destructive capitalism that has kind of yeah i'm synonymous with it i mean and this is me thinking on the fly here and i don't know how well this connects so i would say like no the proper subject of liberalism is not the individual is the consumer oh yeah of course but that and so and so i think that it's completely manipulated and probably and so and so for me that's that that isn't that individual isn't the individual as conceived because like that atomized conception of the individual that we have within liberalism how is that like that is that what could that be other than the consumer yeah and so i think that that's what what the individual is in liberalism is the consumer right because it all choice then basically boils down to you know it's my personal utility right my decision my economic decision making is what is advancing my own interests right and so you know that's why i have a hard time with any christian defenses of capitalism i'm not saying that everything about capitalism is evil right i have to work i have to pay rent i gotta you know all the kinds of things i have to exist within this system i'm not interested in completely tearing it down because of what the costs would be on the other side of that however i think that at least maybe there was you know a stronger sense of what liberalism was in its kind of early stages especially developing within american democracy but that really develops you know in through the 19th century into the 20th century where the the the individual and the consumer are one thing and i think it's actually consumerism at the end of the day is destructive of individual of the individual he would he would agree and he actually speaks uh positively about liberalism prior to prior prior to liberalism winning out in terms of the three political theories you know when it didn't have communism essentially or fascism to fight against and turned into this hyper technological consumerism where literally the consumer is consuming himself and he says that that the process to uh individuality this this hyper neoliberalism has disentangled humans from first god you know god is dead right then any forms of religion that that differentiated from this idea of god or and then from there from nation state you know i can see this is a good critique because you know we used to have america that we'd be proud of america right so we're taking out of all these collective categories that gave us our identity progressively and he says the last category is human human uh himself and he says that's what's going on with gender ideology right and his his position is that this is all leading to ai and this technological singularity that's the way that we're seeing gender insanity on tiktok for example that logic is going to continue to ai where it's going to be like ai is you know we're going to just continue disentangle ourselves from categories where there's no categories left and he says to be human will be called fascist in the future to be human it'll be called fascist in the future uh and and it makes sense i don't know about that but like right yeah he also has the idea that the that the individual is being even like is is breaking down too to the point where now we have the divisional where like it becomes like the parts of the individual person that becoming the defining characteristics which you can kind of see that in transgender ideology and he says that's the kind of continue and his his whole critique is based again heidegger's understanding of modernity as and framing as gestalt which means that we presuppose we assume we see we and the and the the limiting choices that we have it's already assumed how we see the world as a resource for us to appropriate to use as energy so we don't look at a a fall a waterfall is a beautiful thing in itself we look at it as a resource to get electro uh electronic energy from and he says that this logic uh that's what's being exported with uh liberalism to all these different countries that's what the national security state and and the american project that is what's is exporting this empty simulation uh simulacra of consumerism that this is what he says that eventually you know that eats the culture from the inside right you know thomas friedman said that if we had a mcdonald's you know his mcdonald's theory arches theory that if you have countries that have mcdonald's in them they'll never go to war right it's this totalizing complete unipolar vision that is over coding the world and he it he's gotten he's gotten right we see what happened what's happening with the world economic form right we see with build back better and these these technological theories that are supposed to solve all the problems he's using that pretty in a pretty clever way to saying we need to fight against that and he's saying it is multi and i don't know i don't see it in his ultimate affirming theory of multipolarity i don't know but i don't see an affirming something ethos right and i think that's something that is missing that is as glaringly missing and in the whole book is any idea of orthodoxy orthodox ethos any church fathers any you know christian i will put my finger directly on it it's it is the the notion of the person as that is developed within christian theology and like within the within russian tradition like bylosky for example that he's missing because he proposes the collective is his he he accepts the collective as the proper political subject yeah so he doesn't see he doesn't see this pathway that is neither the individual that is as positive by liberalism or the collective that he is suggesting in its place but the person which is a fundamentally relational concept it's it is it is both it is somewhere in between the collective identity and the individual identity because you you have an individual person but that individual person exists in relation as part of a community and that community helps to define what that person is and vice versa yeah but this is just a question this is a question if he's trying to define a political theory dare he frame it in a you know um in a christian way because if he if his idea is multipolarity then everybody has to exercise their uh religious intuition and whatever like he's fine with whatever they want to do right as far as i understand it well he's okay with with islam and buddhism it's just as long as it stays within its own cultural geographic location yeah as opposed to what me that is like imported yeah yeah to me that is like that's completely untenable right and historically naive right we live what is untenable the the his concept of multipolarity is a non-starter not because multipolarity in principle is impossible but the idea that that these cultures can retain their kind of enduring cultural legacy it's just it runs a ground on history right and again this is where economics comes into it how do cultures have concourse well it's through trade right we are anytime you have trade and you have goods and services moving across borders which has been since the dawn of time you have cultures interacting with each other and and mutually developing as a result of those relationships that are being facilitated through trade right doesn't mean that's the only way but that is a dominant way and that is basically the globalist story for the last 500 years has been this this tremendous global explosion globalism is old right it's not new and i think my part of my problem with his concept of technology is i think that there's a kind of a luddite kind of reach retreat away from transhumanism however he's defining that i had huge problems with what he says about gender but i also come at that from a progressive angle which i'll be in the minority in this group however where let's just say on technology itself well the the prophetic witness talks about swords being beaten into plowshares and spears being beaten into pruning hooks to me what that signifies is a conciliatory relationship between man and the machine that these these tools are it's not the tools themselves but it's how they're being fashioned and how they're being used that no longer are they being turned against us and even from a position of like his his points of contact with russian sociology like transhumanism is not even possible because we can't escape our humanity because that's a divine humanity that's always already prior to well and if we did escape our humanity would literally be hell yeah it's and that's and so but i'm not i don't want to say that the concerns are totally unfounded but it's just like no i don't think transhumanism although there's a push for it i don't think it's even possible so what we'll be doing is damaging ourselves and damaging our humanity but so let's say we eventually are able to upload ourselves into virtual worlds and and live these kind of quasi-immortal but don't you think even like don't you think it's right to critique even the ambition for it though because of how destructive it is but then then his his critique kind of my my position is like well what spares your position from the it's growing out of a christian context with christian concerns what what spares your critique from the same antichrist kind of spirit that you're trying to guard against in your critique of the other theories and i think it's because he's avoiding some of those you know what you're talking about james and nate is like it seems like he appropriates tradition and christian the christian spiritual legacy in ways that are useful for him but not in a way that really reflects the the deeper eschatological thinking of the fathers let's say like a gregory of nyssa or maximus the confessor or you know go into berdya and so you know it like the the whole legacy of although he'll quote he quotes even he quotes bogakov and i know and so that's where i find him so mystifying it's like how he's well he's well versed in the fathers right i've seen him right so he's very it's purposefully left out of here absolutely completely left out of here which i find interesting i don't know exactly what to make how would you explain that like i mean in terms of because you brought that up and i think it's a really valuable point like what yeah i'd like to hear your answer to that on that one and so i'm wondering what your what your sense is there what's that what what what do you mean so how do we account for like his ability to make use of certain patristic and christian elements but then like in a sense it's it's it seems to be a feature of his thought but then there's this gaping void i feel like in the middle where the substance of what they're talking about it just seems to be sorely lacking at least in my reading of you know of him and so i'm i'm i'm that's where i'm like whoa whoa what how is he using these sources and and and for what end i think he's using them after the onset of post-modernity through post-modernity in this void you know the the psychoanalytic type say that at the center of human being and consciousness is the void is the negative right so in this void is where we're at with the logic of of post-modernity and he would say that we need to take the debris that has been flung off from post-modernity interacting with these old traditional metaphysical systems and he says there's gold in that debris and we need to find out of that debris and use that to build the fourth political theory he says uh there's a quote he says says not only the highest supermental symbols of faith can be taken on board once again as a new shield but so can those irrational aspects of cults rights and legends that have perplexed theologians of earlier ages if we reject the idea of progress that is inherent in modernity which we have seen has ended then all that is ancient gains value and credibility for us simply by virtue of the fact that it's ancient ancient means good and the more ancient the better and uh he says of all creations paradise is the most ancient one this is kind of scary the carries of the carriers of the fourth political theory must strive towards rediscovering it in the near future it's so interesting that you brought that up i made a note on that passage i'll go back to it but i got it let me that wasn't the one i was looking for it it was two pages before hold on me let me drop one more in here he says the fourth political theory is the amalgamation of a common project and arises from a common impulse to everything that was discarded toppled and humiliated during the course of constructing quote the society of the spectacle constructing post-modernity says the stone that the builders reject it has become the cornerstone the philosopher alex alexander sikatsky rightly pointed out the significance of marginalia in the formation of a new philosophical age suggesting the term metaphysics of debris as a metaphor so it's not going to make sense like just like post-modernism like you know it's not going to make sense we can't use the current categories that we have and make sense of the fourth political theory because he says it's open and he there's no sense making in it yet and i'm not defending this position i'm just saying from my reading of kind of what his response would be in a sense and and i don't know if i so i've been watching uh jonathan's videos and something came that kind of emerged to me watching his his talk on enoch when he talks about uh jubal and jubal and tubal cane right so jubal is um works with musical instruments right so chaos right to bring in change right and and jubal works with livestock and builds tents so it's land dwelling so this made me think of dugan's understanding of this thalysocracy right the seafaring society the atlanticist what he says the west is and then the teleocracy which he says landlocked society and it made me think of the biblical reference to the land and the sea right and now the sea and its and its mercantilism right through this consumerism through this global consumerism is exporting the you know is exporting this this ethic that is the seafarer against he's saying the the land dwellers which he's for right so this dichotomy you know kind of stood out to me i don't know if that makes sense and i was thinking where does tubal cane fit into this right the creators of the technology and the tools used in here so i don't know if that makes sense at all from yeah what's really interesting when you that in my first reading of fourth political theory was about five years ago and i mean i you don't know a ton about me but i'm very apocalyptic in my outlook i think that's where we are in history like just nakedly i think that you know either you know the fourth political theory is the kingdom or we're all doomed that's my that's my position um but you know in bringing that analogy in you know the the kind of the seafaring and the landfaring we get that imagery and revelation right we get we get the beast that emerges from the sea and we get the beast that emerges from the earth both of which are antichrist in their in their unique iterations and i mean i think that that even plays into kind of the the the deeper concepts of the war between the beast and the whore of babalonde and we get into they're these two systems are competing systems that are antagonistic but mutually dependent in this kind of memetic rivalry to use like a gerardian term that are mutually dependent in order to kind of build the world system as it is and i think that that is the dynamic throughout history and you see the difference between the mercantilist societies on the periphery and the you know the kind of the the um kind of more landlocked societies that are in the center is you that's a dynamic that we've seen throughout history and dougan's really good in pointing that out that's actually maybe one of the strengths of his writing is to is to make that make that kind of hidden thing apparent but what what protects what protects his system from just being that beast that arises the behemoth yeah right and the the atlantis system to me is more representative by the image of the whore than it is the beast and actually what dougan kind of represents is this the beast rising up against the whore and eventually takes the whore out right before it completely takes over is that correct but but what's interesting i've been reading i've been reading uh charles upton uh his critique of dougan after i read fourth political theory and then i and then i wanted to read something that was critical from our perspective that was not just liberalism so um upton tries to critique dougan from a traditionalist point of view from within the traditionalist school um and he one of the one of the things he suggests is that um what dougan is actually doing is playing into the theme of the war of gog and magog which is like a distraction from the actual true eschatological conflict um um so what do you guys think of that idea yeah and i think that's and that was even when i you know i'd written written up that apocalyptic novel was dealing at least teasing out some of those themes right is you you do have in the book of revelation you have two beasts and they are at war with two witnesses and i think i look at these as universals right that the church is a stand-in for the witnessing community you know and that testimony is established by two or three witnesses right and so they are outside the city gates where the lord was crucified in a sense that is the witnessing community bearing testimony through time to the work of christ in time you know i was thinking today about that word witness and you know and martyr meaning witness and how like that idea of witness is is is related to the idea of like like just the kind of like pure consciousness right and there's there's it's there's a direct association with that pure witness and divinity itself right and well and it's also the means by which satan is overcome so in revelation 12 how do they overcome satan they overcome him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony right and so the the the task of the christian community is not developing a political theory there is already a polity that we belong to it's the kingdom of the heavens right and this is what jesus comes to instruct us well that's right that's the song i'm singing all the time but i'm glad you're someone else i'm less impressed but i understand the need for those political theories but i think that witness through time is puts you in direct conflict with both the leviathan and behemoth right and so because those two power centers and they're actually at the foot of the cross the same power centers if you look there's a remarkable parallels between revelation 11 and the crucifixion scene and john right there are two witnesses present there's john peter drops out so who's the other witness it's the readers it's the witnessing community that is drawn into it they are at the foot of the cross with the beloved disciple right is is there drawn into that same drama bearing witness to what's happening there and so from from a perspective of someone who has a very apocalyptic outlook my problem with dougan is not that he is at some levels i think making a very admirable effort to identify very real problems i disagree with him on multiple levels but as a christian i i find it to be somewhat irrelevant to the christian task which to me is just bound up in testimony well let me let's look at where it's how the fourth political theory is playing out in practice as dougan has laid it out and we can see how it's playing out in practice in real time right now and it's nothing that any that any christian would want to associate themselves with which is the the murder of christians by other christians let me uh let me read to your point here what he says at the end of chapter 12 the fourth political practice in terms of this eschatological and i share your apocalyptic uh kind of sensibility of where we're at and another aside i've been reading dougan you know intensely for the last couple weeks and it's spiritually draining like i have to stop i have acid reflux like i feel physical and spiritually drained because i don't know what it is i have to step away and not read it for a bit so i it's really strange and i share your critique of his positive solution here especially in its political aspects he says here at the end of the chapter 12 he says the end times and the eschatological meaning of politics will not realize themselves on their own we will wait for the end in vain the end will never come if we wait for it and it will never come if we do not this is essential because history time and reality have special strategies to avoid judgment day or rather they have special strategies of a revisionary maneuver that will create the impression that everyone has everyone has come to a realization and understanding this is a huge arsenal of heidegger's eternal not yet if the fourth political practice is not able to realize the end of times then it would be invalid the end of the day the end of day should come but it will not come by itself this is a task it is not a certainty it is an active metaphysics it is a practice and it can be a potential and rational solution of the enigmatic layers that are discovered while talking about the fourth political practice so he so let me ask a question then um is he saying that it is it is the job of the fourth political theory to bring the end of time into being he something like that he's saying it's not the job it's not the job to bring it into being he says actually yes it is but he's saying that that necessarily can't be the task of a people but he says that's what needs to be done or we'll continue running into the simulation of of of the end and people will think it's the end but it's this this you know yeah but not yet well and how does that comfort so james if you are you familiar with burdai of it all i just wanted to ask one more question yeah go ahead um so okay i lost my train of thought now um okay maybe paul can help me with this one so the bible does talk about um all throughout and in revelation nations and people and tongues right yep yep and and and the judgment of nations and peoples and tongues yep necessity of nations and peoples and tongues yep and and so like i i i'm just listening and thinking about these things like when you were talking about the the um leviathan and um you know the uh the little beast with the little horns and stuff um steiner talks about those in in terms of the harmonic and the luciferic right and when we went through bach's book there's an angel that straddles the sea and the dry land in revelation and bach makes the point that the idea there is not to destroy the aramonic and luciferic but to bridle them right because the because the essentially it's just it's kind of like the idea of the of the uh like the middle path where like that that both the luciferic and the aramonic like the luciferic is like sort of like a um uh like an arrogant descent and the aramonic is like uh just an absolute descent and that basically i think you can't connect and what's in the middle is connected to presence well maybe like a good image to say like the the healthy connection between ascent and descent is like jacob's ladder right right yeah but they're but they're but i i have always been intrigued by the idea of them being bridled because they also represent the passions and um i think the way that bach says that the luciferic delivers up to the aramonic right the luciferic delivers up to the machine so passions deliver up to the machine which i i i see that like i could see that pattern right and and that is um something that christians do or try to do is to control the passions right so that they don't get delivered up to some kind of totalizing system which is always described as the number of a man right well i think that number two sherry just to jump in like 666 if you're looking in the imagery of revelation just kind of taking a kind of a perusal that image i i i kind of reject the idea that it's a reference to nero right i think that what you have there is a number of false theosis right because you have this interplay of these sevens and actually triplets of sevens throughout the book of revelation that are referred to in terms of the relationship of father son and spirit and and the true path to theosis and then you have this this degraded theosis this false trinity and this false triad of satan and the two beasts represented in that 666 which is the human tendency to think that we can direct our own theosis which i think the technological problem feeds into that dugan is recognizing this is why it's interesting to me that well that would be the luciferic pole of evil too but it's like that that that that you can you know attain the throne of the most high on your own terms essentially well i read somewhere recently that uh it was interesting that the number six in 666 refers to the sixth day of creation right the creation of man and it's man's hubris right there is no sabbath there is no seventh day and it's creating a system absent the transcendent and the sabbath right and that's this totalizing logical rational system that we're going to make you know the tower of babel essentially and i've never heard it put that way and it makes sense in this context i just wanted to share this really quick in the context of like dugan's talking about like the retrieving of the idea of paradise and sort of the eschatology of the the fourth political theory this is from upton's book dugan against dugan here dugan exhibits one of the most common misunderstanding of tradition and and traditionalist doctrine the idea that tradition worships the past tradition does not worship the past it worships god and god is not only in the past he is much more truly in the present that is in eternity if he were not in eternity he could not approach us as he is doing as we read these words from the direction of the future if traditionalist if traditionalism grants precedence to the past it is only not it is not only because the past is over and done with it fixed and therefore capable of being possessed but simply because most people in past ages according to the laws of the mavantara were more in touch with eternity than most people are today yet our own door to eternity is neither the past nor the future but the present moment consequently when alexander dugan says of all creations paradise is the most ancient one the carriers of the fourth political theory must strive toward rediscovering it in the near future it is clear that he has no understanding of the intrinsic solidarity between what is ancient and what is here and now that the only door to paradise is this present moment not to mention the rudimentary piece of spiritual guidance that advises us not to seek our paradise in the past but to hope with faith that it lies here in our own future god the father in the book of malachi says i am jehovah i have not changed jesus christ in the book of the apocalypse says behold i make all things new furthermore speaking in christian terms it is not the son one of one substance homo ussion with the father but if the fourth political theory must strive toward rediscovering paradise in the near future instead of realizing paradise now in the spiritual heart which no political theory can do thus making the heart ready for a paradisical future that future will never come this is the illusion the obsession and the bitter irony suffered by the titans and the osteros and the yotin and their perpetual and eternally unconsummated struggle to take heaven by storm if we recognize this truth and can live with it and live into it without greed or fear that all the materia of the eternal form of paradise needs to make a living body for itself will flow toward it spontaneously from both the past and the future the future can never be reached it can only arrive the past can never be dredged up from the heaviness of matter by power and labor and struggle it can only be loved only love can transform the past from a dead weight into a living potential hey paul i'm curious like as we're kind of i i don't want to shift gear because i think that i i love optin's critique like you know he comes from it from like this as a sufi muslim um but i i'm very curious as to what a crc pastor thinks of all of this as you've been kind of sitting and taking all of this in i'm poor sherry i did you guys talk over sherry so much one of our great sins i don't listen to sherry sherry's got a lot of wisdom agreed i you know i i find it i find it fascinating i find many of the the ongoing struggles so i'm i haven't made back up stop talking until my mind has cap i've been wanting to really dig into a bunch of peugeot's recent talks his talk with james lindsey and benjamin voice his talk with um paul kingsnorth is obviously his talk with um brett um weinstein and i thought you know probably my favorite of all the videos was his discussion of enoch i thought that very much illuminated a lot of where peugeot is at i think it's tremendously difficult to so so the the second to communism fascism very much follow on liberalism they're all children of the enlightenment yep and they're all humanist in the sense that the the action the movement is coming from humanity whether that's sort of a communal such as class movement in marks whether that's sort of a naturalism that's in at least nazi ideology and nazi fascism and that's sort of a naturalism that's in at least nazi ideology and nazi fascism and nazi fascist figuring out the relationship between those two of course liberalism comes out of a deep skepticism and and there's i think a a real to borrow from what nate was talking nate and sherry were talking about the the luciferian in that we are we are striving up to the heavens and um and i think all of you have critiqued the um some of the the avaricious humanism in all of these political ideologies i was thinking again i haven't i just haven't had time to make videos but i i actually wanted to begin my critique of some of peugeot's videos with this major piece put out by jonathan height in the atlantic on um he's sort of it's height doing his own thing but if you take height's piece and you take say paul king's north's um what he's been developing the idea of the blob or the machine this world system that is that is it's totalizing and it it's so built into the systems we inhabit that we can no longer see it yeah the the the tyrannical humanism of all of these systems that can't see beyond itself you know that very much connects in some ways with brett weinstein's vision of i mean beneath a lot of what brett talks about there's a there's a deep tyranny of we must save ourselves via and he's sort of all over the map in terms of how that would happen i i love i love the the idea of critiquing these three systems but what they all tend to have in common maybe not at least the the nazi system as much because that's that that's sort of a a taking humanity taking its hands off nature but it's a very dark cruel nature that then ascends and that's almost ceding the the place to them to the beasts whereas you know the vision of the vision of the coming of the kingdom that you find in the apocalypse is one of divine intervention and divine rescue and a a violent putting away of our own self-destructive avarice by which we consume the world and i find that in the apocalypse the the posture of the faithful humanity is one under the altar in many respects of crying out to the lord how long oh lord how long and then of course our participation in this new heavens and a new earth but it is it is finally a gift that comes from above and you know i know that there is fear of somehow losing our place in that coming drama but i i don't think it will be lost so you know watching these conceptualizing these beasts let's say you can look at say the beast of liberalism and the beast of communism and the beast of fascism you know the ancient of days and daniel seven sets up his thrones and and like whoosh the beasts are you know begin to be subdued and then of course the son of man comes and is given an eternal kingdom and and that is the that is the process that is underway even through the the the consumption the consuming and the and the crushing and the devouring that the beasts are doing and so i think a i think a proper apocalyptic christian posture is of course faithfulness in the midst of this cruciform drama with the optimism that we do not i mean it's clear in the book of revelation we do not know the plan or the path that the lord is taking but the posture of the christian is trust and and faithful participation in christ through these passages and so i i tend to think that a you know a christian political a christian political conceptualization sort of has to be embedded in that vision that you know and there's there's clearly elements of christian dna in liberalism there's clearly elements of christian dna and in marxism if you if you listen to tom holland's and dominic sandbrook's treatment of of both marxism and fascism in their podcast there's almost nothing that christianity hasn't altered and infused in our world today yet almost all of these humanistic ambitions are are warped by us in in the greed and i think as sherry said well in the desires that we have i mean consumerism is sort of desire turned into a god and um and i i like you know nate where he was you know started out initially talking about you know the person what we are what we are looking for is in fact this much more relational eschatology of our communion with our god and our communion with each other and i think our communion then with the rest with our sister as lewis calls nature so those are the those are the ideas that have been going through my mind listening to you guys well i think and i think liberalism and its christian roots i think that's the subject that it started out with like or like the christian idea of the person as i was trying to express earlier this is this is what it begins with and it ends up with this individual that exists you know really where consumption is the only end because you take god out of the equation yeah yeah i think um as well put paul thank you um the way that you know i don't see a political christian answer but i think that the kingdom of heaven is at hand right yeah so i think what we'll experience as the apocalypse or you know these political machinations you know are are necessary to get to this point because it's already there so it's like things are disintegrating and breaking down that is our view from this side of whatever is coming you know i take i kind of take take solace in that and i think that dougan for you know he's playing on these these real concerns that real christians have and should have i'd say and with this you know jonathan talks about this disincarnation or this de-incarnation that we're seeing and with social media and all of the the recent technological advancements we've seen them be so detrimental to the very thing that's that's that's sacred to christians is that you know god has already been relieved of his duties politically but now the person the dignity of the person you know and it's he's playing on that that fear or that that concern um you know my wife is a critical care nurse in the icu and to to have in when coronavirus was was was coming you couldn't be with your loved ones while they were dying it has happened in in countless numbers of ways uh you know maybe you'd get an ipad but you know the idea that we're just statistics like statistical data points that if we just don't have this person next to be this next to this person who's has coronavirus we're going to have less spread therefore we need to go with that statistical analysis rather than a human being being with another human being that's dying a family member like that more of that is slipping away in a sense um and i think he's playing on that that fear and i think that's what kind of draws me into because he's pointing out to these things that are like yeah i definitely think people should read him i like yeah there's he's and his critique of his critique of liberalism is very good and it's very on point um and neo-hyper liberalism because you know this what's neoliberal what liberalism has become after world war ii and there was no what he sees as the political force that is resisting russian ambition yes in the contemporary which is because he i mean does ultimately he does care about the the political situation um and um so yeah in terms of what he's addressing yeah he brings in schmidt carl schmidt a lot who had just started reading a little bit and as we've seen the last decade last five years the politicization of everything i started reflecting what is that what is it when everything's become politicized what did they talk what are we talking about when we say that and carl schmidt had a beautiful easy straight and clear definition of what is the political uh he says the political is that which determines the friend enemy distinction period either on an individual level or the collective level and hearing that i'm like oh my god that's what's been you know it's been taken to you know if someone's not vaccinated they're the enemy you know it creates these groups and what the creation in the group is inferred between this friend enemy distinction and the idea that that christ came not to be a political you know overthrow or usurper for the jewish people he came to elucidate and destroy that distinction right which means that friend and enemy which means that doesn't mean that it's we're all homogenized you're still gonna have groups of people or people you disagree with what is the relationship like with yeah yeah enemy that you love that is not yeah doesn't mean your enemy isn't your enemy but it means your relationship with your enemy has been radically reoriented yeah and i i think that that like what and one of the things i appreciate nate you know about what you i don't think you can politically love your enemies though well and and i think and even i see this in paul's communities as well and i'm kind of adjacent in my own weird way i mean guys i'm i'm out there and i know that um so i'm cool with it um but what what has been important in in the relationships and like that i've seen develop here is that yeah i am like i'm off the charts progressive i want to find the very edge of the envelope and then i want to push past it and find the next envelope you know that's just me but what because we don't relate to each other in political terms we relate to each other within within a shared ideology of love not ideology i guess it's a shared ethic of love and a shared presence of love that enables us to and we're very different obviously i got you know discussions we have a sherry with nate and with a lot of other interlocutors here like i'm definitely way you know i'm out there at times but it's never out of a context of my perspectives get heard i get to express these things freely and and i know that i'm loved you know and and one of the things that i wanted to i hope i'm not stealing the ball too much i actually want to pass it to sherry not only because you said something paul but because sherry has a really important perspective that i think is important and it has to do with like just that one of the things that you talk about a lot sherry is is the importance of non-judgment now sometimes i'll push back on you on that but i think like the core concept that you you bring and even the discussions we've been having in our private discussions about dugan is important i was hoping maybe you could just develop like you know how should we judge this or not and i'm curious to see what you think about that yeah well i mean i have a lot of thoughts about you know everything that's been discussed one of them is that you know if if rome is burning we're roman okay just so you know and and that's not gonna that's not gonna look good it's not gonna feel good and it's gonna be really confusing right to be the rome in rome while it's burning and and a lot of the critique that i hear about dugan is essentially the same critique that he has of the west right and so i'm kind of like okay so like luke's constantly saying it all depends on where you're standing you know and and i tend to be very empathetic and so i can always put myself in other people's shoes and that's sometimes a positive thing and sometimes it's really negative for me because sometimes i can have moving things and i can have things that are really negative for me because sometimes i can have misplaced compassion right but i like paul said and i believe the bible the bible talks about nations and peoples and tongues and i don't think that's going to go away i think the attempt to make that go away is is anti-christ because god god made us as nations and peoples and tongues and and god uses the nations to judge other nations he's done it in the past and he's i don't expect him to quit anytime soon and and um and the fact and so these are just my random thoughts okay and then the fact that that um you know christianity brought liberalism into the world um like paul said it also brought fascism into the world and it and communism into the world so to speak right um i wouldn't blame that on christ i would i would blame that on on humanity because we we just always get everything wrong right and and in our attempt to make it good there it is here comes the judgment the non-judgment we oftentimes make it really bad and so like the chinese farmer right says when everybody comes running because his horse ran away and says oh that's terrible he says well maybe and then the horse comes back with seven wild horses and everybody says well that's great he says well maybe and then his son breaking one of the horses falls off and breaks his leg and all the neighbors run over and say well that's terrible and he says well maybe and then the conscriptors show up right and they leave his son behind because he has a broken leg and everyone says well that's wonderful and he says well maybe but we just don't know right and and like i said before he started recording i think it's important to worry about how we talk about these things not necessarily the content you know but but the art and i mean that in in in in the german way like the the actual um art is uh you know the the formulation of something but also as an art because i think that's what christians are supposed to have they are supposed to exercise the art of loving speech and loving interaction and loving in a non-judgmental way and and when we do that we defer to god in my opinion because he's ultimately in control so there said my piece so i i was the the thing that and i i get um james i'm kind of like you i find dugan to be spiritually exhausting um so i found myself last night i was like what i didn't know how to put language to it so um i was in matthew chapter 13 i'm just reading through the parables and i actually brought the the book i'll quote a couple quick paragraphs out of it but the parable the dragnet i think is illustrative of something that dugan's thought really struggles with and it's very interesting that you know and we tend to think that that net is dragging everything up but we tend to think of it as dragging fish up it's just dragging everything up it's a dragnet everything gets included in the kingdom and uh and its catholicity and that comes out of robert capen's writings on uh on the parables that i'll quote in just a minute um but the kingdom is indiscriminate in what it gathers and what is useful to the kingdom will always remain and what is not useful to the kingdom just passes away and that seems to be the final judgment and i think that you know the critique could easily come back my way here too so i you know i'm aware of the limitations that i have in even presenting this but with dugan i think that the where he sees fragmentation in post-modernity where he sees fragmentation in uh in liberalism and in all of these different um you know all these different systems i see maybe from it from the perspective of the kingdom that is like that that mustard seed that grows into the tree whose branches stretch out into heaven is its fractalization right it's variations on a theme and at the upper reaches of that of that organism right it's going to look different than what look what the seed looks like it's going to look different than what the main trunk looks like and what the main branches look like but it's all of the same piece and so to me the the issue is not liberalism is not to me something that needs to be defeated one way or the other it's going to take care of itself capitalism will do the same thing communism kind of did the same thing it collapsed under its own weight fascism was a little bit different in terms of how that was defeated but a lot of these systems just they they collapse under their own imperatives they don't withstand you know what is that uh edward gibbons take on rome you know that it falls through the injuries of time right the injuries of time they're going to wear all of these systems down and the kingdom exceeds that and so to me the question is not you know i don't need to be against liberalism or progressivism or communism or you know and and that's why sherry i wanted i was asking you a leading question and i was cheating and i'm sorry but i i think that your your your main point there is is something that is animated in that christian sense of of what the kingdom is about it operates on a different paradigm and i think that is my my fundamental concern as a christian who's reading dugan is i don't see i don't see this is a viable option for christians to move forward in a way that advances the interest of god's kingdom it may advance the interests of russia it may advance the interests of you know certain kinds of conservatives or people attracted to heidegger's thinking those kinds of things but i don't see that the they're there and so that's where like my main concern is and i realize that maybe is a little bit of a naive critique but i think the right track i think very much he actually he actually defines he actually says what divides us is what unite or what we are against is what unites us so he's actually seeking the unity through what the fourth political theory is opposed to for the sake of political convenience so he's actually operating from exactly the opposite principle that you're suggesting yeah and i would agree with your with your feelings of of his his project there so he wrote this in 2009 10 11 i think it was published in english and he really was you know all out against america americans in the west right he since updated it because he says there's a political awakening that happened during trumpism where this same thing that these uh the islamists the russians intuited about what america has become and is exporting was felt in the center of the country in the center of america so he says that this awakening he has a book uh called the great awakening verse the great reset he says the great awakening will happen in america right but it's going to happen um in concert with the others wake wakening cultures that have seen what america has become and the logic of the antichrist from a christian perspective he brings in the jaul which is the antichrist in the muslim perspective he brings in the kali yuga so it's very eschatological and he brings in all these eschatological symptoms he even brings in the jewish antichrist i forgot what what it's entitled there and he's saying that now that these systems are moving globally to the system is moving to a global uh it's becoming obvious what this globalist system is is for he's saying that can um that can awaken this this religious intuition of the end times of the antichrist in each specific tradition in a sense so he's trying to say that that that's what's emerging here and he's trying to kind of leverage uh this eschatological thinking from each specific individual culture and he he breaks down the the this the world into these kind of meridians so you have you have uh the the west which will be america will be the superpower in the west you'll have canada and south america so that's one block then you have russia and africa and india and you have europe in the middle so america is the the center and then europe even puts in the center which mitigates between russia and the south and then you have asia in the center being china so he's saying these are individual poles right if we're against this unipolarity this this uh this homogeneity this technical homogeneity that we're seeing from this technological system that's being exported they're going to have to awaken the specific being of each individual you know culture that's an ontological reality like there's something there that we've we've forgotten how to observe in a sense so there's something real that's there that's going to be woken up and i think i'm with you i don't see how that happens right i don't i don't see that um in any kind of thread that weaves it all together other than his continuously because it's not i mean it's not it's it's not true i mean it's it's just fundamentally it's a false notion of like like of what a human being is like like you have the chinese people thousands of years right they have the confucianism daoism there's something there that the ancient you know there's an ancient chinese kind of ethic that's been covered over by late stage capitalism and this this hyper liberalization the same thing with the iranian iranian people and i'm not saying i agree with this i'm just i think there is an iranian a specific iranian ethos culture right that again but not ontology though well well yeah i know i wouldn't say ontology and i don't think he says uses he does he actually does say ontology yeah he does say ontology which i'm like no i'm gonna run guys thanks for joining us all right thanks for the conversation yeah thank you yeah so yeah i think that uh i wonder i just have this other thought um ah shoot okay so you were talking about this ontology so ontology is being right the logos of being right um okay scrap that um i woke up this morning and the first thing that came into my head was when jesus said to peter who who who am i and peter said you're the christ and then jesus said well flesh and blood has not revealed that to you and then he said i'm going to jerusalem and peter said be it far from thee right and because he knew what would happen and jesus said get thee behind me satan and i thought to myself wait a minute maybe he was actually concerned like peter right maybe satan was actually concerned and we touched on this briefly in a post-conversation mate concerned about christ's welfare right no no don't go to jerusalem you're going to die right and and uh and that's what peter said and and then jesus said well you know then he called him satan at that moment and it's a kind of of there is a weaponized compassion right it is in a sense because or misplaced compassion and um how did i want to tie that in now i was thinking about it earlier i guess it just goes to this whole idea that sometimes these ends are achieved through violence through pain and suffering right and to and to to avoid or or to think that that should be avoided i just don't know how rational that is in a from a spiritual point point of view well i think i sure yeah i i really agree with you here and i think it's an important but there's there is a distinction that i think we can make is i do not know if the apocalyptic violence that's looming heavily on the horizon is something that can be stopped i really don't at this point i think that in a sense that that cake might be baked or we're just getting ready to take it out of the oven right i'm not advocating for violence yeah no and i know that but i think that the question then becomes okay if that is kind of what we're staring down what changes for the christian well as it turns out nothing nothing changes we go to the cross with jesus the same we're called to the cross and we're called to bear witness from there and it's like and we don't have to get super careful about that and we're not going to be able to do that super cute about you know like do we need to come up with a political theory do we need to hasten the day i find that dougan sometimes he sounds like those dispensationalists that want to build a third temple which is exactly what i was thinking like right right he says between dougan and the dispensationalists and they have had they have swayed governments they've lobbied he said russia is going to be the third room right you know but he he and i think this is part of the reason why you know we might feel spiritually drained reading he uses chaos magic he's he's he comes from that background so he understands how words you know are like spells yeah and he thinks of probably favorably too oh absolutely absolutely so he's you know he takes a yes to everything right to to find the debris and then use it but he doesn't say specifically to stitch you know i i don't i'm trying to it sounds like i'm trying to defend him which i am in terms of your critique right but i share your your impulse i'm just trying to from what i've read to see what what maybe from reading what i would say his response would be but i don't agree with it and i agree with more with this and i'm very apocalyptic in my thinking i think it's you know just observing what's what's going on and i think for me the trust part gets hard when i think of my children my three young children in the world and i'm like that's where i struggle right and it's like you know for what's coming and i just try to keep them in the church i got them back in the church and understanding kind of these important truths that we're elucidating here and this trust and this non-judgment and this kind of observing that's hard it's very hard i mean i'm all on board as well like i i don't i don't put my faith in in any political theories i'm not really political and um and if anything is coming out of someone's you know head and then their mouth i'm i'm more suspicious of it than probably i should most of the time you know and and i but but i there is a sort of i guess for me there is a sort of determinism to the apocalypse like you were saying jed right where it's just going to happen but what i find kind of interesting is that we're all we're a lot of us are complaining about the state of christianity and how it needs to die and i actually don't see any other solution than this yeah and it goes kind of into some of the things that come out of our readings in bach right it is the new song of the 144 000 yeah that brings about the the new creation and and you know i mean james i'm i'm kind of i follow bulgakov it is his uh kind of his millenarian chileastic thought like i think there that there is a a kind of millennium awaiting us um that is you know maybe not as literal as like the dispensationalist might think but i think bulgakov is very interesting in that respect is there is an earthly you know the the the end of the age is not the end of the world right and there is something that comes after whatever history is after it's hard to that's very difficult for any of us to discern but it's a kingdom that's shaped by and rooted in what christ really came to teach us and it's really rooted in the scriptures themselves i mean early christianity came as a result of political upheaval and violent violent persecution and they lived together in parallel societies right um across ethnic divides ethnic divide right so it's a sober nose right so there's no rejection there's you cannot there's no christian basis for rejecting the idea of a universal humanity you just can't do it like that christ is i mean but ultimately christ is the form of man but it's not a universal political identity but it's not a universal political identity no it's a non-political identity it's explicitly non-political identity which is why i'm a christian anarchist yeah and so like the way i see it is that these things are forged in fire okay they are and and so i mean i kind of i don't know i'm i'm i'm really big on rejoicing the lord always and again i say rejoice you know when when when the heat is is coming at me i'm like okay this is this is going to make me a better person a person right this is going to make the and this is another thing that i think of often is that the bride is being prepared the bride isn't ready to go she's being prepared right and and so and and that's just going to come in you know as a universalist this is what hell is so right and so if we have if we have um if we have moments if we have apocalypse happening little apocalypse is happening every day in our lives and little hells right then there's also going to be big ones and they're and they're all going to do the same work don't you think right it's easier to reflect on that than when you're going through it to have that that mindset to be mindful like that i find that important to do yeah i think that's that you can gauge kind of your spiritual progression to be able to kind of do that to not judge when things are going uh kind of haywire because that that will happen and i think it will increase but yeah i i would agree with you but i think it's a tremendous task in front of us in this kind of time and it is really a difficult task even down at a personal level is for us to not lose our minds right i just look forward to the supernost right and and yeah yeah and well i think it's it is it comes from building resilient communities of mutual support the people you can count on doesn't mean you have to be ideologically on the same page but it means if you need to go to next door to get a get some eggs because you're out you got somebody you know you can go to i can right and then you're going to help when you're in a position to do so and and like and like revelation again it called you know this calls for patient endurance you know and that's i think the times that are in front of us and i'm my concern with dougan in terms of especially his relationship to certain iterations of orthodoxy and within certain christian circles is the christians are are enamored of certain things he has to say in that kind of that crowly and sense of like he he definitely is is a magician in his his ability to kind of uh shift into he's like this wax nose is what what shape does he take well it's what shape whatever whatever he needs right yeah it's like what is the there that's there that for the christian like do can we hold on to and i i find that that is the more valuable question to be asking than like is his critical is his critical statements on liberalism are those helpful yeah they're actually he has some very insightful things to say but i don't know i don't know if it really helps us helps do anything except for kind of seed more entropy into the system and more chaos into the system which you know the end result is is violence and i think that it's like okay that's that we may not be able to avoid it but i don't want to participate in that or accelerate it well i think those critiques are important like for christians in america to hear though because there's that kind of a tendency to to fall into this sort of like cultural like bourgeois christianity that like is okay with everything liberalism does and so those critiques need to be heard i think i think it's also refreshing in a sense to people because they sense it happening anyways right they can feel it falling apart and and and and that's kind of terrifying but but to actually hear it formulated um and like i didn't read the whole book or anything i listened to a few chapters online and stuff um it's refreshing it's like oh okay i'm not crazy right i'm not crazy it is falling apart yeah i feel like he he's like adam pointing to his to eve about the problem about the sin you know i feel like he's that more than a christ you know embodying any kind of uh the work of christ he's embodying the the you know the position of adam when when the fall was commencing because i was thinking you know this idea of the subject object you know we need to get back to the root he has this idea of radical subjectivity like radical in the root we need to get to the root i think of that as the tree prior to eating the fruit right that that distinguished subject from object that distinguished self-consciousness right so i see it like so it's the shape-shifting conceptual framework that he uses oh that that's kind of a good you know it's kind of an interesting notion to experiment with you know what you know but then it's you know but we can't actually get back to that place though that's the problem yeah that is well that's on the other side of the uh that's the underside of the apocalypse right the kingdom of heaven was adam and eve's i think that's an interesting point james because i think that that that you know the story of eden i think is is perennially relevant to our situation right and and i think there's a way of reading that is the the fundamental fractures that exist in human consciousness right we we chose the the the degraded and false duality of good and evil there is duality in the garden it's male and female masculine and feminine that are imaging forth god and the first movement of consciousness is not knowledge it is love and adam and eve had perfect access to total communion with god and the created realm in that tree of life but they chose a different path right and so there we're always kind of we're always leaning into our sense making abilities of making distinctions between this and not that and trying to say one is good the other is evil oftentimes making a huge mess of things when i think what what the return the kind of on the far end of history is and and even as we see these interesting studies of consciousness is that is that there's a mutuality between subject and object what is the binding agent there it's love right and so and we've talked about it in the past is you can't know anything truly unless you love it at an ontological level you cannot know a thing's thingness unless you have you have engaged like in a burke like in the sense of bergson there's a sympathetic relationship between subject and object yeah and that's interesting also in that perfect knowledge and perfect love there there ceases to be a clear line between like self and the other because i mean that's the way that the father knows the son which is why the son can be fully identified with the father because of the perfection of that knowledge and love right and jordan wood brings that out in his book that's coming out this fall on maximus the confessor and he kind of he employs some interesting hegelian logic in his kind of understanding of maximus's neo-calcedonian thought is that you what you have in christ is the identity of identity and difference is the meeting point of the finite and the infinite and it's already always already present in christ and that's the perfect meeting point and so difference is not bad like we don't get into like that that pure monism we get into what i think is more of a dialectical or relational monism where that divine oneness is expressed in in the identity and the difference and in multiplicity and and so the hard part is that because we're all so fractured and so dislocated from god's love we're trying to figure it out and dougan bless him he's trying to figure something out i think at some level even you see the grasping tone of his writings that he's really reaching for something but what we to arrive there is to i think maybe come to a point where it's like we're not going to figure this out and our efforts to figure it out may bring us closer to our ruin then it will bring us to back to paradise we're not going to get back to paradise by getting the tree of the knowledge of good and evil right for the first time and so you know to me that's those are that's where like i'm less enamored with the thought but i'm very appreciative of the problems he identifies because they are real problems and and they they're worth looking at and speaking to but in terms of the way it's playing itself out geopolitically at the moment that's where there's real concern is this is this is you know a kind of ideology that is animating conflict yeah from both sides though oh yeah oh yeah absolutely yeah yeah that's not that is not absolving the west in any way of our brutality how much jfk revisited has anyone seen the oliver stone documentary i heard it was good yeah that's part of the uh so i just had a talk with um uh this guy he's got a channel tre telos bound he's a 18 year old kid and he's read zizek he's read philosophy just was baptized into the orthodox church last week right and we were talking about this notion in hagel uh you know kind of see the hagel the the um the dialectic as a bastardized trinity right you have this thesis antithesis right and then out of these two forces the thing and the thing against the thing right whether it's an argument or whatever it may be something new emerges and at a higher level and that's the synthesis and we were talking about uh this um this theorist mcgowan todd mcgowan who wrote a book called the emancipation of hagel and he says that it's not a negation right it's not like a thesis is negated and then it's and it's negation and it's synthesis there's a new higher order that's created that and each synthesis is an explication of the contradiction inherent in our world right and it made me think of this idea that contradiction is revelatory right so pointing to uh dugan pointing at all these contradictions you know he's pointing to the stuff in our environment that we maybe didn't see before so we're seeing more of it as he's pointing it out not just him many others that are pointing out the inherent now more blatantly for a simple example you know coronavirus happens there's measures that are questionable they try the measures they don't work they use the measures again it's like wait what's happening there that's you know so that's a contradiction that's revealing the apocalypse in terms of the revealing right it's being revealed that you know and i think that's where you can you can look at this this idea and i think it goes to the very heart of psychoanalysis which sees the the subject the human subject as a void that's this negation of the negation so from from zizek lacan freud even at the very kernel of of human beingness of subjectivity is the abyss is the void right and it's like you know dugan says that you know um there's being and nothingness in order to get to being again we have to go through nothingness so we have to go through the void right while all these psychoanalytic theorists they stop at the void and they say that you know our neurosis comes from trying to fill a void that can never be filled so we're always chasing ideologies idols and white when we grasp them they go through our fingers and then we look for the next one in a sense and he says that's what constitutes human subjectivity and it's like no it's not like you know and if you go back to christ his teaching and his work um you know i think it's all there and i think that's an answer to hagel and i think it's answer to the psychoanalytic problem there's an answer to it and it's in christ but that's the thing yeah yeah and i think that that's kind of like the the um which is the correct answer the question is what is the subject of history yeah well the biblical concept of the void right there is a biblical void but it's not void it's called the depths right and it's it's a place of both it's a place of both threat and potential in discovery and um ultimately the depths are are where our cry to god emanates from right and and even like you get into maybe like dianniasis the areopagite and his his concept of like the dazzling darkness and that there is there is a there is a sense of void but the the psychoanalytic school just looks at it as a nil as a nothing an eye hill right and it's like no there's positive content down there and god's down there and there's no there's no depth in the depth to which god is not present there's no opening back up to the hole as like harding would have it so i would say that's what dougan is trying to get to and his clumsy way i think so he says we need he is trying to get to the radical the root yeah there where there's this chaos this depth of chaos and i think it's right to to extend the invitation to go into the darkness right i think that that's right um and i can say that with confidence because god is everywhere present filling all things right so on the way that i'm not talking about becoming evil or you know um i i i don't believe that everybody is leaning towards the good including dougan right and so um and and i think was jason almond tree said recently in one of his talks that i don't know if he put it in these terms but there is no anti-christ without christ um right christ brings anti-christ into the world and and the idea that um yates had with slouching towards bethlehem right is i think illustrative of that concept that of this coincidence of opposites right this is what what my conversation with jess and luke was the other day you know of of being able to transcend these things by by synthesizing them i'm not familiar with hagel but synthesizing them in the way that in a way that allows you to to walk on water right not fall into the multiplicity and not fall into the particular not fall into the chaos and um and that is christ because he's all he's all those things right he's everything and he's nothing it's all there what i think that that's exactly it sherry is like you know and that's that was like it's a constant problem of what israel is struggling with with god in the psalms right is the problem of not just the presence of god which creates certain problems right um that it's the longed-for problem but then you're exposed in the presence of god you become aware of your sinfulness but then there's also that cry in the absence of god in the absence is just presence by another means right and it it's revealing the presence in the in the darker that it's it's it's the revelation of the majesty in the minor chords versus the major chords well you know you also was talking about the Passover rituals of of seeking for things right because it it it it's indicative of the hiddenness of god in the world and um i can't remember i put a quote in from kalis just where this morning on the foxer where there was a jewish rabbi and he said or kalis just where i was talking about how deflated you would have been as a child if you were hiding if you found a really good place to hide and then nobody found you right you came out and all your friends were gone home and you and nobody found you and you're and you have the best hiding place ever and he's and this rabbi reiterates that in a story which i have yet to read that that is how it is for god right he's found the perfect hiding place and he comes out of it and we're all gone and nobody found him there's there's almost a sofianic intuition and in some ways in his in his epilogue or what is it in the after where he talks about the metaphysics of chaos because he's talking about he's talking the way he's talking about chaos he's talking about chaos in terms of like the divine feminine and your idea of talking about veiling made me think of that so there's definitely talking about in terms of the divine of the divine feminine um and um that is interesting but i i still think he he i still think he makes a mistake in wanting to reject logos because you need to have both the essential pole and the substantial pole yeah he has this notion of the dark logos have you heard that yeah yeah right yeah i'm not familiar with that i just kind of know it tangentially um i've heard it mentioned but i don't know what it is he's got a good quote from yeah okay go for it go for it so he's talking about here why aren't we talking about god why are we talking about this chaos he says um i'll just read the the paragraph here this is if we focus on the subject of the fourth political theory meaning design we'll understand that it does not belong to the horizontal disposition between these two columns so the column between the subject and the object right he's saying that post-modernism blurred the line between subject and object but it doesn't even consider the vertical and depth dimensions so he wants to do what post-modernism did to the materialist dimension of blurring between subject and object he wants to flip that and do that to the vertical and the depth directions but he says don't worry about the vertical now the spirit the divine focus on the depth the root and that's what he's getting at here he says why do we talk about the roots but not the head this is a very serious and deep moment because we should realize the reduction that is being made if we realize that the horizontal reduction first and we get an unsatisfactory result we will conclude that we should instead realize the vertical reduction to move towards ontic roots but not ontological heights therefore we should postpone such notions as the dimension of spirit and the divine and move towards chaos and other vertical and depth oriented concepts and he finally brings in this ninja quote he says nija said not when truth is dirty but when it is shallow the seeker of knowledge steps reluctantly into the water so that means to me we need to get to a point where we can dip our toe into that darkness that dazzling darkness right it made me think of you know this this inherent sterilization of death and the fear of death in our culture right so anything in these um you know shallow deep waters he says you know if it's shallow enough you'll dip your toe in so i think that's what he's trying to try he's trying to orient us to look and that's why i think it's partly why it's it's so uncomfortable but i don't know about that i just kind of came to me just now yeah yeah i think that chaos is it is it kind of an interesting interesting space and i i look at that as it is the impeller of the growth of creation i mean we even know that mathematically at chaos theory and how that is related to fractal geometry and the creation of complex systems right there is a chaos at the heart of creation but to me that's only that's just a difference principle it's self-similarity like and it's representational and so there's always this mirroring reality of like but not like that is always always growing throughout creation and so he's wanting to get close to that i'm sympathetic to that i just i i think that our relationship to that has to be a loving relationship and what i see is more his his his rhetoric is so martial you know and and so i don't think i think what it ends up doing is it ends up using chaos as a weapon versus using chaos as a tool and and like a like an artist paintbrush is a tool and you can use chaos in in brilliantly wonderful way because he talks about chaos and concreted your way so he talks about it like in that like where where james is just reading he's talking about this sort of like you know chaos and like uh more of the like the ancient greek sense as opposed to the post-modern sense but he he's he goes back and forth between those modes of talking about chaos which kind of confuses the issue and i think as you indicated earlier i think it's using confusion on purpose as a tool but it but in this section where he's talking in as much as he's talking about chaos and that older notion of chaos which is associated with the divine feminine i think there's something particularly russian about that i think i don't know why it is but there seems to be a particular connection between russia and this concept of the divine feminine i think that's why you see um sophiology being developed within within within russia um and you also have like the tradition of um of using for sophia and the naming of churches um you have like the the you know the russian pagan figure of the snow maiden you also have like the dark chaotic figure of baba yaga too at the same time which is sort of like the dark aspects of the of the divine feminine so there's some kind of special connection there i think which is like almost kind of like the fact that like the fatima prophecies like allegedly involved like the blessed virgin's concerns for russia like kind of like almost reinforced that too look i wonder how much of this is misunderstood i'm and it's a like an open question because russians are or the russian culture or the russian way of thinking it's hard to understand digga would say yes definitely and that's the core of it i mean i'm reading salovia and and i mean it's cringe-worthy sometimes for me reading it because he talks about a definite russian-ness right and um and that they have a calling and you know he uses the same kind of terminology that dugan uses yeah but he critiques the church and the hierarchy of the church and like the ecclesial hierarchy and he also critiques their um political ties to the government right uh i don't know but i don't i don't think dugan's doing that no no he wouldn't and um but everything else like if you just stripped away those critiques from salovia he would sound exactly like dugan when it comes to russia it's very interesting right it is they it is a seems to me to be the way russians think about themselves well and i think he's right like it so his like when he gets into kind of his geopolitics and his understanding of what russia's role is in the geopolitical scene i think he's honestly right because russia does occupy a very unique position geographically culturally um historically it's it's it's vastly important and i think you know as a westerner critiquing dugan i it's also not without a knowledge of basically since the end of the cold war and during and prior to the west has almost always had a very adversarial especially like the atlanticist west has had a very adversarial relationship with russia and post cold war you know after the fall of the iron curtain we've basically looted russia and normally that but it doesn't all countries though jen i mean after watching that jfk revisited oh yeah jfk wanted a more of a sober nose yeah he wanted to talk with russia yeah and not just with cuba and with um egypt and syria libya ukraine right who is it what in the west is responsible for these things what is it when we say what is sovereign in the west in terms of this discussion of this thing that's exporting color revolutions chaos technical consumer society what is it i don't know i don't know that's a great question though i think it's manning i mean i think honestly it's i think we're too steep to know yeah it's of this it's not of the flesh yeah there's this there's this sinister spiritual force behind it i think it's impelled by greed by people who see an opportunity and power and it's the it's the power that reinforces the greed because essentially like what happened you know under yeltsin with america and nato is we basically stripped everything out of russia that wasn't nailed down right and and you can they either can be all kinds of ideology we can put behind it as far as atlanticism but all that stuff but a lot of it like if you just step back and take a look it just looks like greed yeah and then and then underneath that is the the willingness to impose that economic advantage through the use of force and political force and then ultimately military force and so like in terms of the violence that we're seeing between russia and ukraine today like the the idea that the west does not hold foundational responsibility and culpability in this this is not i definitely think that putin is wrong in in his invasion of ukraine i think it's it's atrocious and abysmal but i'm not naive to the fact that we in a sense have baited him into that and i kind of wonder if that's not what we did oh and i kind of wonder that if that's not what they're you know that's what they're doing on purpose to show the contradiction within what the west this thing of the west to disclose to the world you know once you start digging into ukraine you start watching some of the oliver stone films ukraine on fire and ukraine revisited you look at his his as a film on jfk and you see what the cia and if you look at the roots of the cia with the oss and and kind of nazi germany that goes into a deep rabbit hole but that is the disclosure that's what's being revealed and it and it has to be done and i think um that's why i say it's burning like rome is freaking burning and people are yeah you know they're confused yeah but we should be the ones bringing buckets of water to those burning buildings as opposed to like lighting more fires you know like that's the side of it that i just it's like yeah it's burning and and it's a problem and we may not be you know this is this is this makes me think of what sherry was talking about earlier and because like we're kind of getting into this idea of like well what is the difference between us like a state and a nation you know um because a lot of we're talking about like you know government actions the actions of the state but there's but the idea of a nation is certainly older than the modern idea of the state and i found myself in i found myself having a very contradictory i'll just be i'll just make fun of myself a little bit here for the sake of illustrating my point um tom belt jed our mutual friend he posted something about like how do you feel about pledging allegiance to the flag um as as a christian and i would had just woken up from a nap and i was in this kind of liminal state of consciousness and it's like i read that and it's like oh i have i i knew for sure i had zero problem with it all with no problem with it whatsoever and even though i'm a you know a self-professed christian anarchist i had no problem with that whatsoever nor do i have any problem with you know people being enthusiastically rooting for team usa or any or any kind of like you know harmless display of patriotism so and i had to be honest with myself about like so there's like so there is so so i kind of made a joke i said you know i kind of confessed that i was like just waking up for a nap and like and i had no explanation of my answer and i'm like it may be have to consider like you know maybe john millbank and his political thinking is a little closer to right and i'm a little closer to wrong but there's something that i'm not understanding and my that may be my mistrust of the state is well placed but there's something about the concept of a nation that is deeper than that and sherry i'd like you to address it since you're the one who brought up this idea of we have nations for a reason from the from the divine perspective i've like i've liked you to be able to say what you think first well i don't know if i could add more to what i already said you know i just you know i just i can't help think about cyrus and darious and nebuchadnezzar and how they were used and you know we're worrying about dougan and putin but honestly if god deems it valuable they'll be out on their hands and knees for seven years chewing on the grass with the cows right like that's how i feel and i mean um you know maybe nations are controlled by angels and states by agregores well i don't know the difference actually like the state was always a communist term for me and it was more patriotic right but um but there is there is a there is definitely a spirit attached to the idea of nation because because people even though they don't maybe live within the nation reflect that spirit i've seen it i've seen people who are born in canada to immigrant parents or immigrant grandparents let's say sydney's or ucranian or whatever german and and their nation is represented in them even though they never grew up there right or maybe are twice removed from it and i find that really interesting and and they do act like bodies of something they have a they have a not just to share not a history but they move in a way they contribute to the world in a way i've talked to my husband about this about switzerland for example and the contributions and i know switzerland's made negative ones but there are a lot of positive contributions to the world from switzerland right and and the way that germany has acted in the in the very distant past and the more recent past and and then and the now even i don't see the activity it might look different but it isn't really different you know well here's the thing is the state i don't think that there's any place ultimately in an enduring sense of the state the state as we know it is a is a function of early modernity grows out of capitalism in the post-west valiant state the nation state is not the nations that's right it's a it's a much later conception yeah you know whether it's in greek in ta ethani or in in herew is hago yin right we're talking about the peoples and their distinct identity as peoples and as groups of people is different than the political arrangements and even when we get into biblical concepts of empire whether that's persia or babalon these are already multi-ethnic or multi-peopleed dynamics under a larger conglomerate of political arrangements so the the political arrangements and the idea that like there is a distinct russian identity as a nation state i will challenge dougan on is there a real russian identity though i would say yes and it's a valuable one and it's an important one in the legacy of world history see i think dougan is struggling toward that identity but doing it badly though what's it's a fair it's a thousand years old you know it has a definite not a definite but a time and a place that had emerged you know oswald spangler talks about civilizations have uh they're organic and they have a body and they have a life cycle and he actually says that russia is in the spring of its life life cycle and the west is in its decline um you know russia started you know in in ukraine really in the 900s around there so there is something there if you think from a materialist and i send my spiritual perspective that gives the russian folk the russian people their identity but to your point you know and to your point sherry my entire family lineage grew up in greece you know my mom got pregnant with me in greece and then moved to america for the first time you know they didn't speak the language or anything and i feel american it's part of my identity and and i think part of the uncomfortableness of uncovering what has been done under the name of america that see you know all of these things that we're seeing it's uncomfortable for people because they're american it's part of our identity there's no getting out of that um but to your point like i am considering myself a greek american but what is this idea of of a greek right the greek hellenic nation has been around since the 1800s in its current political form right but then you go deeper than that obviously it's it's thousands of years old so it's hard to really demarcate the appropriate you know constellation of of ideas that make up a people in a culture so i'm with you i'm just gonna ask you this really dumb question james what did you major in and um in college yeah uh political science and philosophy go figure go figure he's closed right yeah you know it's funny i've had german co-workers in the past that that have have said to me um that even if it wasn't for your surname i would have known your german ancestry because it's just something very german about you so i don't yeah so you just reflected a piece of my identity back to me that i wasn't really aware of so succinctly uh that was pretty cool that was pretty cool and i think that's a really interesting thing james like what you're talking about i think hits on i think the positive role of the nation or nations right i mean like it like baseball and apple pie and thanksgiving dinner and like rock and roll and you know like the things that are quintessentially american they arise in our culture our unique cultural context but these are valuable i mean the rest of the world loves this stuff for them i mean not an unqualified love but they they love elements of american culture that are really cool i mean it's just cool you know like i mean only in america are you going to have the emergence of like skateboarding and you know like uh competitive surfing which i grew up around in southern california and you know it's like there's some cool stuff that we've done right but but you have to like the difficulty that you're identifying is like that's against the backdrop of a very dark political legacy that goes back to our very beginnings right so you have like the the good and the bad growing together what is the political meaning of this distinction that we're making between the the state and the nation well i wanted to read the little slob yet if i could because he actually talks about it for a minute okay i'm listening by the way i just got to take care of something in my living room so i'll be able to hear all you guys so yeah in accepting the essential and real unity of humankind and one rightly should accept it because it is a religious truth justified by rational philosophy and confirmed by exact science in accepting this substantial unity we should consider the whole of humanity like a great collective being or a social organism of which different nations represent the living parts it is evident from this point of view that no people would know how to live in itself for itself and by itself but that the life of each people is nothing but a particular participation in the general life of humanity the function that a nation should fulfill as being an organ that is its true national id idae in french eternally fixed in the plan of god but if it is true that humanity is a grand organism it is still necessary to realize that it is not an organism that is purely physical but that the members and elements of which it is composed nations and individuals are moral beings now the essential condition of a moral being is that the particular function which it is called to fulfill in the life of the whole the idea that determines its existence in the thought of god is never imposed as a material necessity but only as a moral obligation god's thought which is an absolute fatalism for non-rational things is only a duty for a moral being but if it is evident that a duty can be fulfilled or not can be fulfilled well or badly can be accepted or rejected still one would not know how to admit on the other hand to admit on the other hand that this liberty could change the providential plan or take away the efficacy of the moral law the moral action of god cannot be less powerful than his physical action it is necessary therefore to recognize that in the moral world there is also a fatalism but a fatalism that is indirect and conditional and then he just goes on and on into this whole idea but then he says um he talks about the empirical method of figuring out a nation estate which is what we were just doing and then he says this empirical method to get at the truth is absolutely impracticable where national opinion is divided which is almost always the case what is the true opinion of the public of france that of the catholics or that instead of the freemasons and since i myself am russian to which of the national opinions should i sacrifice my own subjective ideas to that of official and officious russia the russia of today or instead to that which many millions of our old believers profess these true representatives of traditional russia the russia of the past for whom our current church and state are the empire of the antichrist he says or for that matter should we deliver ourselves over to the nihilists who possibly represent the future of russia so it's a short little book and it's really good and he talks about the nations as organs in this body of humanity and i think that's the best way to think about it actually oh and it recapitulates the body of christ he does and i guess what we essentially believe and not in the and not in the not in the not in the monstrous way that hobbes does with his with his initial viathan yeah so if you're plugged into christ the appropriately you can be an american and cherish that identity if it's in the hierarchy appropriately if it's not then it's pathological so the fractals have to be nested within each other appropriately in a sense and vertically and horizontally and in every direction that multi-directional i guess this is kind of like i've got i do have to get this back to work here but um i guess like my my sense is and it kind of flows out of some of the stuff i read in john bear right in his his insight i think is like one of the most earth-shattering ones i've ever heard and encountered is that creation is happening at the cross yeah that's happening at the cross also is that the leviathan and behemoth are being exposed and conquered that same chaos comp that we see in the creation motifs throughout the hebraic bible is playing itself out throughout history and so it's the cross that's overcoming that and it's the message of the cross of a god who's giving himself utterly for and as the life of its of his own creation and so you know to me like the the question of well how how do the nations escape the state i feel like it's it's that it's the enslavement to leviathan and behemoth and it's that creation that's groaning and languishing for this revelation of the sons and daughters of god and glory and so what what does that look like well it's the renovation that is taking place ontologically at the cross that is the new creation and which is the creation right and i think the cross is the synthesis of good and evil because it is god dying dying right through pain and suffering which is what we consider if you think about it in those terms i mean this is the way i've been thinking about it lately the christ is taking all all all of that coincidence of opposite that we live in a world of pain and suffering right and that we are loved by a good god a good god who is everywhere present filling all things and how to how do we reconcile those two things at the cross right and i think this has to do with with like time and space and i don't know if you remember when we were doing ml box uh apoc has drawn this idea of of time becoming space yeah um and also reminds me of robert jensen has a um has a line uh jed that kind of reminds me of like what we were talking about as well uh jensen says that time is a double helix with christ that is at its center and even quite quite literally when you do the cross right in orthodoxy everything is there right you have the the trinity right the father the son the holy spirit the divinity and the humanity of christ and then when you do your cross you reflect heaven earth your past and your future and you're there in the center your heart's in the center the cross is literally right here right here and everything's just folded into that yeah um okay guys i gotta i gotta jump off too yeah just one last yeah if i just like i think like that last thing you just said if i could just like a little closing remark i think that idea that like beating heart of of a real relational person i think that's the both the proper political subject and the proper the proper uh subject of time as well absolutely yeah because it's it's time and space too correct in the middle the appropriate mediation of time and space is christ yep right amen amen that's a great note to end on thank you thank you guys yeah sorry sorry went over a little bit no worries
