 Hi, this is Paul. Sorry for the lack of production lately. It's just a very busy time of year Yesterday or the day before I don't remember everything's just been a blur lately Jordan Peterson released his September patreon question and answer in August. They said this is September. I thought what no, it's August Don't tell me it's September yet. Can't be September yet, but it was August but he released September and it was a very good one even with the technical glitches he apparently is going to release the first conversation with Sam Harris on September 1 He answered a lot of very interesting questions Not a lot of questions actually but the questions he answered were quite interesting Especially the one with with Jung and the the one world. I thought that was a fascinating answer There are a lot of very interesting answers in this one and it was very much worthwhile Including the conversation about his his takeaways from from the Sam Harris talk now now someone someone Sent me a message and I'm gonna I haven't responded back to him yet. I just read it last night I think things have just been crazy busy It's the beginning of fantasy football season. So there are draft parties kids are going back to school My wife is stressing because she's got to get her classroom ready. It's just it's just just finished vacation So it's just it's just crazy busy right now But someone says, you know, is this is this is this too much Jordan Peterson? and my answer to that is is that my whole thing really isn't about Jordan Peterson himself and this Has this the kinds of things that Jordan Peterson? Was talking about or the kinds of things I've been thinking about for a very very long time and so as I mentioned to Jordan Peterson when I met him at the Sacramento book tour thing and the VIP thing after I thanked him because this has been one of the most productive and fruitful learning experiences of my life. I've been just learning a ton and So so this has brought up so many new smart and interesting conversation partners I can't keep up and some of you and you know who you are I'm not gonna out you you send me emails with links and conversations and I don't always have time to get back to you So, please please forgive me and be patient with me and so many interesting Conversations online and it's just been so so so much and and also new group Conversations in real life I was just talking Matt just texted me yesterday Matt's the guy who did the Jordan Peterson conversation a month or so ago and He lives in Fresno and they're gonna start a Fresno meetup and I'm gonna help them launch that on September 10 And he said and he didn't even he just put a thing up on meetup and he didn't pay any attention He just looked and 13 people signed up They had four people come up to Sacramento from Fresno. And so, you know, this thing just keeps going But again, this isn't just about Jordan Peterson what Jordan Peterson has managed to do is kind of I liken it to a wick a candle is a funny thing because the candle burns the wax But the wick is what makes gives the thing focus and center and that's in a sense what Jordan Peterson is doing He's kind of the wick for a bunch of conversations that have been pent up Culturally and it was the man in the moment boom right at the right time and there are all these conversations going and so this is I In a sense, I have to keep mentioning Jordan Peterson because he's like the wick and that's that's where people find each other Even our Jordan Peterson meetups here in Sacramento We have we always have the first two hours Which is our official meeting and then usually another two hours after that where those who want to stay until the last dog dies Hangs around hang around until I have to kick him out of the building But you know, this is what we're talking about and it isn't just about Jordan Peterson or his ideas what he's what he's facilitated Is the opportunity for a bunch of us to find each other and to give us a framework and a language and at least a starting Place from which to have a lot of interesting conversations that we've been thinking about and talking about But have been wanting to have and there's Freddie wanting to know if the Freddie and Paul show up Is that yes, Freddie I posted it yesterday. So So even in Sacramento, I'm doing some thinking about new types of forums to to host and creative ways because we've been doing the meetup thing for about 1213 times and that's that's going well and so that's gonna continue to go well But I'm thinking about online ways of doing things that I'm also thinking about how can we structure? Structure better Conversations with each other where you know again as a Christian pastor obviously for me I want to talk about the meaning of life the center of existence What's the basis of morality all of these questions that aren't just Christian questions? and this is part of where I'm gonna go with Plato and Augustine and and Dallas Willard and actually the the Jordan Peterson Question and question and answer in September led into some of that But again, I don't have I've got a lunch appointment in Fairfield So I just don't have time today or it seems like any day to actually make all the videos I want to make So here's some other very small channels that are really worthwhile listening to a node in a network he he friended me on Facebook early on and He's I think he's staying quasi anonymous. I don't know the deal and There's reason for people to do that but so he's he's doing some he's doing some Northrop fry things on Friday and he's now he's got maps of meaning Monday and You know, this is a smart guy and he's thinking through the stuff this particular guy is a Christian and he's thinking through these things And he's bringing in CS Lewis. He's doing a lot of the same stuff I don't have time to do but he's doing it. Well, so, you know subscribe to his channel. Give him a listen and And check him out if he if he suits your if he's if he's scratching where you're itching You know, you'll be blessed. So I've been enjoying listening to him and he's he's given me a taste of of Northrop fry So I picked up fries Fry's book the great code because it isn't in Kindle and So I'm I'm starting to make my way through this fry and Vico a lot of interesting stuff about Speech assumptions and and some really interesting things in there so If I'm if I'm not producing enough for you, you can go check out his channel You know Andy who I had a conversation with not too long ago Andy's is he gave up Christianity used to He says he can still speak in tongues and he used to be you know He went to oral Roberts University and so Andy kind of posted a response video to Jonathan Peugeot Conversation the conversation that I had with Jonathan again. Here's a here's a fun conversation partner that that we can debate some ideas And I say Andy the post Christian beard Sorry, I shouldn't name people but there's so many of you out there It's hard to keep you it's hard to keep you straight But you know, I watched Andy's I listened to Andy's video video last night and and thought he Well, I think you know God aspect one and and pushed back on Jonathan Peugeot Santa Claus existing and again This gets into the question of definition within a materialist frame And my questions for him back would be you know, what is the Disney corporation? Harari goes into this in his book sapiens about the Peugeot corporation, but the Disney corporation is immaterial And it is and it is you know, so Mickey Mouse the existence of Mickey Mouse is all in that What about the existence of Walt Disney now Walt Disney the man is dead Obviously, nobody here is going to deny that Walt Disney is a historical figure or that Miss Walt Disney did or did not do certain things But if you think about what a modern corporation is you get into this this God aspect number one And I think Andy was was talking about the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the Well there And now Jonathan has his own schema and Jonathan on Twitter mentioned some more Greek fathers than Andy should read I don't know if Andy's gonna read him or not. I hope he does. I haven't read him I'd like to read them, but I don't have time even to make the videos I want to make not not to mention read all the books. I want to read So, you know this God aspect one where? But but then also, you know, I a second example of God aspect one is uncle Sam does uncle Sam exist Well, uncle Sam was a was an idea that came up for you know army promotion But but uncle Sam has taken on an existence that is far greater uncle when we talk about uncle Sam we talk about the United States or nationalism or the American government and and you begin to realize that uncle Sam is a is a powerful powerful figure in terms of his capacity to To change the world and shape now remember I'm talking God aspect one here nationalism is a religion with a God but without God aspect two because uncle Sam Well does uncle Sam command does uncle Sam act and and this actually takes on a lot of a lot of resonance in terms of Bible conversations because there's a throughout the Bible there's this ongoing deep conversation about the status of the Lord and The book of Ezekiel actually lays this out and you can find this in my church channel I have a separate channel for all my church stuff if you don't know that When I was going through the the prophet Ezekiel, it's it's amazing how how so often the Lord is paralleled and and sees himself as as adversary against the other empires now, this is a Deep and complicated question, but when you get into God aspect one, you know Even setting aside personal agency Which is probably not the best phrase, but it's the best I got in this moment setting aside personal agency Which is the the Kvatch the the complaint that Sam Harris and and Andy have with respect to the existence of God as a person God aspect one is tremendously powerful and if you go back to my video where I talked about the anti the anti Anti the anti-masturbation God versus the axiomatic God This is this is the issue because in in many ways Jordan Peterson is bringing back God aspect one number one Shamelessly, he's far more hesitant about aspect number two But you know does uncle Sam exist. Do you pay your taxes? If there's a selective there if the draft comes do you show up? Do you argue about politics? Now you might say uncle Sam does not exist Yes, and no, but in many ways The state is God to in the modern frame and this is why politics has within a context of separation of church and state now in in our current secular frame Politics displaces religion and if you look at the if you look at mainline Christianity many within mainline Christianity see politics as the forum for action unlike less secularized God aspect to rich Say evangelical Christianity where now in the moral majority and even Billy Graham they got into politics That's there's a huge debate about whether or not that should have happened at all for the sake of the church for the sake of the community that really believes in God aspect to but You know, Jordan Peterson is coming online and saying, you know these these gods are real and they determine our lives and the degree to which we stand with respect to them Impacts us deeply and again, this is God aspect one My conversation with Jonathan was extremely interesting to me and you can if you look at that conversation you can see I at some point kind of took on the the question or the interrogator the interviewer and I I've I don't know to what degree Jonathan and I are on the same page of some of these things my ideas about angels and demons I Don't know if they're a little different from Jonathan's I don't want to get Jonathan into trouble because here's the thing about being part of a church community Which people don't like you can get into trouble for thought crimes in a church community a lot of the the vows and promises I take as a Christian for a minister regard belief as such and and profession as such and When I sign the Covenant of Office Bears in the Christian reformed church this sets me in a category where? To one degree I have to be careful about my speech and I have to be careful about my belief now this shapes Americans in a and to it to a great degree and and there are good reasons for that but this gets into the you know freedom of speech thought and and so what I do as a pastor is You know, there's a certain amount of jeopardy I take on making all of these long videos most of my colleagues are never gonna watch these because They're just simply gonna get bored with them or the Jordan Peterson stuff doesn't interest them or so on I do know some of my colleagues colleagues do listen because they tell me when they're working in the shop or whatever. So There's a lot going on in this conversation, but does Uncle Sam exist? Yeah, see that's that's and if you really Get if you really take that seriously and again peach Peterson doesn't get that into that directly in patreon September But if you listen carefully about this imaginary now, that's Charles Taylor's word this imaginary that we're living in People act as if Uncle Sam exists They live as if Uncle Sam exists. Uncle Sam is enormously powerful So they fight over the laws that Uncle Sam has and the power that Uncle Sam has to compel This is God aspect one in many ways Now I also noticed in Andy's You're gonna have to watch the casual use of a word like supernatural because once you say that word you evoke an entire imaginary Filled with all kinds of implicit assumptions now, maybe you're owning all of those assumptions But that's a that's a very deep. That's a very big package tied to that word supernatural and I I have similar issues with Jonathan was talking about consciousness and Supernatural consciousness spiritual or spirituality Especially consciousness and spiritual or spirituality. These are words. We use as social lubrication to avoid defining terms consciousness is Difficult to define and so we tend to throw it out there as is spiritual as Ways that will maybe sort of you know blunt some of the edges of differences between us It's their words that are often used. I'm not saying Jonathan use the word this way, but anytime someone I hear someone say consciousness or or spirituality, I Almost think that they've taken I took a lot of pictures on vacation like you used to do I almost think that they tape tend to unfocus the picture when they say that and that they unfocus It for social lubrication terms so that that we might get along better and I would rather have us Sharpen the terms and say okay. What exactly do you mean by consciousness Sam Harris? I've been doing some transcription of the first Sam Harris Jordan Peterson Vancouver talk just because sometimes when I take the time to actually transcribe what they say I I hear it better and I pay more attention to the words and I listen to what they say More attention to the words and I listen better. I've listened to that talk maybe four or five times now in audio format and I'm probably gonna listen to it some more because Peterson's gonna release it on September 1 and then I'll I'm not going to do use any video from that until it is released publicly and then I'll give it some of the treatment that I usually give it but These words when we use these words things tend to get the focus gets softer The resolution gets less and I think especially around some of these words same with God That's why I've got God aspect one God aspect two. We've got a tight. We've got a sharp in the focus We've got it. We've got to find out What's going on? so Supernatural again node in the network fry and Vico maybe Andy and the node in the network guy should start watching each other's videos because You know, there's a hierarchy and that's real so I've got 8,000 subscribers Jonathan Peugeot has 20,000 rebel wisdom has 20,000. These are two channels. I'm following closely and kind of stalking Jordan Peterson has 1.4 million These guys just have subscribers in the double digits. Well, okay, so find Conversation partners where you are in your hierarchy and make the most of those and don't worry so much what your status is And that's what I like about both of these guys. They're putting stuff out on their channel and they're having the conversation and It's always easier to talk down Well, it's easier to talk up to the hierarchy but have conversations down in the hierarchy and so You know, this is part of the reason why now I'm at an 8,000 level in the hierarchy I want to kind of elevate some of these guys from below because I think they've got I think they're making a contribution and I think they're modeling I Think they're modeling good things in terms of we can't all be way up on the hierarchy by definition of hierarchy So the the ethic is to practice Good citizenship at whatever rung you are on the hierarchy and I think especially as a Christian good citizenship means Bringing up those below you and probably, you know again, it's it's the opposite of What I call the relational polarity of the age of decay and gets into some of my own little lingo or nomenclature And and this is deep and this is deep into our culture So, you know I think Andy and note in the network and a network are both doing a good job of having conversations and so if you're looking for channels where you can Talk to the guy and leave comments and get a lot of feedback boy You got someone in the single digits you leave a comment you'll be his best friend. So so go ahead and do it The materialist language using terms for which your evidence is eroding I do really believe that Materialism started to die in the battlefields of World War one and It reached its peak in the late 19th century early at 20th century and it's and it's on its way out I think I think that's true in terms of science now I know obviously people say yeah Christianity died in the 16th century or the 15th century Okay This this is the point we can we can have differences we can have we can have differences of beliefs and still talk to one another that's I think critical and fun, so It's Paul Vanderkley a fundamentalist Boy I'm gonna have to come to terms with that word that word gets used a lot between Peterson and Sam Harris Andy used that with respect to me to what degree am I a fundamentalist now? There's a there's a cliche that says fundamentalist is always to the in Christian terms fundamentalist is always a word you yours to the person to your right or A person who's more literal? Well, you can decide what term you want to use for me. I won't take offense I don't consider myself a fundamentalist because I think Historically it relates to these these little pamphlets that came out early in the 20th century in the middle of the modernist liberal Liberalism conflict and these were the fundamentals So I would I would probably if you have to line all these things up I would probably subscribe to many of the fundamentals and that I believe in a bodily physical Historical resurrection of Jesus Christ and my biblical reading tends towards the conservative but not as conservative as some people would like I'm not as antithetical to to Evolution as some people would like I'm not as tribalistic with respect to treating with disdain other non-Calvinists or non Evangelicals I my relationship with the word evangelical is conflicted too But I am a I am a full-fledged believer in God aspect, too I believe Jesus came into a locked room and ate a fish and had Thomas touches hands and feet And if you've been listening to my videos, there's a reason why I believe this is in fact central And in fact since I have started this entire process through the Jordan Peterson thing I am probably more convinced of the historicity of the resurrection because in terms of my Developing worldview and it continues to develop I'm not dead yet in terms of my developing picture of my worldview It's I see it as increasingly even more Essential that the the central moment of history would be true at every layer of existence In other words, there was a relational layer. There was a physical layer. There was an emotional layer and that This this gets into this gets into my philosophy and my worldview and and my understanding of Christianity so Does that make me a fundamentalist depends on your definition of fundamentalist? I believe Jesus appeared to Paul of Tarsus on the road of Damascus and this is where we get into God aspect to of personal agency and Where it wasn't merely See now see when I talk this way I'm already talking within the materialist frame. Okay, and that bias is Again watch watch note in a network and watch him talk about Fry and Vico because I think that's really helpful And what he notes is that? Fry is heavy in the notes and maps of meaning and so early on a lot of Northrop Fry got baked in To Jordan Peterson and that's behind Some of what's going on here, so I Believe Jesus appeared to Paul of Tarsus on the road of Damascus was there phenomenology, of course But but I also believe that and this is where my Calvinism I'll often ask people why didn't God show up to the Apostle Paul before the stoning of Stephen God chose not to You mean you let Stephen die yes If you understand if you read the book of Acts very closely and you look at how Stephen is represented in the book of Acts Stephen is in many ways the most Christ like figure in the book of Acts Luke intentionally uses language. He used of Jesus in the book of Luke About Stephen in the book of Acts and and very much sets up Stephen stoning in some ways parallel to You know the passion of Jesus Christ and Stephen sees heaven open and all of this stuff and you might say well Well, God should have appeared to Paul before before Stephen was killed before he participated in it and I say That's up to God now when I'm talking like this. What am I saying? I'm using God as an agent God as an actor God as a chooser and this is exactly why people I get comments in the question sometimes Calvinism is a heresy. I used to subscribe to well, there you go. I Guess Calvinism is a heresy. I continue to subscribe to because Calvinism majors in in God's decision making and and I think reflects the Tenuous grasp we have on just about everything and that this long story is God's story now I do believe we are real agents and I do believe we have real responsibility And I do believe we have we have we have sufficient will to be accountable for our decisions, so You know, does that make me a fundamentalist? I don't know depends on your definition of a fundamentalist So I'm sorry about the paucity of content and some of you will say paucity of content Number of you were saying I couldn't keep up. Well, I've given you a little chance at it Number of you were saying I couldn't keep up. Well, I've given you a little chance to keep up You might get more chance to keep up Um, and I'm not saying because I feel a sense of indebtedness to you for more material I just want to make more videos and I don't have time and I'm frustrated by that So I'm making this little video to say I'm frustrated by it because I don't have time to make a longer one So I really want to make more and I have CS Lewis is out there and actually I I've started looking at some frances schaefer in terms of now I I know this is you're going to take away my funnel of analyst evangelical card for this But i've never been terribly impressed with francis schaefer. I like the project But I now maybe i'm gonna i'm gonna give him a deeper look and a fairer look now But often when I listen to him because i'm listening to the audiobooks or read him I'm not just not that impressed with schaefer now a number of you have said Peterson and schaefer are doing similar things. Yes So was plato so was augustin so was dallas willard because I want to bring more dallas willard in here So is cs lewis This is and these are the kinds of conversations that I that I mean But when I say this isn't just about jordan peterson this is about The most important conversations we can have it sounds trite But but these are conversations about the meaning of life these are conversations about What how we should choose to spend our lives these are conversations about the the foundations of our personhood and our action in the world to me these are the most exciting conversations the most fun conversations and what I love having is conversations with people about this and not You know and this is what's made this thing so fun and this is what's kind of coalesced around jordan peterson And this is what all of my videos are about jordan peterson again is acting like a wick and and around this wick and the light a lot of interesting Conversational partners are gathering and we're having a lot of interesting conversations And i'm thrilled by this and i'm thrilled to be a part of this so It's a busy time of year My wife and and some of my kids are going back to school or getting new jobs I've got more and more requests for conversations. I've kind of set up a system now to handle some of that We'll see how that works in the weeks going forward, but i've got tons of pent-up ideas online community conversations more face-to-face type events lots of stuff there Jordan peterson is releasing the sam harris video on september 1 It's just going to be more to do in a sense peterson also in the patreon thing kind of listed out a timeline so yeah the um No exodus until maybe november of 2019 Sad Because I want to get to the sermon on the mount because when i'm going to be looking at dallas willard and plato's republic and augustin and maybe bring in some francis schaeffer and some c.s lewis That's going to kind of revolve around uh, dk justice dekayosune righteousness What is plato's republic about really? And and most of you read the final the last books, but i'm going to spend some time on the first two books because I think actually There's a lot in the first two books that sets the stage for As plato sets up his you know, why is he talking about this city? Well This is going to get into the city of god and the city on a hill and and these cities and what's the relationship between? A person in a city there's a little tease on where i'm going with the republic. I'm also thinking last year I did a parenting through adulthood class I might do a class on on dallas willard plato's republic augustin city of god a lot of my church members I know this this is going to be complicated for the christian reform church that has a strong sabbatarian tradition But a lot of my church members even the one who grew up christian reform church They've lived in california and been corrupted by our culture so that They like going out to eat after church on sunday along with all the other baptists And they're smoking less and drinking less just like the baptists. Oh, it's assimilation into evangelicalism help us But anyway, i'm thinking about i've been trying to think i'm so what i'm doing. I got my meetups over here and You know, i'm getting so many people to the meetups and then the church is over here Now i'm a pastor. Do I want to bring the groups together? Yeah But i'm not going to do it in a way that forces anyone. I'm not going to do it in a way that guilts anyone or or Or twists anyone's arm. I'm Californian enough and liberal enough and american enough that I I I don't think it's productive So so i'm always looking to create spaces where where christians and non-christians can come together for Good conversations and justin briarley has been doing this in in an unbelievable for years But that's a radio show and he has high status people and so on and so forth I just like places where I just like places where we can do this in person and it isn't win or lose. It isn't debate necessarily Although there is some debate that goes on Um, it's friendships over the divide. It's getting to know each other because If you're a christian in northern california, you're not that different from the non-christians and vice versa And so let's and in other ways you are and so, you know, this is just very complicated. So What has again this whole video is about? Why this isn't just about jordan peterson because what jordan peterson has facilitated for me And in a sense the gifts the gift he's given me through this whole thing has just been the opportunity to talk to Guys like andy who is an atheist and that's fun for me. I like to hear what andy thinks and to and to talk to jonathan who's an he was a Orthodox icon carver for heaven's sake I mean when would that have happened and to talk to people in europe and to talk to people in australia? And to talk to people in fresno and to talk to people of all kinds of different backgrounds. And now i've always You know diversity to me. That's diversity That's just one aspect of diversity again, if you know my story that i've talked about plenty in my past videos I've lived diversity all my life. I love i'm high in openness I should post my I took a know yourself or whatever report jordan peterson's big five is and it's i'm a very extreme person I'm i'm like a 98 percent or a one percenter and a lot of these things I'm very high in openness. I'm very low in neuroticism And I love to get into the room and so when we talk about at our meetup What do we want out of these meetups? I tell them I talk a lot on my videos what I really want to do at the meetups Is listen I want to hear What real people have to say and and youtube does this and so Note in a network guy I get to listen to what he has to say and he He digs into northup fry because I don't have the time to and I learn stuff from him and and and andy choose on Jonathan peugeot santa claus videos and I learn things from andy and I learn things from jordan peterson and I learn Things from glenn laury. I was just listening to glenn laury this morning Love glenn laury You know I the more I listen to glenn ral laury the more I realize how much i'm on the same page with him even though I grew up, you know one of the first elections I really remember as a as a as an Was I 18 something like that 17 18 year old when billy when billy When when jimmy carter lost and rodald reagan won I was crestfallen. I've never been a you know, this is so but My church has diehard republicans and diehard democrats in it and we have no problem getting along Uh, we our church has has white folks and black folks rich folks and poor folks And and people who don't believe anything like calvinism They're in my church God bless them and and I have no problem if atheists want to come into my church and not sing any song and not put a Dime in the plate and sit and listen to the sermons and eat cake after church. You're more than welcome This is what I think the church should be this is what I think the church should do This is this is the gift jordan peterson has given to me And and again, I I pastors are liars. Yeah, but we're really thieves I'm gonna I'm gonna take this gift and I am gonna I'm gonna use the stuffing out of it It's going to become like the little dolly one of my daughters had she wore that dolly out I'm gonna wore i'm gonna wear this dolly out and um because this is for me An opportunity to have conversations and to learn and to enjoy and to meet new people and I mean, this is just tripping out my openness thing like like you wouldn't believe and so i'm gonna keep doing it. So There's an answer and i'll send you a link where we can have you know who I am whose question i'm addressing because you sent me a facebook message two days ago, um Or yesterday, I don't remember days are blowing together. It's been so doggone busy, but Yeah, there there's my answer and if you want to do an online conversation about it and probe me a little bit more I feel kind of bad. I was I was such a pastor to jonathan peugeot pastors They're not only when you look at the church and you look at the church and you look at the church Pastors are not only when we're liars we're thieves and we're nosy as heck You know a good pastor wants to get into your life But we do it gently we ask questions and then we probe because people just want to spill their guts and they do it and then Pastors like me are like, oh, that's interesting. I haven't seen that people think of pastors sit in their office and are Isolated oh gosh, I gotta keep moving isolated from the real things in the world That could hardly be the truth people walk into your office and tell you the most Incredibly private things and why because they need to unburden their souls Yeah, it's another rambly video and it's already longer than I expected it would be but You know, what does jordan peterson mean to me? So there's your uh, there's your summer school project or your summer vacation report So there it is This will be the video for today if I have chance to do another video today Maybe I will because like I said, i've got so many of them pent up in my head And i've had so many projects and I have only 24 hours a day and i've got you know, and i'm not when I say i've got my day job by no means hear me complaining because To to past there is To pastor a church is hard But there's no greater privilege when someone comes into your office when someone Opens up their heart to you and tells you Their pain their sorrow their joy There's there's no You know, there's no It's just such a beautiful gift and and as a pastor when you receive that you you treat it as As as a holy thing as a sacred thing because again as c.s. Lewis says you've never met You know, you've never met a person who isn't Who who isn't you know, we're clothed We're clothed in gosh now. I sound like a new ageer. I don't mean it like that. We're in nephesh Okay, we're one being I have a we have an integrated world but You know jordan peterson's the spark of the divine. It's the imago day. It's That there's there's you will never meet another greater thing than another human being Well, except for god, but what is god? God aspect one and two So call me a fundamentalist but so pastoring is pastoring is a Is an amazing thing one of the one of the one conversation I I remember with my father he was He was late in his career as a pastor and often by the time pastors get to my age they they get out of it because it is demanding and it is hard and They get tired of you know when I say When I say there's no greater privilege or no No greater honor someone gives you when they come in and they open up themselves a lot of what people just do at you is complain And it does get tiresome listening to people's complaints And and that's why I don't think I could be a therapist to sit in a room with people and listen to them for an hour I think I would um I think I'd want to pick them up sometime and shake them And i'm surprised peterson must have a great deal of self-control because we we know what's in his heart You know But he he obviously has as um has abilities to sit and listen to people and as scott alexander said He's an he's clearly an excellent teacher and he was probably an excellent therapist and And the loss of his private practice is a loss I'm sure i'm sure he helped and touched many people's lives But his mission is to touch way more people's lives And so this is this is what he's doing at his mission and again, I am rambling This is why I do powerpoint otherwise I will sit here and I will ramble and I will never end the video That's why I always tell freddy land the plane freddy freddy always wants me to call out the freddy and paul show watch the freddy and paul show but Maybe once a week we do the freddy and paul show.
