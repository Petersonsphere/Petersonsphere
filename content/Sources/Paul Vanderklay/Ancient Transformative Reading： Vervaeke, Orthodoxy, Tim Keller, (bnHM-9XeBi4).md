 Hi, this is Paul. John Vervecki this morning tweeted out a video by a channel called Equality Existence. This woman's been making videos for just about as long as I have and not a lot of subs on her channel, but John pointed this out, this video that she did going back over the conversation that John Vervecki and Jonathan Peugeot had and I thought I agreed with John, I agree with John Vervecki that this was a really, it was a quality video. She nicely, I mean she does, she did a lot of the kind of things that I did, but I thought she did it really well. She sort of walked through the conversation and slowed it down, which I know I really need to think it through and think about what they're saying and see if I really understand what John Vervecki and Jonathan Peugeot are saying and well, I'll play a little bit, a little clip of this later. This kind of jumps on a video that I planned out last week, but never had time to pull off. John Vervecki of course continues to do quite a few things beyond just the meaning crisis videos that he's been doing and what's been fun about some of these other videos is he gets into some of the things that we're gonna be getting a little bit later in the meaning crisis video. So I've been excited about that and and I haven't really kept up with doing necessarily commentary on the meaning crisis video partly because especially with John, he's laying all of this out systematically and I want to sort of see where he goes before so that I can contextualize the different parts. I've got some, I've got a lot to, when John and I talk, I'm sure we're gonna talk about the Protestant Reformation and some of those issues because it's actually sometimes when he's talking about Luther, I think he's really talking about Calvin and there's so much nuance and complexity and resolution within religious traditions that it's very very difficult to talk about them, especially with people who aren't immersed in those religious traditions for the conversations to be considered to be fair by people within the religious traditions. This is a continual problem and it's not just a problem with Christianity or Protestantism. It's a problem with me, let's say talking about Buddhism because compared to what I know about the history of Christianity of which I know and I can only know just a little bit, the same is true of my knowledge of some of these other religions that I'm not a participant or a practitioner or a player in and so that's what makes having these conversations just so incredibly difficult because there's so much that I will get wrong and in so many ways that I will, can probably rightly be perceived as being unfair to other people's religious traditions, just simply out of ignorance and judgmentalism and all kinds of flaws on my part and I'm not saying that's what John Vervecky is doing but it's so when Christians listen to Vervecky, there's especially from within a Christian tradition, it's gonna be difficult to sort of suss, to sort of work through but I've really appreciated his series partly because it's helped me see and get some inklings from a different perspective on how religious traditions work, not just Christianity but others and I've learned a tremendous amount through this series so at some point John and I are gonna have a conversation or maybe more than one and I look forward to that but I've kind of held off on that because I've, he's putting a lot out there and it really takes time to digest it and think about it and so often I comment on things unfairly because you're getting my first drafts in these videos and later upon further reflection I'll think, well, I probably shouldn't have said that, I think I was probably wrong but this is what it takes, what it means to have a conversation. He noted that Plato and I just today posted my conversation with Mark Vernon and I think some of the stuff that I'll be talking with Mark Vernon about will bear on this because Mark Vernon knows a lot about Plato, that's what he got his PhD in. There are these interesting transitions that happen, probably gonna have to do a words that fudge video on consciousness because all of these really big words I'm continuing to just wrestle with and try to work through but of course Owen Barfield had this idea that fossils, that words are fossils of consciousness and this is why we read, this is why we read ancient stuff, this is why C.S. Lewis advises people not to practice chronological snobbery but to read ancient material and to work through different perspectives of seeing the world today in a context that says it values multiculturalism, we so easily simply dismiss the vast majority of cultures that have ever been in the world that have been in the past and we and these are accessible to us in a limited way via their writings and their words and so we should we should plumb these depths. So for example Plato as during the transition of and Verveki runs through this nicely, you know in Egypt you've got the you've got the hieroglyphics, you've got the cuneiform and then when you get alphabets and and increasingly we outsource our information storage to texts and now via the internet and our smartphones at the meetup last night I was trying to think of something between Christianity and Mormonism and I pull out my smartphone and I pull up my blog because and someone quipped oh you're that's where you store all your knowledge well that's right I do store my knowledge on my blog and I I stored in my Kindle library and I stored in my YouTube files and all of this stuff so I gotta keep an eye on the time because I got a conversation in an hour and 15 minutes Not gonna have time to do this video anyway Plato was suspicious about writing and how it could change us and rightfully so and so he does these dialogues which which are a particular kind of writing and these these dialogues These dialogues are different than let's say reading poetry and and when she get into the Owen Barfield stuff and the Jordan Peterson stuff You're gonna you're gonna hear a lot about poetry because poetry is a different sort of writing and a lot of the Bible is poetry and most of the poetry in the Bible Christians who will who will say well the Bible is the Word of God and I believe it all of those things well vast portions of the Bible they simply ignore and Because it's hard you know that the prophets the Old Testament prophets are it's just all poetry and And most Christians just simply ignore it because they don't know what to do with it or they have a theological framework that in a sense Puts it over here and says oh you don't have to worry about that then you've got narrative which is which is another form of It's another form of writing obviously, but the point is the way that we the way that we encounter this biblical text the way that we encounter this spoken word most of us We can't help but approach it in a rather naive way Because the only way that we've known to approach it is the way that we've approached it and this is why Moving into another culture is really helpful living in another culture learning another language Anything that can get you out of the bubble of your culture will raise your awareness that there are multiple Cultures going on and this is this is not just true Horizontally in terms of all of the cultures around the world now, but it's very true historically Going back over cultures and people have seen the world through different eyes and We have this bias of course to we can't help but believe what we see and what we believe because that's just what it means to live But it's helpful then to study these other ways, but that's also disorienting because what pluralism does often is Enables a certain skepticism about ourselves. Can I really see the truth? Do I really know the right way is is is this is this really all there is? So around 1200 about 1200 BC John Vervecki talks of her 1200 AD Sorry, John Vervecki talks about this transition from Lectio Divina Into this more propositional form of reading. So let's listen to that part in this video. Okay, let's go back to dating at 1200 You said around yeah. Okay, what what happened around 1200? Well, what starts to happen is So notice we've talked about this indwelling internalization and and one of the one of the things we do because we're sort of natural-born cyborgs as Clark would say right is we have this kind of identification relationship to some technologies, right and And And not only physical technology, this is a physical technology we could we can do it with what I call psycho technologies This is a notion influenced by people like David Olson and Vygotsky and others Right like literacy is one of my prototypical examples. You're using literacy right now in your notes Right. And so what that does notice what you've done you've put your thoughts on paper So you don't have to you can reflect on your thoughts without having to hold it in working memory, right? You can go back and correct your thoughts You can correct you could connect previous instances of when you were thinking to instances now to future instances You could have me read it and connect your car. So just massively empowers your processing, right? So these psycho technologies and and we have some other examples of psycho technology numeracies another coding an example of psycho technology I would need to ask people but I imagine it is I imagine if they've started to Understand and think you know through so they if they've started internalizing and thinking in terms of coding and sort of You know so it has to be related to the cognition because it doesn't just it's not just what expands the amount that you do I guess that's technology. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's right. So so right Notice how like I said notice how second nature literacy is to if you try to if I asked you to look at those pages And don't cheat by like I'm focusing your eyes look at the marks and don't read them It's almost impossible for you to do that. It's become so internalized and it seems like it's innate It seems like it's it seems natural to you. It seems like it's natural to all of humans but that's not because of course for From overwhelming most of history for overwhelming most of humanity people were illiterate And there's still some people are anyway, and we have to and we have to teach people to become literate. Okay, so all of that, okay So how people relate to literacy and I think one of the things that drove the Axis Revolution was a change in literacy a change from hieroglyphic cuneiform literacy to alphabetic literacy And so when you see changes in how people relate to literacy that can help drive significant changes in our Cognition and even our consciousness how we understand ourselves how we understand the world I think that for example and I argue in the series that the change to alphabetic literacy helped to drive The the generation of the two world mythology So what I think one of the things that's happening in one of the things that there's many things All right, one of the things is helping in the 12th century And this is an argument. I think meant by Chatham, but I think he's citing somebody else. I think it's cons Anyways, the argument is people started to read differently and in the 12th century And what's interesting is I've taught myself to read in the way that they read before this change So the differences so the differences so the the the reading that I've learned it's called lectio divina It's it's still practiced in sort of And now this is when he said that I immediately caught my interest because Lectio divina has become a very popular thing in certain Protestant circles over the last 50 years or so Protestants in a way have been Undoing some of the Protestant Reformation and rediscovering ancient Christian practices like lectio divina like meditation like playing around with weekend monasticism You know Dallas Willard with his spiritual formation. I mean all of these things have been making inroads into the Protestant Church One of the one of our sister churches here in Sacramento just did a You know, they just did a little seminar and lectio divina. It's it's very very hot right now in a lot of Protestant groups and This fascinates me to hear well, and so then he starts talking about well What do you mean by these these different kinds of reading? religious and sort of neo-platonic communities, right so when I'm think about When I'm think about Here's where you probably might be doing it when you're reading a poem Right now you might just read it in your head and then what that tends to get you Thinking is right is that you know the the ideas and the meaning are in your head and you think of it largely Propositionally, but what you should do and in fact if you had a good teacher of poetry is poetry should be read aloud Right. You should read the poetry aloud because you're trying to use the meter and the rhythm Right and you know some poets will even use the graphic shape of the book So you're trying to use all of this stuff around the proposition to trigger these other aspects of knowing And and I think this has a lot to do with with YouTube Because YouTube is in a sense this new technology of deliverable Flat now when I talk a little bit about I'm gonna talk with burn power tomorrow about texture Because he had a very interesting video which was a recording of a lecture that he gave at Lebrie about texture, but but YouTube is in a sense a a revivic a vivification of the spoken word and So we're all experimenting in this now The perspective or the procedural the participant use the graphic shape of the pope So you're trying to use all of this stuff around the proposition to trigger these other aspects of knowing the procedural the participatory right and so people were reading and they were reciting Text and they were often reading in concert. So it was also right not just individual It was shared and communal and and of course if your Churches have been doing this stuff for a very long time and it's never what it was never It never stopped happening in church even in our very sparse liturgy at Living Stones Every Sunday we will read we will read part of our an entire psalm and we will read it together and we'll read it antiphonally and And the context of reading that psalm in the in the place of worship is very different from being at home reading it in your You know Protestant daily quiet time or whatever and so this stuff hasn't gone out of fashion It's just a lot of people have stepped out of it partly because as a culture we looked at and said I can read that at home not Recognizing not being aware enough that actually reading it together and practicing it communally is a different thing from From just reading it at home It's just not a matter of gaining the information and I think a lot of people Have given up on Bible reading because I thought well, I've read the Bible before well But we're doing something different often. I'll tell people who are People who are coming to me and they're trying to learn how to pray and I'll say well try praying the Psalms What do you mean? Well, well read the psalm if you're gonna bother anybody read the psalm out loud to God Well, that would feel word. Yeah, part of it is it's supposed to feel weird, especially at first and then you'd say well I read stuff in that psalm and I think well, I don't know if I should say that well, this is part of the this is part of the the Dislocation and the and the shaking up of of who you are. So This is this this stuff hasn't really gone away We're hearing that the one of the first people not the first people but somebody I think Caesar could read in his head And people thought he was a superhuman. Yeah, so It wasn't that common Yeah, and so see you and that's one of the reasons why we started invent inventing more and more sophisticated punctuation So that we could read in our head rather than having to read a lot because it's faster. Yeah, it's faster and It's a bunch more but it has its advantages but Yes, it has significant advantages, you know, I'm not saying to anybody stop silent reading But when what happens is right you you go through this change, right? Where you you go from I have to be participating involved I have to be going through a transformation as I'm engaging with the text like and that's what we often still read when I think Poetry properly we want to put the poem to transform us to change We're not just trying to get the information from the poem. We want to undergo some experience of transfer. It's related to faith or Doth The half. Yeah I know that has to do with Experiencing something. Yeah, that's that's participatory knowing so is this related or yes totally seems like it is so the half right the the the the the participatory knowing it's it's the so You see it in the Bible in the Old Testament Because because it's used it's used both of like a relationship like a faith as you said But it's also used as the term for sexual intercourse Because in sexual intercourse you become intermittently participatory with another human being you're actually conforming and you're you know There's deep perspectival engagement, right? And so Yeah that knowing by loving by having a loving interaction with something notice why that makes sense When I'm involved in these loops remember we did the addiction and it's narrowed well Well, well love is the other way, right? What loved what love does even when you're loving an object if I put it that way, right and then and Aaron showed this in his work This is mutually accelerating disclosure like so what happens is In addiction you get the reciprocal narrowing but in love you get the reciprocal opening up So I start to you get what I call reciprocal realization I start to realize more about my partner, right? And and that allows me to connect more deeply to her who started this idea you said in the cave in him Just which one that love opens up Point to what I mean the idea of it being mutually accelerating disclosure is a researcher called last name is Aaron Well, I think the idea it's just interesting. That's why I'm no no no I think the idea goes back people would want to research Yeah, the idea I think the idea goes back to Plato ultimately this because Plato sees a deep connection between love and wisdom and The process that Plato talked about his anagoga is this kind of reciprocal opening up, right? I you know his idea, you know when I look at beautiful things That that that that sort of transforms me and makes me a more beautiful person Which then allows me to see deeper and more more profound aspects of beauty that then you know sort of beautiful And what happens is it open ends up and that's what happens when you're in love with somebody, you know You you're getting to the depths of the person and that affords them getting to the depths of you and you you sort of reciprocally realize each other in very powerful ways So what happens is People start go from if you'll allow me this to extend this people go from reading the text in a loving manner Okay to reading the text in a purely propositional inferential manner now now this very much happened in the history of Christian theology and when you get to part of what happens in the West is that the vision of science and the I would say the acquisitive Spirit by which we attempted to grasp on to science Theology looked at that and said we need to keep up with this knowledge arms race And so what happened in theology is that theology took on this sort of? Scientist manner and and abandoned this love relationship with the text now again This was not completely abandoned it continued to be Practiced in churches and it continued to be practiced as individuals It wasn't abandoned but in some areas in terms of this is sort of where how culture works because as Jordan Peterson rightly notes we we keep an eye on each other with respect to status and we're highly tuned for that and so When we see science people gaining status anybody who has a score of agreeableness higher than 20 You know really starts getting pulled over there. Of course the low and agreeableness if you go to the Sacramento Jordan Peterson meetup you can meet a whole bunch of people at zero in agreeableness, but that's just that's just our group But but so so this so but again one of the benefits of religious traditions is that they're they're they're highly Conservative and you might say well, that's a problem. Well, it is and it isn't it's it isn't a problem when We for very bad reasons just start jettisoning a whole bunch of stuff that older generations knew was valuable We've lost the understanding of why they're valuable. So we simply jettison them now suddenly we realize everything that we've thrown away How is it reading in a loving manner if you read it out loud and you have the cadence and you? Try to get into how's that love because what you're trying to do you're giving it time Time and love are deeply connected because time is life and giving life is love You is you're trying to trigger right you're trying to trigger All aspects of your information processing that are much more procedural and Perspectival and but I mean because you're speaking you're listening So it's like the difference between reading a script and then acting out the script exactly exactly It's why and I tell people this all the time. I was telling my son this other day Don't read Shakespeare won't make any sense to you You have to go and see Shakespeare you have to go and you have to hear them and and see them Acting and moving around and see how the words are connected to their characters and they identity and then Shakespeare makes all this deep sense to you Now does this only apply to poetry like if you're reading a nonfiction book? So the shallows right there or what is an emotion? Yeah, are you going to act that out? And do you gain something from that? Well, I mean Well, you if it depends what my project is I mean again we What are my goals? What's the task? What's the set of problems? I'm trying to solve right? I Think some philosophical texts are Should be read in this fashion. I mean, I think there's a good reason why Plato wrote in dialogue I think there's a good reason why Plato wrote in dialogue Should be read in this fashion I mean, I think there's a good reason why Plato wrote in dialogues as rather than just in a simple Yeah, I've always found that strange. Yeah, because he's trying to trigger the perspectival, right and the and the participatory And he's trying to get you he's trying to put you into the kind of knowing that would allow you to indwell the dialogue and internalize Socrates and What's interesting is we don't know that Plato knew he was doing that Necessarily consciously maybe he did maybe he didn't but but this is what we do we especially when we practice things from the past We don't know why we're doing it and and and we had a phase Over the last hundred years or so when if you couldn't say why you're doing it Then there isn't a good reason and this this idea has been stuck in our culture and it's really an idea that has to go And I'm not saying we shouldn't think critically and examine but just not having an idea Is is sometimes not sufficient for casting something out? No, let's go back to it People start reading differently and they start and they and so this starts to come to the floor The idea that I can get information without having to go through transformation Okay, you say okay. That's really important. I can get information without going to transformation now I'm gonna have to probably this week make another video on on Jordan Peterson and his believing in God thing because he did a longer Thing on that and I posted a little something on Twitter but I want to dig into that for for because what Peterson in a sense says there is that I Shouldn't say I believe in God because I have not been transformed by God According to this image that Jordan has about about what God is so That what John Vervecki said right there is critically important. So I'll play it again Okay, and it starts to come to the floor the idea that I can get information Without having to go through transformation and and I think part of the truth of that is Information does transform us and and we know that and we have that built into this little phrase. I can't unsee that Because that information just that image just that visual And and this is in comedy I walked in and saw my parents having sex I can't unsee that or or You see your wife cheating on you. You can't unsee that information is transformation and in our information age we have We have denied that at our peril at the same time we treat information as As just a consumable without respecting the transformation. So in a sense that there's there's problems on both sides of that Okay, you say okay who cares, okay What are most of the texts the texts are religious texts clearly it's 12th century, okay And this is this is this is an idea that you know The Jinsun Kim and I talk about a lot, right? And I I Owe a lot to to him about this right, but it but it's also in cons as work and Chatham's work, right? It used to be that you could only Gain access if this is in the right word to God the deepest reality. You can only have that knowing by going through transformation so theology was always linked to the process of spiritual transformation and and this What he said just right there is key because what one of the things that happened when Theology decided it wanted to be a science just like all the other sciences is it Destroyed that link a couple years ago one of our one of our pastors the pastor over in Davis said I want to start a Monest a cemetery. It said what do you mean? You want to start a cemetery because throughout the history of the church Pastors have been trained within the church and and what happens After the Reformation the ways after the reformation is that Pastors get trained in schools now It's important to remember that schools used to be monasteries in a sense. And so this this relationship between knowledge and God Has has been a very complex one throughout history But you know what he said right there is is crucial in that Knowing by going through transformation So theology was always linked to the process of spiritual transformation But what starts to happen is I can do theology I can generate propositions and beliefs about God without having to go through any transformation So theology gets divorced from self transcendent around the year 12. Yeah, that's when it starts happening Why because the reading is changing and the reading change because And and I'm well This is one of the areas I want to talk to John about because I want to know a lot more about this and so I'm Waiting for him to get into this in his series because I'm probably gonna want to take a look at some of the books He's good at giving book references. And so as this is something I'm very curious about Peugeot has said something very similar to it I believe for reasons you said I mean there's many ways in which I can I can make my reading much more efficient Much more effective. I can consume more information right if I if I read in this silent Prashan, but now I start to think of myself inside my head and that I am my beliefs and that Meaning is in the propositions in my head rather than the meaning that was carried in My in this reciprocal realization between me and the text and this mutual transformation, right? So now there's a separation. That's right And then and at the same time Aristotle's being rediscovered, right and so Aristotle is Like to the ancient world. He's science. He literally writes all the books on science like literally right and so When Aristotle's being rediscovered, you know, you've got all this scientific knowledge that's coming in and it can't be ignored by the Christian church Right. It can't be ignored because of the authority they give to the ancient world And I've been reading about this actually recently at first Aristotle was banned and then of course he was embraced and Thomas Aquinas then Creates a synthesis also because you know Aristotle and Plato, you know had deep influences on people like Augustine And so they can't just ignore Aristotle, but they can't simply assimilate So they've already respected Aristotle or the great respect for Aristotle that has been set up within sort of some of it's in the warp Of you know the way in which Christianity had integrated with the platonic tradition around what year was the integration with the platonic tradition starts much much earlier Well, no, that's much later I mean, I'm Kevin I'm actually getting to Aquinas in this picture that we're talking about but no this is much earlier you're seeing this in the you know in the third and fourth century and and most especially in the fifth century with Augustine Augustine is the person that really fuses Christianity and Platonism together, but you're also seeing it in In Eastern Christianity, you're seeing it was pseudo Dionysus. When you say he's fusing it It's not as if he's taking passages from Aristotle putting it in the Bible No, no, what you mean is he's respecting their line of thinking and then applying it to the Bible. Yes, so In fact Augustine famously argued that he could not have become a Christian until he was exposed to Platonism Because Plato's way of thinking about like the upper world right the platonic way of thinking like the idealized world Yeah, yeah that that gave August because Augustine was a very much sort of a materialist in his way of thinking and he Couldn't get into Christianity because he didn't know how to relate to this God that was this invisible unseeable He was an atheist before no, he's a Manichaeanist He falls he follows the religion of Manny which was a very sort of dualistic very materialistic especially his version of it Well start there I sometimes forget exactly where I've I want to I want to dip out of these things now along the way and again I think people throw such fun things at me so I'm doing the Gospel of John in my adult Sunday school class and So someone shoots me this From st. Elijah Church somewhere in Middle America this wonderful series Very long series, of course I love a very long series very long series on the Gospel of John and I was listening to this video and I thought This is exactly what verveky is talking about. So let's let's let's listen to some of this The ancient church Use the the word Passover the word Passover in Hebrew is Pesach You put that into Greek and it's pascha and that is the word that the Eastern Church has always used The Western Church uses the word Easter. So when I say pascha, I mean what the West means by Easter So we have pascha and at pascha all Converts were baptized on Holy Saturday Before we had pascha beginning at midnight Easter service held at midnight in which they would receive their first Eucharist. So you had baptism and Eucharist Centering here on Holy Saturday of Holy Week Holy Week would have been the week immediately before That Sunday pascha Sunday and then we had a period here That we call Great Lent That's Where we're talking about now The oral instruction took places in two stages the first stage of instruction catechesis occurred during the seven weeks of Lent and Holy Week prior to their baptism chrismation on Holy Saturday the catechumens were called Photosominoid to be enlightened ones photo Sominoid after their baptism and first Eucharist the newly Baptized were called Neophotistoid the newly enlightened ones They now entered the second stage of instruction Mystagogy so here is pascha all of this catechesis learning the story of Christ the from his baptism all the way up to Holy Week and Then here getting baptized and receiving the body and blood of Christ at Eucharist is now going to be followed on this side by mystagogy Mystagogy instruction up to the day of Pentecost 50 days after pascha Now it's important to note that this and he's going to talk about the gospel of Mark and then Matthew and Luke Alongside with the gospel of Mark. That's the catechesis. That's the preparation for Baptism and formal inclusion into the church and then mystagogy instruction is the gospel of John Which follows from that now now it's important to recognize that this When we think about catechesis and this is very interesting for me because of course in the Protestant tradition We have a Heidelberg catechism, which is which functions similarly But when I think about what's in the gospel of Mark versus what's in the Heidelberg catechism It's very interesting and it leads me into Dallas Willard land and reading Dallas Willard's best book the the divine conspiracy, but It's fascinating here how it's important to think about that again, if you look at these traditions you talk to Jonathan Peugeot or now that I have a number of People I know through the meetup that are undergoing catechesis within the Orthodox Church It's interesting to me how You know that again the the way Why when you go to an Orthodox Church you have to stand through all that liturgy and One of the one of the members of my meetup it was After Holy Week comes and holds up this big book He said we just did this whole book in liturgy and and again the point from the verveky thing Is that they didn't just sit there and read through it. Okay, I read through this book. I know it It's a different kind of knowledge as a community You're standing up there and again when in an Orthodox Church or you're under you're within this building and and you're within all of this and actually Jonathan Peugeot goes into this in the clips that quality existence plays of that verveky Verveky pageau video. So I very much recommend listening to it. It's a nice way to kind of Understand that verveky pageau interview that happened and so Jonathan Peugeot says, you know I want to get into this place and I want to I want to be surrounded by this I want to get immersed in this I want to be in the story in this way During the seven weeks following Pascha the newly baptized then received mystagogic instruction into the meaning of their faith and Into experiencing the presence of the risen Savior in their lives Now listen to the language here. Okay into the meaning of their faith into Experiencing the presence of the Savior in their lives. How are they going to do this? They're going to do it something much more similar to lectio divina not exactly because obviously lectio divina, especially within the Western tradition as a specific understanding, but The same technology is going to be used The ancient mystagogic instruction of the church is found in John's Gospel the synoptic Gospels grew out of the Lenten Catechesis of those preparing for baptism the synoptics make sure believers know the story of Jesus John's mystagogic Gospel grew out of the Mystagogic instruction of the newly baptized given between Pascha and Pentecost the mystagogic Gospel takes believers into a deeper understanding of the resurrected Jesus who is present in our midst today John created a mystagogic Gospel that allowed his listeners to participate in enter into and experience The one who is truth itself the truth that is the Gospel You see there is no past tense to the resurrection The resurrection is transformative The risen Savior still opens the eyes of believers to understand the scriptures Jesus was not an add-on to the ancient Israelite story he is the story all along Now now some of you who are Protestants and listening to this you I'm not gonna do it right now But I could pull up Kim Keller quotes that say nearly the same thing CS Lewis quotes that say nearly the same thing the point of the resurrection is not as And again, I gotta be careful with this Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris Focus on well, maybe did Jesus rise from the dead and again if you've listened to any of my videos You know what I believe about this and you know what I believe about the importance of this about the physical resurrection of Jesus so don't take what I'm about to say as Anything taking away from that but that event the importance of it does not in fact is not in fact exhausted by the event That's part of Christian theology in fact Christians lived within the resurrection that's that's what happens in Christian theology and so And this gets into you know people would sometimes ask me well well even if Jesus rose from the dead 2,000 years ago So what if I can't lay my hands on him now, and if I don't see him you know turning Turning water to wine if I don't see him stilling a storm or walking on the walking on the sea You know I don't care That's that's a framing of Reference a framing of the world that like many of our friends We can't see it gets the frame within which they live But my point here about what he just said about the resurrection is this isn't something that only the Orthodox Church believes This is this is this is common to this is mere Christianity The things written in the Old Testament are about Jesus That now that some of the dispensationalist I think wander off the trail on this mark But the understanding of the Old Testament that he just asserted the Orthodox Church believes that the Catholic Church believes that some of the older Presbyterian Protestant churches believe in including my tradition that that then you again I can pull up temp plenty of Tim Keller Sermons where he basically says what Jesus does after the resurrection is open their eyes to the scriptures. That's what the resurrection does Even as Peter took his stand with the Apostles on the day of Pentecost John took his stand with Peter and Paul Matthew Mark and Luke and Proclaimed the gospel shared in common within the church You search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and These are they which testify of me But you are not willing to come to me that you may have life John's gospel is not a book to be studied John did not write more scripture to be searched It isn't the words on the written page that give life John's gospel is mystagogic it offers the opportunity to enter into and experience the very things being described and discussed Now there is value in reading John's gospel piously just just reading it and There is value in reading it academically But for those Desiring to enter into the fullness of this gospel and for those asking for more than what they have Jesus still says come and see John's gospel is mystagogic. He offers a journey to be taken a journey to see Jesus Two thousand years later Hungry and thirsty people still come saying sir. We wish to see Jesus the experience and illumination gained remain ineffable and cannot be quantified or reduced to academic conclusions or literary Documents right there what he said right there is really important they remain ineffable Now what does he mean by that? in a sense what he's saying is that You can't take this and Exhaust it with words. All right There is it's it's it's basically what verbecky is talking about that there's another layer here going on and in fact The practice that the way that you regard the way that you live with the text is Put is is a different thing than just just the words themselves This is a journey not to understand a book But a journey to meet a person This is a journey to see Jesus. It is also a journey with Jesus it is a journey into the mystery of his truth Mystic odgy cast catechism and mystic odgy part two Okay, so that's how far as far as we'll go with that, but you can see and in fact if you if you didn't see well some of the interesting stuff in here is also about in scripturation, which I just started the I just started the gospel of John in my Sunday school class and noticing where this begins this begins at in the gospel of John begins even with a prologue we're already in a sense into John the Baptist and the baptism of Jesus and Thinking about that was really helpful in terms of fleshing out. Oh Why are these books shaped the way they are because that's that's a constant conversation among scholars Why are these books shaped the way they are and and when you understand it within the life of a community? Well, it begins to make a lot more sense and and you understand Participation via liturgy in terms of community in terms of what John Ravichy just said again It begins to make a lot more sense now John was just on rebel wisdom with the things I talk about the series is the dip with Jordan Hall and Again very similar to what we just heard but a little bit different So I wanted to play this to in which people read text for example as an example Just try to start deepening the metaphor. So I compare how we read text we read we tend to read text Right in a consummatory fashion. We're taking in the propositions We're looking for the in sort of the logical coherence between the propositions in our head and we're sort of living inside of our Head in that way and then before that Typified in people do in lectio divina, right was this this reading that was recitation it was done communally and Right, and it's meant to be participatory like the way you read a poem or the way you you sort of set yourself to appreciate music Now it's it's also important to recognize that even I mean, this is so recent When I was growing up we'd sit around the table and we'd have dinner and my father sometimes would recite poems that he learned in His public one-room schoolhouse in the middle of the prairie growing up in the 19 He was born in okay. So he was in the late 30s early 40s when he was growing up That was a part of education now. We have changed education in this country to the part where we no longer Practice rote memorization partly because when we have all these books around us and so we can keep the information in these books But but something else is lost in the losing of in the losing of that practice and and people have known that but I don't Know that we've known all that we've lost in that practice And and then the whole point of that was not just to take in the information and consume it but the idea was that you could actually only approach the reality that the words were referring to if you were allowed something other than just The semantic content to engage you in a transformative process, right? So it was very much this idea that you can't these deeper realities require a Transformation before we can appropriately grasp, you know the meaning of the words that are being uttered and so The the and so Kranz and others talk about, you know, the notion of the self was a much more extensive notion It was involved with others and with the text rather than being sort of locked inside the head and locked inside the propositions and this is where You know we could get into at some point probably into some of the barfield stuff because even even even the notion of the self You again you hear plenty I could quote plenty of Tim Keller for this your identity was received. It wasn't achieved You were you were always a part of your community This is this is your identity you didn't have to develop this yourself and and it was built into the text And so if you know Julian in the comment section I've had Julian on the channel a couple times and should have mine again sometime You know Julian is a hutterite and he's so he is embedded very much within his religious community and so the community in the text and and Julian, you know Julian welds dumpsters and you think well why such a sharp young man Why is he welding dumpsters because part of the communal tradition is working with his hands and that leaves him time to listen to my videos What a wonderful thing but but this is and it breaks us out of this our the little bubble which is 2019 and whatever little space you are and which for many of us is just within our little heads now why all of this is relevant to me and I think to our conversation is because Right one of the core aspects of what people reliably seem to be pointing towards when they're seeking meaning is this sense of deep connectedness connectedness to themselves to each other and to a reality that in some sense is Is greater than them and it's interesting because I think This is what it seems to me I think you're doing something very Analogous with spoken discourse as what people were trying we're doing with the the reading which was also being spoken by the way What I mean by that is you're trying to bring back right the connectedness of the communication process now It'll go into that more and you should you should watch that video But but he's exactly right the connectedness of this process now part of what's happened In let's say the history of the Christian from church these Dutch immigrants came to the United States in the latter part of the 19th early part of the 20th century and and they shared a common language different from the outside world They shared a common community. They created institutions They did all of this stuff that the the catechism Bible reading Piatistic practices all of this gave people an incredible sense of community and meaning and they were able to build institutions and do all of this Part of what happened was that the rest of the world came in you had newspapers and radio and then television and now the internet and so and So we we don't know what we are what community we're a part of and I think increasingly that that community is mediated by the by our social networks and the smartphone and Okay, what's gonna be the ramifications of this? I? I Don't know that we I don't know that we know now One of the things that I picked up, you know, Victor Frankel in the meaning crisis Victor Frankel during You know Victor Frankel survived the death camps and and very much understood the meaning crisis because it was it was right there Nothing will focus you like a concentration camp and and the meaning crisis and Victor Frankel if you've never read man's search for meaning By Victor Frankel, it's a it's a must-read Because he you know, he basically notes that people with meaning people with purpose that can't be touched from by the by your By the people imprisoning you they survived those who didn't have that they didn't make it Bringing to a Very narrow path a very narrow window which is for us to make it as a species through the Exterior aspects of the crisis that we find Now now now Jordan Hall and John Verbeke were talking about threats that threaten us that that we are especially in this kind of media media Context we have and there's been a lot of attention paid to the media context because we we we're increasingly aware that the The Those who are serving up the really the agendas of our lives What is their agenda and You know, there's tremendous conversation right now about Google And what is Google's agenda and the Google's just been kicked out of the Pride Parade in San Francisco because The organizers of the Pride Parade don't believe that Google is sufficiently Down with their program because they haven't clamped down on on Crowder and others And so, you know all of this is going on and so you have the question of what community are we living within? What in fact are the egg-sharing? Are we living within what in fact are the existential threats that we face because dependent on the frame here Whatever your frame here that will determine what you respond and how you live we must as individuals first make it through the interior crisis of becoming transformed and to be allowing ourselves to be Intimately and vulnerably transformed by the reality that is in fact simply there And I like Jordan Hall's phrasing here because he nicely showed the connection which I which is so often lost between the interior and the exterior that that Be transformed by the renewal of your heart the Apostle Paul says in Romans 12. So Well, we're gonna get into that in a minute And to be in relationship with it with nothing between us and it so that we can at long last respond to what is really happening and discovery in ourselves that Capacity to be responsive to what is really happening, which is such a funny thing. Like it's literally right there Right in front of us. It's at our hands It's really a choice to be able to reach out and grab the response to the meeting crisis Now Of course, you're gonna have the question. Well, how do we know what the real threats are? Because I think part of for example the The the losses experienced by the church have been a skepticism about the threats that Church leadership have asserted And Others to have so these things that you said were evil I Went into them and they didn't seem evil at all. They were life-giving and this is So right away you have this question of orientation So the meeting crisis has to do with the internal and the external. Well, how can we know? One of the things that I had a The hopefully I'll get the video of the CS Lewis presentation that I did last week but one of the one of the members of our meetup was in the car with us and and sharing you know, share he was these he's using Sam Harris's meditation app and and I was I was I was very interested in this because What you learn with the meditation app is you you learn to practice a psycho technology and it's been put on your smartphone And you can you know, you can learn how to meditate and what was interesting to me is okay When do you deploy this? Well, well we deploy it when when we're experiencing stress or anxiety Or something is upsetting us and and and we want to be Zen and it's like a it's like a pocket superpower And you can once you once you get trained in accessing a certain a certain level of now again We got this fudgy word consciousness once I enter this realm of consciousness Then when when I might instinctively be reactive now because of this led this this this new pocket superpower I have I can go into a Zen state and I cannot be reactive and and now I think a lot of that is good because Certainly we are suffering from a whole lot of reactivity all around us that is dealing with violence and all sorts of things And and one of the things that Victor Frankel noted in in the meaning crisis that he was pointing out You know in the in the mid-century was you know, three major societal ills aggression addiction and depression And we would have to add anxiety to that and and so then that it's it's a powerful thing and we look at it As well This is a good if I can just you know I have this mental this pocket superpower where when I feel myself getting anxious then I can Go into a Zen state when I feel myself getting reactive then I can calm down It doesn't answer the question though because there are sometimes you should be reactive and sometimes you shouldn't and and You certainly need the capacity to not be simply To not be simply to be covered with buttons and out of the world pushing them That certainly you don't want to be but when do you need to be when do you need to react and how? Having the superpower doesn't answer that question One of my favorite examples of this is a section from Tim Keller's book on preaching where he tells this little story He's talking about that what I call the secret sacred self There are many severe problems with the with the sovereign self as a philosophy of life to begin with it assumes that we know What we want and our inner desires are you know in our inner desires are coherent and that our inner desires are inner are coherent and harmonious Modernity tells us to discover your deepest desires and to fulfill them But our deepest desires often conflict with one another a desire for a stellar career will often be in conflict with the desire for a particular Relationship and our feelings constantly shift so an identity based on our feelings will be unstable and incoherent So again, I mean you have to listen to your feelings, but your feelings can't be your master So so how can we deal with feelings? Well, maybe I'll have my superpower to numb my feelings. Well, that's okay that's certainly a better way than using alcohol to numb your feelings or pot to manage your feelings or or Netflix to always manage your feelings And even more serious problem is that an identity based on expressing ourselves without listening to the outside Dictates is actually an illusion a popular exponent of the sovereign self is Gail She she he in books like the seminal passages in 1976 She insists that you can become yourself only when you can look inside and express yourself from an external from any external valuations and Predations this is patently impossible and and Keller is exactly right here Imagine an Anglo-Saxon warrior in Britain AD 800. He has two very strong inner impulses and feelings One is aggression. He loves to smash and kill people when they show him disrespect Living in a shame and honor culture with its warrior ethic He will identify with that feeling he will say to himself. That's me. That's who I am I will express that he won't really because he's living completely embedded within that culture He didn't even have to say that to himself. It's just who he is The other feeling he senses is same-sex attraction. So you got the gay Anglo-Saxon warrior from Britain AD 800 To that he will say that's not me. I will control and suppress that impulse now imagine a young man walking around Manhattan today He has the same two impulses both equally strong both difficult to control What will he say? He will look at the aggression and think that's not who I want to be and he will seek deliverance and therapy and anger management Programs he will look at a sexual desire. However and conclude that's who I am What does this thought experiment show us primarily it reveals that we do not get our identity simply from within Whether we receive some Interpretive moral grid lay it down over our various feelings and impulses and sift them through it This grid helps us decide which feelings are me and which should be expressed and which and which are not and should not be expressed So this grid so this grid of interpretive belief Not an innate unadulterated expression of our feelings is what shapes our identity Despite protests to the contrary we instinctively know how inner depths are We just instinctively know our inner depths are insufficient to guide us We need some standard or rule from outside to help us sort out the warring impulses of the interior life and Where do our and where do our Anglo-Saxon warrior and our modern Manhattan man get their grits from their cultures their communities? They're heroic stories. They are actually not simply choosing to be themselves They are filtering their feelings jettisoning some and embracing others They're choosing to be the selves their cultures tell them they may be in the end an identity based Independently on our own inner feelings is impossible The reality is that we can no more bestow dignity on ourselves than I on ourselves than identity In fact, they go together in the need for recognition Charles Taylor quotes Gail Sheehy's book and her counsel that we must not care what others think But that we must bestow the verdict of significance on ourselves Taylor argues that this too is an impossibility You cannot get significance through self recognition. It must come in great measure from others. This is why we need community in The end you can't name yourself or bless yourself. You can't ultimately say to yourself I don't care that everyone thinks everyone I know thinks I'm a monster I love myself and that's all that matters that would not convince us of our worth unless we were mentally unsound We need someone from outside to say we are of greater worth and the greater worth of the person telling us So the more powerful that recognition is to our identity formation This is where I'm probably gonna get I really want to get with John Vervecki and talk about Luther because he says well Luther That's just narcissism because someone arbitrarily is giving you worth and I think we're gonna have to process this together because Keller is sort of half Lutheran half Calvinist And so Keller kind of shifts between those two quite a bit So if we try to authenticate and validate ourselves we place ourselves in an infinite loop of delusion that will lead to either Narcissism or self-loathing so actually Keller and Vervecki have some of the same concerns about narcissism the unshakable need for external Affirmation and recognition along with the current denial of this fact of human nature puts enormous pressure on the late modern self in traditional Societies if you are simply a good son or daughter husband or wife farmer or mother you are doing all your society required That could be smothering and confining, but the bar for recognition was not Impossibly high and they experienced a ton of meaning the modern process of identity formation However tells you to go out and create a self from scratch You must identify your dreams especially the most vivid ones and to fulfill them or feel like a failure That prospect crushes those in many segments of our society where money looks power success sophistication and romantic love are all all become not just good things but necessary identity factors and Here is where Christianity's offer can be recognized as so liberating in biblical terms We are all socially independent and worthy Interdependent and worthy beings because we were made in the image of the triune God the Imago Dei This means that our value is both inherent it comes It it comes simply from being human and contingent. It reminds us how dependent we are upon God It is an identity that is not achieved but received Likewise in the gospel in the work of Christ that identity is baptized into something even greater It is not achieved through our performance of social roles or through our fulfilling of religious and moral Standards or through our success and achievement of status it is found in him now right there. What do you mean by that? That's tough How do you understand that? Got 15 minutes until my conversation Not having a ret not having a record of my own that comes from my performance and effort But that which through fit comes through faith in Christ the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith paraphrase of Philippians 3 9 so Obviously that's something that I'm gonna have to talk about in other times and in other places But there's the Christian the Christian method and that's that's a nice shorthand of where Tim Keller Goes now I want to come back to this and I want to play her ending because I was I was really touched by it Because it it speaks of I hear a lot of this. I hear a lot of this both in the meetups and in the conversations and and so when I when I think about For vaki and Peugeot, they both have I'm kind of so you got verveky here and Peugeot here I'm kind of in the middle of them as a Protestant and and and working this through because I Really sympathize with what John verveky has to say because John would say, you know, you can't go back and he's right We can't unlearn and so any process which is a simply going back I don't think will will get us there and and I think this is in fact part of The way the world works as I mentioned before I'm reading this this book that that Ron Dart recommended which is basically a story of Erasmus and Luther and and and you know, so one of the earlier things that talked about the fact that you know when when Aristotle really comes on the scene and in medieval Europe Well, there's a crisis and first the church wants to kind of close them off So you're not allowed to read Aristotle. Yeah, but that just makes all the scholars really read them So they're reading him secretly so then they open it up and then of course You've got Thomas Aquinas doing a synthesis of Aristotle and it becomes the doctrine of the church and and then you get to Galileo I mean Galileo gets in trouble for defying church teaching, but it's not biblical teaching. It's Aristotelian framing of the universe so We can't simply go back but I Think I don't think before us is just blue skies either There is in fact a reality and the goal is to get in touch with reality Reality and obviously have a Christian minister and lay my cards on the table But you know when I when I listen to I don't know her first name or her last name But when I listen to her talk, I really sympathize because a lot are coming to me saying similar things So let's hear what she has to say Verveky indicates a need for communities which he calls wisdom institutions to be created where people can come together and cultivate Anagagai this may also Consist of classes or Dharma talks. Let's just say Peugeot sees the breakdown and resurrection of meaning already built into the grand hero narrative of Christianity and that Christianity descends and is reborn we continue to follow the rituals and this is the true true difference. I think between Jordan Peterson and verveky which I I got this wrong last time. I said that Peterson was a ritual and For veky was experiential, but what what it seems like is that? Is that the ritual is important in both regards one to induce Anagagai the other to embody the narrative, but there's no Anagagai, of course, and I think she lays this out beautifully should watch the video She's only got 85 or 100 views on it. So let's let's give her a few hundred folks Encourage her because she's been at this a long time and you know She hasn't got anywhere near as much encouragement as I have but she's basically doing the same thing She's working stuff out. But you know, the anagagai is the leaving the cave Well, that means that means leaving the cave and Get this new watch and if I sit too long it tells me to do stuff and I started talking with my hands and now It says good job. You've done your exercise. I guess I got my heart rate up But leaving the cave but but you leave the cave out into the real world and the difficulty that we have currently Partly because of pluralism is we don't know what the real world is And so of course we've got science and now we're we're seeing that science has left out the subject and you You can't leave out the subject without leaving all of us behind That's more or less the point of of everything that I've said about the monarchical vision once you imagine you've achieved it You've already contaminated your clean room because of course you brought subjectivity into it because how couldn't you and that's the point of the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris talks So so we want to leave the cave. Well, how do we leave the cave? Well, well, what is truth? Crossover in these two which makes it so interesting so I Think the difference I Think something that comes up for me is that that Peterson is a deeply religious person or so he has said this But he can't a hundred percent believe in God. He can't connect there. Whereas Peugeot does and verveky is Declares himself as secular. So these are it's it's interesting I've had this dilemma myself. I characterize my own spirituality is complicated and I suppose by Complicated you could say I am as Verveking Peterson indicated She's got segment Freud looking over her shoulder Complicated you say religion Experiencing a meaning crisis myself. I want to be deeply connected to that real world I've always referred to it as the new edict dimension or the spiritual dimension that that Victor Frankel refers to but I have a hard time Actually having an embodied understanding of God, you know Belief in God is if you will in any kind of traditional sense I feel like I'm suffering from that same barrier because I I want to but I can't Get there all the way in a Christian sense. Maybe this is just because I've been Raised in the time I have been I think that has a lot to do with it Yet when Carl Jung was asked do you believe in God he says no not believe I know and Somehow that resonates. I do have this feeling that no of knowing that is outside the realm of any previous Understanding I have a religion Maybe I believe in God more as tau as a force in the universe It is absolutely constant and absolutely dynamic at the same time very important I think in a way I feel like this is expressed in the dementia in the description page. Oh gives of the Trinity and Need I state this it reflects very much dynamic quality I would say my belief is that God is something like dynamic quality Again, both approaches take into account and understanding of the underlying structure of reality and proceeding from there These are practices that can ground us as we sort out the chaos at the end of the cycle or During the meaning crisis. So I hope that made sense and I will see you next time for part two Okay, so I left a I Left a comment and and I'll read the comment, you know, I really appreciated it. I think a lot of what helps I Talk a lot. I talked to a lot of people who share the comments that you made at the end of this video I meet them online and in person meetups here in Sacramento I think for individuals like Peugeot and myself who have never left a Christian thread and and you might pull up a blog post I did in 2009 which comes from Which comes from George McDonald George McDonald was a favorite of CS Lewis where When I was homeschooling my kids I read the Princess and the Goblin which is a which is a wonderful fairy tale And it's much worth reading where where the little girl has to follow the thread and she needs to trust the thread and she She has to stay with the thread. Don't don't leave the thread And actually I found that via via a sermon praying our fears from from Tim Keller now I lost that I lost the thread and The experience belief the experiencing belief is a difficult for say someone like Peugeot and I who've never really left the thread Decades of practice and community reinforce it helping it to make it very real indeed These practices beliefs were jettisoned by many as counterproductive offensive and moral and necessary for many and just simply abandoned It's sort of the difference between starting to learn the violin when you're seven and I think of my my conversation About the violin my conversation By learning the violin when you're seven and and having to pick it up when you're in when you're an adult as a Christian I don't see that as an insurmountable obstacle however and By virtue of the fact of what God has done if you permit my language many times in history through conversion the thief of the cross gets a promise so I'm looking forward to part two, but So, you know I resonate I resonate with what she says and folks are looking for the truth last night at the end of the meetup I had a really good conversation with a someone who came in he both came to the CS Lewis Society and then he came to the meetup and You know he's an atheist and he sort of identifies that way except doesn't like all the ways that atheists are getting identified as now sort of like Christians, but you know so we have this meetup at church and and I know some of the negative comments and the introduction to meetups video that we did, you know We sit down and we have meaningful conversations. We talked about these things. I think that's the That's that's what we can do to help each other is to talk to talk about these things to share ideas and one of things I really like about both Jonathan Peugeot and John Verveke is they they both have the capacity to talk to people different from themselves and it doesn't boil down into Some nasty little nasty little spat To to be able to Both be open to listen to others and yet to have an identity and to and to explore together That's that's really It's really what we need This flow is beyond us, you know just this morning at Stetzer Posting a thing from Christianity Day the Southern Baptist Southern Baptist Church is is having their convention the Southern Baptist Convention and You know losing half of their kids. This is part of the meaning crisis and what I tweeted out I don't think the church recognizes this as a part of a much larger Cultural situation it thinks it can improve it can improve performance with pizza smoke machines and more empathy this challenge runs far deeper than cooler Hipper and Woker and Tomorrow I'm gonna do a conversation with burn power again And then we're gonna talk about texture and one of the things that I was burn or burn was talking about Texture and he recorded a thing that he gave at Lebrie about texture and you're thinking, you know in this whole meaning crisis thing We haven't even talked about Texture and and and how deep that goes when when feel is the primary is the primary substitute for think that we use well feel is about texture and And I forget the word that Rebecca uses Can't pull it up to the top of my head But just like we use we close our eyes and we use all that all that machinery to to to see with our minds We hold our hands in and we use all the same feeling machinery We've got all of these nerves all over our body and we use that to feel our way through the universe This foe is beyond us. We are not going to think our way out of this Which leads me to I've got two minutes, how can I be saved? Well, what do you mean by saved saved is a fudgy word I think it has to do with all the layers. I like Jordan Peterson's Piaget eschatology It has to run all different ways and CS Lewis gets into that saved from what I need to be saved from everything And I can't do it. It has to be real beyond my understanding of real I'll never figure it out deeply enough in my little lifetime I'm 55 years old and walking home today could get hit by a car and bang That's it for you Paul Unless of course as I believe as a Christian, this is just the beginning of a much larger life It's a tremendous tremendous It's a tremendous thing to be able to believe him And what's what's interesting is it's just been sort of sort of dismissed out in the world And I think we threw that away in exchange for what pride? It's something I can experience but it's not made up of pride It's something I can experience but it's not merely a personal experience It can't just be me Well, I guess that's my altar call It's time to talk to folks So enjoy the video Leave a comment
