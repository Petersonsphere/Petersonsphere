 Hi, this is Paul. Tremors in the story verse. Critical Drinker did a video that on the news, it's all over the place, that the Oscars had fewer than 10 million people watching them, which is not a huge number given that they're on network news and it was 58% lower than last year. Now, there's going to be a lot of talking about why this is and finger pointing and blaming as if somehow we have a moral obligation to watch that show. I've never been a person who's watched it much at all. But there's a lot of talk about churches losing people. This is happening in the entertainment industry. Hollywood has been the main storyteller for the culture for a hundred years. Hollywood has grown rich off its storytelling and someone like the Critical Drinker and many other YouTube channels who are movie critics who pay their, in a sense, movie theologians, they're not happy with what they've been seeing. The channel like Critical Drinker basically is decrying sort of the continual moralizing from Hollywood. It's most annoying that this is mostly coming from wealthy elites who are just sort of talking down to little people. That's the way they see it. I'm not a movie critic. I'm not going to wander into their territory too much. He goes on in his video to say, well, people want entertainment, escapism. People are locked down in, people are sort of locked down right now. They can't go out and do things like they usually do because of the pandemic. And that's true. And so you would imagine that if Hollywood was doing well, ratings would be up because everybody's home, at least home in certain states more than others. But this is where the Critical Drinker and I sort of part company because I'm not sure that it's merely escapism or entertainment. Again, I think that there's something far deeper going on here in terms of the stories we tell and the stories we need and the stories we feed off of and how we use those stories in our lives for sanity, for calibration, for wrong and right. As I said before, I think movies have been the primary religious vehicle for the nation, for the culture for a very long time. And given its popularity for the world in many ways, movie theaters have been and movies have been what's comparable to the ancient temples. I used to record stuff off cable TV that I thought was of interest and of potential sermon material. One show that was on the History Channel was all about ancient technologies and it went into the technologies used by the temples to amaze people. You would go into a temple to have your god become real to you, whether that was Artemis with her multiple breasts producing milk in Ephesus or whether that was chariots flying through the air. And in some ways, ancient temples were using various, to use a vervekey word, psychotechnologies to create awe and wonder and a sense of, see, we sort of diminish it with entertainment. I just had a conversation with Byrne and in a lot of ways this is an area that Byrne is very much a specialist in. One person left a comment on my channel, probably a new person to my channel. What is Byrne an expert in? Where are his credentials? And I kind of want to say, well, this channel really isn't an expert space. I mean, there's little old me and to what degree I'm an expert in anything you can be the judge of, but mostly we talk to randos and we talk amongst each other and we try to learn together and that's sort of the estuary nature of this channel, I hope. Esther pointed out a channel that had caught my attention a while ago, but I'm subscribed to over 300 YouTube channels, so I certainly don't try to keep up with all of them. The Bible is Art and just recently did a video, Do Stories Need Happy Endings, and Terry Gilliam was on there sort of comparing a couple of different directors and the person making the YouTube video was making the point that part of what the Bible gives are redemptive stories. I remember in one of Jordan Peterson's videos he's talking about when he would take his son maybe to a movie that was a little too old for him and a little too scary for his young son, Jordan would always say, keep your eyes on the hero and that's really quite good advice. And in my last monologue videos I've been spending more time talking about story, the story inside and the story outside. We regulate our emotions with story. We maintain our sanity with story. Again, thinking about the conversation I had with Sevilla King a while ago now, talking about how she, you know, first she went to art school and then she became a therapist and then she was working in a clinic and she noted how, you know, basically how religion kept sanity in very distressed and impoverished communities. I've seen this all my life, both in working in African American communities in North America, working in poor communities overseas. Religion is in many ways the ancient mental health system. You maintain your sanity, you keep your equilibrium, you make sense of your world through storytelling. Rebel wisdom's been talking about, you know, sense making. Well, storytelling is a major major component of sense making and in some ways we tell stories to, again, the world is too big for us and so stories are this critical compression device by which we can compress the world and make sense of the world and then we tell the stories out and the stories come back and it's sort of this very wave-like estuary fashion of stories coming in and out and in and out and the morality, the youth are educated in their morality and in all kinds of ways through storytelling. Yet there's a sense in which there's sort of a dead reckoning truth with respect to storytelling. Often, like I say, for Jordan Peterson, his meaning, do what's meaningful instead of what's expedient, that's sort of an internal gyroscope. If you're shut off from the stars and you can't navigate by them, meaning is sort of a dead reckoning way of telling the truth. I look at Jonathan Peugeot's excellent video on parasitic storytelling and that observation too, that certain kinds of stories sort of they eat their hosts and so therefore they can't really be foundational. They're always parasitic, they're always dependent, they're always contingent upon the deeper bedrock that we sort of have access to with stories. The video before the Hollywood one or a couple videos ago from April 15, Critical Drinker did a very interesting video on why canon matters and so what you see sort of with the Star Wars fandom and the Harry Potter fandom and the Star Trek fandom and especially Star Wars and Star Trek because they're older, there's a lot of talk about canon because there was a lot of fan fiction, there's a lot of other storytelling and what needs to happen within the story is that there has to be order within the Star Wars universe or within the Star Trek universe or within the Harry Potter universe. There needs to be a certain amount of coherence that makes sense within itself. I talked to Burn about that in terms of liturgy and so and I think all of this is sort of a dead reckoning storytelling. Now Jordan sort of popularized for our generation Carl Jung's observation that people don't have ideas, ideas have people and I would sort of extend this to say ideas don't have people, stories do. We are in many ways stories are the sense-making oxygen that we breathe, personal stories, stories from each other, stories from our past, stories from our ancestors, biblical stories, poetry as well and often these videos someone will say what about poetry? Yes, poetry too. A good amount of the Bible is in fact poetry. That's what we're talking about. The Bible is in fact poetry. The Bible has narrative, it has poetry, it has law, it has a whole variety of things. The Bible is really sort of a library but this story making, this compression engine that we use to sort of make sense of the world and connect with each other and understand each other and learn to relate to each other. Again a big part of the Burn video, the Burn Powers video, that power video that I thought was excellent was when Burn was talking about relationships and how fundamental relationships are. You know actually yesterday I recorded a video that I actually, I haven't actually thrown it away yet but I probably will because I wasn't happy with it and I was so unhappy with it I didn't post it. I posted, I just decided to post Burns, my conversation with Burn instead because it was such a good conversation and I figured I would probably want to riff off of it and that's always the problem when I do videos for other channels. Burns was on my channel, Burn has his own channel, but when I do videos for other channels and they sort of wait in the queue I want to talk about them, I want to riff off them and I can't because you don't have access to them so that's part of the reason I asked Rafe if I could release those conversations earlier rather than later. Because of all the work I do on Jordan Peterson, YouTube pretty reliably forefronts Jordan Peterson stuff in my feed and so when the Michael Shermer conversation came up, it came up right away and I sort of decided you know Jordan has been doing a lot of conversations and I sort of crowd filter them. If I get, if I start getting signals from you, oh he talked about something that's important for your area of his work, I'll usually wait and get that and Strahan sent me this and said well he talks about the resurrection so you might want to take a look at it and in fact there's there's a good 20-30 minutes of conversation in that video that I am interested in. My goal today isn't to do a full commentary on that 30 minutes but I do want to play some of it because it does get into this idea of story. Now I thought this was really a good faith conversation between them and I thought Shermer was very honest about himself, honest about his story. There were elements of the story that I didn't know about. Apparently he went to Pepperdine, he at one point was an evangelical Christian and he gave it up and so now he's sort of a, he's a celebrity skeptic. Is he a, if Sam Harris is A tier, he's sort of an A minus B plus tier. His YouTube channel has a significant splash, he's been on all of the usual shows and so in terms of that status hierarchy, I mean he's going someplace. Part of why I deep-sixed yesterday's video was I messed up the video and I was playing this video and you couldn't see it. So, Shermer begins with sort of your standard modernist skeptical treatment about the resurrection. Religious truths because that comes up a lot in your books and I'm a great interest to me as well. In terms of religious truths, here's the example I use, like Jesus of Nazareth. Okay, did someone named Jesus of Nazareth actually live and was he really crucified? I think most historians, including my atheist historian friends who study this, say yeah, there's probably very good evidence someone named Jesus existed and you know the Romans crucified everybody for anything. They didn't really crucify everyone for anything but, and again this is sort of a standard treatment. Good chance he was also crucified. You could put a Bayesian analysis on that. My priors are high for Jesus' existence and crucifixion. But then you slide toward, well, was he resurrected from the dead after three days and then did he ascend to heaven and he did all of this for us. That is, you know, he died so our sins would be forgiven, something like that. Now on that last one, that would be purely in the religious truth. You know, you accept Jesus as the Messiah or you don't. Christians do, Jews and Muslims don't. There's no set of arguments that Christians can make that say rabbis and imams don't know the arguments and if, oh, if they only knew the argument that this theologian just made, they'd become Christians and accept Jesus as their savior. They know the arguments. They just don't. And now this part of what I talked about in the video that I am not going to post from yesterday is this whole line of argumentation I really don't buy. And if you've been listening to my channel a while, you know I don't buy it. You know why I don't buy it because it's, I don't think Hume's, I don't think Hume really stands up here. I think Lewis pretty easily addresses that in his book, Miracles. It's, and, but the reason I don't buy it is because people don't work that way. And I can make that argument from, C.S. Lewis actually begins his book, Miracles, with that argument that the only person he knows who claims to have seen a ghost doesn't believe in ghosts. I can make that argument from a biblical perspective that, let's assume for a minute, that the astounding miracles that Jesus did and the disciples were witnesses to weren't sufficient to convince the disciples that Jesus would rise from the dead on Easter Sunday morning. And it's just not how people work. And so if you look how people work, it's quite a bit more mysterious and quite a bit more psychological and has a whole lot more to do with stories. Right now in terms of politics, part of what's going on in the country is the complaint that the news services, and of course, Rebel Wisdom has really majored in this, the news services report the narrative and they report stories that fit the narrative. And this gets into all sorts of different things. I've been paying very careful attention to the news in terms of police shootings to see how people of different races who are shot by police, how that is reported, which murders are reported and which racial identifiers are made. And the information is out there. The Washington Post, in fact, has an excellent database, which you don't have to subscribe to the Washington Post to have access to. And all of the data is out there and that's what the internet is good at. But what both political parties and what all of us tend to do is not only do we promote and shape stories that fit our predetermined narrative, this is the point of C.S. Lewis at the beginning of his book, but in fact, we take in information that fits the narrative. In fact, we even filter out information that doesn't fit the narrative. And this is something about human beings that we do quite readily. And so the approach to the resurrection, not only number one, do most of these atheist Christian debates about the historicity or the physicality of the resurrection sort of hinge usually on miracles or not, whether or not the laws of physics are ever broken, as if we can go find these laws of physics in physics themselves and that these in fact aren't things that we derive from observing physics, therefore meaning that new observations, if they occur, would cause the amendment of those laws. But also that almost any arguments about whether or not Jesus rose from the dead is the same argument in some ways about natural or supernatural, if that's your framework, if any supernatural thing happens. And if you've been following my rough drafts for Sunday or my Sunday sermons, I've continued to make the point that in many ways, Jesus' resurrection is a very different thing. For example, there are few people that are skeptical about the fact that Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon, yet no one would require that we have physical evidence from the river, let's say a heel boot and say, I won't believe Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon unless, when you say, well, that's not really a dramatically different thing. No, but it's a thing that happened once and it's an awfully important thing in terms of the history of the world. You can look at Constantine and the Milvian Bridge and the vision that he had. Now, no one would be expected to have seen the vision with him unless it's reported that it was a public vision, but in some ways, the evidence for the vision is the reign of Constantine. And you might say, well, what does that really prove? But that's precisely my point, that history flows this way. This is essentially C.S. Lewis' argument in his book, Miracles, which you can look at if you want, but Lewis did actually a lot of reflecting on this. And towards the end of the discarded image, Lewis talks about the fact that, well, there's a lot going on in terms of storytelling and history and conveying history with language and evidence. There's a lot going on in that, but needless to say, Shermer is skeptical of the resurrection and he basically hands out a fairly standard treatment of it. I don't accept him because that's not in the realm of objective truth. This is just a pure religious truth. And now the resurrection part, I would say, 100 billion people have lived and died before us. Not one has come back from the dead. Here's the question. People are brought back from death all the time on an operating table. What is your definition of coming back from the dead? How do you know no one has come back from the dead? And no one would argue that. What do you mean coming back from the dead? Is it a ghost? Is it obviously the story of Jesus' resurrection? And again, I've talked about that in my sermons and I don't feel the need to go through that here now. Maybe one, you know, Jesus. And if he did, then we could put a number on it. Chances of this happening are 100 billion to one. Have there been 100 billion people in the history of the world? I don't think anywhere close. The ECRE principle, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Is the evidence commensurate with the 100 billion to one? No, it's not even ordinary evidence. It's biblically internal. There's no external sources. And I don't know the internal, external to the Bible thing. From the Roman scribes or Jewish scribes to describe, oh my god, I saw this person and, oy vey, Jesus, you've come back. Nothing like that externally from the Bible. So there, you know, we're kind of in the middle there. But then I got to thinking, what if it should have... It's external to Mark, external to Luke, external to Matthew, external to John, external to Paul. Never been taken literally in the first place. What if that's not what the story means in this? And this is the, this is the, this is what I wanted to play because this is the argument. Well, maybe, and I think he's, you know, this is a good faith argument. He's trying to be gracious. Maybe the gospel writers didn't intend to communicate that Jesus was physically risen from the dead. That seems to be very difficult, a very difficult argument to make because in fact, the gospel writers do, and Paul does, make the point that this was a physical resurrection and then an ascension and then reigning from on high. You can look at the Apostles Creed. I mean, all of this, it's one picture. And I think what's important to notice is it's one story. And NT Wright's very fat book, The Resurrection of the Son of God, goes through all the theological history and a bunch of that stuff. But the point, the point I want to make here is not... Everyone's face... Okay. Well, if, you know, let's say we had fuzzy pictures of Jesus, like we have fuzzy pictures of pyramids over American warships or, or tic tacs flying in a crazy way, followed by American jet fighters, would that convince you? No. Well, and again, my point was stilling a storm didn't keep the disciples from cowering in a closed door room during the resurrection of Jesus. People don't work that way. All sorts of fuzzy pictures on the internet about aliens. We make sense of things via story. That's how we compress the world. That's how this works. And so to say, well, maybe they meant part of the problem, maybe they meant, didn't mean it literally. Again, literally this, this, this differentiation comes far after the gospels. Now I'm not saying that the gospels didn't understand the difference between physicality and spirituality. In fact, very quickly in the history of Christianity, there were lots of groups that basically made the assertion. These were Gnostic groups and we're going to come into Gnosticism a little bit later in this video. There were Gnostic groups that basically said, well, Jesus never really was a human and Jesus never really died on the cross. Or you can go to the GOS, the gospel of Judas, which is another Gnostic gospel where, well, what Judas is the hero of the story because he relieved Jesus of his decaying body and turned him into a pure spiritual creature. And so just on the question of historical takes on the resurrection, what Shermer is articulating just really doesn't work. Now this is a little hard, I think, probably for people to understand because my argument here is a little subtle because on one hand I'm saying to Shermer, no, ancient people very well could have communicated Jesus having a not being human, having a spiritual experience or the disciples having a spiritual experience after that. Ancient people had the capacity to relate this, these ideas and NT Wright runs through all these things. Even in the book of Acts, when Peter shows up at the door after an angel releases him from prison, the servant girl comes back and assumes that it's Peter's angel or Peter's ghost that is at the door and leaves Peter outside the locked door. Peter can't walk through. And if you read again, the gospel accounts, it was very clear, a number of things were very clear, one of which is that as NT Wright says, these texts are unembroidered and we would expect more theological embroidery on texts that are not just sort of relaying the facts as was recorded. And that's exactly what the apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15. So the intent of the gospel writers, the intent and the understanding of the early Christians and the theological position that did win out in the Catholic Church was physical resurrection of Jesus. Okay, so that's one point. Now the second point is that that fact, again, now be skeptical about the physical resurrection. That's not the point I'm making here, but how that works in the story is vital for the development of Christianity. Another point that it's really the crowning point of NT Wright's argument, you can find his argument in paper versions, you know, not necessarily the big fat book, it's over on my shelf, I don't feel like getting up and getting it. But basically the point that NT Wright makes is the theological innovation and the rise of the community is the best argument for the physicality of the resurrection in the same way that the best argument for Caesar crossing the Rubicon is the fall of the Roman Republic. And the best argument for the vision that Constantine saw is, or is reported to have seen, is the reign of Constantine. History works that way. And so the idea that we keep going back and saying, well, maybe they didn't mean it. No, they did. Now you can be skeptical about it, you can deny it, you can say, I don't believe in it. As he said, Muslims and Jews and great many other people say they don't believe it. That's absolutely normal and human. And I would assert that in some ways, even though the Apostles saw Jesus work many miracles, they still didn't believe. Now right away you have to get into this question of, well, what do you mean by believe? Now this morning I was a little snarky on Twitter because I found this from the Twitter thread of a guy who quite publicly a few years ago left the Christian faith and has his own certain political persuasion. And this just basically looked like this is one of these pass along things on Twitter where people are sort of telling the world exactly what they think politically. In this house, I don't know what he means literally by that, but we sort of understand what he means figuratively. This is how we believe, okay, all cops are bastards. Okay, I understand you're trying to insult all police officers, but in my experience, people who say these kinds of things often also don't own guns because they say the police have guns and the police will keep me safe. But it's like, do you really believe that if you believed this, would you really live the way you do? All landlords are parasites. Wow. Do you think that people who don't have enough money or have certain socio-economic conditions that can't afford to purchase a house or maybe they're going to live in another city that landlords aren't providing a service? I mean, this is just enormously dismissive. There are no good billionaires. Oh, wow. War is a racket. Okay, I don't like war either. I had a very elderly member of my congregation who was sort of losing his faculties at one point tell me that George W. Bush started the Iraq War and that George W. Bush had sent him an email saying that they were going to split the profits. Now, this particular individual, I'm quite convinced, never voted for a Democrat in his life. And he had personal pictures of George W. Bush. He had probably contributed to the campaign and had a lovely picture of George W. Bush and his wife. And partly because of the dementia he was suffering, considered he and George W. Bush on a first name basis and quite close friends because of the volume of mail he was getting, probably because he was contributing faithfully to the George W. Bush campaign. But war is a racket. Wow. Money is fake. But I see people post this kind of thing and I'm sure he's a lovely individual. And if I would say, it's not a person I know personally or I've ever had any real interaction with, I would say, let's go out to coffee. He would probably say, here, I'll pay. And you don't believe any of these things in sort of the same way that did the apostles believe in Jesus? I mean, every time, you know, so Jesus is sleeping in the boat and the storm comes up and Jesus stills the storm and Jesus says to his disciples, you have little faith. You do not believe. And the reason they don't believe is evident on Easter Sunday morning because they didn't show up at the tomb. Now, either the gospels are lying that Jesus never said that or even more likely to me is the fact that Jesus told them and they just didn't believe them. Why? Because tell someone something that is unbelievable and either they will remember it forever like this senior citizen telling me that he was on a first name basis with George W. Bush and that he and George W. Bush offered to split the proceeds from the Iran-Iraq war, from the, I'm sorry, the American-Iraq war with him. Yeah, belief is a funny thing. And I paired this with another thing that I found on Twitter this morning, which I thought exemplified exactly the same thing. And I'm not saying this to be, okay, here I go. I'm going to say I'm not a, I'm not a climate change skeptic. And I think I'm sort of where Jordan Peterson and, you know, he had a guy on the other day. I think it is something that we need to address, but it's in proportion with lots of other things. So actually I think I'm sort of on the same page as Jordan Peterson on this, but yeah, absolutely. I believe 100% that a society will collapse from climate change within 20 years. That's why my life plan is live in a big city, specialize in white collar or artistic work, cultivate zero practical skills. This is how human beings are. And I can poke fun at conservatives in all the same way. And I watched conservative hypocrisy and saying they believe things and not acting according to their beliefs, 100% with conservatives, just like with progressives. Why? Because this is how people live. This is how I live. I say things all the time that I believe this, and then my actions betray me. We are, we are hypocrites to a huge degree. Paul, who's, you know, Paul total to Pravati VanderKlay, at least he includes himself because this is how we are. The first place, what if that's not what the story means? And this brings me to the way you read literature and particularly the Bible in a mythic sense. So let me just say the way I wrote this. What if the story was never meant to be considered literally true? What if it's a metaphorical truth or a mythic truth in which readers might be inspired to bear your own cross or admonish not to be crucified by your enemies or warned not to resurrect bad habits or encouraged to be born again by starting their life anew after a troubling past? Or maybe it's a literary truth, like when William Jennings Bryan famously gave his cross a gold speech. We shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold. So in this sense, you know, he's speaking metaphorically. So what if Christians have been misreading this story from the beginning? It was never meant to be literal, like when Jesus says- But meant by whom? The gospel writers? See, that just doesn't really hold up. Now, there's a lot going on in terms of this question of how ancient people thought of text. And again, I mentioned C.S. Lewis. I mentioned Owen Barfield. I've read sections from C.S. Lewis's miracles about this. There's sort of a divide that happens. Wind and spirit used to be the same word, and then they split. And so there's a lot going on about this that you can make the point. But to make the point that the gospel writers didn't intend to communicate that Thomas touched his hand and Jesus ate a fish, that seems to be completely the intention of the gospel writers as it was for Paul. Now, doubt it happened. All of that I can buy, but to say it was never meant and Christians were reading it wrong. No, Christians have been reading these texts correctly. That's what the authors intended to communicate. Now, there's a lot of interesting stuff that goes on here. And I paid some attention to Tom Holland's treatment of Arthur and the Arthurian legend. And the rest is history also did an excellent episode on Troy, because of course, for a long time, it was assumed that the Trojan War was simply a myth. And then it was discovered by a myth, it was a completely fabricated historical event. And then it was discovered that, no, there seemed to have been a Trojan War and Homer was writing about something. And ancient people wrote in ways and dealt with their stories in interesting ways. But to argue that the ancient people couldn't communicate that the disciples believed they had physically been with Jesus, that's just not true. But ancient people had a variety of ways of recording things, and they did so in different ways than ours. This is from C.S. Lewis's book, The Discarded Image. And this passage was actually pointed out to me by some people on the Bridges of Meaning Discord server. And this is Lewis writing at the end of the book. And this by, I mean, so Burn Power, Burn, when I first met Burn, Burn said, this is my favorite C.S. Lewis book and almost nobody's read it. And then I finally read it. And yeah, I can see why this book is integral to the question of storytelling, story making, relationship between story and history. All of these are very interesting and worthwhile subjects to pursue. So this is what Lewis says. I'm inclined to think that most of those who read historical works about Troy, Alexander, Arthur, or Charlemagne believed their matter to be in the main true. But I feel much more certain that they did not believe it to be false. Now, notice Lewis can be a very subtle guy. But I do feel much more certain that they did not believe it to be false. I feel surest of all that the question of belief or disbelief was seldom uppermost in their minds. In other words, and I think this we have to look to a degree at the Protestant Reformation for, because part of what happens in the Protestant Reformation is the psychologizing of the Christian faith to a high degree. Someone just recently said, well, why are you still Protestant? Well, maybe I'll have to make a video on that. Um, because I don't psychologize my way out of my Dutch Reformed history or community or all of these ways that I'm embedded in this story. But what Lewis is saying is that this idea of belief and disbelief, which is sort of primary to our conversations, probably wasn't functioning in the way they did then. And we've actually, I've actually gotten into some of this stuff in my conversations with Rafe Kelly and John Vervecky that in many ways, you know, the Greek word Pistis, I used to in college Bible studies, because I was learning Greek and sort of shaking things up with people I would be in Bible study with, when I would read through a Bible, the Bible and the Bible study, I would keep switching believe and trust. And that that made it far more participatory than propositional because when we hear belief, we hear propositional. And so Shermer is very interested. Well, did they believe? Well, what exactly is that? And of course, Peterson delves into that, you know, to a large degree. So I feel surest of all that the question of belief or disbelief was seldom uppermost in their minds. And again, you can read Paul, if you believe with your heart and confess with your lips. That's what the apostle Paul says now in the book of Romans, I believe. Now, why did what did he mean by did he mean trust in your heart and confess with your lips? Because that's an absolutely credible way of talking about Pistis. And in fact, talking about the faith as such, you can find that I think it's twice in the New Testament, you can find it as such that way. But the dominant, the dominant posture in the New Testament is trust, not some abstract thing. Jesus rose from Jesus, Thomas touched Jesus hand, true or false. Aliens are scoping out American military, true or false. The 2020 election was rigged, true or false. Those questions don't actually tell you much or tell me much about you. They'll tell me some things, but they won't tell me much. They'll tell me a lot less than a lot of these conversations imagine needs to be told. Their business was to learn the story. The business was to get the story inside of them. Their business was to act out the story. Again, look at Jordan Peterson's first biblical series lecture, because he really goes through a lot of that. If its veracity were questioned, they would feel the burden of disproof lay wholly with the critic. That was their culture. Till that moment arrived, and it did not arrive often, the story had by long perception a status in the common imagination indistinguishable at any rate, not distinguished from that of fact. In other words, and Peterson actually takes this tact with Shermer because what Peterson doesn't do with Shermer is get into a minimal facts argument or something like that. He gets into how does story work with people? And that's exactly how Peterson should engage with it. Now recently, and again YouTube has been serving this up, somebody has made a video out there that says something to the effect of Jordan Peterson told a Roman Catholic priest he believed in the resurrection. I watched that Bishop Baron conversation all the way through if you watched my commentary. Jordan Peterson said no such thing, nor every time Peterson has asked these kinds of questions he gives the kinds of answers he keeps giving. Why? For this reason that I'm saying, and in many ways it sort of follows Lewis because what is most important is how the story and the detail of the story that the writers of the story are saying, physicality, that is the detail of the story that is important for how the story functions. Now again, maybe you're skeptical about it. Okay, I'm not, but the thing that is most important about the story is not this sort of third person propositional thing over there. It's actually whether they're living into the story, which again if you look at the most popular Hollywood stories recently, that's in fact how those stories are functioning religiously because people are trying to live into them. Now they've got a fair amount of stuff going on. They don't necessarily really believe they're doing magic with Harry Potter. They might be calling themselves Jedi because they really want to be Luke Skywalker and ride around the galaxy in a space cowboy movie, but the story aspect is the most important. So in the sense Shermer is onto something, but he's completely missing actually the historical element of this, and I think also the psychological element, and this is exactly where Lewis goes. Everyone knew, as we all know, how the ostrich hides her head in the sand, that the past contains nine worthies, three pagans, Hector Alexander and Julius Caesar, three Jews, Joshua, David and Judas Maccabees. Now again he's going into this partly because of this book, The Discarded Image, because he makes the argument that what the medieval church did was basically inherit the pagan world and convert the story verse into Christendom, and when you look at Jonathan Pujol's channel, that's exactly what Jonathan Pujol is relaying to you, and in some ways what Jonathan Pujol is doing to contemporary storytelling is what the medievals did to the pagan stories. It's all part of the same line, and I think it's for that reason that part of the reason Pujol's channel is popular, because Pujol is in a sense picking up the medieval mantle and doing it in our contemporary world, which is an amazing thing because there's way, way more stories, but that doesn't mean that there's way, way more good stories, and that the patterns in the stories are in fact limited and are still shining through. So three nine worthies, Hector Alexander, Julius Caesar, three Jews, Joshua, David, Judas Maccabees, and three Christians, Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon. Everyone knew we were descendant from the Trojans, and now you might say, oh, oh, well wait a minute, what about genetics? Well, in our contemporary woke storytelling, everybody knew your descendants is really the critical thing by which you should be judged. Are you a descendant of the Jews or slave owners or slaves or some oppressed group or some oppressor group? It's working the same way. Everybody knew that, and that in fact was operating in their religious social relational world. Everyone knew we were descended from the Trojans, as all know how Alfred burned the cakes and Nelson put the telescope to his blind eye, as the spaces above us were filled with with daemons, angels, influences, and intelligences, so the centuries behind us were filled with shining and ordered figures, with deeds of Hector and Roland, with splendors of Charlemagne, Arthur, Priam, and Solomon. When I listen to Tom Holland, this is the world he wants to go back to, it appears to me. It must be remembered throughout that the text should now call historical, differed in outlook and narrative texture from those we should call fictions, far less than modern histories differ from modern novels. In other words, when we go to the movies, we're sort of going to the temples. That's really how they function. Now, we don't sit there well sometimes when they break canon, or when something really egregious happens, it's like Luke Skywalker would never do that, or something happens. I mean we're watching Iron Man and then he does something and it's like, I don't know if that suit could really just sort of come flying across the world that was in, I forget which movie that was, or you know the longer Iron Man went, the more his suit could do, etc. etc. and so you watch it like, I don't know. But the point is, you're living into the story, that's the point. And again, when I say these kinds of things, a lot of Christians get really nervous because, oh you don't believe in the physical resurrection? No, I do. In fact, I'm more convinced of the physical resurrection because of these arguments. But what's passing is modernity, where we're always fighting these stories in the way that Shermer is fighting them. It must be remembered throughout the text that we should call historical differed in outlook and narrative texture from those we should call fictions, far less than modern history differs from the modern novel. I don't think it's coincidental that in a lot of ways the history that Tom Holland writes is very novelistic. Medieval historians dealt hardly at all with the impersonal. Social or economic conditions and national characteristics come in only by accident and when they are required to explain something in the narrative. In other words, what were they doing with their stories? They were making sense of the world, they were piecing their world together. That's what the stories were for. The chronicles, like the legends, are about individuals, their valor or villainy, their memorable sayings, their good or bad luck. Hence, modern finds those of the dark ages suspiciously epic and those of the high middle ages suspiciously romantic. Perhaps the suspicion is not always justified. The elements of epic and romance, like those of economic and social histories, exist at all times in the real world and historians, even in dealing with contemporary events, will pick out these elements which the habitual bend of their imagination has conditioned them to notice. In other words, historians read this, look for what we're interested in. We're looking for the physicality, we're looking for the Julius Caesar's boot heel by the river. That's what we want. I won't believe Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon unless I have evidence. What kind of evidence do you require? Perhaps past or future ages might wonder at the predominance of impersonal or other modern histories, might even ask, but were there no people at that time? Even the turns of expression may be the same in chronicle and romance. Now tells the tale will be found and all medieval narratives about the past are equally lacking in the sense of period. And you can see this in Renaissance paintings about Jesus. What was Jesus doing in that Italian, in that medieval Italian village? They're doing something else with story. For us, the past is, before all else, a costume play. From our earliest picture books, we learn the difference in clothes, weapons, furniture, and architecture. We cannot remember in our lives any historical knowledge earlier than this. This superficial and often inaccurate characterization of different ages helps us far more than we suspect towards our latter and subtler discriminations between them. It's a lot of like saying, I don't think Iron Man suit can really fly through the air and just kind of mold around him, can it? Can it? You don't care, or you do kind of, but why do you care? It is difficult to think ourselves back into the minds of men for whom it did not exist. And in the Middle Ages and long after it did not. It was known that Adam went naked till he fell. After that, they pictured the whole past in terms of their own age. So indeed did the Elizabethans. So did Milton. He never doubted that Capon and White Broth would have been familiar to Christ and the disciples as himself. It is doubtful whether the sense of period is much older than the Waterly novels. It is hardly present in Gibbon. Walpole's Atoronto, which would not now deceive school children, could hope, not quite vainly, to deceive the public of 1765. Even when the most obvious and superficial distinctions between one century or millennium and another were ignored, the profound differences of temper and mental climate were naturally not dreamed of. Authors may profess to know that thing in Arthur's day or Hector's were not quite as in their own time, but the picture they actually paint belies the profession. So this is what Lewis is dealing with in the discarded image. The kingdom of heaven is within you. Maybe what he meant was we're supposed to create a heaven on earth here. It's not a place to go like there's this other, you know, ontologically real place. It's in your mind. It's in our, we're supposed to create better societies on earth by working to help the poor and that sort of thing. It's really something, listening to him, try to save Jesus for the moderns, because that's, there's a lot of theologians that have been doing that for a very long time. Why don't you want to get rid of Jesus, Michael Shermer? Well, it's because you're attracted to him in the story and you're trying to pull him into your modern world and you're changing him in order to do that. That's basically what a lot of modernist Christians have been doing for 200 years. Peterson doesn't go there, which is what's interesting about Peterson. I just want to get your thoughts on that. You got a half hour? That simple, that simple topic. Yes, you've written a few things on this. And I can imagine Peterson thinking, this darn question. I keep trying to talk about it. No one's ever satisfied. Here we go again. Now I'm going to play a later piece of it. Like I said, I'm not at this point planning on doing a full, doing a full treatment of it. So we'll just jump to this section because it gets towards the end and I mean, he sort of has to warm up to it and get there and he gets there. Now you talked about the Bayesian improbability of the resurrection story and I countered that with a description of the potency and validity of the religious narrative and its. Peterson basically made the argument about narrative that that's the critical aspect. That's the relevance, the relevance realization we're doing, the location of that relevance realization to take for Vervakian language is at the story level, not the physical level. Okay. And again, I'm not a skeptic about the physical level, but the relevance realization is at the story level. And that's essentially what Lewis is, the point Lewis is making in the discarded image and in miracles. And Lewis isn't a skeptical about the physical either. Necessity. And that doesn't mean we resolve that there's a tension there because the tension would be well, we obviously believe that in the narrative domain, tell me if I'm wrong about what you believe, but there's obviously literature of different depth. And we make a distinction between great literature and lesser literature. And I think we can say that great literature bears a more profound relationship to the truth. Now, again, what truth, all truth, including the physical. And that's basically how Peterson continues to answer this question, all truth and how far will it go down into the physical? How does it get down into the physical from the story verse? And the greater the literature, the more profound the truth. Well, I don't think there is any greater literature than the biblical literature taken as a whole, partly because all of our other literature in the West has come out of it. You know, it's the source of it. And so it's a great truth of some sort. Well, what does that mean? Well, I don't know what it means. What does that mean? Even what does that question mean? It means how do you live? How does it change your life? Does pictures of pyramids over American destroyers make you build a bunker in your backyard? Have you built one? Does stories about climate disaster in the next 20 years have you moving to Vermont and starting a massive garden and benefiting from Bernie Sanders and Vermont's lax gun laws? It's a crazy world we live in, isn't it? Are you moving? The irony is that the people who are skeptical about climate and COVID are the ones who go out to the woods. For the most part, there's, I mean, human beings are very diverse. Or I don't know any more than I've already seen. I don't know any more than I've already surmised. And I have to live with that tension. I can't resolve it. You know that because of our moral ambivalence, each of us, we're less committed to our task than we might be. Okay, that's critical here. Because again, for Peterson, and actually, it's not just for Peterson. It's really true. I haven't done much commentary in this book recently. But if you look at how Machu Pajau lays out the symbolic order, human beings are the connection. We are the connection between the story verse and the physical world. And that's exactly how it functions in Peterson. And so if you listen to Peterson carefully, it in many ways mirrors some of what now, again, in my commentary on this book, I've got a number of thoughts about this book. It's more evangelical than you might imagine. Human beings are the nexus point. We're the place where the breath of God meets the stuff of Earth, because we are made of the stuff of Earth with the breath of God in us. And in the Joannine Pentecost story in John 20, Jesus breathes on the people and says, receive the Holy Spirit. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means that we are the avenue for the new creation into the world. Does that mean that there isn't a second coming? I'm not saying that. I think there will be. I'm that kind of undeconstructed Christian who is not skeptical about those things. I'm not skeptical about those things because I've seen in many times and places, the world is strange, stranger than I can know. And so that's when I had my second conversation with, my first conversation with J.P. Marceau and John Vervecky about miracles. I said, I'm not skeptical that human beings can walk on water. Read C.S. Lewis's miracles about why I'm not skeptical about that. Because, well, what exactly is this creation? If Jesus could still a storm with a word, what is this creation? And this is sort of where Peterson always ends up saying, I don't know the limits. We're plagued by existential doubts. We're held back by our resentment and our bitterness. And those are all deficiencies in our storytelling in many ways. Because if the story, and this is why preachers nag congregations sometimes, because they're basically saying, if you really believe the story of Jesus, you wouldn't sin, you wouldn't worry, you wouldn't doubt. Oh, but we do not believe, do we? We get in our own way. We have an ambivalent sense of whether we're worthy as individuals or as a species for that matter. And so we stumble forward half crippled and maybe we move towards the light regardless. But we're not all in by any stretch of the imagination as individuals or as a culture. And every preacher will tell you this. It's the reason we preach because we say to our congregation, you're not all in. And the really hard thing for the preacher is I have to say, well, neither am I. And this is again, when Peterson talks to Peugeot, why won't you join the church? Because they certainly don't look all in to me, had he's got a point. Perpetuate it. Well, what would we do? Would we defeat death? Would we bring about immortal life? Have we been defeating death? Yeah. Immortality? Well, this gets funny. Would you want it? Suicide rates have been going up. People don't even want the 80 years that our society might promise them. What does that say about us? What does that say about our story verse? What does that say about the inside and the outside? What does that say? And then we write shows like The Good Place and Upload and basically, gosh, if human beings get their hands on the afterlife, we're going to commercialize that too. Would we resurrect the dead? Who knows what we could do? I don't see that human possibility is bounded in any realistic sense. What we've already accomplished is absolutely beyond comprehension. And we've done this with technology. Well, what is technology? Technology is in some ways mentalizing the world on a map, sometimes in a story, maybe in math, manipulating it to our will and changing it. And everyone said, yes, science and technology, it's powerful. Yeah, it is. But it's us doing it. It doesn't do itself. Again, I read all the time on Twitter and in the papers, science says science doesn't say a darn thing. We're going to get into that a little bit later. There are many things that we don't understand at all, at all. And many of those things are going to be revolutionary. They're going to change the way we look at everything. And so, well, then I wonder too, well, there have been people of varying different moral ability throughout the entire corpus of, throughout human society. How does immense moral good manifest itself in the world when it actually makes itself real? And what is its capacity? Could it still a storm? Could it still a storm? Could it multiply loaves and fishes? Could it walk on water? Well, right now we're flying through the air in metal tubes, but Peterson always goes to this place. Well, where's the limit? And he's saying, we don't know. Why don't we be honest about that? And that's the story of, that is the story of Christ, mythological or otherwise. That is the story. And there is this insistence, and this is an insistence among sophisticated Christian thinkers that the moral world and the objective world touch in that story. And the thing is, the moral world and the objective world, they do touch because we live in the moral world and the objective world. That's this point. And so they do touch. And so I don't know what to do with that either. Like, like are good and evil, they're realities of a sort. Well, are they the deepest realities? Like I think they're the deepest realities. See, and I think it's here that he departs from Christianity and maybe he's looking for a Hurra Mazda and maybe a Persian scheme. Maybe it's a different religion, but because in Christianity, the deepest reality is the God. It's not good and evil. Good and evil is never really, finally fully a fair fight. Now you can listen to the whole thing. It's all on the internet. I know. So every now and then, whenever I have a video that kind of goes out a little further, someone will say, I like it better when you don't interrupt. Then watch the original. I'm not there to interrupt you. Now I want to get, I want to focus more on this question of religion. And there's a video out there with really crappy sound, but it's a really terrific lecture of Tom Holland from a few years ago. Did religion exist in the ancient world? And that sounds like an absolutely ridiculous question, but it's actually an enormously serious question because you only find the word religion twice in the Bible, but all of us would see it as a religious book. And so I think that's a religious book. And again, if you read Tom Holland's dominion, you can get a sense of, well, wait a minute. Christianity sort of convinced the world there was such a thing as a religion. And in some ways, the people living in India didn't know they had a religion until the British came and named it for them. Before that, it was how the world worked. Now I want to bring in a classical story, an ancient story, Oedipus the King, Oedipus Rex, by Sophocles. And I found this morning a really delightful video, a really delightful channel, Classic Summarized, Oedipus Rex. And so in eight minutes they summarize it in a pretty fun way. It has a million and a half hits and the channel has multi-million subs, but it's a good video. I'll leave the link in the show notes. But, oh shoot, I was going to... Okay, I have to decide which way I want to go. I'm going to go with this first. So another thing to do is look at the sparks notes. So let me bring up my window here because it'll show up there. And so sparks notes, of course, and this is, of course, I had cliff notes back when I was in school and you actually had to buy paper in order to read this. And now we can just go to the internet and find sparks notes. And here's Oedipus the King. And let's think about this question. Is this a religious story? Were these people religious? So a plague strikes Thebes. The citizens gather outside the palace of their King. And right away you might say, oh, you have a plague. Why don't you all stay home and lock down? They gather outside the King. The King's got to do something about the plague. Oedipus asking him to take action, do something about the plague. Trump, Biden, do something about the pandemic. Oedipus replies that he's already sent his brother-in-law, Creon, to the oracle at Delphi to learn how to help the city. What do we do in America? Well, we have scientists. There are religion. That's where we get the information that teaches us how to act in this world. All right. Creon returns with a message from the oracle. The plague will end when the murderer of Laos, the former King of Thebes, is caught and expelled. The murderer is within the city. Okay. Exclusion, inclusion. If someone who's within the city walls, that is in a sense, well, it's a walled garden. That is in a sense, holy ground. And there's contamination. Now, again, you might hear this and think, well, this is very religious. Why doesn't someone teach them about germs? Because the germ and morality have nothing in common, except we all believe that. Because, well, do you believe that homeless people are immoral? Well, that's complicated. Do you believe that they're dirty? Do you believe that immoral people are dirty? I remember in the Democratic primaries, one of the presidential candidates, when asked what their top priority would be, she said, basically, we have to decontaminate and scrub the White House after Trump leaves. Now, Trump is a rather famous germaphobe. He's not dirty. Why did she use that language? Jonathan Haidt is all over this. Now I remember why I switched the order. Someone in my consciousness congress was talking to me. I'll get there in a minute. Oedipus replies, Creon about the murder of Laos, who was killed by thieves on his way to consult an oracle. Only one of his fellow travelers escaped alive. Oedipus promises to solve the mystery of Laos' death, vowing to curse and drive out the murderer. And if you know anything about this story, you can go to that little video and find out there's going to be a little surprise about who the murderer is. All right. So you've angered the gods. That's why there's a plague. You've angered the gods. And we say, oh, you silly, silly pagans. Now, not one of the good classicists that the Enlightenment Christian free clean room was built upon. This is the source of the Enlightenment? These people? They went looking for morality as the cause of contagion. Well, notice during the pandemic, in many ways, a mask, this one made by a member of the church. This shows your morality, doesn't it? If you wear this with some people, you're a moral person. If you wear this with other people, you're not a moral person. You're not a patriot. You're not a defender of liberty. Why would masks have moral valence? Of course, Jonathan Pigeot will talk about this for, you know, his videos are shorter than mine. But morality and contagion, are they linked? Well, he's banging his mom. Now, is she really his mother, even if he doesn't know it? Pagans understood physicality. Pagans understood the relationship between physicality and identity. It's us that are really starting to play in interesting ways with physicality and identity. So you've angered the gods. A plague falls upon Thebes. If only they knew about germ theory, they could have prevented that pesky plague and utopia would arrive. COVID. We didn't prevent the pesky plague, did we? When Trump wanted to close the borders from China. That's racism. A little later didn't seem like it. We're funny, aren't we? We're really funny. We think that we know what's going on in the world. We think all these lines are clear and distinct. And then stuff happens. And here we are. Now, what we will be told is, well, don't worry, we'll get there. We will. What about me? I'm in my fifties. No, I don't think they're solving death before I get to die. Is modern science going to raise the dead? Would we want to be raised the dead by modern science? Why did you disturb me from my sleep? How many movies have dead people say? We dream these things in our stories. We play with them in our stories. All of these ideas we play with in our stories. This is theology. This is eschatology. This is, well, eschatology is the basic level. I'm going to move my, there we go. Now, I want to play some more video. I just played some Peterson. I want to play some Daniel Bonavac. Who is Daniel Bonavac? Daniel Bonavac, I think he still is, professor at University of, another U of T, not University of Toronto, University of Texas, Austin. And he's got a lot of YouTube videos out there. He's a professor of philosophy and he's a really good professor. And I believe it was in, I forget his name right now, I did a conversation with him. A lot of us have done conversations with him. He's a filmmaker in Toronto. And he did a conversation with Daniel Bonavac. And Bonavac basically said, I really can't teach my 20th century ideas course anymore. People get too upset. Why do people get too upset? Well, when you hear some of this video, you'll learn why people get too upset, even though not a lot of people have watched this video. Well, 40,000 said it's a respectable video. But basically what he says throughout this course, which is a really fascinating course, is that what we live in the midst of are all these two level theories. What were the levels for the ancients? Well, there were the people and there were the gods. What are the levels for us? Well, there's us and there's science. Why did I put the gods above and science below? Well, science is below us. We think we're top dog. We think we're top monkey. Science is below us. Science doesn't tell us anything. We speak through science like an oracle speaks through the gods. Are you noticing how things don't change? You notice how things do change. But all these two level theories. And so, well, what does Oedipus, King Oedipus need to do? He needed to address the thing with the gods in order to fix the plague. We need to address the thing in the science in order to fix the plague. But science doesn't seem to have as much power as the gods, which is why people continue to be religious. Or in fact, they still believe in science, but they also believe in the gods. Well, you can't have both. Really? Well, now I remember why I wanted to bring in Freddie de Boer. Esther passed along this little gem to me, the religion beneath. Read the whole thing. It's on Substack. I'll put the link in the comment. What became of atheism? Part one, the whole article is good. And Esther said, you're going to want to treat this. Yeah, I am. What makes this process quite strange to me? He's talking about, you know, atheism and Christianity. And part of what makes height, he's skeptical about Jonathan height, Adam friended, sorry, heights perspective. So bankrupt is that the meaning and rules for people, which so often praise in religion, so often praise in religion in the abstract stem from their very supernatural elements, which people are now so eager to do away with. I should probably pull up the whole article and, and, and read this in context. The whole thing is just so good. He first starts talking about new atheism. Now, Freddie de Boer is a communist, well, a Marxist at least, and he's a real one. And he's upfront about it. And so I like reading people who are upfront about their ideas, even though some of you are allergic to Marxist, you'll get hives if you get near one. Well, here's one. Talks about the new atheist and didn't really like talks about the politics of the new atheist. He mostly talks politics. And then he talks about how, gosh, the whole thing is so interesting. It's hardly an original notion at this point that the new atheist took religion more seriously than many people who were ostensibly religious. I have never been one of the new atheist is itself a religion. I've never been one of the new atheism is itself a religion meme. It abstracts religion to the point of meaninglessness simply to dunk on atheists in a high minded fashion. It has certainly been true that if modern religion is afflicted with a dearth of passion, new atheists helped to, to re infuse that passion, making religion very, taking religion very seriously. And in their zest, inspiring slumbering hordes to rust to religion's defense. Yeah, they did do that. Now that mutual commitment to engagement and argumentative escalation is almost entirely gone. New atheists exist and fight in forums on Reddit constantly, but there were once getting cover stories and publications like the Atlantic, seemingly weekly. They now seem like a curio of the early mid twenties, like a crank, like a crunk era of rap or, or knowing that George W. Bush is, is a hideous monster. He paints now he loves immigrants. He has the blood of 500,000 Iraqis on his hands. So cute. I'll give you a little taste of, of, of Freddie DeBoer's political sentiments, but, but he goes into the new atheist, but then he, he begins to note that, well, basically what, what James Lindsley talked to me about, seems like a long time ago now when I had him on the channel before he kind of rose, my timing was good on that one. And why guys like James Lindsley and Peter Boghossian are not fighting against Christians anymore. Well, they don't, they're still atheists, but it's just that they're too busy fighting their own fellow atheists who they charge are acting like religious people. Because I find many aspects of new atheists to be so unpalatable, even though Freddie DeBoer is an atheist too, and the whole phenomenon to be directly contrary to secular interests. I shared the detest many people, this distaste many people feel, but I am also convinced that the religious should be worried about the decline in the holy wars and wars. In other words, the new atheist sort of pumped up the Christians. That's sort of how people work. These skirmishes also died down, I suspect, because many fighting on behalf of the religious side were admittedly non-believers themselves. And because many of their liberal religious counterparts adopted those tactics. I can't tell how often, for example, commenters on liberal blogs would preface a denunciation of Richard Dawkins by reassuring everyone that they themselves were agnostic or otherwise unaffiliated. Of course, Christianity is a very important part of the religious system. Of course Christianity isn't literally true, says Michael Shermer. They would always say that before excoriating arrogant atheists. What they never seemed to understand is that the of course was more a grievous insult to sincere Christians than Christopher Hitchens could ever come up with. In other words, if you really want to insult someone, treat them like they're non-consequential. That's how you really devoid them of all their agency. Don't fight them. When you fight them, you validate them. Treat them like they're simply not a problem, because if you're treating them like they're simply not a problem, you're signaling you probably believe they're simply not a problem unless you've just got a whole bunch of different levels beneath. Let's see if I can get these words a little bigger for you. There we go, that works. And bigger for me too. Progressive Christians, for their part, often did essentially the same thing. They would constantly pre-announce that they would not consider theological questions in these fights because those questions were not the real question at hand. We'll never see eye to eye enough to argue, but of course this pre-emptive strike did atheism a favor, even if it made arguing harder for the new atheists. It deepened the sense of genuine religious content is irrelevant, not a subject of interest for adults. While I acknowledge that this is a kind of uncharitable mind reading, I think that so many religious participants felt more comfortable shunting the question of God's existence to the side because of their own ambivalence to that question. Now I think here in many ways Freddie Debore sort of exposes the fact that this is his posture and he takes the thoroughly modernist take that. Well the real argument is the existence of, and I'll throw in the definite article, the God because if you followed my channel enough you'll know, oh there's things to talk about there too. God number one and God number two. This is what I mean when I say that atheism can lose again and again while in the background secularism wins. He clearly has not read Tom Holland. Surveys may make it such, but religious identity is not a binary and my own experience in the world is limited as that is, suggests that the intensity and certainty of faith is declining faster than self-identification and a greater negative effect for religion. He's watching polls of the nuns, but again he's seeing it through a secular frame and he doesn't understand yet. I think that's coming in our culture because I see it on Twitter. I see some atheist plus people and I see some progressive Christians basically now picking up what Tom Holland is saying and saying yeah secularism is just Christianity light. What we need is, what you need is what? What we need is a new religion which is a new two-level theory. New atheists are hard to please. They want a victory that feels like victory, a grand renunciation of religion where the believers openly repent. Isn't that what everyone wants including the Christians? They want at the end of the debate Sam Harris to say I believe. You're gonna make a meme out of that one? Similar I must admit to the apocalyptic Christian belief in the prophecies of revelation, see, but if they were less driven by contempt they might have noticed that they have won by losing. Every day religion recedes a little bit into the background as ordinary people, religious or not, abstract religious meaning in their lives to the point where it's hard to know how it would begin to define why a distinction between believer and non-believer actually matters. Now there's a point there but I disagree with this point because my assertion is that just like with Oedipus, religion never goes away. It's always the way we engage with the world. And he talks about Satanists. He talks about Jonathan Haidt. We are talking ultimately about abstracting religious observation, action, practice from what religious identity has been for most practitioners for thousands of years. An expression of literal belief. There's that word again. It's sort of a modernist tell. In or about supernatural forces that exert control over a material world. He's framing it just like a modernist. Freddy, modernity is going away. I'm just telling you now. Determine the nature of morality and many traditional rules over an afterlife which provide punishment or reward in that afterlife on your adherence to that moral code, whether heaven, reincarnation or other. After we have rejected the truth part of these truth claims, there is no reason to cling to any of the beliefs about the nature of reality or morality and a religion becomes a club like any other. You might as well join the Elks Club. Now again, a lot of people have been doing this but what's really happening is religion is sublimated. Now seeing how much endurance I have and how long I dare make this video, because it's going to be long. That's basically Tom Holland's argument with respect to culture wars in their most recent edition of The Rest is History, which I thought was outstanding. But Freddy is un-reconstructed. But then he sort of notices his own stuff. What makes this process quite strange for me and part of what makes Height's perspective so bankrupt is that the meaning and rules for life which people so often praise in religion in the abstract and the abstract stem from the very supernatural elements which people are now so eager to do away with. Okay, let's go all the way back to Peterson and Shermer. Shermer is talking like Freddy de Boer. Peterson comes along and says you don't understand how people work. I'm a psychologist. I've studied how people work. This supernatural miracle stuff, it's got some valence and because of modernity we're sort of framing it that way. But what's really moving people are the stories. That's what's really moving people. Yes, religion provides psychic comfort in an unfriendly world. Freddy de Boer is a Marxist, albeit of the people. But it does so because it imposes on sense, on senselessness through the existence of one or many who literally determine what sense is. See again, Freddy, it's story. Yes, religion helps guide moral decisions, but it does so because it posits an entity from whom unerring moral precepts flow. That's part of it, but it's story because the movies we watch that are molding morality, you don't go into that movie and imagine that there's a real iron man in the sky. Sam Harris would attack that real iron man pretty darn fast. That's sort of God number two, but it's completely forgetting God number one. Yeah, I'm gonna have to define that again for those of you who are new to the channel. God number one is Arenic, the arena. God number two is agentic, the agency. Ancient paganism was, well, there was a meta-divine realm which sort of stood in for God number one, and then the gods were basically like superheroes. The Hebrews constructed it differently. Yes, religion helps rescue people from feelings of meaninglessness, but it does so because it tells people that they have a specific moral purpose that is defined by a creature of infinite greater wisdom than ours. Creature? Oh, Freddy, do you know absolutely nothing of Christianity? I mean, in some ways, if you want to make a play, it doesn't really even matter that way, supernatural, natural, how about divine creation? Part of the reason you find Protestants get so squeamish about the word divine, like in my conversation with Rafe about the divine feminine, and you saw Anselman jump on that right away in the comments, was, well, we sort of just reserved divine for God, and your creature of greater worth, that's one of the gods. That's a sort of a pagan god. It's not Christianity, but I understand how you're confused. A lot of people are confused, including ones who go to church. Yes, religion soothes the sick and elderly, but it does so because it tells them, see, it's lying, it's this opiate, tells them that they will soon be joined with a maker who will grant them some sort of eternal reward. You take away the supernatural element, as so many now seem to do, and now you're kicking two legs out from the three-legged stool. I don't see how getting catechized and joining your temple helps you any if you also think that they are living accidental lives. In other words, here comes the meaning crisis. The product of some chemicals happening to congeal in such a way, in a spiritually dead and directionless universe, one in which your life will flare up in an eye blink and then cease to matter for the rest of eternity. Sartre would still stare into the heavens, soul crying out for meaning, if you gave him a set of rosary beads and told him he didn't have to actually believe in she who inspired their use. It's right there. Esther knows what she's doing when she sends me this stuff. I don't always use what Esther sends me, but she was dead on with this one. And so he's going to continue with this. But yeah, there we are. But let's continue back to Daniel Bonavac. Well, maybe I'll just play the tape because he describes it quite well. Tape, I said. Excellent. Well, then let's talk about the problem of normativity. That's today's topic. And so what I want to do is think about a problem that I think is a central problem throughout the day. That I think is a central problem throughout the 20th century. It is in part a philosophical problem, but it's not just a philosophical problem. It's really a problem that affects people's everyday lives, the way they think about their lives, the way they think about themselves, the way they think about their relationship to other people into the world. So let's take a look at what this problem is. We have to go back to the Enlightenment. The problems that are dealt with in the 20th century arise out of the Enlightenment, and in particular in the Scientific Revolution. There are two thoughts that emerge in the Enlightenment that sit somewhat uncomfortably together. And Enlightenment thinkers, I think, don't fully appreciate the complexity of this. But by the dawn of the 20th century, people became well aware of the tension between these two Enlightenment ideals. One of them is the gap between is and ought. That's what I'm calling this problem of normativity. What do I mean by normativity? Well, norms, the ought factor. We evaluate the world as good, bad, right, wrong, just, and unjust. We also describe the world, and there's a little bit of a tension between those two things. In a traditional conception of the world, they go together very nicely. But there's something, as we'll see, about the Scientific Revolution that suggests, at least to some people, that science could be a complete description of the world. And once that's the case, you start thinking, well, wait, then what is left over for these evaluative judgments, the rights, wrongs, just, unjust, for that kind of virtuous, vicious, cowardly, courageous, and so on? What is there left for that kind of language to do? What's left for the ought if we can give a complete description of the world in science in terms of just is and must? So there's a gap between is and ought, between description and prescription, if you want to put it that way, or description and evaluation between fact and value. And it's that gap that is going to concern us. Now, the thought really goes back to ancient times that, yes, there are these two dimensions of things I can simply describe or I can also evaluate. I can talk about the way the world is or the way the world ought to be. However, the tension between the two is something that really arises as a product of the Enlightenment. The second thought from the Enlightenment that is going to create the puzzle and do a lot to create the tension is the idea of a two-level theory. We're going to see a lot of two-level theories throughout this course. Now, I just made the argument a little bit ago that in many ways, the Greeks had a two-level theory too, and all ancient people did. There's, but it's the level this way. It's the god or the gods, and it's us. Now the two-level theories are going to be beneath. And so they arise for the first time, perhaps, in the Enlightenment. They create a problem, as we'll see, about what it is to be human. Now, what do I mean by a two-level theory? Well, according to this sort of theory, there is- Now, part of why it's going to create a problem of what it means to be human is relationality, because look at what Oedipus had to do with he had to figure out how you related relationally to the gods. Okay? That's how you related. What about when they're below? We don't relate relationally below. We command and we control and we colonize and we dominate below. There's a surface level of things, roughly the world as we observe it, and ourselves as we observe ourselves. And then there's a depth level, a deeper level, that actually does all the explanatory work, that explains why things at the surface level behave the way they do. So a classic example is in science. We describe what's going on in a chemistry lab, for example, by talking ultimately about molecular structures. We talk about the microscopic level of things, and we say that explains what's going on at the macroscopic level, the level of appearances. That's one example of a two-level theory. As we'll see throughout the course, there are many others. There's evolutionary theory that says, aha, yes, you seem to be doing this in this, but really you're serving a certain genetic purpose. Or we'll see a variety of versions, for example, Freudian psychology. Ah, you think you're doing it for that reason, but no, no, no, you're really doing it because you hate your father and wanted to sleep with your mother-in-law. Or Nietzsche's idea that yes, you think you're doing this for noble reasons, but actually it's a will to power, you're doing it to grab additional power for yourselves, and so on and so forth. So there are going to be lots of examples of two-level theories we'll consider. The purest, you might say the most respectable, is the thing that arises out of the scientific revolution. The scientific conception of the world is ultimately depending on the behavior of what microparticles, but we'll see many other variants. Anyway, what's key here is that what's happened hidden at this deep level determines what's happening at the surface level. Okay, I want to go to his second lecture. Let's see if I can navigate this. All right, here we go. And so on and so forth. So there are going to be lots of examples of two-level theories we'll consider. The purest, you might- No, I didn't do it right. Hang on. Okay, maybe I'll do the end of this lecture, then I'll do the beginning of, and I'll do some of the next lecture. Well, I'm going to skip a couple of things here and get to a 20th century version of this that generalizes the picture. Now, some of you have been on the channel a while. We'll remember some of this, I've played some of this before. It's Wilford Sellers and how he frames it. We're talking about it gives us some key terms we're going to use throughout the course. This is a contemporary, well, almost contemporary, 20th century philosopher, Wilford Sellers, who taught at Iowa, at Minnesota, at Yale, and then for about the last two-thirds of his career at the University of Pittsburgh. And he gives a very famous definition of philosophy. The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, he says, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term. Okay, so what is philosophy? It's really the attempt to say how everything fits together, how things hang together. Now, what kinds of things? Well, anything, okay? All of this is understood very, very broadly. Now, philosophy in that way is sort of like impractical religion. It's sort of like theoretical religion in some ways, because religion is working it. Philosophy is thinking it. It doesn't have one specific field of study. In fact, when I told my grandmother that I was going back to my hometown to study philosophy, she said, oh, that's nice, Danny. What's philosophy? And I hadn't started studying with Sellers yet, so I couldn't give her that. I don't think it would have helped anyway. But it is puzzling, right? If I had studied it, it is puzzling, right? If I say, what is astronomy? You know, right? Study of the heavenly bodies. If I say, what is sociology? You know, it's the study of society. Biology, the study of life. But philosophy, ooh, that's hard to say. And here's his point, really. We don't have, as philosophers, a special subject matter. Our job is to explain how all the rest of it fits together. So there's an additional problem, not just how the whole picture fits together. He says the philosophers confront it not by one complex, many-dimensional picture, like all of those given by the special sciences, the unity of which, such as it is, you must come to appreciate, but by two pictures of essentially the same order of complexity. Now, in this way, so for an ancient religious person that doesn't know they're religious because they're just living, you have the gods that you relate to up and you have the world that you relate to down. So philosophy, in some ways, is this direction. And you can see that here. So there's two levels here. Each of which purports to be a complete picture of man in the world, and which after separate scrutiny- Now, I'm not saying that philosophers anti-Christian or anything like that, because, of course, many philosophers have been theists all the way on and many philosophers have been Christians, but I hope you get an understanding of a lot of contemporary secular philosophy. ...must fuse into one vision. Let me refer to these two perspectives as the manifest and scientific images of the world. So those are the two key terms we're going to be using throughout the course. The manifest image, that is, the world as we ordinarily perceive it, and also ourselves as we ordinarily perceive ourselves. And then the scientific image of the world, the image given to us by the sciences and especially ultimately by the physics. How do we fit those two perspectives together? He says it's really a task of stereoscopic vision. We've got one view, that is, the view on the basis of common sense, roughly, on the basis of our ordinary perception of the world. And then we've got a view supplied by the special sciences. And as we'll see, especially by the sciences that take us beyond the macro level of observations of the world to the micro level and postulate laws at some microscopic level. How do we fit these two visions of the universe together? What is the manifest image? Well, it's just basically, as he says, characterizable in two ways. First of all, it's the framework in which we encounter ourselves, in terms of which man came to be aware of himself as man in the world. It's the framework in terms of which, to use an existentialist term of phrase, man first encountered himself, which is when he came to be man. And so basically this is, well, how you find yourself. What are the basic objects of the manifest image? Well, people, animals, lower forms of life, and merely material things like rivers and stones, cabbages and kings. Okay, the objects of the ordinary world, like my cow. That's partly a memorial. She died on Monday. So I'm so sorry. But I thought that would bum you out, so I decided to cheer you up with the next slide. Anyway, the other image is the scientific. He put a picture of a cat reading, to kill a mockingbird on the screen. That's what everyone was laughing at, for those of you who are listening to the podcast. It arises out of the manifest image by careful observation and experimentation. Those observatories were there partly to convert our manifest image, common sense observations of the heavens into a scientific theory. And so we carefully observe, we carefully measure, we test hypotheses, we experiment. But he says, then something new happens. Something dramatic happens with the introduction of theoretical entities. Things like atoms, microparticles, genes, all of those sorts of things, fields, all of those are unobservable, but nevertheless causally active. All of the first part, you might say most of astronomy and so on, it's really a matter, at least in the early stages, of refining our manifest image observation of the world. But then we actually introduce that second hidden level, and that changes things dramatically. So the manifest image is our macro level image of the world. The scientific image is our micro level image of the world. What physics ultimately describes as this world of microparticles, waves, fields, and other things that are interacting according to scientific laws at the base level. So here's one way of thinking about this. As we now turn our attention back to ourselves, in the manifest image, we talk about rationality. We think of ourselves as behaving as rational people, as making decisions for reasons. We think morality applies to us. Sometimes we make the right decision, sometimes the wrong one. It might really be a moral thing. It might be a different kind of normative thing. There are times when I do something that's not immoral, but just stupid. And so there are all sorts of evaluations there, not just moral evaluations. In that image, we take responsibility, or fail to take responsibility for our actions. We think of ourselves as free. We think of ourselves as capable of making decisions. And so we think of ourselves as exercising what philosophers have called practical reason. But in the scientific image, it looks like I'm simply this cloud of microparticles, of waves, of fields that are governed by causal laws. That description of me is completely value free. And I'm afraid it'd be more basically say, well, that's what we are. And I seem to be paved in a way that's purely determined. Or if you think quantum mechanics is to be understood in indeterministic probabilistic ways, then there's some element of randomness thrown in too. But randomness, plus some degree of determination by law, don't really feel like they add up to freedom. So, well, I'm going to skip this part since we're low on time. But the idea is these images aren't just two rival images. They clash. They differ in certain ways. What makes it tough is that the scientific image seems to claim to be a complete description of the world. And yet, if we think of it as a complete description, we're left out of it. We, as we think of ourselves, we as free beings, as beings who think of ourselves as free, who think of ourselves as acting according to reasons, as thinking of ourselves as doing what we ought to do or failing to do what we ought to do, all of that seems left out of the picture altogether. It's your meaning crisis. So it looks as if there's really a clash. And the problem is how we fit them together. How do we evaluate the conflicting claims of the manifest image and the scientific image? Well, that is indeed the problem. And Sellers identifies the core of the manifest image. What is really special about it? What is unique? What makes it itself? Well, when we say that a certain person desired to do A, thought it his duty to do B, but was forced to do C, we're not describing him as a scientific specimen. We're describing him but doing something more. And that's the irreducible core of the manifest image. It is, in our terms, normativity. The irreducibility of the personal is the irreducibility of the ought to be is. So in the end, he says, it's really Hume's problem that is dividing these. The manifest image is shot through and through with the ought, with norms of a variety of kinds, with evaluations. But the scientific image seems to be strictly in terms of the is. How do we fit them together? He says, really, in the end, science is describing the realm of law. The manifest image, we think of ourselves as belonging to the space of reasons. But now, how do we combine a view of law with a view of reasons? How do we think of the realm of law as interacting with the space of reasons? He says it's not really a different realm. It's a different way of seeing the same realm. But how do those ways actually combine into one vision of what a human being is? So here, to just summarize, in the manifest image, we think of ourselves as free, acting for reasons, acting right or wrongly. We take responsibility. In the scientific image, we're just determined by something we aren't conscious of. Our reasons are mere rationalizations. Ferality is either nonsense or reduces to something else. And so we have no responsibility. And so I'll leave you with this problem. This is a statue called Molecule Men in Berlin. And it seems to me to illustrate this. These beings are striving. They're doing things, it seems. And yet, you get the impression they're just made out of steel. They're just made out of microparticles. And so how do we fit those two visions of ourselves together? Okay, now let's jump to what's next. Today, we discussed the thought of Karl Marx. We're going to be backing up a bit before we do that and thinking about some of the history of the 19th century that gets us up to the thought of Marx. But Marx is really our main objective for the day. Why do we study him in a course on ideas of the 20th century? Well, because Marxism becomes one of the main ideas of the 20th century. It spreads to much of the world. The parts pictured here in red become part of a communist bloc at some point during the 20th century. And so it ends up having a huge impact on world history, not really initially, but largely in the 20th century. So it becomes a key thing to study. And it's important to understand its sources and its nature in order to understand later what happens during the 20th century. Now, there's a little bit of intellectual background. I want to tie things back to what we were discussing last time with our distinction between the manifest image and the scientific image. The manifest image is our common sense picture of the world. It's our picture of the world as consisting of ordinary middle-sized physical objects, you and me, desks and tables, cameras, screens, iPads, glasses, and so on. That's the sort of ordinary picture we have of the world. But the scientific revolution introduced a new idea. In fact, at one point, John Locke is talking about vision. He says, how is it possible for us to see things? And he actually comes up with a strangely modern theory of vision. He doesn't know what to call anything. But he says, well, there are these particles that light consists of. They're like little tennis balls that bounce off things and bounce into our eyes. And that actually isn't so terribly different from a contemporary idea of what light is. Notice what he's doing. He's taking a common sense type thing like light and describing it in terms of microparticles, in terms of waves, in terms of fields, in terms of, well, as he puts, little tennis balls. But other things like that that are microscopic, we can't ordinarily see them. Nevertheless, their behavior explains the behavior of the things we ordinarily encounter. So that's the picture of really the manifest image, the scientific image, and then the problem sellers points to is how we put those things together. Well, there's a certain way of taking that idea that leads to significant trouble throughout the 20th century. I'm going to refer to it as neo-gnosticism. It's lonely. And I think this is really helpful, and especially because Sam Adams had the point about Brett Weinstein's Gnosticism. And then when I saw this, it's like, oh, look at all of these two-level theories. So we'll let him walk through his, because I think this is really a good way of framing it and in fact connecting it to all of the ancient two-level theories. ...being one of the few who truly knows. But that becomes a common theme. A great number of intellectuals think they've got it figured out. They understand the base level well enough not just to do science, but to actually control the world, to be able to shape the world the way they want. And that's what I'm calling this neo-gnostic vision. Now, why neo-gnostic? Well, the Gnostics were an ancient group who thought there was a special secret knowledge. And if you had the key to that knowledge, then you could bring about utopia, either here or gain admission to heaven. And so it's that sort of idea. There's some secret knowledge, which is such that if you possess it, you can bring about utopia. Now, to return to last time, the manifest image of the world is a sort of surface image of the world, a common sense image. We think of ourselves as free beings. We're rational beings. We act for reasons in the manifest image. We tend to think of ourselves as acting rightly or wrongly, virtuously or viciously. We take responsibility. We think we are actually agents who act for reasons in the world. But the scientific image gives us a very different picture of ourselves. On that picture, a sort of depth picture of the world, we're determined by something we aren't conscious of, either by scientific laws and the motions of the microparticles or by something else, maybe by random jumps of electrons, whatever it is, there's something that is controlling what we're doing. We're not conscious of that. The reasons we actually give have nothing to do with the ultimate causes of our behavior. They're really just rationalizations. Morality is either just nonsense, because after all, there are no odds in science. There are no goods and bads. And so either it doesn't make any sense at all, or it really reduces to something else. It's an indirect way of saying, oh, well, this produces as much pleasure as possible, or as little pain as possible, or serves the evolutionary needs of the species, or something like that. And finally, on this vision, since we're not free, we have no responsibility. After all, we're not really in control. The electrons are in control. Now, if that's the picture, we have the manifest image, it's in some way acting the way it does because of the objects of the scientific image and what they are doing, then for a purely scientific version, you might say, nothing really follows. It's true that the world isn't as we think it is. We aren't as we think we are. On the other hand, what follows from that? Well, huh, not much of anything. Oh, surprise, the world isn't exactly what you thought. Well, big deal. However, that's because nobody really knows, nobody can manipulate the connections. But suppose people could. At least I should say they can't manipulate them in a very large scale way. We can manipulate them a little bit. You have a headache, I can say, oh, take this pill. And maybe I can even explain why that pill helps to relieve your pain. And so we can do this in sort of minor ways. We can't do it in very big ways. If I want to say, oh, I want to bring about utopia, what should I do to the electrons? That question doesn't really have any answer. But now what if I had a different theory? What if I thought I knew the basic level and understood it? And moreover, I understood in a big picture kind of way, the connections between that basic level and the surface level. Now you can sort of get a sense of what religion does because religion is two level theory of the ancient world. How does the world align? Well, get the world aligned with the gods and then the world will be set right if that's in fact the theological picture that's working there. But now with our contemporary two level theories, how is this working? Well, especially in a democratic thing, we have to get everyone on board in order to align with this theory. And so again, Freddie DeBoer might not see this as religious, but it's the same game. Then I might think, aha, to produce the outcome I want on the surface level, to produce this utopia, I know what to do. I can manipulate the base to bring about my goal. Well, if I had that knowledge and were convinced that I understood the connections, then maybe that project would make sense. So I might be able to take what you might say works in very limited ways in medicine and pharmacology and things like that, and start applying that to the whole social structure. Well, that sort of, I'll call it intellectual hubris, that idea that you understand things well enough to do that, combined with a two level theory of this sort that distinguishes something like a manifest in the scientific level, leads to a sort of two level conception of society. There are those who know and those who don't, right? And so you get what I'm calling modern Gnosticism or Neo-Gnosticism. There are those who know the underlying causes, call them the elite or the intellectuals or the anointing. And then there are those who don't, the common people, who don't understand the basic structure, don't understand the connections well enough to do anything about it. Now, this is, and by the way, in this course, we're going to be discussing a lot of ideas without meaning to endorse them. We're going to talk about Mussolini, we're going to talk about Hitler. I am not on their side. I'm not having you read them because I think, oh, they're awesome. Okay. And so this is one of those ideas that maybe you can tell, I don't tend to like it very much. On the other hand, it's an important idea. It motivates all sorts of actors, people who gain real political power throughout the 20th century. And so the Gnostic version of this is not merely the distinction between the manifest image and the scientific image, but the thought that it's possible to know this and to know the connections well enough to manipulate the base, to produce the outcome you want at the higher level. You can do something that actually transforms the world by applying appropriate manipulations to whatever the structure is that really has the causal power and serves as the scientific image on that conception. So here's the basic idea. Societies are now imperfect. People cause harm, right? They do all sorts of damage to other people. There are all sorts of things wrong with the world, disease, war, conflict, sisters-in-law, all sorts of terrible things. Okay. But look, people really aren't behaving freely. They're driven by forces that are hidden from them. And so maybe if we could change the pattern of those forces, we could get people to behave differently. And you can see this all the time. Well, people don't know that they're racist, but they're racist underneath. So if we can do something about their racism, then everything will be fine. People don't know that they're sexist or there's some, and in many ways the menu of sins has been quite dramatically reduced down to a few things. And so if we can change how people act, well, we can change social institutions. That maybe could change the pattern of forces. Maybe that could change the way people behave. So maybe if we manipulate, well, something, right, it depends what exactly we think is going on on that base scientific level, but whatever it is, if we are able to change institutions and change what's happening at that level, then maybe we can transform the way people behave. We just have to know how. So that's the vision. That's this utopian ideal, you might say, that if we only understand the connections well enough and understand the base level, we can bring about utopia. And so this leads us to think, look, most of the time what people say, it's not really what they mean. It's not really what's going on. There's this base level that's determining everything. So the fancy highfalutin name for this is the hermeneutics of suspicion. Hermeneutics, the science of interpretation. The idea is you interpret what people say in a fashion that isn't really on the surface. You interpret it in terms of the basic level. This sort of thing goes on most commonly and most famously in Freudian psychology. So why are you here to see me? Well, I'm unhappy. What are you unhappy about? I hate my boss and he hates me. Oh, tell me about your boss. And then you start talking and says, oh, tell me about your father. Hmm. Sounds like your boss and your father are a lot alike. They're both older men. So maybe you really hate your father and you think your father hates you. No, no, I get along okay with that. Et cetera, that sort of thing. And then you say, no, look, you don't know what's going on. You're completely wrong. I say, ah, resistance. Resistance is futile. Resistance is common in psychology. Actually, this is what Freud says. When Freud... You're showing fragility there. You're fragile. Find patients who say that's a bunch of garbage. He says, ah, okay, you're resisting treatment. This is common. This is part of my theory and so on. And so he doesn't take it seriously. He just says, yes, my theory predicts you would say that. I have to interpret you what you say in terms of these underlying causes. Okay. So anyway, yeah, I'm going to jump to this. Suppose you think there is a group of people, the elite, the intellectuals, the anointed, who actually know something about the base level. Then a certain problem arises. What are you supposed to do? After all, the thought is, well, you could bring about utopia if only you changed things at the basic level in the right way. But what would utopia be like? What would an ideal world be like? Pause for a moment and think about that. Imagine your ideal world. What would it be like? Are we supposed to answer? Yeah. I love that. Are we supposed to answer? Because right there, what would your ideal world be like? And I think about John McWhorter's, well, maybe you can have a soundtrack music, but it's amazingly difficult to answer this question. And so I love that. Are we supposed to answer that? Yes, it's a classroom. Let's talk. Are we supposed to answer? Yeah, I can just show you the films. I didn't expect you to actually talk to me. No tuition. No tuition. Okay. Ah, now we start to get particular. But where are all these particularities coming from? Well, he's probably feeling the pressure of paying tuition. Hey, so there's one aspect of your utopia. What other aspects? Education would be completely different. Education would be completely different? Yes. Unheard. Like, technically, I don't know if you've seen the video of why I like education but hate like school or something like that. Ah, yes. Like, you cram everything the night before just to forget it at all two weeks later. Yeah, right. No, listen, I didn't like school much either. I mean, by the time I got to your level, I started liking it. But I think I was shaped by the fact that when I was in second grade, we were doing this thing of learning to count by tens, and the teacher was taking out these packs of 10 pencils. And we were all saying, 10, 20, 30, you know. I was like, oh, I'm so bored. So I wasn't really paying attention. And when she brought up an empty hand, I was the only person in the class who shouted out 70. So she locked me in a room closet for an hour. So anyway, yeah, after that, I didn't like school very much. Um, but I like it when I'm on this side of it. This is much better. In any case, okay, so education would be different. Tell me more about your utopia. Yeah. No diseases. Everyone's healthy. No diseases. Everyone's healthy. Okay, that sounds like a good aspect of utopia. Tell me more. Yeah. No, like, gap between the rich and the poor. No gap between the rich and the poor. What else? Yeah. But if you don't have a gap between the rich and the poor, then everyone would be the same. You'll be very like, we'll all be poor. We'll all be rich. Oh, well, this is something we're going to encounter when we think about Marx. Yeah. Suppose there really were no gap between the rich and the poor. Then it's like, if you work really hard, guess what? You get nothing for it. Now, maybe you'd work hard anyway, because you just love work. But guess what? Yeah. And then the combat is already starting in the class. People who don't love work. So that does generate a problem. Other aspects of utopia. Yeah. You can eat whatever you want to get fat. Yes. Yes, I was so excited when they came up with a kind of fat that was like the mirror image of ordinary fats. So you could eat like potato chips and tortilla chips and so on with this stuff. And it would just flow through you like plastic. It would not actually make you fat. I thought, oh, utopia has arrived. But guess what? It flowed through you like plastic. It gave everyone diarrhea. So much for the greatest nutrition innovation of 1985. In any event. 1985. Yeah. We could describe this in lots of ways, but notice we could have different visions. And so there's a sort of problem. Aha. Well, maybe we have the key to the universe and create our utopia. But what would that be like? What should we actually do? Well, in a way, it's easy to answer, right? Change the base to change the surface into your utopia. But hold on a second. Which kind of utopia do we want? What should we strive for? And what should we strive for first and so on? We have to know what we ought to do. But now we've got a problem. The Gnostic vision here relies on norms, odds. What are we be anointed to do with our newfound powers since we've figured out all these structures? What kind of state of society should we try to bring about? And yet it also undermines them because the odds are all up there at the surface level. They're not there at the base level. We actually think they're all nonsense, right? Or they're cover for something else. And hold on a second. We need them to decide what to do. So I'm going to refer to that as the paradox of the anointed. And it's something that will come about or come back to haunt us. And the number of points in the course, this vision relies on norms. We have to know what we ought to do. What an ideal state of society would be. What really would be the best state of society? What would be better than the present? What would be just and so on? That means we need norms to decide what to do. But the vision also undermines those very norms. They are treated purely as derivative or as nonsense on the level that matters. The basic level, they don't exist at all. Now, again, if you if we use Sellers thing, we imagine we want to get our true certainty comes from the scientific image. That's the knowledge that we have. The other certainty, we can't be certain of those things are in the manifest image. But you can't get any of those odds from the scientific image because they're all in the manifest image. In other words, it's always you've always got to get them from people. And again, if you're if you're thinking through this, you're seeing all of the dilemmas. And I really love how he labels this, the paradox of the anointed. And so we're forced to rely for our very decisions to shape our utopia on these things that we've undermined and we've thought are nonsense. And so what do we do? It becomes a serious problem. And we'll see it rear its head again and again, as people have this vision, and then find as they try to put it into practice, they run into very serious. And so what we do is we smuggle Jesus in, because Jesus is going to show us what to do. We'll get there a few minutes. Well, let's back up and take a look at the historical background to see how we actually get to Marx's thought. The basic thing we're going to be talking about today, though, we'll discuss various aspects of his thought. The most important one will be the Communist Manifesto published in 1848, which is a key year of revolutions in Europe, one of the picture there in Germany. So let's take a look at how all of this comes about. We talked last time about the scientific revolution of the enlightenment in the way in which it transformed our understanding of nature, our ability to look around the nature as governed by scientific laws that were universal, that were necessary, that were absolute. That immediately didn't have much impact on the way people lived. However, the technology that the scientific revolution made possible did begin about 100 years later, maybe, to start having a significant impact on the way the average person lived. Suppose that you were alive in 1750. You would probably be living pretty much as your parents had lived and as your grandparents had lived, as people had lived 100 or 1000 or even 5000 years before. What could you really accomplish? Well, really what your own muscle power would enable you to accomplish, maybe with the help of a few animals, a few primitive tools, but you really wouldn't be able to accomplish a great deal. Nothing very different from what anybody else had been able to achieve since roughly the Iron Age. Suddenly, technology comes on the scene that transforms agriculture in the 18th century and then in the 19th century transforms manufacturing, makes it possible to actually have industry, to have factories, to produce the kinds of things that no one had ever been able to produce before. That changed the nature of human society very fundamental. Let's start with the agricultural revolution. After 1750 in Britain and spreading then throughout the rest of the world, the agricultural revolution made it possible for farmers to grow much more food with much less work. There was more food, lower prices, it took a lot less labor. That meant that people had more money for other things. Also, there was a lot of surplus labor. People were no longer needed on the farms and that led to a transformation of society and made possible actually the industrial revolution to follow. Now, how did this come about? Well, partly people were able to develop new farm tools. Partly they developed a four-field crop rotation system that was much more efficient than earlier systems. Partly they imported crops from the new world that enabled the soil to be enriched as well as new ways of producing food. Also, they developed better fertilizers, both synthetic and natural fertilizers. They understood in short the science of farming much better. And so the result of that was, well, new technologies. Here you see 19th century farmers spraying fields. Here you see the kinds of large farms that became possible with this sort of technology that were completely impossible before. What you could really farm was limited by what you could do with your own hands, with a few horses, with some oxen. But now suddenly you could do larger states. Corn from the new world. You could grow food much more efficiently and you could also allow fields to lie fallow and replenish them. And so the result of that was much more food available to the population. And it really solved two kinds of problems. Both the problem of food shortages, where there were local failures of harvest and things like that, sort of local famines. But also when harvests were good, what were the farmers going to do with all that extra food? Well, as we'll see, they soon developed ways of transporting that food to markets to make it possible for us to solve the problem of surpluses as well as the problem of food shortages. And so the idea of being able to go to a market and buy food in this sort of way became something that was much easier and much more available for people than it had ever been before. Now, this was possible only because large and successful farms actually were left alone. There was enough stability in government to grant people rights to property and that made it possible for people to develop farms and keep them. Before that, at a certain stage, if you were too successful, some noble, maybe even the king, would come in and kick you off the land and take it over. And so it required the kind of stability of the political revolution in the Enlightenment here, John Locke, who helps to bring that about, and also the power, for example, of parliament against the king. In any case, that political background obtained in much of the world by the 18th century, and so it made possible a transformation. The result of that was a transformation in what the population was able to do. In 1800, four people out of five worked on farms. Only one person lived in a village or a town or city. And so 80 percent of the population was involved in food production. A hundred years later, it was down to 20 percent of the people involved in food production, and 80 percent were now in cities, in towns, doing other things. That means that throughout the 19th century, 60 percent of the population moved from the countryside into the cities and had to find something different to do. By the way, what percentage of people now are involved in food production? Two percent. Two percent, yes. So it's an amazing transformation. Now, 98 percent of the people are out here. I thought there should be a third slide where I had 98 little pictures of them, but I thought, no. So anyway, yeah, during the 19th century, there was a huge movement of population. 60 percent of the people ended up moving from the countryside to the cities. There were other things in technology that transformed the way people lived and amplified these effects. Consider clothing. Edmund Cartwright in 1787 invented the power of clothing. I hate it when I talk to a muted mic. Before that, clothing tended to be handmade. All of a sudden, it became possible to produce fabric and then shortly thereafter, back to clothing in factories. And so the growth of this was very rapid. 1813, there were 2,400 of these power looms in Great Britain. Again, as I said before, into the muted mic, the transformation in the 19th century was astounding. And in the 18th century, I mean, things are changing enormously rapidly in the physical lives and therefore the social lives moving to the city. My ancestors moved from the Netherlands to the United States at the end of the 19th century and very quickly migrated from probably farm work into urban work and they went to cities. By mid-century, there were a quarter of a million. And so the idea of making clothing by hand almost disappeared by the middle of the 19th century. That meant that clothing became much cheaper, much more widely available. Instead of the average person having one or two suits of clothing, you have this and when it gets already a change in the back, that's pretty much it. No, suddenly people began to actually, well, have wardrobes, began to actually look better, began to smell better because you could actually like wash clothes and have something else to put on. For the first time, people were able to wear cheap cotton underwear. It drastically reduced the incidence of disease. So here's an example of a power loom. This meant, of course, that the average person involved in the clothing industry was no longer sitting there doing a bit of sewing all by themselves. They were operating something like that and that transformed the nature of labor significantly. Here's another example of a power loom. Well, if that was only the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, a major development was James Watt's invention of the steam engine. In the 1760s, he invented the engine. At first, it couldn't really do much and it was very large, but in 1782 with the rotary steam engine, he made it much more powerful. By 1800, it was capable of generating 10,000 horsepower. Think about that, the power you can have by harnessing 10,000 horses together. So it was something much greater than anybody had been able to harness before. By the middle of the century, it was 1.3 million horsepower. And so the increase, again, I mean, these are, and these are just two aspects. You have enormous change in how many different areas throughout this period. And of course, when you have change like that, you have disruption, dislocation, you're going to have poverty, you're going to, I mean, social structures have to be created. I mean, it's, when you, these are just two little areas, just enormous change. Increase in power, the increase in what human beings could accomplish was vast and again, led to a fundamental transformation in the way the average person lived their lives. Here's a painting of Watt doing his calculations and looking into the fire and getting the idea of the steam engine. And here in 2013, the iPad was relatively new and the professor had a projector that he could use. And now suddenly he could show pretty pictures. I know, I took the same trip. One of his first rotary steam engines. It was big. It wasn't terribly useful in that form, but it didn't take long for people to find uses in building roads, in building canals, in building steam ships. And so. And you're going to have the end of slavery in, in the, you know, in England a little bit earlier. And of course, as, as Tom Holland notes, that the English are going to basically cow much of the world into abolition. But, you know, there's a technological element to this end of slavery too. I mean, the cotton gin sort of gave slavery another leg to stand on, but as machines are taking over, you know, things are going to have to change. And these changes have continued. And we continue to wonder, okay, what, what labor in the future, as we have this new cyborg AI revolution taking place now, you know, will there, will I be displaced by a different kind of talking head? Steam ships became commonplace throughout the 19th century. They got places much more predictably, much more safely than sailing ships did. Railroads became a primary means of transportation in 1804. The first locomotive appeared on the scene. That is Watts first designed for a locomotive. It went five miles an hour. In 1830, there is the first passenger railway. It could go 16 miles an hour and hold quite a few people, as you can see. Now, by the way, to us, 16 miles an hour sounds pretty crappy, right? But imagine that the way you get everywhere is by walking or maybe taking horseback. Well, this was faster than horses over the long haul. It was certainly much faster than walking. By mid-century, trains could go 50 miles an hour. And in Great Britain alone, there were already 6,000 miles of track. So railroads became the common way of transporting goods within a country at any rate by the middle of the 19th century. And of course, that only continued so that by the end of the century, they were common and really expand entire continents. Well, I've already mentioned there was a vast movement to cities. One way of seeing that is that in 1800, London had a million people and there were no other cities in Great Britain over 100,000. There were only six between 50 and 100,000. By 1850, London had almost 2.5 million people. There were nine cities over 100,000. Think about in 50 years, going, if you're in charge of London, going from 1 million people to 2.5 million people in 50 years. That's a lot. It's tremendously disruptive and difficult. And 18 cities who were almost at that level. And so the population was flooding into the cities from the villages, small towns, from the farms, basically. And flooding in not because they're flushed with cash and have mad money to spend on the glitzy urban area, but because they don't have anything to do on the farm anymore. And you're going to have, this is going to go all different ways. Now, what were conditions like in the cities? Not great. People were 12 to 16 hour days. They were subjected to noxious fumes in factories, high temperatures, dangerous conditions. Two of my own great-grandfathers died in industrial accidents. And so it was a very, very dangerous place to be. On the other hand, well, yeah, here's vision of an industrial town. That's the smoke from a steel furnace behind the houses where people were living. And here's an actual photograph of Pittsburgh, my hometown. At the end of the 19th century, those are the steel mills. And these are the steps that went down from the workers' houses on the hills down to the mills. And we didn't have steel mills in Patterson, but we had locomotive mills and then silk mills. And so I look at this picture and it's a little time distant, but the houses and this is the American East. I live just barely on the other side of the hill. The steps are still there, by the way. It's kind of cool. The mills, sadly, are not. When I was a kid, actually, that's what we did for fun. We would like to go down to the mills and it would be very hot in the mills. So they would open the door so you could watch the steel being poured. It was awesome. That was like a night on the town. Anyway, there were good things about this, however. A large number of people began, for the first time in history, or at least since the Roman Empire, to have discretionary income. Manufacturing vastly increased productivity. It lowered the cost of goods, meaning that people could afford things that before that were available only to the wealthy. There was increased trade because transportation became so much more reliable and more commonplace. Now, let's pause here, because he's obviously setting up marks. I really like this presentation, but think about, okay, all the way back to religion. Well, what is religion? Well, these things below are radically disrupting and transforming life up here at the manifest image. Of course, we're not telling a story about religious things. There's a lot going on religiously in America in the 19th century, in the East. You've got going out West. All of these things are going on in all of the different levels. Travel a great deal more. That led to significant increases in income and wealth, but it was very unevenly distributed. In the cities, there was a lot of crowding. Here you see people in London living in other people's backyards. There was sewage and garbage in the street, widespread disease. Cholera, for example, was commonplace. It was pretty unpleasant. There was also tremendous income inequality. In 1801, the top 1% controlled 25% of national income in Britain. By 1848, it was 35%. Today, it's about 19% to give you an idea. So inequality was really, by mid-century, a tremendous problem. That's part of what led to the revolutions of 1848. Where you see the red stars here on the map, those were the locations of revolutions. So in a number of cities throughout Italy, throughout the Austrian Empire, in, well, today would be Germany, and then was not yet unified. In Paris, in Tipperary Ireland, in Denmark, there was unrest all over Europe, partly as a result of these conditions. And that is part of the background that helps us to understand Marx and his thought. In 1848, the year of the revolutions, he publishes the Communist Manifesto. Now, he begins by saying, a specter is haunting Europe, the specter of communism. Actually, he's making this up. None of these revolutions had anything to do with communism. Four years before, he was a journalist nobody had ever heard of, and he was writing things in notebooks about philosophy. And so, the revolutions weren't prompted by communism, but he saw a good advertising campaign when he saw one. And so he said, Smart capital propagandist. Aha! It's really communism that is underlying these revolutions. So he timed it all very, very well. Oh, there he is. If any of you know of New Hampshire's Old Man in the Mountain, looks amazing. The Old Man in the Mountain Foul. That's actually a statue in Europe. That's not the Old Man in the Mountain, but it looks like that. Anyway, what is Marx's key idea? It is a version of a two-level theory. It's not really exactly the Enlightenment version. He gives it a twist. Nevertheless, it starts. His thought starts with a two-level theory. There's a base level, which is materialism. He says, we have to start with material reality, economic conditions, and use the scientific method. They are the real individuals, he says. Their activity and the material conditions under which they live, both those which they find already existing and those produced by their activity, these premises can be verified in a purely empirical way. So he says, I don't want to start with abstractions. My philosophy starts with real people and the way they really live. I'm going to start with the world as it is. It's very religious in that way. Because remember, the philosophy is just sort of up there in the thought. He says, I'm going to talk about the way people really live. Is this religious? Now, all the way back to the Greeks, all the way back to Oedipus, well, there's a plague. Is that religious? Yes, it's religious. It's kind of above. Well, there, the two-level theory, it's below. I'm going to start not with grand ideas, but with the facts and with real conditions on the ground. The surface level, well, that's thought. That is really dependent on what's going on at this other level. So conceiving, thinking, the mental intercourse of men appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behavior. Notice what he's doing. He's saying there's a scientific level that involves our understanding of people's material behavior, what they're actually doing in the world. And then there's- So it's essentially a social science. It's what they're thinking about, the way they conceive of things, the way they think about things, the contents of their thought. All of that is really an effect. It is not cause. It is something produced by these things going on at the material level. And that includes politics, it includes laws, morality, religion, metaphysics, anything like that, that is on the level of ideology, the level of thought is really purely an effect. It doesn't cause anything. It doesn't have any independence. It is purely an effect of the way that people are living their lives in material and ultimately economic terms. So he summarizes all this in a slogan. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life. Here, consciousness is standing for thought, this mental level, the surface level, and life is his shorthand for this material level, what's actually going on in the material world. And you can see that depth psychology will not be far behind. And so it's what's going on in that material world, life, that is controlling consciousness, not the other way around. So that's a way of understanding his version of the two level theory. Life, the material and economic forces are the base level. Consciousness, the realm of ideas in general, is the surface level. All the causes are ultimately material and economic. Everything that really is doing the explaining of anything is happening at this level. All of that is merely an effect, merely a superstructure, something that doesn't have any independent causal power. So there's an image of Mars out of coins. I really wanted to use that in our videos, but it's copyrighted, so I can only use it in class. Anyway, there are a number of aspects of the superstructure. Religion is the most obvious target. He says famously, religion is the opiate of the masses. But it's not just religion. All norms, all abstractions, ethics, anything that involves the realm of thought is like this. And that has real consequences. Here is the destruction of a church shown red square in Moscow in 1929. So it's something that has an effect on what you think about certain institutions in society. All right, well, all of that is really just derivative. And the same thing is true of ethics. Engels writes that people consciously or unconsciously derive their ethical ideas from the practical relations on which their class position is based. That introduces one of the key ideas of the Communist Manifesto. The whole history of the world, Marx and Engels say, is a history of class struggle. So ultimately, what we really have to understand at the base level is the class structure of society. He says all moral theories have really been the product in the last analysis of economic conditions of society obtaining at the time. So, of course, that makes him suspicious. You say something and he says, well, look, you're just arguing that way because of your class position. In a sense, you don't have to take the argument seriously. You just say, I need to look at the practical, the material reasons for your behavior. So that's one important component. A second important component is what he thinks the essence of a human being is. Men can be distinguished from animals, he says, by consciousness, by religion, or anything else you like. And indeed, it's a classic philosophical question, one raised by Aristotle. Aristotle says a good person is one who fulfills his or her function well. Just as a good eye is one that sees well and a good knife cuts well. Well, a good person fulfills whatever is the function of a human being well. But what is the function of a human being? Aristotle says, well, an eye is different from other things in that it sees. A knife is different from other things in that it's sharp and can cut. What makes us different? He says, what's special about people? Now, what is special about human beings? How do we differ from other animals? Oh, we're rational. So that might be part of the answer. We're capable of rationality. Are other animals rational? Well, maybe to some degree, right? I mean, you don't see cats just running their heads into the wall repeatedly. At least not normally. But on the other hand, they aren't capable of mathematics. I've never seen a cat sit down and do a calculus problem. And so, yeah, whatever that rationality is that cats or other animals are capable of, it seems much less than human rationality. Yeah? Where is the surface level, whereas animals are more concerned with the base? Ah, you might say, okay, we're concerned with that surface level. We actually engage in thinking. We have ideologies. Other kinds of animals don't. Walk up to a raccoon and say, so what's your philosophy of life, raccoon? Right? You're not going to get an answer. I think it's not just because you can't understand what he says. Wittgenstein at one point says, if you could talk to a lion, you know, you couldn't understand him. He would just have such a different language. I think this is nonsense, by the way. I think I can perfectly well understand what an animal would have to say. I mean, I know when my cats are saying to me, I'm hungry, or I'm lonely, pet my head, or, you know, I'm mad at you, so I'm going to pee on your computer keyboard. I know what they're saying to me, I think. But anyway, yeah, there's nevertheless a significant difference, you might say, in the ideology that we have and the ideology and the conceptions that an animal seems capable of. Yes? Ah, good. We think to progress. Progress. Keep that in mind. And develop. We actually, and that's actually very close to Aristotle's answer. He says, we act according to rational plans. Rationality is part of it, but part of it is planning and acting on the basis of plans. We actually think in terms of progressions of thoughts. We seek to make things better. We try to develop. And so that makes us different. You don't really, I think most of the time, find animals scheming and plotting and planning and constructing elaborate plans and then carrying them out. But people do that sort of thing. So those are Aristotle's answers, and those are maybe the most common answers throughout the history of philosophy. Well, here's what's special about us. We think. We do things. We plan. We act according to rational plans. That isn't Marx's answer. So what are some other possible answers before I get to that? What are some other possible ways of answering this question? What's special about us? Yeah? We can conceive morality. Good. We can conceive of morality. We have moral codes of conduct. Other animals don't seem to really have that. Yes? We have the curiosity to... There's two sorts of curiosity. The curiosity killed a cat, and curiosity is what helped us improve or like become... Ah, good. Yeah, curiosity killed the cat. So maybe other animals are curious to some degree, but they get in trouble as a result of it. We actually have a curiosity and an ability to... ...strata. I guess things like this you could give that make us different. We walk upright. We reflect. We speak. We abstract. We theorize. We laugh. We cry. We feel. We pray. We worship. There are lots of different things you might pick on as things that are special about us, that distinguish us from animals. And various thinkers have given answers. But here is Marx's answer. We make. We produce things. Okay? Do cats really make things? Trouble, exactly. Do dogs make things? Well, they might burrow out of, you know, a little burrow or something, but they don't really make or produce much of anything. But human beings are capable of that. We can produce our own food, for example. We can make things. We can produce crabs. We can do things that involve producing technologies, let's say, producing products. We can produce art. We can produce music. Those are things that animals don't seem to be able to do. So Marx says they themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence. So the very first thing we're likely to start producing is survival. We have to have the means to produce. I can't make something out of nothing. If I say quick, make an item of clothing, you might think, well, but I don't have anything to work with, right? I don't have any tools. I don't have anything to make it out of. Yes, we need things to produce things. So we're capable of producing, but we need materials. We need things to work on. We need tools. And so the control of those materials and the control of the tools becomes crucial. So he says, what is critical to us then is the control of the means of production. And that leads us to his analysis of the big problem, the class struggle. The whole history of the world has been a class struggle between those who own the means of production, the bourgeoisie, he calls them. And there's the classic image of the bourgeoisie. And then the proletariat, that's his name for the workers, those who lack the means of production themselves and have to work for other people in order to produce things. So here you have the person who owns the means of production, doesn't himself have to labor, but simply relies to produces by the poor part of what he refers to as rural idiocy, growing the food, but otherwise having no effect on anything. Now, if you take a look at, I'm gonna jump ahead a little bit, any bit of property that you can use to produce things, that is really what he's talking about. That is what has to be owned by the state collectively and taken out of private hands. So here is the Marxist program that he outlines. A progressive income tax, the more you earn, the higher the rate you pay. No inheritance, so an absolute 100% estate or death tax. Nationalize all banks, have state ownership of communication, transportation, farms, factories, anything that could be involved in the means of production. He advises the construction of industrial armies so that people can be sent to where they are most needed. And then free systems of education so that people can be trained as they will be needed to run communications, transportation, farms, factories, etc. By the way, you might notice that certain aspects of that are now commonplace, like a progressive income tax. Others, well, not so much. So certain aspects of this remain highly controversial, others perhaps less so. Okay, why did I play all of that class on communism? Now you sit here on YouTube and your podcast and you've easily got the ability to fast forward through it if you already feel you know a lot about communism. I thought it was an excellent presentation on communism. I thought he sort of laid things out nice and clearly. And that's, but his treatment of communism is sort of the normal treatment. Now again, I like the two level theory aspect that he brings into it, the neo-Gnostic aspect that he brings into it. And now I also want to bring in the rest is history, episode 38, their treatment of communism. Because what's interesting is that on one hand, we've got all of this, all of this lower level theory of, well, this is what's really going on. And the consciousness in people, their thoughts, their mere expressions, they're the product of all of these other unseen things that we are unconscious of. But what we didn't deal with, what Bonavac didn't deal with at all in there is, well, where does this vision come from? And because, you know, we talked about, well, we've got this utopia. Well, what is this utopia? And notice that kind of the class pauses. Well, who has developed answers for the questions of utopia? A specter is haunting Europe, a specter of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter. Now remember, Marx writes that in 1848, where there is no communism yet. And so what an amazing job at propaganda of self-promotion, deeply ironic for someone who wants to abolish private property. ...the Communist Manifesto, written in 1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Welcome to The Rest is History with me, Dominic Sandbrook, well-known Marxist, and my sidekick, wishy-washy, Brixton centrist liberal Tom Holland. Hello, comrade. Hello, comrade. So today we're talking about communism, the great political theory that dominated so much conversation in the late 19th and much of the 20th centuries. And actually, looking back, Tom, when we were kids, communism and capitalism were locked in this genuine competition, so it seemed, for the hearts and minds of millions of people. I mean, when you survey the world, the map, I can remember those maps from my kind of childhood, the Soviet Union and all its satellite states, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Hungary, East Germany and so on. You had in Africa, you had places like Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, you had Afghanistan, Mongolia, of course, the People's Republic of China, which is still technically communist, as are Cuba, Vietnam and Laos, but there's been a huge falling off since then. So do you think communism is gone or is it still with us? I think it's such a potent idea, and it won't surprise you to know why I think it's a potent idea. I can't wait for this. Yes. I think it has very, very deep roots, and maybe we'll come to that. And I think that the guiding kind of ideal that it embodies, that all of humanity can be liberated and that all of humanity can share in an equal justice, is one that has an obvious appeal. And I guess that when we talk about communism, we tend to mean the specific form that it has taken in the writings of Marx and then the way that it's evolved with Lenin and with Mao and through the ideological war of the 20th century, as you said. But I do absolutely think that, I mean, China, potentially the greatest power on the face of the planet, remains a communist state. So it's ridiculous to say that communism has gone the way of Nineveh and Tyre, simply purely on the political level. But I think it also continues to have a huge influence on the cultural level. Yeah. So I would say that probably the two most influential communists, because at the moment, would be Antonia Gramsci, Italian, writing in the 30s, who argued that essentially kind of culture is the way for social justice to be established. Okay. Now notice the, and Bonnevac didn't really get into, the idea, of course, with Marx is just that there's this evolution that's going to happen socially and now switch sort of to culture. That's not a big switch, but it's a little bit of a transition. And that's been hugely influential in all kinds of ways that people understand the operation of culture. And I'd say, François Nant, the great Martinique francophone writer who has essentially kind of articulated a Marxist understanding of world politics with an emphasis on how colonized societies and the global South can fight back against what he casts as oppressive imperial domination. And I would say that both of those thinkers have a, you know, colossal influence. I mean, I go so far as to say that actually, in a way, you could say that Marxism is more influential at the moment in the United States than it is in China. That's an amazing, that's an amazing statement. It might very well be true. Discuss. That's an interesting, that's an interesting argument, but they're both offshoots, aren't they, from the sort of the main trunk of communism, which we associate with Marxism. So there had been ideas about a communist society before, so Thomas More in his book, Utopia, at the beginning of the turn of the 16th century, has this vision of a society where people share property in an idealized sort of post feudal world. Now, again, look at the date of that and look at what happens in Protestant cities, where, well, if you look at Jonathan Pujol, one of the points that Pujol keeps making is that, well, in Pujol's sort of neo-medieval vision, you leave the fringes. You have the center and you have the fringe. Protestantism was much more about eliminate the fringe. It's modernity. Let's make the entire city holy. Zurich, Geneva, Plymouth, New Haven, Connecticut. Remember that conversation I had with someone from New Haven, Connecticut that did a little working in the roots and said, wow, they got the plan from the book of Revelation. Well, why? Well, this is the instantiation of God's kingdom on earth. And the diggers in the English Civil War. But I mean, these are communist of a kind. They're kind of proto Marxist ideas, you could argue, can you? Can I? Do you want to bring in your book? Do you want to do your thing? I mean, everybody's waiting for this. I'm not going to mention my book, but I would say that the prototype of a communist society is the early church. I'm giving you a hard time, Tom, for no very good reason, because I actually find you very convincing on this. I genuinely think you're onto something. So go for it. So I think the prototype is the description of the early church in Acts of the Apostles, where it says that the apostles selling their possessions and goods gave to anyone as he had need. But now, okay, what has changed? Because we talked about Oedipus, well, you have, you know, the God and well, in the Acts of the Apostles, you find these Halcyon Days passages in the book of Acts in chapter two and chapter four, that Tom's just about ready to describe. And well, this doesn't just sort of come up from below mindlessly, but this is coming down from above. And there's an obvious echo there of Marx's famous dictum from each according to his ability to reach according to his needs. And essentially that posed a kind of challenge to Christians, which is, is this a kind of realizable ideal? And it's hard to overemphasize, you know, the degree to which in the Roman world, the rich and the powerful assume themselves to be morally superior to those who are poor. And Christianity represents a really- Now, the rich and the powerful assume themselves to be morally superior. To us, that sounds utterly strange, because we have been so conquered by Christianity. Well, where did that Roman idea come from? Well, it was basically in many ways, religion was very karmic. And if you were wealthy and powerful, the gods were shining on you. You obviously had the backing of the gods. God bless you. You can see this in the Bible as well. Look at Job. Look at Job before the fall. Look at Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Look at the patriarchs. The idea of to be blessed by God was to have your fields produce, your wives produce, your, you know, to have influence in the town. It was also to be wealth. It was also to be generous with your wealth and to be hospitable to the stranger. That was sort of the old regime. And so, okay, now all the way back to religion, all the way back to the beginning of this conversation where we have Jesus' crucifixion. Now, again, the crucifixion of Jesus keeps running against the story because people from the old regime would say a god would not allow his son to be crucified. And Islam says that, and Gnostics say that. God would- God can- that cannot happen. Jesus sort of breaks the script. Okay. And that's this transformation in Christianity that Tom Holland sees. And, but it's going to take a long time to work through. And challenge to that assumption. And in the fifth century, you start to get the degree to which in the Roman world, the rich and the powerful assume themselves to be morally superior to those who are poor. And Christianity represents a really profound challenge to that assumption. And in the fifth century, you start to get the notion of a kind of class war that is motivated by Christian doctrine. And there's actually a British thinker called Pelagius who argues that humans can redeem themselves from sin through their own efforts. And- What's so fun here is bringing Pelagius into this conversation on Marx. This manifests itself in a kind of particularly radical Pelagian thought with the idea that the whole of history is an expression basically of the war of the rich on the poor. And that therefore, if you get rid of the rich, then you will have paradise on earth. And this gets opposed by particularly Augustine, the great father of the church, who says that humanity has fallen, we can't possibly realize heaven on earth. And so the best that can be hoped for is that the rich will continue to give to the poor. And I think that in essence, you could say that there you have communism against social democracy set up in the fifth century Roman Empire. It's basically Karl Marx and the Cadbury's family, the sort of philanthropists. Well, and this is, you know, because there's just so much history to pull in here. And Augustine, Augustine, John Verbeke keeps saying, you Americans keep saying Augustine, we keep saying Augustine. All these British pronunciations, all these words that we disagree with in terms of how to pronounce it. But this question about agency and question about direction. Now, of course, there's a sort of progressivism and there's a sort of inevitability. And now this comes through clearly in, again, I'm going to play a little bit of their culture war podcast, which I thought was absolutely incredible. But you can see how all of this stuff is these theological battles are undergoing throughout history. And what happens is they sort of mix and mix and mix and they all come, they all come through. Yes. Yes, and Augustine is a chocolate magnate. Essentially, and Augustine's influence is obviously, he's the huge influence on the church. Pelagius gets branded a heretic. And so over the course of the church, its history, there's an extreme anxiety about any suggestion that Christian teaching, particularly in the Gospels, you know, woe to the rich, the last will be first and the first will be last. These sayings of Christ should be put into social practice. But you do start by the, I mean, essentially the Reformation at its radical fringes is an attempt to put that into practice. Although, of course, you have Calvinists who think if you're rich and successful, that shows that God is smiling on you and that actually being a wealthy sort of merchant or something is a sign. And what's interesting at the Weber thesis is the Weber thesis is what you basically have are these theological traditions that are constantly at tension and sometimes at war. So the Weber thesis is sort of like the more ancient, karmic, you know, your blessing is a sign of God's favor. God is smiling on you. But then you've got the other theme which comes in and you've got the theme of the cruciform path of Christ on the cross. Sign of God's favor, right? Absolutely. But on the very, very radical fringes, so even before the Reformation with the Hussite Rebellion, you have this amazing communist, I think it's the first attempt to realize a communist society in European history at a place called Tabor, which is named after a mountain in the New Testament. And knights and beggars all join up and start digging this huge great city. And they're doing it against the backdrop that God is going to judge the world and that paradise will be established on the earth. I mean, and you can see that that idea of trying to build a kind of a universal equality and that the New Jerusalem will be built on earth, you know, you can see that that's kind of waiting. So we've got all this eschatology, which is just rolling in through this and all of these threads within theology are sort of working through in very subtle ways. But is this a two level theory? Because to what degree do the people know they're working through these theological, these religious things? And so all the way jump back to to Schirmer and Peterson and stories. You have basically these stories that are sort of at play and these the stories and the theologies. Well, what are the theologies? The theology is sort of abstractions from the stories. They're the narratives that are that are at play in all of this. Got about the Anabaptists in Munster, who tried to do the same. You've got the diggers in the the English Revolution and all these figures are influential on Marx. So the diggers are now in what's now what's now a gated community, ironically, isn't it? A way sort of stockbroker. That's right. Stop. Yes. So let's fast forward a bit to the 19th century and the emergence of what people now think of as communism. And now I would argue that that's and a lot of sort of Karkine communists get very offended if you and very cross if you say this. But I would say it's so obviously a kind of political religion that it's barely worth arguing about. I mean, it even later on has icons and banners and sacred texts and and prophets and all the rest of it. But the interesting thing about Marx is that Marx is not from I mean, he is from a converted Christian background, but he's actually Jewish heritage, isn't it? But do you think Marxism is basic? I mean, you obviously do because you think everything is Christian. But you're you're kind of why don't you? We agree that fascism wasn't any remaining skeptical listeners that Marxism is basically religious. Well, I think that you know, the thing the famous phrase that you read out at the top of the show, a specter is haunting Europe, the powers of old Europe invented into Holy Alliance to exercise the specter. I mean, on the most basic level, Marx has he's kind of like a Gothic writer. He's haunted by vampires and werewolves. And the language of Das Kapital is kind of shot through with the idea that there are supernatural entities and parasites and all that sort of stuff. Yeah, yes. But I think on the broader level, Marx takes for granted that the oppression of the poor by the rich and the powerful is wrong. But he doesn't want to say that this is a metaphysical position, because that would immediately kind of lead him wandering into theological dimensions into the into the dimension of kind of the Christian thought. So he claims that it's all entirely scientific. Well, that's the key word, isn't it? The scientific nature of materialist historicist. So he sits in the in the British Library number crunching the facts and lots of graphs, lots of tables, supposedly proving the inevitable fact that, you know, that all of history is a class warfare, and that it is predestined that the wealthy will be overthrown, that there were a classless paradise will be established. And it seems to me that essentially, the whole pretense of Marxism to be scientific is a kind of Oedipal attempt to deny its Christian heritage. It's an Oedipal attempt to deny its Christian heritage. Why is it Oedipal? Americans, we'd say Oedipal. It's an Oedipal attempt to deny its Christian heritage, because what he doesn't understand, which is what Oedipus will learn, is that he married his mother and killed his father, and he didn't know it. The story was operating. But instead of the gods above who are, you know, the fates and everything that's going on. Well, now it's it's another two level theory. It's the gods below. And and you see all of these tensions just working their way out. And now science will sciences this cover, but but there's no there's no art in science. And so there is a powerful providence at work for Marx. But it has to be there has to be, of course, when Stalin goes into the Ukraine and starts, you know, destroying the the the kulaks and and starving the Ukraine, all you have to read is his blood lens by Timothy Snyder. But what is what is, you know, Stalin is in that sense, you know, we look at Stalin cynically, like, oh, well, he's just a tyrant who's doing this for no, he's a true believer. I think Wow, that's a big, and indeed, it's Jewish heritage. Because it fascinatingly, one of Marx's ancestors was Rabbi love, who was a famous rabbi in in 16th century Prague, who, according to legend, fashioned the golem, which was a kind of a kind of monstrous automaton, a kind of proto Frankenstein monster, which is in a way a kind of sensational pre pre figuring of the relationship of the bourgeoisie to the proletariat. So there's all kinds of strange stuff swirling around there. And I think the idea that it's scientific is is one for the bursary. I mean, what do you think? You're a Marxist? I mean, I think it's scientific. I think it's scientific in the sense that no, Dominic Sandberg is not a Marxist. So many theories and ideas developed in the 19th century were thought to be scientific because it was an age obsessed with science. So it's the age of Darwinism. And it's the age of, you know, new technology and the railways and all the rest of it. And so any new theory almost by definition is going to be sort of grounded in scientific language and whatnot. And science in this case, it stands in for I mean, Marxists often talk about being on the right side of history. So this idea of the inevitable progress of history, and it's a scientific law, I mean, science sort of stands in for God, doesn't it? In this, I think in this formula. So Walter Benjamin, the great German 20th century philosopher, he compared Marxism's kind of historical materialism, as they call it, he compared it with another automaton, the Turk, which was this sort of supposed robot. There was actually a bit of a con created before it was sort of created in the 18th and 19th century or something. And he sort of said, you know, what's hiding under the the pretense of all the machinery is actually theology. And is this sort of, you know, that's the that's Marxism's dirty little secret that is basically theology posing as science. And I've always sort of thought that I mean, I can remember when I was at university meeting people who sort of said, you know, the age of 20, with all their their years of experience of the world, they would sort of say, Oh, well, I'm a Marxist. And I'd often say, Well, how do you know? How have you decided how this sort of age where we basically know nothing, and we're still reading lots of stuff? How do you know that this is the blueprint that explains the world? And of course, that was a stupid question, because I thought it was a political position, but it wasn't it was a religious position, sustainment of religious identity, I think rather than a sort of. I mean, that's obviously not always the case. There are people who are more sceptical Marxists, but it's not necessarily always when people say they're a Marxist, it's not often, it's not always a sort of cognitively carefully developed position often it's inherited. So I don't know if you've read David Aronovich's book about growing up in a Marxist. Well, before we before we get to that, it's very interesting, because when I look at younger people in America who are on that political wavelength, on one hand, the the eschatology of Marxism, the the hope of the eschatology sort of remains there and the the meaningful mission to pursue it remains there. But again, you look at the stories, and we've talked about this before, they're dystopian. What do we have to look forward to in the world? It's the it's the breakdown that the future is dim, the future is grim, which is which is very opposite Marxism. And again, it's amazing how all of these subs all of these strains sort of continue to invert. But again, it's this is all happening in the story verse. The story versus is where all of this stuff is going. And where all of its process, it's in many ways, it's it's where we live ideas don't have people stories do. And so even the, you know, even sort of what what should be canonical Marxism doesn't seem to function. Familiar. I mean, Marxists in Britain, in the post war years where Marxism, where communism was a tiny thing, they had their own dentists, they had their own circles of friends, they had their own newspaper, they had their entire own view of the world. It was a closed system, not unlike a religious cult. And in many ways, I think that's what it is. Well, Gramsci was a great admirer of the Catholic Church. And it's interesting that across particularly Latin America, but but also in you know, Catholic countries in in in Europe, really the kind of the battle between Roman Catholicism and communism is often a kind of unit. It's a war between siblings. And they're both closed systems. The once you Oh, and liberation theology. I mean, this this this has been fought within the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America. And in some ways, it's a Latin import into the United States. Once you buy into it, then everything makes sense. Yes. And I think also the other the other obvious parallel with with Christianity is the way in which people get branded heretics, and the way in which dogma and doctrine has to be adapted to fit changing circumstance. So Marx, you know, Marx's philosophy is clearly bred of the very distinctive circumstances of the mid 19th century. So the revolutions that are going on in 1848. And this is why I played all of that video from Daniel Bonavet, because he nicely goes through just a few aspects of the mass of social changes. But okay, but now we're doing this. So what are we doing when we're doing this? Well, now we've got a two level theory, because we're saying, well, you know, people are just kind of living here on the surface, but underneath all these massive changes are going on the dramatic social and technological dislocations and that is producing in them. We're just a wash in this stuff, continental Europe, which ended up leading to his exile to Britain, where he and Engels, who is basically kind of running factories in Manchester and going fox hunting on the weekend and things. I didn't play that part of Bonavac's lecture, but you know, the idea of what a Marxist, now that the means of production is given to the state and all of this wealth is being produced and everyone will just sort of go hunting during the afternoon and doing criticism in the evening. And that was another great part of the Bonavac. I played a lot of that lecture, but I didn't play it all, the link to it's in the notes. So he has a kind of eye view of the way in which the industrial revolution is impacting towns like Manchester, cities like Manchester and, and inflicting appalling suffering. And, you know, Mark says, you know, prophets have to have beards. He has a big beard. And there you go. No further proof. When I was in the Dominican Republic, I had a beard. I've had a beard most of my life. And sometimes people would look because most Dominicans were clean shaven and they look at me and that's, you know, the beard, a Fidel, Fidel needed. But also it's fascinating. I mean, I think also that one of the things that you get from both Marx and Engels, oddly is almost no one writes more with a greater sense of awe about the achievements of the bourgeoisie than Marx. I mean, he, you know, he, the way in which he describes the achievements of bourgeois civilization, its restlessness, its kind of global reach, its potency, it's a stupefying portrayal of the achievements of Victorian Britain. And there is also a kind of weird sense in which if you look at, you know, it's not just Engels with his, his fox hunting, Marx is kind of, you know, I mean, he's going on seaside holidays, isn't he? I think he's- The Isle of Wight. He's a great fan of the Isle of Wight, I think. Yes, that was it. Because Benjamin Boyce says Black Lives Matter with the leader of Black Lives Matter who buys this palace in the Beverly Hills to- He went to Ventner, didn't he, for the last fortnight of his life and last holiday and it rained every day. And it's become very pooterish. It's like a family holiday in the 1950s. Yes, yes. So you've got the specifics of Marx's circumstances and Engels. And then of course, you've got the very different circumstances of revolutionaries like Lenin who come from a very, very different world. That's what I wanted to move to. Because of course, the great irony with Marxism and with communism is that Marx thought, exactly that, all you're saying about him and the achievements of the bourgeoisie, one reason he likes the achievements of the bourgeoisie or is he awed by them is because they have the seeds of their own destruction in them. So he thinks the more capitalism develops, the more sort of magnificent it is, the more quickly it will crumble. It's the grave digger. Again, that Gothic quality. Yeah, the grave digger is a very Gothic expression, isn't it? They're digging their own graves. So he thinks the revolution is going to happen in somewhere like Britain or Germany, the most advanced industrial civilizations. And actually, it happens in Russia, which is the one place that he had thought would be leading the counterrevolution. He'd sort of seen all this counterrevolutionary potential in Russia. So Russia does have two industrial cities, St. Petersburg and Moscow. But otherwise, it's a huge sort of agrarian giant full of peasants. It's exactly the wrong place. And orthodox. In many words, in many ways, it's the wrong place in many ways for for communism to take root. And the key figure here is Lenin, because Lenin is the person who says, well, actually, what you need, you know, it's not just you don't just need the core. Now, now, I'm not just taking a jab at the orthodox or anything like that. My point is Germany and England, you know, two of the most Protestant nations in Europe doesn't happen there. And it might sound like communism is sort of Protestant tish in terms of following the Swiss Reformation. But no, it happens in it happens in the orthodox place, the orthodox place where you have the the center and the fringe and you sort of still have the medieval world, which which will get swept up and, you know, grabbed by the scruff by Stalin and brought into modernity in this way. A course of history, what you need is a revolutionary vanguard, a vanguard party that will take the levers of power stage a coup, grab power and then push this through whether people sort of basically whether people like it or not, because it's acting in the course of history. And then here's your two level theory. Well, we the elites, the neo-Gnostics, we know better. And and we're going to take it and we're going to have it happen. Daniel Bonavac in his in the next lecture on relativism goes into Dostoevsky and Nietzsche and and and in a really nice area talks about how in the Grand Inquisitor in that story, Dostoevsky is really working through those issues of freedom versus happiness. Well, you know, the Grand Inquisitor tells Jesus, well, you gave them all that freedom. People don't want freedom. They want happiness. Of course, this is Dostoevsky's notes in the underground. There's a ton of stuff going on in there. And I think right at the beginning of the I mean, right from the outset, when Marxism is put into practice, you have basically violence and dictatorship and you couldn't have it otherwise. I think also you you have the offer of elitism. So yeah, the genius of Marxist Leninism is that it offers you I mean, basically, so the Marxism will appeal to people who who are very concerned with social justice, who want equality across the world, who want justice. What Lenin does is to fuse that with the sense that you need a controlling elite. And on the theme of communists in London, I did a brilliant radio piece once about this. In other words, you you need a controlling elite. Why? Because the Holy Spirit isn't bringing the goods yet. And so we have to prime the pump. And so and you know, again, but well, it's not coming from above. It's not relational. We're not doing all we can to have God bring it down. It's supposed to well up from below. We've got the Peugeot and you know, the verveky emergence and the Peugeot emanation. So, you know, we're dealing with all of these things here. This room above above what's now a curry shop in Whitechapel, where I think for about kind of four weeks, there's a communist conference going on. You had Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky, Rosalux, and Gorky, Zinoviev, all kind of staying in this one bed. I always thought it would make an amazing sitcom. Yeah, sitcom. Very good. And so I think and I think that they that the brilliant irony of that is that that was where the Bolsheviks, i.e. the majoritarians, the people in the majority were staying. And I think the Mensheviks were, you know, the people in the minority must have been staying in an even smaller room somewhere. Well, I think I mean, it's interesting you mentioned Stalin, because Stalin kind of hangs over every discussion of communism, because, you know, Stalin murdered millions upon millions of people. And the question with someone like Stalin and what I find so fascinating is, is Stalin an aberration, which Marxists will now often claim, oh, Stalin was somehow some imposter. He was a monster who'd somehow got his hands on the experiments and all got out of control. Or, for example, there's the alternative view, which is, I don't know if you read these monstrously big books by Stephen Kotkin, this American scholar who's working his way through Stalin's life. And he says, no, everyone's got Stalin wrong. Stalin wasn't a madman. Stalin wasn't even necessarily a sadist or, you know, any of these things that we imagine. He's not sort of traumatized by his childhood. He's none of those things. Stalin is actually a very good Marxist. He spent all his life immersed in Marxist ideas. He's written tons of incredibly tedious articles about aspects of Marxism in Bolshevik journals. And actually, the reason that he kills all these people is because he thinks that's the way to achieve the paradise, that he's actually a good Marxist. And that's the thing that, you know, when he makes his decisions, that's what always drives him on. And that actually, the violence is inherent and the killing is inherent, because that's the only way you're going to achieve this good society. It's not going to be delivered from above. You're going to have to prime the pump. And so you, the elite, you're going to have to make it happen. And so again, if you read Timothy Snyder, Bloodlands, which is this, it's a rough book about the history between, of the basically the peoples in Poland and Ukraine and Belarus who live between Hitler and Stalin, those poor people. Well, I think that when you look at Stalin or Mao or indeed Hitler, you have to bear in mind that by their lights, what they're doing, they're doing for the best. And that, you know, the idea of killing millions in the cause of bringing about some ideal earthly, it's so monstrous to most of us that it takes such a gear shift that I think it's difficult to do that. But I agree. I think that Stalinism develops logically out of Leninism, which in turn is a logical attempt to adapt Marx's theory to, as you said, the kind of unexpected fact that the revolution's happened in Russia and not in Britain or Germany. And so it's interesting. So now, in a sense, we've got sort of a Protestant vision versus an Orthodox vision. To what degree can the city replace the monastery? And to what degree will the knowledge of the Lord cover the earth like the waters cover the sea? To what degree is this world capable of hosting that level of, of that level of goodness? It's a deeply, deeply religious question. Now I wanted to play, I wanted to play something else before it's already this, this may break the record of, of longest videos. But this, this culture war video was, was absolutely, was culture, I'm not a cultural, what are the arguments was, was absolutely incredible. And I'll only play a part of it, but the whole thing is well worth listening to. The episode on fascism was also, this is, this is right now my favorite podcast. I, I look forward to every episode that comes out and I, I, um, I listen to each episode two or three times. It's, it's, it's not just, they don't just have insights that you can, if you're like me, sort of an insight digger, but the banter, the, it's, it's all here. It's a great podcast. I'm hacking. So never before has our identity been to, you get the gist. These people are being betrayed under the influence of dangerous new foreign ideas. A tiny minority of metropolitan intellectuals are trying to undermine our national history and destroy our traditional culture. Never before has our identity been to, you get the gist. So this is England in the 1530s. It's England in the 1640s, England in the 1700s, the 1900s, the 1960s. And now once again in the 2020s, welcome to the rest is history with battle scarred culture warrior, Tom Holland and me, the far more nuanced and reasonable Dominic Sambrook. Dominic, Dominic, you are so battle scarred in the culture wars. I mean, you write for the daily mail, but the essence of a culture warrior. Okay. You're going to go there straight away. Now I know where we know where we stand. I'm hacking. So we're talking, we're, we are going to get into the history of culture wars. I mean, we're not, maybe we'll fight some culture wars in the second half of the pod, but maybe the start with, I think it's really, this is such a hot topic and I think we should really sort of get into what culture wars are, are they confected, you know, where do they come from historically? And we might as well start, I think, Tom, with a question. So we've got a question from Gilberto Morbac who says, what is the first instance of a culture war? He says, it's not the culture camp, which is Bismarck's war against the Catholic church itself. Now I don't think it is. I think culture wars are as old as history itself. And I think they go back to, you know, what are the Greeks and the Persians, but a culture war, what are the arguments within the Roman Republic? But I've got a, now this, so I've been preaching, I've been casting, obviously for homiletical purposes, the struggle of the, those who are faithful to, this, this, gosh, this gets so theologically complex and interesting, those who are faithful to the vision of God's deliverance of his people in the book of Isaiah, this vision that, um, the book of Daniel, that God is going to rescue his people with, uh, with the Son of Man is going to come and rescue his people. God's going to put down the beasts that have, that have risen up out of the chaotic seas and, um, and the, you know, there'll be a new heavens and a new earth. You can find that in the book of Isaiah and then of course, but the, ever since the destruction of the temple in 586 BC, um, the, the second temple was put back up by the Persians and of course, Cyrus is a servant of the Lord. He's a Messiah of sorts. Well, but then they continue to be in bondage in their land. And then you have this struggle that, that Jesus is born into, in the midst of it. And again, Michael Shermer says, well, they were crucifying everyone. No, they weren't. Um, Jesus is crucified between two Lestai. Luke calls them evil doers, but they are brigands. They are insurgents. They are revolutionaries and Barabbas gets to go free. So what is a culture war? Now, of course, James Davidson Hunter, um, sort of popularized the term in America in, I don't know, I've got the book. I don't know what, what year the book was, was released, but well, they'll get into that here because Holland comes out with a really interesting definition of a culture war. But maybe Tom, you disagree. I do disagree because I think that if you use culture war to mean the war between two different cultures, I mean, every that that's every war, every war is, is bringing different perspectives, different cultural understandings, different cultural assumptions. So you might just as well say war. I think, I think that's not, that's not quite, but the idea of, um, that's not really what I mean. What I mean is the argument about what, who should we be? What are our values? What's our identity? I mean, Greeks did argue about that. Okay. So Sandbrook is saying, well, this is a war over identity. Who should we be? And that's, that's very much, so you see this in the American culture war is the story of America from 1619, the America's original sin is slavery and the entire history of America has been to, um, oppress, abuse, and, um, and take advantage of black bodies. That's what's been dominating. Of course, native Americans say, Whoa, what about us? Um, or is America this story of liberty? So is our culture wars fundamentally questions of identity and national identity? Because again, all the way back to the beginning of this video, it's all these stories that were, that were built within and, and back to Lewis, where, you know, these stories, they have, again, back to Shermer, it has to be physical. It has to be historical. It won't have the same bite. If it's not historical, it can pull us into it. Let's say, so let's say star wars or Harry Potter, which are purely fictitious, but, but it won't, it, we won't have the sense that we can really embody it unless within the story, there's a physicality to it. And of course, that's exactly what Christianity offers things. And Romans argued about them and said, you know, are we becoming too Greek? Are we becoming too Persian? Are we betraying our ancestors? Are we living up to our history? All those arguments, which we have as Britons right now, or Americans, they are as old as history itself. But you see, I think that's like saying that Julius Caesar conquered France. It, it's kind of true, but it's also missing quite a lot. And I think it risks anachronism. So I do think that the culture camp, you know, it begins with, yeah, basically, it does begin with, with Bismarck and the conflict with the, with the Catholic Church as a concept, as a category, and perhaps you can then back project that in a certain way. But I think that essentially the culture war that Bismarck is engaged in is over the limits of religious authority over a secularizing state. Okay, now that's really interesting, the limits of religious authority over secularizing states. Now we're in many ways, we're, it's the crisis of the, of the, of the Reformation. But the, but also getting into this question of how in effect does the eschaton come? Of course, Marx has his own narrative, which seems to be, well, Stalin believes it, but today is roughly abandoned because you have this, that this eschatological dystopia that, that young people are imagining is coming, but, but still you have this, you can derive meaning from pursuing the revolution. Holland's thesis just fascinated me here. So I think it's about the tensions between the secular and the self professingly Christian. Okay, so now go back to Freddie De Boer's piece, because Freddie De Boer as a Marxist is a, you know, sees secular as, you know, godless, open atheist and, and religious as, and then he basically says, well, religion is going away because nobody believes any of this stuff, because if it's all, if it's all chaos and then it's just what we impose. Well, but of course, Holland's definition of secular is, well, that's, that's the secret second sister of the church. Secular is the product of the church. And then go all the way back to Oedipus. Well, what are we talking about? We're talking about which level, so two level theories at the level above or a level below, which level is actually going. And so you could look at someone like Freddie De Boer and, well, he's got, he's also got a very interesting piece a number of years ago, where he basically says, you know, all of the religious conservatives were right, because yes, this is progress and we are actually moving forward with our liberations. And so it was like, oh, well, you're, you're a Marxist believer. What an astonishing surprise. Yeah, but as you will know, of course, the concept of the secular is itself a Christian one. So what I would say, culture war is basically it's sublimated theology. So it is generated out of a specific. A culture war sublimated theology. And see, this is when I first heard Holland talking about these things. It was one of the first times that I had ever had anybody else that I had heard talk about the fact that the American culture war is a Christendom civil war. It really is. These are, these are two elements of Christianity coming to the fore, battling each other. And, and it is, it is not identical to, but it is not dissimilar to the older, the older karmic essence of religion that says the patriarchs are, are, are blessed by God and Jesus that the son of God is crucified, but then of course, resurrected. That's how the story works. Stories of redemption. So you get back to the critical drinker and noting that, well, people aren't, people aren't liking the movies. Well, why aren't they liking the movies? Well, you're, first of all, you're splitting the people and you're sort of creating a strange implicit. So, you know, a generation ago when people would watch, let's say a movie that the baddies were the slave owners and the, you know, the, the, the triumph over the slave owner wasn't just the triumph for the black man to be freed, but the reconciliation of now the black man is, is freed and, and all can be one. Whereas I was watching, you know, I was watching Vikings, which I found far more nuanced than a bunch of you said, well, watch the last kingdom. And I started watching the last kingdom and it doesn't have the same kind of nuance on these issues as the Vikings do. So, the secular is itself a Christian one. So what I would say a culture war is basically it's sublimated theology. So it is generated out of, out of a specifically Christian context, but it's a context in which one side no longer recognizes itself as being Christian. So it's a kind of post-Christian war. So that's, I think, so I think that all the culture wars in America, I think, so I think that all the culture wars in America, they are essentially all revolving around issues of Christian theology. It's just that one side doesn't recognize that. And one side does. But let's go back for Tom. I want to go back further before, before we get back to Bismarck. Some of one side doesn't. So within the church, which is, so you have this broader culture war and you also have this proxy war within the church, even within the evangelical church. So the progressive evangelicals versus this is where Freddie de Boer's thing comes in. There it is. There it is proxied, but what's happening, at least in the Christian-informed church. So I had, you know, Clay on which sort of Clay sort of represents the progressives. I'm going to have some members from the committee on to talk about, you know, the, really the conservatives in the committee with respect to these questions. But what's the way this is, we're having this discussion on CRC voices right now, which is this listserv that I participate in for the CRC. It's what is the hermeneutic? What is the hermeneutic? How, how do we read scripture? Because it's these, it's these, it's these underlying things moving up and illuminating different aspects of the Bible. ...and Christianity and stuff. Are you saying that when in the sort of the later days of the Roman Republic, which you've written about, you know, so successfully, when people are arguing that the, the founding ideals, the sort of puritanical, what they see is the puritanical ideals of the Republic have been lost and they are arguing about, you know, what they see as the luxurious effeminacy and decadence of the modern age. And, you know, people like Cato are arguing against what they see as the sort of the new people who are un-Roman and all that stuff. You don't think there's a culture war element to that? You really don't? I think it's more about political style, because that's the essence of it. But that's what culture wars are about now. I'm not sure it is, because I think that it's, it's about, I think that baked into our understanding of culture war, and unless it's going to become something so kind of broad reaching that it just becomes nebulous and pointless, is the idea of progress. It's the idea of whether you're on the side of progress or not. So it- Now, this gets interesting in terms of Jesus, because all of the, all of the, all of the attention in the second temple period in the first century on, let's call them virtue signaling, but they're not virtue signaling below, you know, the dietary laws, the Sabbath observance, the, all of, you know, they couldn't, they couldn't take the Romans on as such with the military, and so the Pharisees are focusing on all of this religious stuff. And all of this religious stuff is to signal to God, because it's fundamentally relational to God. And John the Baptist comes, and John the Baptist says, well, it's eschatology, the day of the Lord is coming, and the axe is laid to the root of the tree. And you see, you have all of this going on, but this is the direction of religion, and this is what, in fact, you know, this is what Freddie DeBoer writes, well, that's just gone. Well, people are, well, when people lose that aspect of religion, where do they go? They go to this. They go to these other two level theories. We're just, we're, we, we understand that there's a splitness to us, and, and it's going to manifest in one duality or another, and you have to decide how you're going to live. It requires people who feel that they're progressive of culture, or unless it's going to become something so kind of broad reaching that it just becomes nebulous and pointless, is the idea of progress. It's the idea of whether you're on the side of progress or not. So it requires people who feel that they're progressive, and people who feel that progress is actually a form of loss, so a kind of conservatism. There are, of course, you know, there are people who define themselves absolutely as conservatives in, in, in, in Rome, but- Yeah, well, Cato would be a great example. But, but see, but Caesar is not, he's upholding a kind of style. It's a kind of flash. It's a kind of an appeal to the tastes of the people, but it's not going against the very idea of Rome. It's not kind of formulating the idea that there are customs and practices that are superseded that should be jettisoned. I think if you want, so if you want, the closest approximation to a culture war, I think that you get in, in Roman history, is one where, where Christian ideas about what a society should properly be is, are coming up against traditional Roman ideals, because that genuinely is a kind of clash. And I think that the Christians who are opposing certain aspects of Roman culture are doing it in a way that we could perhaps define as progressive. They're kind of saying, okay, things can be improved, things can be better. And the traditions that you are upholding are antiquated and should be jettisoned. So, so- Well, I wanted to ask you about that when Christianity comes in, because now, now it's interesting, because we just talked about Pelagian and Augustine. Augustine, if you read City of God, you know, is basically talking about how Rome, Rome is done. Rome is unworkable. You know, Constantine comes in and, again, back, there's everyone, they're trying to placate all the gods. They're looking for, they're, they're rehearsing, they're casting gods who can be one god to rule them all, and Augustine sees the vision, wins the battle at the Milvian Bridge, and establishes a new kingdom. Now, I want to do a lot more research on this and think a lot more about this, but to what degree does the Byzantine, the Eastern Roman Empire, to what degree do they instantiate the kingdom, and to what degree do they feel the effects of the now and not yet? Because that's the theological tension that is at work in many ways between sort of the karma, God blesses the patriarchs, success is evidence of the blessing of God versus Christ, which, which really takes both things in, and I say this to people, I say Christ both reinforces the hierarchy and has this flat equality, and, and Peugeot says this better than I do, how Christ sort of ties all, he fills up the hierarchy from top to bottom, and he fills out the, the horizontal plane this way too. That's what makes it an archetypal story, because we, we can't figure out how to do both, and so all the times and ways either we project this into story, or we try to live it out in our life, we're always caught between those tensions. There surely you have, you must have a sense, I mean it's very hard to get hold of that now, because our sources are so limited, but you must have a sense of people in there in Rome, in the days of Constantine the Great and his successors, well I suppose more his successors, who are saying, you know, I was always brought up to believe X, Y, and Z, and, and now, you know, and, and now, yeah, everything that I believed has been turned on its head, and isn't it awful that these shrieking strident people, in this case the Christians, are taking our country from us, I mean they wouldn't have said our country, but you know, our world from us, and turning everything on its head. I just believe what, what people believe 20 years ago, and suddenly that I'm told that's all wrong, I don't even know what the right words are, you know, we know the lingo, so aren't they saying exactly that then? So what Christians are bringing in to the, to the party is first of all the idea that there is a kind of universal identity that transcends the local, so Rome, Roman traditions are not that important, they're relative to the good news of, of, of, that Christians bring, which are, which is, which are properly universal, and also the other, the other idea is that certain aspects of Roman culture are not just kind of irrelevant, but literally demonic, and therefore have to be abolished in the name of something that perhaps rather anachronistically we could call progress, because Christians would see the removal of the demonic as improving life for society and everybody within it. So is that things like gladiatorial, yeah, but there's one slavery, that there's one, there's one particular kind of incident, which is, which is famous, which takes place in the late fourth century, there is an altar in the Senate House, called the altar of victory, which serves as a symbol for the Romans of their, the glories of their past. So there's a statue of victory, Nike, which dates back to the wars with Pyrrhus, so before the time of Hannibal even, and the altar itself is, has been put there by Augustus to celebrate his victories over, over Antony and Cleopatra. So it's absolutely, you know, it's, it's Nelson's column, it's, it's everything that the Romans kind of see as embodying their martial glory, statue of Churchill, yes, absolutely, absolutely, and the Christians hate it, because it's, it requires people to, to offer, to burn incense, to offer sacrifice to these gods who the, who Christians see as demonic, so they're constantly agitating to have it removed, and 357, Constantius II does remove it, then he's succeeded by Julian, who is notoriously known by the Christians as the apostate, because he wants to reintroduce paganism, so he, he brings it back in, then it gets removed again in 382, and the emperor who does that, a guy called Gratian, then dies in a coup, and his half-brother, Valentinian II, is then petitioned to bring it back, and the reason that this is, is very well documented is that we have both sides, so we have a guy called Symmachus, who is a senator, a pagan senator, who's writing to the emperor and saying, look, you know, live and let live, Christians can have their churches, why can't we have our altar? Sure, that's fine, and then we have the response from St Ambrose, who's the bishop of Milan, saying we cannot negotiate with this, because this is demonic, it has to be got rid of, we have no compromise at all, and I think there you do see a kind of, a proto-example of the contours that the culture wars in our society will take on, the sense that certain things for those who are identifying themselves with what we might call the progressive cause is non-negotiable, and that the detritus of the past cannot just be tolerated, it has to be removed. So I think that that's... Tom, I think you've brilliantly disproved your argument at the beginning of the program. No, I haven't, I haven't, because I... Because you've just, I mean, that to me is utterly compelling, I mean, that sounds completely recognisable. Ambrose is woke, and the other fellow is unwoke, and never the... So what I would grant is that there are certainly cultural war elements within Christianity's relationship to the pre-existing society, and it's there, for instance, also in the anxieties that Christian philosophers and theologians feel in their attitude towards pagan literature. So in the 10th century, there's an abbot of Cluny who has a dream in which he sees a vase, and it's full of coiling snakes, three coiling snakes, and he wakes, and an angel appears and says, these snakes are Virgil and Horace and Ovid, so you must get rid of them. Meanwhile, simultaneously, in Ravenna, you have people who are saying that actually we should be studying Virgil rather than the gospels, because they're much better. So that, I guess, is a kind of, you know, there are a kind of prefigurings there of trends that we recognise, but I think that basically what is happening there is that it's the tension between a fundamentally Christian society and a society that is not identifying itself as Christian, and I think that... Do the Christians cancel stuff? Do they want to cancel literature, for example? Not really. Some do, but it's a kind of minority, but there's always a slight ambivalence around it, and I think that, you know, there are kind of, I mean, I would argue that the, say, you know, people giving warnings before, trigger warnings before studying Ovid or something in a 21st century American university, that there is a kind of echo there of the ambivalences that Christians felt, say, towards Ovid or Virgil in late antiquity, and I think that essentially it's, but in both cases, it's bred of deeply Christian assumptions about both the universal and the progressive, and I think that those are the keys. What you also get in this period, Tom, well, so late antiquity, early medieval, is a huge amount of hullabaloo about images, and one thing that does strike me as a kind of continuity is that obviously there is a torrent of stuff at the moment about statues and about plaques to people and, you know, who you celebrate in the graven image, and that's there in, you know, that's in there Byzantium and the arguments about iconoclasm, and then there again, I think, don't you see the same kind of thing? People who say, well, I've been brought up to believe X, Y, and Z. I've always believed that these images were an important part of that, that they're central to our culture and our imaginative and religious, our spiritual world, and now these bastards are coming along and whitewashing them and getting rid of them just as they obviously later do in the Reformation, and that seems to me to be, that's a fascinating impulse running through the last 2,000 years, constant battles about images and who you put up and whether it's right to put up an image at all. Again, the images are so interesting because I think if, and I'm of course not an expert on, but all of the stuff that we've been doing, thinking about these things psychologically, I mean, what is an image? It's a, it's a non-living instantiation, and so part of what happens in the iconoclasm of Protestantism is that the churches and the people and the lives of the people in the churches are to be the images. Look at what Bishop Barron says about saints, and I've used this word interchangeably. In the Protestant Reformation, everyone is a saint, simulustus at peccator, Luther, simultaneously sinner and saint. The Roman Catholic tradition, saints are exceptional Christians that in their lives they embody the Christ in the way that other church-going knuckle-draggers can't hope to do. What happens in an image? An image sort of freezes a saint in stone to not decay, and so you have all of these themes that keep, that are sort of vying, and are they, again, we started this video, you know, do people have ideas or ideas have people? Well, ideas get instantuated in, as Tom Holland would say in his Englishism, in stock and stone. What is stock? Stock is wood. It says stock and stone. It's like, what's stock? Stock is wood, and in wood and stone, and no, the Protestant Reformation is, no, you ought not to have an image frozen in wood and stone. You ought to have the image be in the life of the person, and so then the city becomes this place of saints, and they're all saints, and you see all of these tensions working through. I was kind of thinking about this, knowing that we were going to be talking about this, and I just kind of have this, I feel that that's different because those are Christians arguing in Christian terms about what should be done. So the arguments about icons in Byzantium and about images in the 16th century are people who both accept that they're Christians on both sides. So it's arguments about theology where both are recognizing that they are arguing about theology. And it's so interesting, C.S. Lewis thought that the Protestant Reformation was an utter catastrophe, and now if you read some of Lewis's biographies, it's very interesting because he was brought up in a relatively anti-Catholic family, and he never went over to Catholicism. He remained an Anglican, but he develops this idea of mere Christianity, and again, his question about the Protestant Reformation, well, I think that the Protestant Reformation should have been something resolved, well, where? Well, with theologians and in behind closed doors, with in rooms, you can imagine his mere Christianity phrase, in rooms with fires and pints and pipes, that would be where it rolls out, but where does it roll out? It rolls out in the streets, it rolls out in bloodshed. So again, very interesting contrasts. But they don't think the other people are good Christians, though, do they? No, they don't. They really don't think the other people are good Christians. But I think the definition of a culture war is where, both sides are essentially debating theological terms, but only one side doesn't recognize it. That's a very interesting definition. Well, that is, in fact, what a lot of what we see happening now, where secularists like Freddie DeBoer, basically, and skeptics like Michael Shermer, but again, when I look at Peterson and Holland, I think you see more clearly the recess of modernity. And you see, and with Peugeot, you see the beginnings of the medieval process now continuing. What was the medieval process? The medieval process, the medieval process, and Holland just talked about the tension between the pagans and the Christians, but in many ways, a lot of the medieval project, as Lewis highlighted in this, was continuity. And of course, that was Lewis himself, from the pagan, as the good dreams, the dreams that the people of the world the good dreams, the dreams that are appropriated, but also the dreams that prefigure the revelation of Christ. And this is again where Lewis is analogous to say a Petersonian figure in this. Okay, so explain that to me. You think one side is pluralist and the other not pluralist. This is why this is a great conversation. They are, this is dialogos in the Vervecian sense. They are both going to leave this conversation with more than what they came to it with. On the statues issue, there is absolutely, of course, Christian culture introduces a huge ambivalence about statues. And the idea of putting up statues to memorialize great figures is a very culturally specific one. It's one that the Greeks have and particularly the Romans have. So the Romans are always shoving up statues of their great generals and their great men. And essentially, the trend in modern Europe to do that reflects a kind of loosening of specifically Christian understandings about what is acceptable in the public space. So it's in the 17th century, really, and then through into the 18th century, that you start getting people saying, we too have great men. This increasing identification with particularly Rome. So the 18th century is known as the Augustan age. So it's in the 18th century that you start getting people putting up statues of great men, of generals, and kings, but also benefactors, Christian benefactors. I wonder if this is throughout Europe or just in the Protestant sections. I don't know. It's a question. Yeah. So up they go. And that's why most of the statues in our public spaces represent figures from the 18th and the 19th and the early 20th centuries. Yeah, from the age of empire. Because this is a classicizing age. This is an age that is looking back to the Roman age. Now, I think that the anxieties around statues today are bred off kind of deeply Christian ideas. It's just that the people who are campaigning against it, they wouldn't recognize that as being Christian. But essentially the a two level theory, right? It's a two level theory. They're working out things beneath the surface. They're not conscious of it, but they're working out things beneath the surface. And again, in the next Bonivac, where he goes into Dostoevsky and Nietzsche, he'll go into Hegel and talk about this. The sense that we can't have a statue up because it commemorates depravity and evil. So if it's a slave trader or an imperialist or whatever, you know, this is drawing on the assumption that to make a profit from slaves or to conquer vast reaches of territory and kill people while doing so, is not something that is deserving of praise. And these are assumptions that are bred of the great heritage of Christian history. But they've escaped the moorings of specific Christian doctrine. And they now just kind of percolate in the air and people just kind of breathe them in and take them for granted. But that, I think, is for me, that's what I would see the culture wars as being, is that it's arguments about theology that do not recognize themselves as being arguments about theology. Fascinating definition. This is fascinating. Okay. I mean, all this stuff is great. So I'm not going to play the whole thing for a whole variety of reasons. But listen to the whole thing. If you haven't subscribed to this podcast, the rest is history. You really should because it's fun. And I think, again, what am I doing? What am I paying attention to? Why am I bringing in Michael Shermer and Jordan Peterson and Freddie DeBoer and Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook? Because the tides are changing. And are we reaching the end of the period of the Protestant Reformation? Is it resolving? And what is it resolving into? And all of these modernist theories, I don't think we're going to get away from two-level theories because we have always had two-level theories. And Oedipus Rex, it was, well, it was the gods. And it was, no, it's not the gods. It's the germs. Yeah. But, you know, but none of these dynamics are going away. But here's here towards the end, how is a culture war won? And, okay, well, what does what does winning look like? It looks like, well, ideas tend to lose in history, but well, communism lost the Cold War and it's springing up again. Well, why is it springing up again? Well, because of, you know, it's it's still got things to say to the culture, but it's, you know, does it need to be put down? But now this section, you're going to begin to again re-echo some of what we played in the in the communist question. You asked about- Well, I've never I've never I've never concealed my my admiration for- No, you haven't. You haven't, to be fair. You were waxing lyrical about him in our Prime Ministerial World Cup. So you were talking about universities and I think that's a really good point and it brings up Paul Duncan's question. So Paul Duncan asked the question I basically want the answer to because I want to- he says, how a culture war is won? I need to know because I want I will not rest until there's a statue of Field Marshal Lord Roberts in every market town in England. And now those of you who have been following my sermons, you know, that in Jesus loses the culture war. Well, what did I mean by that? Well, the Romans will come down in 70 AD and destroy the temple and they will come back in 135 in the Bar Kokhba Revolt and the Jews will just keep getting put down. And so then Pope Joe says, not actually a pope, this is someone on Twitter that I've read first in my sermons, well, Jesus wasn't really Messiah because he left oppression and he didn't he didn't release the oppressed. And again, theologically you could say, well, the, you know, the prophecy of Isaiah of setting the captives free of what Jesus quotes to John the Baptist when John the Baptist disciples come to Jesus and say, is it you? And these all these deep, deep questions about eschatology. Well, is the resurrection physical? Because, okay, well, let's ask Michael Shermer the question that Daniel Bonavac asks the class and that one that one girl says, well, you want us to answer it? And Bonavac's like, yes, that's why we're here. We're in class. Talk to me. Answer the question. What is a utopia? And and so the communists will say, well, it's the abolition of private property. And well, is that from the Bible? Is that where we're heading? How are the means of production? How does this work? How do how do you win a culture war? Paul Duncan says, if you're trying to win a culture war, are you and it's a key question, are you better off trying to change people's minds or to have your position enforced by the power structures of your time? Or back to Stalin? And before you give your answer, Tom, I was thinking about the Reformation. I mean, the Reformation in England, the English Reformation was by and large, I would say, pretty unpopular. Now, I didn't I didn't play the part where they again, another incredible idea with this that well, basically, these culture wars, we we exported them with the dissenters to America, it's been fomenting in America and America and their Americanization podcast, which I played some of just re re brought it to England. And so now, you know, in the Vietnam War, there's Vietnam War protests in in the UK, and they're not even in the war. And when George Floyd dies in the United States, the Black Lives Matter protests going on in England, and it's the stories. And you've got the pilgrimage of grace, you have a series of risings from prayer book risings and all these kinds of things. And the Reformation, it seems to me, wins because it's backed from the top or at least sort of very, you know, with a bit of ambiguity, but it's got the state behind it. But also because England is very young country, and people forget quickly. And by the time Mary tries to turn back the clock to she's a culture warrior of a very different kind, because she's a kind of reactionary culture warrior, I suppose you'd say, or at least I'd say most a lot of the people who remember Catholic England are dead. And younger people have grown up knowing only Protestant England. So to some extent, it's just a question of outlasting your opponents, and and I guess converting the young, which is why I wanted to ask about universities. So do you think that is the way that you win a culture war through schools and universities? Or is it all kind of control of the state? You know, if Boris Johnson is listening, he wants to win his culture war. Can he win without universities? I suppose is what I'm saying. I think the universities matter more. And that's kind of the Grampskin idea that you affect change through culture. And I would say that the most dramatic illustration of that, I mean, almost in the in the whole of history, actually, is the the evolution of attitudes to homosexuality over certainly my lifetime. Now, before we get there, I've been reading in reformations, the Jesuits, I mean, what do the Jesuits do the Jesuits, basically stem the tide of the Protestant reformation through education. But let's go back to Tom's answer here. You know, it affect change through culture. And I would say that the most dramatic illustration of that, I mean, almost in the in the whole of history, actually, is the the evolution of attitudes to homosexuality over certainly my lifetime. You know, a few years before I was born, it was illegal. Now, essentially, it's illegal not to support it. And, you know, my again, my my children, I think, would find it kind of incomprehensible to imagine, you know, that living in a world where it was regarded as criminal. And that's obviously I think that that's a kind of classic example of where the change of public attitudes, I think that was much more important than kind of individual politicians stepping in and Oh, absolutely. I think isn't it on things like that. And also anti racism. They're driven by sport. They're driven by fashion and culture, far more than anything. And yeah, then. But also, I think but also, I think, accepting the essential justice of a cause that once once once once once something becomes kind of, you know, it gains a critical mass, then it becomes very, very difficult, I think, to oppose it. And that's kind of what happens with the Reformation. It's what happens with the Christianization of the Roman world, that it that something can be quite kind of new and shocking to people in the in the initial onset of this this perspective. But once it beds down, it just becomes the kind of standard. standard. Very, very, very But it also is about you want to, you know, people don't want to be viewed as eccentric, do they, by and large, people, people also successful, talented people, or people who dream of being successful, they don't want to go, they don't want to espouse views that will lead to their cancellation, as it were. So by definition, people as people come up the ladder, they're more likely to go with the new orthodoxy rather than the old. But I think it's more than that. I think it's it's not even Oh, I better believe this or else, you know, I'll get I'll get burnt at the stake or, you know, thrown out my university post or something. I think it's just people just think this is what I should think. Because of course, I should think, you know, of course, the Pope is, is anti Christ. Of course, gay marriage is absolutely to be celebrated. I mean, it's just what you think. So here's a here's a counter example, though. A huge culture war, which we haven't mentioned at all fought in the course of the 20th century is communism's culture war on the old. So they have control of the universities, they have control of schools. I mean, they they they have control in a way that today's culture or as couldn't dream of. But it doesn't work. And that's an interesting that that lots of people, they preserve somehow, the old orthodoxies or the old views, you know, the Pope, the poles, and their Catholicism, for example. So why do you think that cult that particular culture, when they had all the apparatus of victory, didn't work? Because it doesn't work economically, does it? So you think it was driven? It was about the economics rather than we talked about that in the communism one that that that it's it's an attempt to create heaven on earth, that rubs up against the fact that it's not possible. And that essentially, you know, a progress towards dictatorship, perhaps is baked into the attempt to to impose it. Whereas let's end with this, then. Go on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go. So we talked about winning and losing. Does it have to be winning and losing? Or can they be compromised? See, what I see all the time is now this is I'm now putting on my sort of popular newspaper hat. I see all the time sort of high minded people moaning and saying, Oh, they hate the confected culture war. They hate all this. But then in the next paragraph, they then say how determined they are to win it and to crush their opponents and to strip museums of their problematic artifacts or whatever. So it seems to me they patently clearly like the culture or they just want to win it. Can there be a compromise in some of these things? Do you think can societies find a way through or must it end with victory as it did with the Christians, for example, in in Rome or in the in the Reformation must it end with victory for one side or the other? Well, I mean, you've argued that the roots of our contemporary culture was lying in the 18th century in the Whigs against Tories. I mean, essentially, the elements of that argument of that of that argument is still present today. And there's a sense in which the parliamentary system, the party system in Britain evolves to create a dialogue between those two rival points of view. So I would say, yes, absolutely. Because because in a sense, I think that that you can see that there are the inheritors of the Whig and Tory traditions of the 18th century are still going strong today. And that, in a sense, the you know, our parliamentary system exists to ensure that, if not necessarily compromise, then at least kind of, you know, that people can live alongside each other in the same country and have these arguments. I know you disagree. You want to live from Tom. I want a total crushing defeat of the Whigs. Okay, well, culture, I used to like the Whigs, but but but I've now just taken against them completely. Okay, so this particular battle, I think Tom is over, you should retreat to let your wounds. The war, of course, you have war, of course, continues, as indeed does this podcast. So we will be back, Tom, next week with the French Revolution, another very good culture war. But before that, we'll be back. But before that, before that, we're back. Oh, yes. With the podcast episode on a literal war, the Seven Years War. So there's the ads, and those are more podcasts coming up. So definitely subscribe to them and listen to them. But you know, this this is where in some ways, I think we sort of swing all the way back around to Peterson. Because I think the way that that this current movement, so you have in the Renaissance, the turn to the text, and then the the failure of the text to arrive at the consensus that that we needed. But of course, it continues on through the protest, because there's plenty of failure in the institution, too. And so it was philosophy and its rationalism and empiricism and, and a quest for certainty and post modernity comes along with a hermeneutic of suspicion against a two level. Well, science is beneath. Well, now what we have is, well, science, no, science is up here in the manifest image. Now it's it's the suspicion, it's the hermeneutic of suspicion. And these other narratives that all of these stories are battling back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And I am not. So when you get to the end of the question about, well, how are we to, you know, how do you win a culture war? Well, how long can things that are parasitic continue to feed? Is there canon? Do these things eventually is there in a sense, a floor and of course, our friend has, wait, wait, Carl, who is unsubscribed from the channel, this is one of the things you learn as a pastor when someone comes in and is a huge, huge fan and says you do no wrong, be careful, some of them, not all of them, some of them, well, you know, I was too, too open to divine revelation and not, not dismissive of divine revelation and so therefore not necessarily down to natural law. And of course, that's Carl's big, big issue, Carl, in the comment section. But where, see, and this is where I get back to all the way back to the critical drinker and escapism, it's, it's redemptive and the story has to be redemptive in the physical. And so Shermer, well, maybe they wrote it and maybe they didn't mean no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, we all look for redemption at all the levels and, and we wait for the logos to become flesh and the story to become manifest in flesh. It's, it's not an experience, it's not an escape, it's finally the resolution of the story in a stable, permanent, eternal way. That's the, that's the only thing that will satisfy us now. Well, can that happen? Will that happen? And of course, well, once you say no, it won't ever happen, well, then you probably just succumb to your passions. Well, to what degree can it be hosted by this world? And I think, at least in my theological tradition, it requires death and resurrection, not simply symbolically, but in the flesh. So yes, this is my longest ever podcast. I'll put it out as such. I don't know if I'll have to chop it up and, and parcel it out as episodes, but maybe this is just too long for anyone with any good sense to listen to. So if you do in fact, get all the way to the end, please leave a note and say, I made it to the end. Thank you. Or I've, you have tortured me long enough, Vander Clay. I am unsubscribing to this channel. You have betrayed the trust that I, that I placed in you as a listener by making the most un-listenable podcast imaginable where we'll see what happens. The whole channel has been an experiment. So if you got to this, if you got to this level, if you got to this place, I should pay you.
