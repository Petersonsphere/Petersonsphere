 Okay, well, I'll try not to cut you off, but maybe I should to make you comfortable. You cut me off all you want to. I won't be offended. Okay. Well, others might and you know, we've got to keep the audience happy. You cannot live your life fearing what others will think. You have to think about it. You have to be concerned by it. Okay, well, I've thought about that before because sometimes it's a signpost though to be like you're keep your social like how you act socially in check though. Yeah, it's data. It's data. Use it like data, but it's it's all data. It's all tools. Okay, it's what you do with them. Okay, well, I already started. So hello, Paul VanderKlay. Hello, Andrea. How are you? I'm good. I am excited for this. This chat that's going to be I've decided it will be fruitful. I know it will be. I didn't have any question. Okay. So I've asked you here today because I wanted to speak to you about this estuary thing that you've been going going on about and you just put out a video about it and I couldn't decide if I was disappointed or happy to get in for more information about it because I wanted to this is what I wanted to be the estuary how to but you already did you did it's evolving. Okay. It's very much evolving and it is evolving from conversation to conversation like this. So this will be a marker on the way to estuary. So have no fear. Okay, well, okay. I put them all aside then. So okay. Can you give for any of my audience who doesn't know what we're talking about what is estuary? Well, people ask me that and I say well look it up on Wikipedia an estuary is a place usually where fresh water from a continent or an island flows out into the sea and in biological terms estuaries are one of the most diverse productive and interesting biomes that we know of because you have plants and animals that are freshwater and plants and animals that are saltwater and they come together so you can get creatures coming up from the sea you can there are some creatures like salmon who you know they spawn upstream and they go out to the sea and then they return and so I should probably describe for those of you for your listeners who don't necessarily watch my channel that I am a pastor and I've been a pastor for quite a few years now doesn't feel like a lot of years to me but 20 I've been at my church now 23 years and before that I was a foreign missionary and I have always been frustrated by how churches are walled gardens and you know listening to Jonathan Peugeot I probably have a better understanding of the necessity of the walls and I understand that but churches are places that should feed the world and fresh water living water should flow out from churches to bless the world in ways that the world sees obvious value from so I started YouTube I used to just I used to use hangouts on the air to to let people who are missing my sermon see the sermon so if you go to my YouTube channel you'll see some very old YouTube's about guinea pigs with my daughters when they were small a bunch of sermons and then Freddie came along and that was the start of the Freddie and Paul show that was the start of my YouTube career and I had maybe 15 subscribers at that point and then I started making videos about Jordan Peterson right and one of the things that happened fairly early on which I knew what happened was I started getting a lot of comments from Christians who would say things like why are you talking so much about Jordan Peterson you should talk about Jesus and I would say you can go to Livingstone's Christian Forum Church that has my sermons and my Sunday school and guess what it's lots of Jesus hardly any Jordan Peterson over there but in this channel over here I want to talk about Jordan Peterson I want to talk about what I want to talk about and I want to have conversations with people who are not necessarily Christians I have always as a minister who had small groups in Bible studies I could tell that people in church would adjust the answers the answers they would they would doctor their speech in order to say the kinds of things that people want to hear them say in church in fact people in church will will say things that will gain them status in church do you have an example oh do you believe the apostle's creed do you believe Jesus is coming back to this world to redeem it do you believe in the resurrection of the dead people in church will say yes but I know people in church have doubts they have questions what do you think about evolution and creation well people won't give you straight answers partly because they know that church sometimes is not a place that wants to hear people's honest opinions now I don't say that I I would rather hear what people really think than to have them give me an answer that they think I want to hear because the truth is even if if I disagree with them if they're just giving me an answer they think I want to hear we're not honestly going to have a conversation and I as a pastor am probably not going to be able to be effective in terms of what I am supposed to do which is help them believe the truth at least as I see it or my church doctrines or what have you so this has been a perpetual problem in church plus the fact that so churches are supposed to reach out to others who don't believe in God or don't believe as they do and most of those people don't go want to go anywhere near a church because of all the games that churches play and so what happened after I started making Jordan Peterson videos is that I started having really cool conversations where people because they weren't in church would tell me what they really thought okay I found that refreshing and then I started a meetup a Jordan Peterson meetup Sacramento Jordan Peterson meetup where lots of people would come into my building and we would have long rambly conversations and they would tell me exactly what what what can I swear on your channel sure okay they they would tell me pastor I think you're full of shit and I would rather have someone tell me they think I'm full of shit if they think I'm full of shit rather than just smile at me condescendingly and walk out the door yes and just be silently judging you and then like later telling their friends or family like right this guy was full of it are we are we going to have a real conversation are we are we going to actually deal with the questions that we as a culture and society have to wrestle with because if if all I'm doing in the Bible and Christianity and theology and with people isn't real enough that we can have an honest conversation then why am I giving my life to this and so what happened as a result of the Jordan Peterson meetup and my YouTube channel was that I began having conversations with a whole range of different people early on Strahan who is a guy from South Africa really was excited about John Vervecky and so he you know just harangued me until I watched some of John Vervecky's videos and then John Vervecky started his awakening from the meaning crisis videos which the quality was better the old ones you couldn't understand what he would say a lot of the time and so then I started having conversations with John Vervecky and again Christians were very hesitant and I very much understand Christians as John Vervecky like who he is what he's doing with regards to meaning right John Vervecky is a professor at the University of Toronto he's a colleague of Jordan Peterson there's actually a very interesting conversation he had with Jordan Peterson a few years ago John Vervecky grew up Christian in a I've never in a rather fundamentalist group and basically slammed the door as he left the church now he dabbled in it he got very interested in neoplatonism and paul tillich but he got he went very deeply into tai chi Buddhism he's a cognitive scientist and so I see John Vervecky as a seeker after the truth he loves diet he loves Plato he loves Socrates and he is a seeker after the truth and he wants to know what's true now he's a non-theist he's not an atheist he's a non-theist and you know you can watch John's stuff to find out what he means by that but John is an example of a guy that I love talking to because he knows a lot and I learn a lot from him but I get a lot of you know very early on I got a lot of crap from a lot of Christians that said things like you shouldn't talk to them you shouldn't have them on your channel you're promoting his work and and I've dealt with this for a long time because I had a blog and if anybody follows my blog one of the common comments I get from things is I post anything I find interesting or might want to find again and I do it without comment because it's just data and then people are like well you're promoting I'm not promoting squat if you want to hear me promote something ask me what I promote but I want to talk about these ideas and I want to engage with people and I think the church should be doing this and I know the church always has the difficulty that I think see part of my problem with me is that I get talking too long so that's why you should interrupt me when you want to because you'll probably make me better by interrupting me so you have my permission to interrupt me but in in North America so so in Europe you had all these state churches where you know we're a Roman Catholic country where you know the official church of England is the Anglican church and on and on and on and on come to America you have this religious marketplace which I think is healthy for the religious institutions and organizations and movements I think American the kind of the American open marketplace has been very good for that but it has a corrupting influence that churches do a lot of self-promotion to gain followers and to gain money and what that part of the dynamic that that sets up in American churches is we want we want to propagandize people we want to tyrannize people because we are trying to build an army that will you know will dominate our neighbors and do we do wait wait do we want that I think a lot of churches do okay I just needed to clarify like is that a tenant that I don't think you do I don't I that's yeah and I don't like that's the opposite of the first shall be last and the last shall be first and I think it's the opposite of see when I was in college so I grew up uh I'm you know my father was a minister my grandfather was a minister I had a wonderful church upbringing growing up because my father was pastoring this um very interesting inner city church but my father was also very high in openness non-directive or tyrannical at all in terms of a pastor as many would say he would give you so much rope you know he would give you so much rope you could hang yourself which is probably part of my fault as a pastor but so I went to college and you know so I grew up in this weird little Christian Reformed Church which all this mixture of all these different things and then I go to college and there's some evangelicals there but mostly it's Christian Reformed people at Calvin College in those days and and Calvin College was not a very tyrannical place it was not Wheaton where you had to sign a pledge and promise not to see movies or go out with girls that do or anything like that girls okay yeah and and Calvin was very open and they didn't make you go to church they didn't make you go to chapel and so what that allowed me is to well you know if what if I don't want to be a Christian what if what if I think that the Bible is hogwash or propaganda or something like that I should read it for myself and so I started reading the Bible for myself and I found Jesus to be a very interesting person because this evangelicalism that so the Christian Reformed Church is sort of part mainline part evangelical it's kind of a moderate denomination still fairly conservative but anyway and so I didn't find when I read the Gospels I didn't find the Jesus I expected to find okay who did you expect to find well I expected to find the kind of guy at the end of the evangelical chalk talk do you know what a chalk talk is I mean like those little like flannel graph talks yeah yeah flannel graph or chalk talks or you know the the whole Evandale evangelical schtick is like like scream in the dark was a big thing in New Jersey where you had like this this haunted house and so you'd go through this haunted house and then you get out the other end of the haunted house then you sit down and have a come to Jesus um you know story to be a Christian and so Jesus died for your sins well if you read the Gospels well yeah Jesus is dying and but there's there's a lot that you know why in the Gospels do we find Jesus arguing with people about whether or not he can heal people on the Sabbath that's weird and and so you find Jesus with all these these disputes that I didn't you know I would sell I would sell light bulbs for our little Christian boys club at church and I always be a little nervous about that that Jesus would show up at Northside Chapel and overturn my my light bulbs selling you know table okay in the church but so I guess selling light bulbs on on the Sunday was okay but but but the Jesus I met in the Gospels was very different from some of the impressions I had gotten in church so and and then um I didn't decide to go to seminary I probably had some daddy issues where I didn't want to be like my father because I looked like him and you know everyone called me little rev growing up and you know so so I wasn't going to be a minister but then you know okay I'll be a foreign missionary I'll do that because that's different and lo and behold here I am pastoring just like my father did but wait I I'm curious who who was the Jesus you did find then well he was hard to use he's kind of hard to contain he's kind of hard to put in a little nutshell well you know the reason why this is interesting to me because I was just speaking with someone who is an ex-Christian who's very very very Christianity now and he's usually it's not Jesus that people specifically point to for being an ex-Christian it's like a lot of what the church has done and and old testament stuff he's like no I don't like Jesus he's he's mean to the the Canaanite woman very very unkind to her oh yeah the other syrup that's a fun conversation oh yeah but but he does he does heal her daughter yeah that's the results I know man I was like I don't even know where to start there but that is in my head that's why I'm curious to hear the facets that you discovered that you didn't hear before but because it's not as simple kind and quiet nice Jesus right exactly and and shouldn't the church be a place where that person can walk in and say I think Jesus is an asshole look how he talked to this foreign woman I want a church where people can walk in there and lay that on the table and not everyone say oh how dare you sir how dare you flee from here where's my fainting couch okay that's right so okay bring me the and sterling salts and because I believe that that's written into the story the book is written in a way that he should have that response because you know Jesus I mean and it's all over the Gospels you know guy comes to Jesus you know my my child is sick and Jesus oh my a sick child let's off away and fix it it's like well wait a minute there were tons of sick children around and if Jesus is who he said he was well wouldn't he walk through the village and say oh yeah you've got cancer you're gonna last another 10 years oh there's an accident coming to you in the picture I mean I mean so so the thing about the Gospels are is that they force us to ask Jesus was both Jesus had this incredible quality of oh first of all the the image that even the popular public relations that people have of Jesus today just doesn't hold up scrutiny with the Gospels because first of all that the one the one public fact about Jesus was that that that no matter how skeptical you are if you at least acknowledge his existence even if you don't that even if you just say okay it's just a story why would he be so unpopular that bitter enemies in a culture war could who could agree on nothing else about the world could agree that the world was better with him dead yeah he was okay that offensive okay just to clear okay so I'm thinking to clarify there's the zealots there's the the Pharisees there's the Sadducees there's the Essenes I don't know that the Essenes had a representative in the Sanhedrin but there are a number there's like screw you all back yeah they're out in the desert they're out in the desert they're the ones who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls people in the in the Qumran area anyway so so there are these different factions who were very very against one another yet somehow they all eventually came together in agreeing on a plot to have Jesus executed yes and that is to what you speak of Romans and collaboration with their bitter enemies the Romans yes that's right that's the we're gonna get the Romans to kill Jesus and and even in this scene where Pilate who knows that this is a trumped up charge he's got Barabbas who is a real legitimate revolutionary that the Romans want to kill and says I'll be magnanimous once a year should we let Jesus go or Barabbas and in other words when they pick Barabbas to be letting go what they're saying is what we want is a revolution because Barabbas is the the kind of guy we need not Jesus and all right we'll kill Jesus and that's what happens that's what happens and and Jesus is and now again crucifixion is not this is what we do to common criminals no crucifixion was a political form of execution by which the Romans demonstrated their power and cultural supremacy over what they regarded the Jews as this you know they're just this this people over there with these wacky religious ideas so you know the the two and I hate the way thieves on the cross these weren't burglars that Jesus was crucified with these were these were likely Jewish nationalists that wanted to see the Romans out and they likely were killing Romans or trying to undermine the institutions of Roman domination that's who Jesus is crucified with okay and and and even in those scenes you know first they start out mocking and then in one of the gospels one of them turns to the other and says hey why are we picking on this guy I mean you and I we we know the political deal here we were actively trying to undermine the Roman occupation of the Holy Land but this guy in the middle he wasn't one of us and and you know father remember me you know remember me when you come into your kingdom surely you'll be with me in paradise and so but that but Jesus that's the point yeah that's the point that he wasn't like them and that's why he stands out 2000 years later that's right and and all of these I mean Tom Holland makes this terrific observation about the gospels that you know what what these gospel writers had to do was write it account of Jesus that would be fresh and compelling in their day and be fresh and compelling to people in every other culture all over the world since then and the fact that four authors did it in a tiny little short time span and the only thing those four authors really have in common is the person they're writing the story about is is is it just an unbelievable undertaking in the history of human writing and so it's no surprise that they're all about Jesus so it's Jesus himself and his words and his life was so utterly compelling and so utterly transformational that you know that that he continues to compel and transform today and the church is supposed to be the place of witness to that man but the church is so often anything but that that's what I'm okay that's what I'm okay I'm the question was like asked you what it was that you saw that you did who you who was it you did find when you read the battle for yourself the gospels for yourself but the original question is what is estuary and so that's what this is this is a I love the explanation but it's a it's a long explanation as to why why we need something other than what is current so that we can talk about such things even you said even heretical things yes even even a place that entertains heresy yes I got that from a friend who I shouldn't take credit for that because my friend is is very articulate and he has a real gift of putting his finger on certain aspects in culture and and see now and this is part of the reason I'm going to have both living stones online because that the I think part of the problem is that in order to the church's mission is to bear witness to Jesus in order to do that the church does need a place that's a walled garden of sorts and so on my church channel I will teach about Jesus I will talk about the Bible I'll do all of that if I did all of that on my regular YouTube channel a lot of people would say it's a preacher he's talking about Jesus but I don't just want to talk about Jesus I want to talk about Jordan Peterson and John Verbeke and you know even Jonathan Peugeot so Jonathan Peugeot was an orthodox icon carver and I come from an iconoclastic tradition I mean the Dutch in the Dutch you know when they kind of had issues with the Roman Catholic Church I mean they stormed into monasteries and destroyed statues and icons and these kinds of things so but but here I think what we need to do is we need to talk about these things so why am I a Protestant and not a Catholic well can I talk about that I can talk about that and and what is a Protestant and and see and I also think it's true that most Christian people are far more secular than they think and most secular people are far more impacted by the legacy of Christianity than they imagine and these things can be discussed in an estuary and I like the image I've had this image actually for a long time and I probably have said the word a few times in certain interviews because I talk so much but I you know this is what this is what the Jordan Peterson meetups in Sacramento were and this is this is what Jordan Peterson sort of facilitated I mean I don't think we even quite know yet what Jordan Peterson did but what he did was huge and what he did was sort of broke open he kind of broke open Christianity to a lot of anti-theists and a lot of people who had really bitten hard on the the new atheists a moment yeah but but he also kind of showed the church that you know um a a professor of psychology from the University of Toronto can get four million views thinking out loud about the Bible what does I mean that's what I mean when I saw Jordan Peterson I thought I looked in the mirror and said you know what the hell's wrong with you Vanderkley you know here's this because the church says well we've given Paul we've given Paul the education and he subscribed to the proper doctrines and and see I don't I don't I don't want to devalue that or diminish that but here comes Jordan Peterson on the stage and people are like I want to study the Bible no I mean people didn't say that after listening to me what what was this man doing and so it's like I better figure that out because I don't want to I don't want to stand before the throne of God and say yeah Vanderkley yeah yeah yada yada yada you did a lot of that Jordan Peterson he sure turned out a lot of people what did you do you know so well it's not my works of righteousness Paul I know I but yet we are called to give an account for you know what we've done yeah and we all want to hear well done good and faithful servant and you know how many talents did he give me what have I done with my talents and and another thing that has always annoyed me and infuriated me sometimes about the church it's just we just play it too darn safe because as a pastor say these certain things and you have this nice career track as a pastor and you preach the right sermons you satisfy everyone in the church you know so again the same friend that talked about entertaining heresy you know also talks about you get captured by your audience and and preachers are so often captured by their audiences but here's the thing Jesus never was so Jesus is so Jesus is fabulously popular in the Galilee because of his preaching he's one with authority his miracles everyone's excited about him and he looks at the crowd and says you know you're all a bunch of mooks and I'm not your knight because you think you can you think you can you know you think you can bribe me with popularity king no I will not you will you will not make me your king well well aren't isn't Jesus supposed to be king yeah but he's a different kind of king and so there was this there was this imagination of what a messiah should be and there was intense pressure on Jesus to be that and Jesus keeps saying I won't be that and so he doesn't use are you the messiah doesn't answer says I'm the son of man and it's like and Jesus does that all the time because he's reframing and and so they would have known Daniel like they would have known the oh yeah yeah the jesuit have known the Romans would have said what okay but the Jews would have known that that so he's saying something very messianic but so that they're messianic that they right expecting they had a mental script in terms of what a messiah should be and okay you've got a big following now you know let's be John Brown and let's bump off the armory at harper's ferry so we can start a slavery vote those are our scripts right just preaching exodus right now and those are our scripts and and Jesus says um unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you can have no part of me and what does that even mean have no part of me and what does that even mean and what does that even that's lots of people are like oh he jumped the shark i'm off even that what does that even mean like we don't we just do it we just take the sacraments at least the catholics are like oh it's literal we've decided transubstantiation that's what we're deciding it's literally his it turns magically into his flesh and magically into his blood we've decided at least they've decided what it is we we don't even know what it means symbolically i mean i did speak with uh cajou about that and he blew my mind with his answer but anyway but but we we in general we're just floating around doing these little rituals we don't even know what they mean yes well and and it's worse than that and that's what the jordan peterson thing you know really helped give me some time to talk about i mean like i i listen to people all the time they use this word spiritual and it's like what do you mean by that word and as a pastor and i was doing it because i'd be in church and people say well saved i'd say well what do you mean by saved and then they stop because pastors never ask questions like that why because pastors are too busy promoting themselves at their local church in order to grow big in order to be on to grant to be on christianity today or you know what have you and is this why we need us to marry though like is this why we need a space for discussing these things that you're is this why that's needed or is it supposed to be in the church that you're that you're i think it needs to be i think every church should have an estuary okay and what do i mean by that every church rightly within church we have expectations behavioral and propositional belief expectations confessional expectations of people that is totally appropriate within a church within the walled garden okay but outside the church and pezote kind of has this with his little icon this cosmic icon that he did you see water running out of his walls yeah and to me you know far be it for me to start doctoring jonathan peugeot's icons but yeah i would i would i would open that up a little bit and there'd be some reeds and you know seals would so i live in sacramento which just south of us is the delta and that's the major estuary for the state of california this huge wetland and it's all levied up now and you know southern california wants the good water from the american i mean it's it's waters as as mark twain said you know in california um whiskey's for sipping and waters for fighting so water is really important here in arid california but an estuary is a place where you know you'll see well the salmon go upstream you'll see seals come in sometimes from you know from the ocean and they come up here and they hunt fish and you know this is this is where we're going to die of hardened arteries wait it kind of skipped what yeah churches that don't have estuaries are going to die of hardened arteries now an artery of course is that thing in our body yes but in in california in the 1940s because california is always worried about water someone had the idea to dam up the california delta you know because it the other see it goes through the delta then it gets kind of narrow and it goes out to the golden gate bridge and someone had the idea shoot what if we like built a huge dam and we kept all this lovely fresh water and didn't dump it out in the sea because we need all this fresh water and so they built in salcelito california it's a really cool place it's sort of a museum now they built the bay area model and it's this you can walk in it's this huge room it's like a warehouse and and you and they chose the tides and all the rivers coming in and the whole water system of the delta and the bay and it's a really cool thing and they built that because they didn't have computer modeling yet because they wanted to know what if we built a giant dam here and just kept all the fresh water to ourselves that's what churches do okay and what that does is it actually it actually harms the church and it doesn't jesus comes into this world why to have a nice life well if he was going to have a nice life he should not have you know given up the carpentry gig he should have found a wife and settled down and had some kids and you know no jesus comes into this world for the sake of the world and that is why the church is here and so every church needs an estuary the church needs to have its walled garden and to do the stuff inside i get that i work for that i've had a career in that but the church needs to the church needs to share its water of life with the rest of the world and what does that mean it means well so when so we had some you know i so i was helping to start meetups and talking about jordan peterson and so we had a group in chicago and okay they wanted to meet and okay well it's one thing to meet in a house because if you meet in a house you do a meetup in a house it's like i'm gonna go over to somebody's house i want to i want to go to another place and so some meetups were meeting in restaurants which okay you can do a restaurant but you get the waiter and the noise and everything churches are perfect places for meetups to meet and so a number of these guys in the meetup are christians not all of them and they asked me where should we do a meetup i said talk to your church and two of these guys talked to their churches and their churches said no what so then i i knew you know i'm a christian reform minister and so i you know who do i know in chicago i know the pastor of the wheat and crc i've had a few conversations with over the years and so send him an email say hey this is what i've got going and people in the christian form church and know a little bit of what i'm doing somewhat some of them do some of them like it some of them don't and uh could could you let these people use a room and generally speaking in churches during the week churches got rooms and and you know they don't know i don't know but they said yes yeah of course they said yes and so it's it just give them a room we give rooms to a we give them a room um hello we're like harkening back to like there's no room in the inn for you mary and joseph sorry hello and and in all in all fairness to churches you know churches do lots of feeding the hungry food pantry donations churches do a lot of that but when it comes to ideas yes kind of frees up yes okay okay because that is something that i wanted to specifically ask you about because you said that a lot of people are interested in the estuary idea and like i definitely am i would rather like go to that as church for you know this is what i want to hear from you so tell me okay tell me about what you thought of when you heard the idea and tell me how the thought you have about it oh i have a new home because i have okay because contextually because my channel was not meant to have anything to do with my religious faith it was just supposed to be idw sorry sorry intellectual dark web but most of you should be um i wanted to be in the ideas realm in that sort of space but it's as i get closer and closer to like looking into meaning and what is the source of our meaning of course faith has to come in somewhere because that's you know that's where meaning often comes from and for me personally i can't really divorce that from my channel because my channel is andrea with the banks and that's me so so okay with regards to past the past few interviews i've done i started off by going on my friend mars's channel um and his channel is trans bra and he wanted to talk to me about did you see this i shared it and i think you i really i really thought oh maybe maybe i i think we talked about sin and sin and the lgbtq community and one of the questions i had was why doesn't why doesn't the church want the celibate gays you know that was in the next chat i did but mars wrote me and saying that is a good question why doesn't the church want the celibate gays anyway so so i was talking to him about what is it like oh is there a place in the church for those in the lgbtq community um because he's he's a trans guy and so he was he's interested in exploring all ideas in this space and he's interested in he first wanted to talk about what is sin and of course you know i i go in the typical missing the mark because that's what i know it is but i but then i started i watched your i watched your all of your stuff that you've been doing about um same-sex marriage but you kind of have decided to go really far back and look at the sex lives of the patriarchs Abraham Isaac and Jacob that's where you're starting i'm not going to start there because you are and i want to ask you about that but i so i did the prep by watching that and then your other interviews about um the lgbtq community and where christians have gone wrong and i ended up talking about how we just need to love people as they are and that needs to be the starting point um and then he changed the name of the um the episode to be loved as i am and i almost cried no i did cry a little bit so so and he says that got me to thinking okay i want to i want to talk more about this so i ended up talking to someone from the pageo group um because i asked the pageo group about the margins and the lgbtq community who are on the margins and then how how what is it like to move into the center and that got a bit of a stir in that group really i'm so surprised and i little naive me i'm like well they're all about symbolism they'll stick to the symbolism and i was naive and to think that that would be it and it's not that it had to be they didn't have to stick to the symbolism but i got you know some interesting whatever one fellow i thought had some interesting answers so i interviewed him about about the lgbtq community in the church so i did my own interview where i'm like exploring this and he very much did stick to the symbolism and and talking about the margins and what is marriage what does marriage even mean what is the symbol of marriage pointing to those kinds of things so i feel like that's that's a bit of a story about where i'm coming from but then i hear you talk about estuary and that's where i feel like i've been with regards to the lgbtq community questioning about that and the place they have and and then yeah what is marriage and and those sort of questions as to why is it so sacred that we're barring people who desperately want it you know they want it so badly and we're saying and we're like no but we're fine with divorce but you can't have it though anyway it's a whole nother talk paul that's a whole nother talk but the whole point is i feel like i've been sort of searching in a in a in a heretical space and then i hear you talk about estuary and i'm like that's where i want to go because i want to question why we do things i want to like you are literally questioning why do we marry what is it for why is it sacred and that's where you're starting with the patriarchs and what their marriages look like not like ours well unless you look at some of those are coming around i guess it's coming full circle with polyamory here so that's another again a whole nother talk but but i do want to participate in estuary because the the response i received was very you you've got to be careful with what you're doing in in the best possible critique and then the and then the most the worst was like oh look at these liberals coming in with their liberal agenda like that's that was the worst response like that but anyway so but but for the most part actually it was pretty good it was a pretty good this is like oh what about kids like you know that's a valid question i didn't even think to look in there you know so those it wasn't necessarily negative it was just people like questioning which is fine but yeah so that's what i've that's where i'm coming from and then you bring up estuary and then you know the next couple weeks after i've done these little sessions on that so so tell me your thoughts tell me your thoughts and what you think well let me ask you the lgbt question the church is always dealing with insider outsider questions okay this is constant so read in the book of acts okay we've got these gentiles they're not circumcised are they in the church or out of the church so we've got these okay then we've got these as the apostle paul calls judiizers the judiizers are saying these god-fearers as they were called in the book of acts who are unwilling to be circumcised are definitely out of the church paul the apostle paul says these judiizers they should be out of the church you read the book of you read the book of first john it's a very antithetical book you know if you're not in my church you're anti-christ and so the church always any any place with a wall will always have issues of what side of the wall are you on and so and i think peugeot part of his real contribution is he he rightly says okay let's have no walls uh very quickly everybody says that's a bad idea because and and what we've seen culturally is that well okay so we're going to be so let's look at let's say the mainline churches so there are in almost every city there are abundant churches that would fall over themselves welcoming if you're trans if you're gay if you're if you're if you're a a heterosexual non-conformist in one way or another there are churches that will not only welcome you but celebrate you okay all right and so well who is not welcome in that place well all the people who aren't sufficiently celebratory about that particular group of people in other words you you can't help but have certain dynamics go on once you have a boundary all right that's just what boundaries are and how they function with human beings so what you need are you know so someone someone made a comment oh your estuary is like jonathan peugeot's narthex i'm gonna have to do a little bit more research on that but but churches have always had boundary water areas and so and and those boundary water areas are you know are problematic they're always problematic so so we have let's say we have the um let's say we have the polyamorous clergy all right well how's that really going to work oh we're going to have that we're going to have the church of we're going to have the church of free sex which means you know we're gonna have the swinging church well how how how well is that really going to do in terms of a stable group because the thing about there's this wonderful book written about the oneida community in the 19th century the title of the book was oneida free love and a well-set table and it's the story of of noise who is who was kind of a visionary and he believed in science and eugenics and you know developed this entire community and what about and it was you know it was sort of a it was a free love commune in some ways but the person in charge basically decided you could sleep with anyone you wanted but the one rule was you can't get too attached oh great great world style yeah that's right because once you get too attached well we we want this to be just us not them and see those see these dynamics these dynamics are always going to be with us so so you always have to deal with these questions estuary is a space which is intentionally outside the walls okay and once you have that you know they're going to be outside these walls they're also going to be outside those walls but it's a place that we can meet and okay we all i didn't think about that like uh like when they walk when like two opposing armies send in like people to make a truce or to discuss terms yeah okay is that where i'm go is that does that make sense the things that i was like where i'm coming from wanting to discuss the lgbtq community in the church like is that does that have a home in in estuary i guess that's where yes yes yes yeah well that why you know and again in terms of stuff on my channel and stuff on my church channel about the kind of the middle space is my rough draft for sunday where i give a little bit of people on the regular channel a little bit of pico what i'm doing in church but on the regular channel you know i'm i'm pretty much open to talk about just about everything because youtube is a place for everything that's it remember i said early on youtube is a place for people with not a lot to lose and but but here's the thing um what i would imagine estuary will likely estuary will be a home for certain kinds of things but what you'll notice is that estuaries also have boundaries and just like so you've got this army and that army they have a white flag of truce well they're parlay well there are rules about the parlay one of the rules is uh don't kill the other guy right because if you say okay white flag let's parlay and they all want they all go there and then one shoots the other well i guess we're not going to have that space anymore now it's just back to war and and that's why even warring groups understood we need to have channels of communication because we can actually have a win-win if we actually talk so an estuary and as a pastor the reason i am saying every church should have an estuary is because if you don't have um well think about they again think about the water cycle let's look at jonathan peugeot's cosmic cycle so the rain comes down you have a wall what happens if the rain comes down you have a wall and there's no outlet for your fresh water i mean it just pulls up you're gonna have a reservoir okay and a reservoir is a fine thing but every working reservoir you find say in the state of california is going to have a spillway why you got to let the water out you need the place outside the wall if you don't do that then we have what we would call stagnation and that's exactly what we find in the church okay yes because that's the other question i was going to ask why do you have to bring this up why is this not being done anyway it is being done okay and i think it has always been done i think for example the monastery movement was in many ways a function of this most churches throughout history most healthy churches have had this aspect so for example you know the the complaint in the roman empire of a a pagan king was that the churches not only fed their widows but fed the poor fed the pagan poor better and it's like there's an estuary aspect yes and people knock on my door and they have some expectations sometimes they're disappointed they have some expectation that they will be treated humanely and even today for the most part churches have the idea that go down a street see a church if the door if it's not covid if the doors are open and there's music coming out you can walk your butt in and sit down now you don't know how you're going to be treated or what that's going to be like or if you're even going to want to be there but the door is open it's open now that open door means it should flow out too and so like i said churches are thank god very excited often to be sharing money or food with the poor or clothing or or money for organizations thank god that churches are doing that but what about ideas and that's the thing it seems like like almost foreign to me to have the ideas be okay to discuss that seem outside of doctrine or dogma yeah then my question would be why because you're you're discussing them in your head isn't it better if we just take them out and talk about them 100 but it's because that's what i that's what that's what i literally received in different iterations when i'm going into a place that seems what is the word like i guess outside of of doctrine that's dangerous that's we can't just go accepting these sort of oh be we can't just go become part of the world like that's the worry that's the worry i'm seeing but to hear is not to accept i mean and that's that's part of a dynamic that happens that you know someone says something okay they said something they said something that's what happened they said something that's that's shall we freak that out the ideas do have power though oh they do they do okay then you're kind of making the case for why we don't have to hear them they've got power the problem is that they are they are already out there yeah and in this age right now they're gonna be out there and so i would rather have the church take a step forward and and again pay attention to the so here you've got the church and here you've got the estuary okay so there are going to be different there are going to be different codes of conduct in the two different spaces and that's okay okay and we all manage those things too there are things that your children can do outside that you will not let them do in the home right right as part of their training even and and my kids have picked that up you know there are words we use outside that we don't use in the home there are words we use in the home that we don't use outside what's so scared what's so hard to understand about that right i think it's hard when you apply it to not teaching children and teaching a congregation well again i've got there's the walled garden here that's the congregation and so if you go to my church channel which is quite a bit less popular than my personal channel you know we're gonna we're gonna teach and talk about things here now you've got an issue like gaze and you say well how do we work on this okay well how do we work on this let's talk about that let's and and part of my frustration is that we so often forget a whole bunch of things we know when we get scared or anxious or defensive or uptight and so part of what happens in an estuary hopefully will be some of the things that we learned in church we can take out into the estuary some of the things will come in from the sea but these dynamics have always happened and i i think we can do better both in the church and outside the church and talking about these things because here's so let's let's take the the question of your friend who is trans is your friend is a human being what is what is the church rule about your posture towards that human being what is the demand of christ to that to love thy neighbor as thyself love thy neighbor as thyself that's right now all of us know that we have neighbors that don't agree with us about things that don't necessarily live the way we think they should live and all of that if if we were to say to our neighbors i demand that you everything that i say oh that's that's called tyranny um you can demand that all you want it ain't gonna happen parents learn that quickly i demand that my children never deviate from my from my priorities for their lives well good luck with that um it's not gonna happen so okay well let's have a conversation as adults about that so there are norms and rules in that estuary space too and we learn them but here's the thing about in in christ's kingdom you have that law love now what's interesting about this is that people out there outside the walls are saying hey you're supposed to love me fair enough that's they know the rules on the inside yes they do that's a demand okay but then you have the next question what what does love require and you know that as a mother of three children what does love require about the ideas that your boys have well i mean it loving them enough to discipline them at the right time yeah loving them and then when they become adults loving them enough to disagree you still have boundaries and your your 25 year old son might say mom if you loved me you'd buy me a camaro then you say oh really okay isn't that what love requires well love what is yeah so that's what these these are for is yes what is what does love look like what does it look like that we what's what type of love are we talking about as opposed to what those outside the walls are talking about yeah oh this is where peterson gets his that depends on what you mean by love that depends on what you mean by god that depends on what you mean by marriage i want to ask you why why did you decide to start that series on on same-sex marriage i'm not done with it whether i know i'm waiting another thing i've been waiting for more content because i want to facilitate both sides to understand each other a little better and there are there are a host of off the shelf so i have two baseball bats in the room next to me that i gathered from homeless beddings around me and it's it's not that these homeless people are looking that i why do i find only all bats and no balls because they're not playing baseball so i usually confiscate the bats because i don't want my windows broken and i don't want to get clocked if i walk out here at night sometime so i confiscate the bats well what we have in our culture is a whole bunch of conversations and we've got all these clubs that are at hand and so here's the here's the here's the one club you're supposed to love me you christian bang and the others you're supposed to follow the will of god you you degenerate bang okay well after we've done that maybe we've learned that that wasn't necessarily the most productive thing why don't we actually look at this is an extraordinarily complex and in some ways important question and the church has settled its mind about this a very long time ago but a lot of the things in our culture that raise the question about these people's access to the public life so on and so forth also arise out of christianity why is it that this these liberation movements come out of christendom and not some of these other places in the world can you explain what you mean by coming out of christendom well it's well part of the difficulty now is is to find a place in the world that isn't deeply impacted by christendom in 1999 the dalai lama who if any if you ask who's the dalai lama oh he's is the dama lama left or right oh the dalai lama's left it is the dalai lama about doctrine and saying no to people no the dalai lama is about love it you know think about the reputation of the dalai lama and then google what the dalai lama said with respect to same-sex behavior in 1999 and people would be like why would the dalai lama say that i don't know why would the dalai lama say that well what was the that will you be the google for me sure uh he said he said no i don't think that's a good idea okay hmm why wouldn't it be a good idea so very quickly you have to ask some questions well what's what's really going on underneath the surface here and there there are lots and lots and lots of layers to this conversation and most of the time the conversation happens at the level of baseball bats and no balls just hitting each other it's like all right if you want to play that game go ahead but i can promise you it doesn't go anywhere so i start this this little series on my channel because i want to look at some things other than the baseball bats that are at hand and of course one side of one comment on on twitter somebody said something nice about me and the other person said yeah i like his stuff but he's hateful towards gays oh okay i'm hateful towards gays this this is what they know about me all right that's fine and and so you're literally trying to give more nuance ah but here's the thing about nuance there's just about like everything else yes or no about nuance what do you think about what do you think about um oh just name any difficult thing out there what do we think about what was it reading about recently oh abortion there's there's a good one abortion what do you think about nuance with respect to the the abortion debate oh no nuance allowed it's a woman's right to choose no uh life begins at some conception no nuance allowed oh okay well how's that working for us maybe we should have a conversation maybe we should ask some questions what is this fight really about because in my a woman's right to choose oh okay so you're going to self-abuse no what i demand is that the medical establishment assist me with this well that's different from doing it yourself yeah but i can't do it myself safely oh well there's another layer are are if you you know well this is part of my body well if you were to if i were to walk into an emergency room say you know my hand i fall it falls asleep i don't think my hand's terribly pretty would you cut it off for me what do you think the er is going to say i'm going to shuttle me to the psych ward well and why this person wants to cut off their hand and the other thing is too is you know that could be from the other perspective is the lack of support for women who might have their babies except that they feel like they they can't can't do that you know you do you know what i mean like there's the social aspect of um what if the church came around those who were unwed mothers and rather than shaming them loved them well that's that's another aspect church have you never seen a church do that i i've seen different iterations yeah some not good and there are sometimes the church as well sometimes other but but the point is that there are many more questions that go along with these debates than because i hear someone let's say have someone that say you know they're gay and they're like i can't stand it that the church keeps me out and i said well the unitarian universalists have every flag you can imagine on their front lawn they'd love to have you there well i don't want to go to that one oh okay so you're really upset that this church or that in fact some won't let you in but would you really want to go there anyway no i don't really want to go there i just want to i just want to i just want to have the option of going there if i want to and have them treat me the way i would want to be treated well i kind of want that option everywhere i go when i walk into a car dealership i'd like it money no problem take the keys that's what i want no but i think that churches are held to a higher standard money is different for us so i mean this and my point and i can argue this exactly the other way too my point is that well why why do you believe they should let you in well because of jesus right why do you believe that you have been treated in a way that no image bearer of god should ever be treated well that's because of the bible well i think the bible is a hateful book so you're going to get rid of that image bearer of god thing and and people just don't know these things and and so you know the real thing that jordan peterson did in many ways was sort of up the resolution in a whole bunch of areas for a whole bunch of different people and and and whereas they had maybe thought that i think i know everything well maybe you don't know so much maybe i don't know so much and maybe maybe if i would sit down with a trans person i might i might be a little less dogmatic and a little more understanding about what it's like to be them and i don't think that's a bad thing i don't think that's a bad thing so maybe we can start there so that's what the estuary is for yeah yeah well and and more i you know why estuary and and now a lot of people are well i haven't developed this either but a lot of people are thinking that well this is going to be one thing and my idea is no because i want it and you know this because um i actually got the idea so so idea so so there is a guy who was talking in the id idw space um uh dave from rebel wisdom often refers to him that the key thing of the idw is not what's on the different heart the servers the hard drives on the servers oh yeah yeah from ryan benet yes i interviewed yeah idw protocol is what he calls it idw protocol i think estuary is more protocol than what's on on the hard drive of paul vanderkley server because i think we'll have a live we have a living so the jordan peterson meetup was sort of a living stones estuary and that then produced bridges of meaning which is its own estuary and that spawned the or the the my meetup spawned the fresno jordan peterson meetup and that was an estuary and then the chicago one and then we were starting our tour when covid came out we you know visited church of my friend in tucson want them to have an estuary and their church is already very estuary like anyway and so i i will i want to be a promoter of estuaries rather than the estuary itself because here's the thing all of you are smarter than me i say oh no someone's dumber than him i'm sure they are but all of us together are smarter than any one of us and that's part of the genius of estuary is that when we start talking maybe we'll start learning some things each of us and and maybe what maybe some of these wedge issues and and things that we've been doing like this maybe we can start to open our hands and do a little bit of this and we still have thumbs out here the thumbs never quite get in but um you know maybe some of the fingers will touch and that's okay have you gotten any pushback against this idea of estuary a little bit mostly from christians and understandably so yeah because because well i'm not i'm not christians have something to lose but every gift is losing something that's the point of a gift or a sacrifice you lose something and and well who is the church is supposed to bear witness to jesus well what did jee what did it cost jesus um his life okay well hopefully um and and but that imagery runs through this and the apostle paul talks about being poured out and that that in many ways is the christian life and what what the flow of the christian life is that we pour ourselves out first of all because everything we have has been given to us so the water comes from above and we pour it out and the whole point of the resurrection is well if you allow your life to be poured out like jesus was well what did jesus get back read philippians 2 not only his life but the kingdom and so the whole flow of christianity is that we pour out our lives to each other and god gives us the kingdom and that's the christian life so yeah is there is there danger of starting an estuary and some real smart atheist is a better you know better arguer than podunk pastor and suddenly everybody in the group everybody in the group takes off on some crazy idea that some very articulate person has yeah that's a danger but tell me where that danger isn't already so um and and it's also not the case as much as a lot of smart people like to imagine it is that the person with the best argument wins what's really interesting about jesus story is where's the argument i mean what we see is a guy splayed naked on a cross looking to be a political loser is that the argument and the apostle paul says arguments arguments what i point to is christ crucified and that's how we win by losing that's and every mother knows that every mother that does not win by losing basically the kids grow up and think wow mom was really withholding and frigid no what's the good mom the good mom lays down her life for her children what's the good husband the good husband lays down his life for the family this is christianity this is what it's always been this shouldn't be a shocking revelation to the church unfortunately it is for many oh paul you have a way to make things sound so simple but go and do likewise yeah well it's hard it is hard you know i had a yeah you know that's why that's why it sounds simple but in the practice in practice it's that's where we uh have the working out our own salvation that's where we uh have the working out our own salvation with fear and trembling because it's really hard i had a near altercation with daniel yesterday he was having some conflict with a homeless person and yeah yeah yeah doing all the you know and then and but but the thing is with with him and he's out of control and then he he starts you know starts coming up on me and pushing his finger in my chest and i you know i pushed him back and i kind of you know i think he was he kind of why do kids do this all the time you know how far can i push you well you can push me away but there are there are boundaries here and he was a little surprised when i pushed him back like are pastors supposed to push back well sometimes they do and and and that's the thing with jesus because people hear me talk this way and they think well that's just going to make you a doormat do you did you read the gospels and get the idea that jesus was a doormat you're just complaining about what he did to the syrophoenician woman which the story ends up with her getting what she wants but he's going to make a point first because and this is another confusion that we have that oh being a christian means being a doormat which means someone comes along and says i feel like it's my right to do x oh okay that you feel that that's your right well congratulations well you ought to agree if you love me oh well you know that that can't those arguments don't wash with your kids this person isn't your kid no it's another adult but you're still another adult you still have the freedom of your own mind you still don't have to agree well if well if if i don't agree he'll he'll hate me and he'll deride my reputation and jesus says blessed are you when people speak ill of you what do you mean blessed well there you go have a boundary people will speak ill of you i mean okay it's not bad to have boundaries you need them you and that's that's part of peugeot's genius you know you i mean the biggest organ in your body is your skin and as talk to a burn victim if you know even if you get a terrible burn in this path just a part of your body it endangers your whole body your skin is that important and but but look at what skin is it's the semi-permeable boundary it's living it's breathing well that's what our boundaries should be like sometimes we need walls sometimes we need doors sometimes we need estuaries that's we need estuary all right that's where i'm gonna end it because because we could just keep going yes we could thank you so much for this wonderful discussion that i knew would be fruitful and it was good good well thank you for um for what you do and i don't get a chance to watch all your videos but you youtube serves them up and i usually look at the the thumb the thumbnails and sometimes i'll listen to little pieces of them so um and and thank you for thank you for being a part of well part of the reason i very much wanted to talk to you because i noted in bridge of meaning you said well well bridges of meaning is my church and i thought well this is something that is worth talking about because an estuary really isn't a church right i wanted to be a church and it's every church should have an estuary and this is where we could use peugeot language is the church the narthex no but every church should have a narthex i've never heard narthex before yeah well that's because okay i'll have to look at narthex is this narthex is this it's a boundary area of the church too okay and and well we could say every home should have a front porch what's the front porch for the front porch is for meeting neighbors and for sitting and talking okay so so yes the your your friday no your saturday night before sermons those are my sermons during covid and since i've been more involved in bridges of meaning i feel like they're my community more and more i i'm still figuring out how to get more involved but i'm i'm trying just hey everyone i don't know what you're talking about what did i just step into that's what i that's what i do well and and this is and and as with estuaries there are times of high tide when the estuary is full of salt water and there are times of flooding or low tide when the estuary is full of fresh water and so these things will flow and so you know the the keepers of bridges of meaning and and i think they've done very well with this and they're continuing trying well we're getting a little too much christian oh we're getting you know and but part of part of why i wanted living stones online was you need to you christians are sort of used to dominating and so you gotta kind of hold them back and say we've got the church here you know that's probably a good conversation for within the walls this is a this is a conversation this is a space for other conversations it's an opening up of of what the narrow typically would dictate but opening to different ideas and and and asking the questions of why do we do this yes and and in you know an argument your same-sex argument an argument within the walls is well this is what the word of god says about that okay that's perfectly good argument for within the church this is what the word of god says about that you say that in the estuary everyone's like i don't even believe in that i know but i okay oh paul i was trying to wrap up but now i'm like i i think that should be moving into the church asking why sure you can ask why but the language in both places is going to be a little bit different i still i still have more but i think that that'll be another conversation do more of your do more of your um the the sex lives of the patriarchs which will eventually answer this these questions i have about the lgbtq community like if you could do more of those that would be wonderful what i'm about to say sounds will sound horribly liberal and leftist to a lot of people but the important thing for you to decide is less what's your answer about that you need an answer everybody needs an answer the answers are things we need but what's really interesting is that again speaking from a christian perspective here someday you will be quizzed by your maker to say how well did you love these people over here the answers are going to have a part of that but less of a part than you might than a lot of people might suspect and the really some of the really witnessful christians have been ones that have often not necessarily had the answer that everyone always assumed would make towards really loving and that's exactly what we see in jesus oh jesus should be oh a syrophoenician woman oh she's the outsider oh and jesus like you know do dogs eat from the food of the children i know are you calling her a dog i know and that's mean that's mean but the point of jesus is nice is nice but it's not well why was she nice and good or not why i know they're very much not the same but why was he so good and kind sorry both of those things to the samaritan woman at the well did you read that yes i did a picture on it in university he was a little you know what did he call her you know when he says go call your husband what was he setting up did he completely gave on mount garrison you people you know you people worship what you don't know that's hardly it's hardly push over as insulting as from the dogs but maybe maybe that's my modern reading well what this is not modern it's it's jesus has the freedom to manage a conversation as he sees fit he's lord of his language as are we jordan peterson says you know they're not going to put pronouns in my mouth that was an important thing and that's a part of western culture that i think comes from jesus and now you now you now you have the agency in the land of nice there is no agency because and and it doesn't finally work so but this is this is part of this is part of jesus and your please tell me your children haven't haven't pulled the you're mean to me mom argument on well i mean if they have i don't remember 100 the words but it's i do this because i love you that's right don't you though and you do and sometimes you change your mind because sometimes we do it to them because i'm having a bad day and i don't want to get off the couch yeah actually that 100 is very often yeah so i mean this is this is what we deal with but you have to the the real the real problem of pastors is that they're often quivering masses of availability you don't find that in jesus but we say that's what we want as a culture but we don't really mean it because we know that in a real relationship there's there's both there's yes and no and why wouldn't that be the same with god and jesus we want god to be our yes that's a good okay we're for real good around we're for real laying in your grave now for realsies paul you're just i'll shut up no no there it's wonderful i'm just trying to manage my uh my time
