 This is Paul and I haven't been I'm not nearly as productive not on vacation as I am on vacation apparently Because i've just been frustrated this week I've been um, i've been cleaning out my office and you see this bookshelf. I got that My daughter's cleaned out their room And so I have this new bookshelf and so I took down most of my books and they're all in the sanctuary and my sermon isn't done I have counsel tonight and my 98 year old church member Fell and hit his head so I had to run across town visit him in the In the in the home and so i've just been running around and I haven't had time to do a video and it's driving me crazy Because I got these ideas i've got all these videos in my head and I can't get them out and it's making me nuts And then along the way Andy walters Makes a video to the sam howard jordan peterson debates and leaves a little note in my blog And i'm i'm just running around today crazy thinking i don't have time for anything today I don't have time for anything today and I start listening to it. Oh man. I I love this video that he made and he told me called me out kind of in a nice way At the end of it because i'm a christian. He wonders what kind of a pundamentalist christian I am which is a Which is a total total fun thing to discuss And so I you know, and he doesn't have a big file or anything I don't know if this is just a one-off thing that he wants to do. He's got a great beard Look at that beard. That is a nice beard and Andy speaks well and he's a clear thinker and he's been watching his debates But so so I want to do a little commentary on this video because I thought he had a lot of good points The sound seems a little low. So we'll we'll see how this goes. Hey everybody I wanted to add my voice to the jordan peterson Sam harris debate And see if we can untangle a few things Um, i've listened to I think a bit of the first one and the full length of the third one Shame on you for not hearing it Oh, we're gonna take away your card from the from the jordan peterson fan club and i've also heard The most recent ones and i've heard I think the first full podcast between harrison and peterson um And part of what's going on in this conversation that's difficult for me is i'm having trouble even figuring out What exactly are the claims that? They're disagreeing about Um, it feels like to me as somebody who has roots in analytic philosophy that the claims aren't quite as precise as they could be And I think that because there is some imprecision running around in the conversation there is an opportunity to to make that more precise and then Really Highlight the actual differences between peterson and harris and I have to tell you andy I was listening to this in the car And i'm looking all around for this fire truck Sorry, this is sorry goodbye And I got that a little late after i'm looking all around. Where's the fire truck? Where's the fire truck? so What i'm going to do is i'm put together i'm going to put forward four or five different claims that I think are being Circled around but not named And just by naming them i'm hoping that that'll help kind of get get us maybe unstuck in the way we're thinking about this conversation And then I have some thoughts about how we might move the conversation forward in general So the first claim is this idea that there are principles of human flourishing and I think that this really is at the bedrock of the conversation between harrison peterson because It goes uncontested certainly from harrison or certainly from peterson's side And peterson spends a lot of talking a lot of time talking about divine principles Um, sometimes he uses that language or he'll say wisdom things like that Um, and and I don't get the sense that harris Contests this basic idea that there are better and worse ways of being human It's almost self-evidently true um, okay Now right away when he said this I thought no I can't blame people He hasn't even seen all the peterson sam harris. He hasn't even heard all the peterson sam harris debates Why would I expect him to have watched all of my videos? But if you look back at the video I did earlier this week I referenced this this tiny little book by a canadian philosopher. I'm being facetious on the tiny little book Named charles taylor and you might want to pick this up Because the point I was making from from charles taylor's book is that this idea of The sources principles for human flourishing if you go to the chapter on providential deism That's what it's about. Okay Providential deism was this intermediate step from the the period in european history charles taylor says roughly around 1500 where belief in god is axiomatic everybody believes there's a god does that make everyone good? No, does that make everyone a good christian? No, does that even make everyone a christian? No, but but everyone almost everyone believes that there is god and and believing believing in god is axiomatic and what taylor's book? Tries to answer the question and taylor knows a lot which is evident through the book because it keeps telling us how much he Knows is he tries to get a handle on? What exactly was the process? within christendom within western civilization where christian where Where belief in god goes from being axiomatic About the year 1500 to about the year 2000 where it's no longer axiomatic and anyone who continues to believe in god is what Is is has doubts is what? Charles taylor calls cross pressure Now both peterson and harris will say yes, there are principles for living well now When they agree on this and while they do have maybe some disagreements about what those principles are I think the debate between peterson and harris actually goes deeper because harris wants to say Wellbeing is self-evident and peterson says not that self-evident peterson gets at this very strongly in the dilla hunty debates because That's that's exactly where peterson pounces on dilla hunty right from the start that Not only the idea that there are peterson doesn't really debate the idea that there are principles of principles How to live a good life he is he is Right there in terms of in some ways perhaps A late stage providential deism that there are principles But what they're really going to start debating is the source of these principles But peterson is also going to be more skeptical because he's going to tell sam harris that his assumptions about Well-being are overly formed by christianity and sam harris will say genetic fallacy and And peterson is going to say well-being is not as self-evident as you would imagine And this is where we get into the question of happiness versus meaning that people will often exchange meaning for happiness. So So yes Sort of let's let's let andy continue But those that the core set of principles, I think is what actually what the primary object of this debate Has been about is and again, I don't think it's so much if you could start to Create a list of what those core sense of principles would be There would probably be a fair amount of commonality between peterson and sam harris, which is part of the reason they're both in the intellectual dark web and they there's there's a huge amount of Agreement between them which is part of what makes the debate interesting because then the focus turns to What are the source? How can we know the principles by which we can in fact construct a good life? That's the question And harris wants to say reason And peterson says i'm not so sure about that your your read us reason is a secondary thing It stands upon presuppositions As the go-christ says reason is a consistency tool not a discovery tool necessarily You have to have a fixed point upon which reason is built but the fixed point is a isn't Is an is an assumption. It's a Presupposition and so one of the things that peterson Says more gently to sam harris, but probably because of status really bangs on matt dillahunty about is Wellbeing is not as self-evident as you imagine and in fact your assumptions about well-being Have been constructed from the christian framework and fabric and they want to debate that and peterson is not going to concede that point Because peterson looks around and says well, let's let's look at evidence Your assumptions of well-being fits quite well into a lot of the assumptions of other christian people around you and so when matt dillahunty Deconverted from christianity as many people as as andy mentions he Deconverted from christianity many of them will say I just stopped believing in god, you know That's right He's just stopped believing in god and you didn't go out and murder your neighbors or steal your neighbor's house or Or take your neighbor's car or start treating your cheating your neighbors No, in fact you live quite well amongst all these other christians You don't live as well among people from other cultures if we were to plop you in the middle of africa You have a whole lot more Adjustment to do if we plop you in the middle of iran you'd have a whole lot more adjustment to do in other words There's a huge degree of commonality built into your definition of well-being that you simply are not taking stock of and peterson is saying that those assumptions have a history and I was just listening again to Dallas willards on the best of the there's a podcast called the best of the veritas forum And then just some of the recent uploads they they republished an older Talk by dallas wilder willard on nicha and and I think willard really Gets right down to it in terms of how nicha Formed the modern world or at least how nicha was right in calling the shape of the modern world so early So back to andy is the nature of those principles in particular See see now not really the nature and a little bit later. I think he's going to nail it right so The the content of those principles the provenance of not so much the content again the the I think they find that they Sam harrison and jordan peterson have a lot of agreement on the content of those principles But the provenance of those principles. Yes, that's what they're debating Those principles, um the promulgation of those principles Yes, the promulgation of those principles because sam harris wants to say well we can promote these principles via reason And we best take all of this superstitious stuff and put this away And peterson is saying if you go to the oakum is it oakum where he talks with? uh rubin is there and then And then two other guys and peterson. I've mentioned that video before So Peterson basically is saying The way we articulate these principles that is most natural to us and most Most like let's say machine code. All right, because by the time you go to school and get educated and going to high school and college you've got a you've got a capacity to to to work with abstract ideas The and principles when you get to the line when you get the principles so you you look at a story you analyze the story and you take the You take the the moral of the story and what you do is you abstract out a moral you take something Which is contextualized within a story you abstract out a moral and then the idea is that you can plunk that down then into other Context and that will be useful now Deep within this project of what peterson and sam harris are doing Is the assumption that if we can abstract principles out of it out of particular contexts Then we can apply those to other things and Now what you have to understand deep in our heart is the motivation because the motivation here is to secure for ourselves Well-being to secure for ourselves the good life And this is the goal we would like to secure this for ourselves And this is where in a sense you get into a fundamental conflict with a with a At least my tradition of christianity which says this is something that human beings are not able to do and this is this thomas this piece on toml soel that I referred to about the I forget the language but it was it was such a good piece and this is what happens when I don't do a powerpoint Before I do the video is that stuff comes up and I don't think I don't think it through but Can we? Are we in fact capable of constructing for ourselves the life we've always wanted and peterson is a skeptic on this And this is what peterson means when he says to sam harris, you're not taking the heavy hitters into account You're not taking nicha and and dostoevsky Into an account now someone just recently i've been talking about a russian movie now I can't remember. Oh the stalker the russian movie the stalker That movie goes deeply into it because the question is well Well-being well, how do you define well-being? Well, I define well-being according to what I want Okay, but what do you really want and? The naive person thinks they know what they want A worldly person keeps getting what they want and realize they want something else They want something more donald trump on his inauguration dance danced with his third wife young beautiful won the presidential election has all the money in the world and The the song that he danced to was frank sinatra my way. I did it my way And this is donald trump well-being now. This is part of the problem with well-being Whose well-being whose well-being at whose expense and now Sam harris would quite nicely and quite frankly in a christiany sort of way say well It should be well-being for everyone. That's how we will maximize well-being Really does that happen in the world does that happen in a marriage even when you've just got two people That that promise to love each other that have chosen each other in our context and they say They say what well i'm in this marriage for my well-being and the other person says i'm in this marriage for my well-being And the minute one of them says this isn't working out for me boom you don't have a marriage anymore People do that a couple times they say well that doesn't really work so it works a little bit better San harris basically says this it's it comes down to love well love is a really tricky thing because love means being committed to the well-being of another and Well, there are wonderful times two people are young and healthy and they have a fair amount of alignments in their life And they think yeah well-being we're both looking for the same thing. Well good for you We'll be married. Why don't you be married a number of years? so why don't one of you gets Alzheimer's or the other one has an affair or or or your dream job comes up in another city and And your other person has their dream job in a different city and now you're you're going to try Commuting via airplane and any life is full of these kinds of things Well-being is by no you have to be naive to imagine that well-being is something that's self-evident and again dostievsky dostievsky goes into this and if you read dostievsky he goes down and down or read tolstoy read tolstoy's confession tolstoy He was he had everything he could ever want but he could barely go into the barn alone because he was afraid He was going to off himself because What does it all matter? Well, you know once you get to the top of that once you get to the The top of the ladder the top of the hierarchy you say is there a there there so it's not so much the elements The principles for living if in fact, this is a point that I digress and this is what happens when I don't do powerpoint Peterson wants to say Well-being is best articulated in stories not in principles Well, what do you mean by that? Well a story and give us back to this oakum talk that he did with rubin and the two other guys the Objective is was that it? Peterson says there's something about us that we understand well-being via Story far better than we understand it via a list of principles and this when you look at those two methods You're really differentiating kind of a 19th century positivism that said we can distill and create a list of well-being and What's interesting is that harris kind of says yeah, we can create a list of well-being and I would say go ahead and try it Just just try and get to the depths of it And this is the point that i've made in a number of other my videos if I sit in the room and I try To describe this room. There is not a true infinite, but there is a near It's true, I don't know there's a near infinite number of things that I can describe and Because life is so rich and so large and so complex story seems to be kind of the machine code that we have And and principles is kind of a higher It's a different programming language that that doesn't really connect up There's no drivers and it doesn't really connect up to the hardware and at the end of andy's video when he talks about peterson and religion and music because I'm probably gonna oh gosh what time is it? i'm probably gonna run out of time because I could probably talk for two hours just about this little video because There's so much good stuff in it and so much cool stuff and so much stuff. It made me want to talk about At the end of the video andy talks about music and how music is Peterson is kind of like music and religion. I think that's a great point I think he's I think he's really correct there, but let me continue because there's more good stuff There's so much good stuff in this video. I really enjoyed it and so on Um, and so those are some of the particular claims that I want to cover next so first The content of these principles. So let me just pause here actually put a little Kind of concrete around what I mean by these principles. So um, just to pull an example off the top of my head um See and this is this is part of the problem with even trying to use principles In order to pursue this objective for example via stories and via things The bible is full of this stuff when the I was preaching to the book of second kings and when the Commander of the army of the syrians comes to jerusalem to try to demoralize the people and has a kaias Figuring his good is cooked his goose is cooked The commander of the syrian army says, you know open the gates and surrender and all of you Will be taken to a land that is rich with you know, rich with fruit trees and you'll have your own houses And it would be well watered. These are all Short term ways of communicating well-being and he lived happily ever after The we we've developed all of this and This is so much Better than saying a principle there needs to be sufficient water There's no music to that but that doesn't work with people. Yeah, of course there needs to be sufficient water We want there to be enough water, but not too much um, the bible talks about you know the You know the the wise man the beginning of the book of psalms the wise man Is like a tree planted by a river that bears its fruit in season and out season And the and the godless you know those who don't follow the lord and listen to his wisdom and obey his commands They are like the chap that gets blown by the wind About music This is what humanity has been doing and a bit a little bit later in this video, too We'll talk about what I think he's again right on that that peterson is using kind of a darwinian a darwinian evaluation of stories and saying that these stories that last a long time are the ones that actually They work and they work because they've been formed through history and They just work. It's like the wheel Peterson is fond of talking about abraham the story of abraham and isaac and the sacrifice That abraham was called to me and and again a principle here would be don't kill your son Yeah, yeah tell the story of abraham and isaac and It's so much more is into that story And although I may not be getting all of the complexities correct here um the the the upshot for peterson seems to be something like um the moral of this narrative is Sacrifice now to get what matters later Okay, that's a perfect example of this. Well, you take a story you turn a wine into water Okay, and now you have a principle. Well, why what's the value of this principle? Well now you have this principle that you can apply to different situations. Here's the difficulty with principles principles You have decontextualized it when you pulled it out of the story How do you know if you know enough that it'll fit into another story, let's say your Let's say you're a black youth living in a crime-ridden part of town And okay. Well save your money. Well, that doesn't make that or Let's use somalia. Let's say you're living in a country where warlords Lords are reigning and there's so much chaos. Well Sacrifice now for the future peterson is down on right that Mostly goes and in fact if you listen to my videos about Peterson and his Easter video In five parts this issue about sacrifice is actually very foundational for peterson in terms of his understanding About god and my god number one god number two visit video god number one This this god of the background this god of the governing background And and because we saw that those who save flourish those who share flourish This gets built in but then this then gets articulated in stories and this again is deeply part of peterson's Program where he says it's through these stories that actually these these principles get embodied and communicated with far greater effectiveness than save You know sacrifice for today and tomorrow will be better. Well, maybe it will maybe it won't maybe get hit by a car so That's again an illustration between stories and principles something along those lines now That I would say that second part that I just said sacrifice now to get what matters later let's call that a fundamental principle of human flourishing and then we have that principle is then Enclosed if that's a word See and this is the part problem with principles because what you do with a principle is you Decontextualize it and you try and turn it into an elevated tool and that's And this tool nature is deep within the contradiction between peterson and harris Peterson is far more suspect of tools and harris is I think far more naive about Rationality as a tool and what it can accomplish peterson is far more hesitant and I think again this comes out of his This comes out of his work as a as a clinical psychologist because you go into a room and you sit down with someone and Someone tells you their problem and you diagnose them in your mind and say, okay These are their problems And so what i've learned in my education is these are these problems and these are tools I can use to apply it to these Problems and so what you do as a psychologist or a pastor or a parent is you Oh, I read this article about how to fix my child because they're wedding to bed Okay, so you take this tool and you try to apply it And what do you learn? Well, sometimes it works and you say, oh great. Sometimes there are unintended consequences and you think oh I don't know if that tool was the right thing more often you do something and it sort of makes some improvement but what you then begin to realize is that this human being you're dealing with is enormously complex and Look at antibiotics. Well infections are a problem. We develop antibiotics antibiotics kills infections. Great. Wow time 70 years into it. Well, what do we discover? Well, the germs are fighting back so we develop new antibiotics Oh, and we're using antibiotics to feed to farm animals And well, what are the unintended consequences of that and we're over prescribing antibiotics for certain kinds of things And what are the unintended consequences of that? Peterson keeps saying basically the world is far more complex. And so the best orientation we have For trying to understand the world is looking in the past and you might say okay, but Scientifically, how far can we look back? Not very far. Not very far at all You know depending on which field maybe only 50 years or 100 years or 150 years or maybe three or 400 years when it comes to Certain elements of chemistry or or physics it you know, then you're dealing with Newtonian beyond that You don't have anything so Peter says that's how can we appropriate the wisdom? How can we appropriate the evidence that we have gained over the last 100 million years or 3.5 billion years when we've been watching each other and how has that been encoded that has been encoded in the bible And that's been encoded in other stories now We're going to get to that because and he makes a good point on that later on and again I'm going to introduce i'm going to keep interrupting this video and i'm not going to get through the whole thing So go ahead to Andy's page and listen to this video because I thought it was worth listening to clothed in In this particular narrative of Abraham and Isaac So that's what I mean by those those principles So then now let's turn to different questions. So those principles exist and then now if we ask ourselves What is the content of those principles? I think that Peterson is It has spent really much of his life trying to trying to assemble a list of these principles Yes Now that that may be Peterson because he's a clinical psychologist has been working from this paradigm for a long time and he sees its limitations a slight disservice to to Peterson because I think there are It's not just an objective list of like 18 000 Principles that are all on a surface level and not connected at a deeper level, right? But I do think Nevertheless It seems to me that this seems to be peterson's main program is What are the principles of living? Yes, 12 rules for life that enable human flourishing and in this of course But again, don't forget Peterson has more skepticism that this business about enabling human fear of flourishing discovering human flourishing living out a flourished life Is attainable because he reads dostoevsky this fact makes total sense when you consider that peterson is a Clinical psychologist he he's spent many many years. I assume Helping people to get unstuck in their lives and certainly what he's doing Is helping people get unstuck in their lives now on a much broader scale And I would include myself in that category so So that seems to be the kind of thing that that that peterson is up to So harris on the other hand is He has spent a lot of his Life his career. I should say anyway You know, he was made famous for debunking Not debunking but but really attacking fundamentalism And and I I think if I was to in broad strokes kind of paint their natural Conversational style I would paint peterson as like a reclaimer and I would paint Harris as like a debunker and I think that's a really helpful Characterization I think pete that's that I think those two labels really get them well that peterson is a reclaimer. That's That's now he's a liberal he's Not a right winger and again andrew sweaney and rebel wisdom. I think are engaging in some of this conversation. Well But he's a reclaimer and Harris is a debunker and and bingo and harris, you know debunks a lot of the A lot of the fundamentalist myths I I get even confused saying debunks the myth because now i'm so far from fundamentalism that They don't even seem like they need to be debunked anymore. And we are all contextualized when we watch these things but that but uh certainly there was a time in my life where They did need to be debunked and that's what he primarily is and he you know, he identifies with that skeptic crowd The james randys of the world, although he has important differences with them. I don't want to Paint him into a corner there. But but I I do think that's Broadly speaking a kind of a fair assumption. So when we're looking at this conversation then It's no surprise that that peterson Is interested in motivating people and reclaiming this religious tradition uh, specifically christianity Whereas harris is more interested in uh debunking Any problems associated with doing that? And so that's kind of painting the picture or setting the basis here so When we ask ourselves, what's the content of these principles? Um peterson is going to say yeah, there's this list of principles I came up with and they act there's actually a strong overlap between That list and christianity itself Right and that's exactly what i'll say to harris and Harris is going to want to say Or or does say um, well there there may be this this this Objective set of principles at the core, but at the same time those principles have been Clothed in the language of Eastern mythology in fact harris would say and and I think he's he's dead on right This is what harris wants to say and this I think exposes Harris has an issue with christianity Okay, everybody has issues you have issues with christianity. That's all right. I understand that but this is peterson wants to say you've got issues with this and And this is why the debate is not so much the content of these Principles, but the source of these principles and that gets exposed when harris says well I can get these principles from the east It's been clothed better in eastern in some eastern traditions in their mythology than in christianity And so One of the claims that I want to put forward here is this notion of what i'm calling mythological fungibility and the idea here is that One could or the claim somebody who subscribes to mythological fungibility would uh by the the notion that That objective set of principles Could be expressed Equally as well in any tradition and I don't think peterson because they have that this part of the debate and and andy didn't solve the debate but Sam harris made this point to peterson peterson as well You know I look at I take stuff from dallas and I talked about some other I did I talked about some other cultures and and some other mythologies, but I know the western mythology is better So that's really what I work from But I don't I don't know that peterson would deny That you can derive wisdom from mythologies from the east and other cultures in fact even even even a christian like peter kreef who is a conservative catholic and And a dutch a dutch friend Told me that kreef means lobster in dutch, which was really cool, but even peter kreef won't deny that you can learn wisdom from from the east Assuming that the necessary You know Human artistic tendencies were applied to that tradition and so here we might think of you know, not only the eastern traditions, but also You know the story of pinocchio which of course doesn't originate in any religious tradition at all or the story of Right, so peterson uses pinocchio He uses the lion king and this is part of peterson saying that there are there are archetypal truths that You they they can be you can find them in the bible. You can find them in disney You can find them in mythologies all over the world. I don't think peterson would contest this point at all Beauty and the beast or grim brothers fairy tales And what's curious is that I think jordan peterson actually subscribes to mythological fungibility But harris is using mythological fungibility as a way of Casting doubt on the notion that there's something really Um embedded in the christian tradition that can't be found elsewhere and so Now what's interesting is that if you look at if you go to maybe i'll pause and go there This is from csl is the grand miracle one of my favorite pieces Like csl you can tell the sound level difference I'm not going to fix it. I never read it one is very often asked at present Whether we could not have a christianity stripped or as people who ask it say freed from its miraculous elements A christianity with the miraculous elements suppressed And now it seems to me that precisely the one religion in the world Or at least the only one I know with which you could not do that is christianity In a religion like buddhism if you took away the miracles attributed to gotama buddha in some very late sources There would be no loss In fact the religion would get on very much better without them because in that case the miracles largely contradict the teaching The teaching or even in the case of a religion like mohammedanism Nothing essential would be altered if you took away the miracles You could have a great prophet preaching his dogmas without bringing in any miracles They are only in the nature of a digression or illuminated capitals But you cannot possibly do that with christianity because the christian story is precisely the story of one grand miracle The christian assertion being that what is beyond all space and time What is uncreated eternal came into nature into human nature descended into his own universe and rose again bringing nature up with him It is precisely one great miracle If you take that away, there is nothing specifically christian left There may be many admirable human things which christianity shares with all other systems in the world But there would be nothing specifically christian Conversely once you have accepted that then you will see that all other well-established christian miracles are part of it That they all either prepare for or exhibit or result from the incarnation And just as every natural event exhibits the total character of the natural universe at a particular point in space of time So every miracle exhibits the character of the incarnation And now if one asks whether that central grand miracle in christianity is itself probable or improbable Of course quite clearly and you can read the grand miracle in lewis's book miracles So this this is this again is the point and so harris's perceptive in noting Christianity is a little different here. And and so peterson if you stick to all of the stuff common to the other Mythologies, I won't have a problem. But when you go into christianity and you don't Don't what? you don't Don't what? You don't take off the top Okay you like to come up from the bottom and maybe stuff i've come up from the bottom it gets expressed in other religions and other Mythologies and and maybe even in the bible and you can hear brett weinstein on the joe rogan show with brett And jordan peterson were on joe rogan and they debated these points in that video This is where this gets debated because brett weinstein will say well, maybe there is some wisdom in there But it's up to us to choose but this leads to the difficulty because on what basis do you choose? Well, I have to leverage that wisdom and and what well-being this then shows the circularity of it because we Evaluate well-being based on what well based on our experience. Well Why have we said we need to look at much? Well, we look to look you to look at many more human beings not just me But we also need to look at human beings going back in time. Well, how far back in time? Well as far as we can go well scientifically we've been doing psychological studies for 50 60 years Oh that and and most of them to western civilization. Well, that doesn't tell us much So we have to get broader so we have to do these in other situations other civilizations But we have we're already late in the game there. So that's not really helping us much So it would be good if you actually had a system that had at least some control element like a standardized religious text And you had a fairly well documented um history of communities around this text and their conversations around this text and then suddenly you're into Islam a little bit longer judaism a little bit longer christianity, but i'm not saying that there aren't similar things in hinduism or in buddhism, but This is the point If you're going to judge well-being you want as far back a sense of it as you can and in that sense peterson's darwinian Question and his pragmatic darwinian element of truth. That's why that comes into the picture you see Peterson is has been working through his stuff for a long time and good bad right or wrong He's got a fair amount of consistency in this level of it now you get into more of the social conversation and the political Conversation, I think it gets more complex. But when you look at this This part of his mission and this layer of his work This is this is where this goes now I wish I had more time to keep going through this video because You know a little bit later. I'll see if I can we'll see if I get lucky Harris's notion here. I'll see the sound levels low To enable something like a human god to interact with mankind or Or is peterson anyway, so This is this is terribly quick and dirty because I don't have any time to do a video today And but I can't help but do one because I get frustrated and annoyed if I can't make a video.
