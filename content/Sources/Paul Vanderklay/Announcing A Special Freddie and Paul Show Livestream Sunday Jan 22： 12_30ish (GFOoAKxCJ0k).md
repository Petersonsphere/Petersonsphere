 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to make a brief announcement that this Sunday, probably about 1230, I think that'll be about the time when we finish up the service, and Freddie's birthday is next week and he's turning 50. And so we're gonna have a little cake after church and once that all settles down, we'll have a special Freddie and Paul show probably between 1230 and 1. We are going to live stream the Freddie and Paul show. And that means that if anybody wants to wish Freddie a happy birthday, you can do that in the live chat. If anybody wants to ask Freddie a question, you can put that in the live chat. Rick will be monitoring the chat and Freddie will answer any questions that you have. I told Freddie a few months ago that this is something that we could do and he was very excited about that. So I think Fancy Nancy will be there. I don't know if Philip the Jesus man will be there or not, but we'll have a very special Freddie and Paul show this Sunday, probably between 1230 and 1. And if you'd like to join us, be there live and we'll see what happens. You never really quite know what's gonna happen on the Freddie and Paul show.
