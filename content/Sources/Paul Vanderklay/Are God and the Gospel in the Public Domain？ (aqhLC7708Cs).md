 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to make a one more video yet this week and as always my videos are sort of Thinking through what's going on in my channel at least my monologues the conversations obviously go from a different Go on a different schedule in some ways because other people come in and change my thinking Converse the Anselman is in some ways the king of the comments and Vixen Dixon is the Queen Those of you who follow the little first game will know that she is the Queen but Anselman as You know one of her most reliable commenters obviously Deeply Christian man. We haven't had a conversation yet. I don't know one of these days. I think we should Also, there's different little sub communities It's kind of swirling around my channel and Anselman is is very much king in the comments, but he's not in the discord and so there's all these tiny little sub communities of That I've gotten to know in this process He left a he left a comment on my conversation with Brett Anderson that I that I'm Basically, what are my videos about my videos are about things? I read or listen to that stick in my head for at least a day or two and I feel the need to comment on them because I think they're Important or noteworthy or they've risen my salience hierarchy and this is what he says to the conversation Admit to being increasingly weary at so often hearing all the warmed over rehashing of the dogmatic ideas that wish to depersonalize the logos and Side-step the truth of Jesus Christ as creator and God incarnate to promote a religion of evolutionary progress that makes Jesus of Nazareth Incidental and not the personal alpha and Omega the same old mythology of all religion in quotes being an Invention of human beings evolving from non-human animals Drag-knuckle drag-knuckle working their way by trial and error towards some self-devised final resolution There is a rejection of the fact of the crea that of the creator having given a reliable revelation of himself as Recorded in the Holy Bible. It is simply an avoidance of accountability to God and the demands of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior You do not help people to come to Christ by trying to fit Christianity into their fanciful theories which seek to relativize Christianity there's a lot in that and I'm sympathetic to the comment in many ways which might strike some of you as peculiar because You know Anselman later on had wished that I had pushed back more fervently with some of the things that Brett had said and other people said well that's not really what Paul is doing and you know, we can we can always have that that conversation and so I've been thinking about this this comment for a little while now and This morning I woke up and as I usually do Early in the morning. I start to think about okay. What am I? What am I? What is what is arising in my mind what is what am I sort of percolating at? This makes me sort of think about Freud and Jung Comparing notes on their dream interpretations which Part of the annoying thing about reading Jung for me is always so many dreams so much interpretation just seems so so distant of course some of you will think very differently of that, but So this morning I I just had the question is God in the public domain and then later is God and the gospel in the public domain I could totally relate to Anselman's point and I could also as you could probably tell from the conversation really feel the excitement of mutual discovery I really enjoyed my conversation with Brett and I thought it was Someone commented in the comments. It sounds like he's he's he's talking I thought the video was on 2x because because Brett is very sharp and very clear and he speaks very well and out it comes very quickly and so you have to kind of brace yourself and you know and Get you know keep up with the fire hose and and figure out what all is going on I thought it was a quite a remarkable Conversation but but it very much gets into this question that Anselman raises and and so part of what I do is If I'm going to be sort of blunt and Sometimes a little cavalier with celebrity atheists. I should be just out of fairness equally blunt and cavalier with those of us in the church and and so this this this question about God and and Jesus now, of course, I'm this week. I've these weeks. I've got double the work and half the time So I probably shouldn't be making a video at all So what I try to do is make sure that my video making and my sermonizing to put out sermons and messages for New Year's Eve and for and for next Sunday's kind of coalesce and then they sort of do this week because I As those of you on the discord know I jumped into the open studio one day and said Should I start in the book of the Bible or stick with the lectionary a little bit longer? And of course some people had ideas like Zephaniah and Leviticus I didn't go with that and I stuck with the lectionary finally and the lectionary passage for at least the revised common lectionary for for next Sunday is John one with the logos and You know Anselman is is right in that. I mean, he's watched my channel as closely as anyone He comments on pretty much every video Almost right away almost as fast as the Queen but You know and he's right in terms of one of the big issues that I'm wrestling with is this question of personhood and the Depersonalization and what what's going on in this space? You know in a lot of ways, you know, this goes back to Jordan Peterson and Early on there were a lot of What's an analogy that Christians can use for Jordan Peterson and eventually I settled on and Over time I continue to be happy with my analogy as Jordan Peterson as the unauthorized exorcist Well, what is an exorcist doing? He's relieving people of demonic possession and there's the story of the Gospel of Mark Which is which is has always fascinated me teacher said John We saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us Do not stop him Jesus says for no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me Whoever is not against us is for us Truly I tell you anyone who gives you a cup of tea Whoever is not against us is for us Truly I tell you anyone who gives you a cup of water anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name Because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not lose their reward There is so much mystery in this passage But you know in some ways Jordan Peterson gave the church a cup of water in Jesus name This this stuff gets this stuff gets tricky and Of course my status as a Christian minister makes it in some ways more tricky And and sort of what Jordan Peterson did was Well, maybe I should keep going with the video because I have an idea where I'm going never a very clear idea Christians sort of have a I can understand People outside the church and non-christians watching watching christians carefully if they bother watching at all with a little bit of wonderment about some things because christians love public vindication, so when of course the priest comes up with the idea of the big bang and it catches and becomes it becomes Scientific orthodoxy and I noted someone on the video. Yeah, I do really read the comments I can't get to them all the time I noted someone on the video. Yeah, I do really read the comments. I can't get to them all generally but I very regularly go through the comments and and And read or skim and one person said I didn't know that christians complained at all about the big bang. So One should get out more to certain places, especially in american evangelicalism and even in the the sort of Kind of Boundary water place that the christian reform church is kind of this strange territory sometimes between high church and low church between main line and evangelical so so you get all sorts of Interesting arguments coming through the christian reform church one way or another everyone's sort of grasping at its its flag But but it this sort of reminds me You know you can't have something like let's say the discovery institute or Intelligent design or creation science unless You're you're really looking for vindication. You're looking for vindication. You're looking for collaboration or better perhaps corroboration from the natural world that our story is true and that's a that's a really helpful thing to do if we'd like to not be gnostic because We want to have one story. We want to have One universe through and through we want there to be one truth And and so sometimes christians kind of give me the impression. Of course. I had five kids and get a lot of experience having five kids and sometimes you hold a toddler your your toddler and Someone comes up to you and maybe it's another kid And you're paying attention to another child and the toddler kind of looks in a fit of jealousy and says well He's my daddy not your daddy and and christians kind of do this sometimes And and understandably so now the toddler has a point and it's jealousy not envy because yeah, he is my daddy And and so I do lay claims to him because he has laid claims to me But daddy of course knows How to relate and navigate the complexities of these relationships better than the toddler? And so I I very much understand anselman's Weeriness with respect to this that um, yeah, it's and he's right and i'm in some sense with him that Beneath beneath certain currents there is a desire to By making by making god public domain Making him a god that we can wield and that is finally the ambition behind Magic right it's it's the ambition behind Ambition behind Magic, right? It's it's the ambition behind Tim keller's definition of religion and the sermons he was this is awfully obscure the sermons He was preaching in the mid aughts and tim keller when I first started listening to tim keller around 2006 he was he was on a tear about christianity versus religion and Uh, obviously religion is a very fudgy very sloshy word that we're Continuing to get to try to get to the the roots of but In order for The the claims the universal claims of christianity to be true You're going to have to live with these tensions Because he's not just my daddy. He's our daddy And and if he's the creator of all then He not only quite rightly makes claims on those who are not within the church or don't consider themselves in relationship to the christian articulation of this father, but christians are going to have to figure out how to Bear witness to this father in a way that others who have very different ideas and by virtue of social status and many other reasons Are going to oppose christian formulations of these ideas and and so, you know, this is a very Estuary like move here Where we try to figure out? Okay. Well, how how do we talk about this? and I was I really enjoyed my conversation with brett and His um, I thought that I thought that conversation went very well and so I think there we are in some ways in the church You can't go to church and sing. This is my father's world And not at the same time imagine that um Others outside the church are going to have something to say And that we in the church should listen and of course we would like them to listen to us but He's my daddy. Yes, he is but um He's also out there in the world making claims of fatherhood over Many many others who don't seem to be in your little family How do we navigate these waters? This isn't this isn't an easy question It's funny when I listen to celebrity atheist talk about the bible and point out all of the things that don't fit And things that don't fit with the church and christianity and I think yeah You're not reading it every week like I am um you read through the bible and there's going to be a lot of things that you begin to scratch your head and say are these features or bugs and Well Makes for interesting conversations a lot of difficult problematic offensive things in the bible. Um, there was a guy uh I just remember his name correctly neil punt who was a retired minister of the christian reform church I guess uh, you should all worry about me in my retirement if I if i'm saying this stuff now what am I going to say when i'm retired when the pension is locked in and and um, You know basically the worst they can do is sort of take away my my privileges of preaching and serving sacraments um He wrote a book He wrote a he wrote a couple of books on biblical universalism as he called it and and I thought I I really appreciated it and some you know people took shots at him and critiqued him and fairly so and rightly so but I I just like the chutzpah of it all and you know christian exclusive vision and this is sort of what we're talking about that Christianity makes audacious claims and christianity's audacious claims come from our book I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me Wow, but but that's got to live with a bunch of other claims in the bible which are which are dramatic one of the points that I made in one of the question and answer friday question and answer There won't be again one this week, but the week after i'm sure we'll do another one And christianity has to deal with this The question of an abraham kiper one of the lights of my own tradition You had both common grace and the antithesis and these two things have to live together. It's sort of Like I often make the comparison with a bounded set and centered set ideas and and For a while it was very fashionable in the christian church to we're trying to get out of our rigid hierarchies and our ossification of our traditions and so young radicals would would wave the flag of well, we need to have more of a bounded set theory of Theory of community rather than boundary markers. So So it's a center set rather than a bounded set Kind of you can find a bunch of that if you google that and that was really something to be talked about about 10 or 15 years ago and You know words and ideas have their fashions, too Well common grace and the antithesis sort of live like that too because I looked at bounded set and centered set and said you know, they really they really live in dynamic relationship with each other over time because Once the center once the center moves it creates a new bounded set And and and you can only understand the movement of a centered set by virtue of watching the boundary markers and the bounded set And and you notice this with two ideas like common grace and the antithesis the antithesis is well It's it's in a sense binary. It's black white right wrong good bad in out And and common grace is much more of this analog where? Well, god's grace is is is littered throughout the world and and you know pagans and and people far from god and people of other religious traditions can Can know truth and speak truth sometimes to the shame and embarrassment of people within the church And so common grace and the antithesis always live in a in a universe together and part of navigating through life with wisdom is figuring out The play of the antithesis when when are we antithetical? And when are we much more analog and gracious and and and it's in our actions that we decide And get right or get wrong When to make those movements? and and so How in the public domain is the knowledge of god and the bible has actually a lot to say about that I Really enjoyed nt wright's book paul a biography And and those of you who want to learn more about paul or nt wright's work? Can can take up that book? I I enjoyed that book and it's one of these books that I want to reread and come back to because You can learn a lot from dr. Wright paul of tarsus though continues to be one of the most influential and divisive figures of Of human history and in some ways in different ways from jesus In a couple of hours i'm going to talk to jacob who if you're on the discord server, you know who he is Who who really is fascinated with jesus and really likes jesus and hopefully we'll get into that in our conversation today But really doesn't like paul at all and and this of course annoys some of the christians in the discord and and and I I just have fun watching the conversations go back and forth and and jacob's view of paul Jacob's not alone. Just read the book of acts now the book of acts is written by luke Who it seems quite clear paul had tremendous influence on luke and of course luke is one of the authors of the Four synoptic god of the of the four canonical gospels in the bible one of the three synoptic gospels and and of course luke also writes the book of acts and So luke is a fan luke is a friend of paul of tarsus and luke doesn't at all cover up the You know someone might complain that acts get a little hagiographic with respect to paul perhaps but luke doesn't cover up the fact that It seemed everywhere paul went Things get very antithetical very fast and People are always trying to kill paul and at one point paul makes a list of all the things that he's suffered from and and my goodness If he had had a real nice therapist someone would have sat down and said paul, maybe Maybe you should lighten up but paul's not about to lighten up and paul goes on a tear through throughout the ancient world and and leaves ruptured synagogues in his wake and and both the the greeks as they would be called in the eastern roman empire and jews of some of these cities wanted to kill him and he goes back to jerusalem and in fact he has to appeal to the romans to try to save his life from From the people in jerusalem quite likely whose coats that he held at the stoning of stephen so Yeah paul of tarsus boy What a guy and It's enormously controversial and even within Even you know, he goes on and the pauline epistles and you can have your debates over which ones were written by him and And how the other ones were formed on and on and on but it's a large and influential portion of the new testament And a large and influential portion of christianity and especially protestantism who thanks to luther really sort of Doubled down on luther's vision of paul right or wrong And by luke's account like jesus he's just a When I say troublemaker, I don't mean that poor. I mean he's going to say things that that polarize people just like jesus did and and I think part of the Part of the reason we don't see that from jesus is jesus has had such dramatically good press probably From the 1960s and the hippie movements that somehow they saw jesus as this quivering mass of tolerance Well, just don't read the gospels too carefully and and paul's just like him in that way But you know, that's not in and of itself necessarily a good thing. There's lots of people like that. It's Partly personality partly the sign of the times donald donald trump has been like that And so I thought for this video I might um Read through paul and athens now for some of you. It's a very familiar thing. But for others it might be new new now at the risk of um giving a Endorsement, even though I would endorse it I use i've used logos bible software for a very long time or An unpaid promotion of them. I thought I don't want to do a whole bunch of cut and pacing I'm just gonna i'm just gonna go right from the i'm just gonna go right from the software and you go to axe chapter At axe chapter 17 paul and sylas are in beria now the brothers sent away both paul and sylas at once during the night in beria They went into the synagogue of the jews when they arrived Now when now they were more open-minded now they were more open-minded than those in thessalonica And they accepted the message with all eagerness Examining the scriptures every day to see if these things were so and so a whole bunch of protestant churches Really love the berians and you can find berian bible churches all over the place in the united states Therefore many of them believed and not a few prominent greek women and men But when the jews from thessalonica found out that the message of god had been proclaimed of course luke is not writing Impartially here luke has a dog in all of these fights um Had been proclaimed by paul and beria also they came there to inciting and stirring up the crowds So when the brothers sent paul away at once to go To go to the sea and both sylas and timothy remained. So again, it's very interesting that His reds paul they really hate and sylas and timothy can sort of Go under the radar and stay there and continue to share some of their teaching and some of the encouragement that they're going to give to some of those who In beria are sort of enamored by paul's preaching of the resurrection in the book of acts that preaching of the resurrection is something that is is brought forward again and again And and those who conducted paul and those who and those who conducted paul brought him as far as athens and after receiving an order for sylas and timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible they went away So paul has to flee Thessalonica and beria and then he goes to athens and he's got to kind of cool his heels Well, they're in athens, but um Well paul's gonna do what paul's gonna do Now one of the things I tell people if they if they've been reading the bible for a long time it's always fun to find another translation to read the bible from because If you've got what what happens is that the bible, especially if you've learned it from your childhood It's all imprinted in your head and unless you're say looking at greek or something else It's these these patterns these patterns get set so read it in a different translation and get a different sense So i'm reading from this lexem english bible, which is I actually like this translation Basically for some of its virtues That it's different and it tries to be a little bit wooden like the old king james or the new american standard It doesn't they're not doing as much interpreting. Let's say they are I mean how to quantify these things um, you know, it's not It's not as is heavily chewed Let's say like the the niv and certainly not something like the new living translation and they're they're not looking over certain shoulders like the esv is and it's just A translation done by some of the scholars within the people who are putting out this bible software. So You know, it's it's it's not a it's not a big thing But I often find it helpful and all the little tools within logos that you can use you can see the You know, you can see the different verbs and stuff are highlighted And these are just things that I do that when you read that you just pay attention to some of the greek text underneath If you're going through english instead of I don't go through greek very well or very quickly So it's just faster to to use english and so if you don't know greek at all You can learn these little hacks and tricks to sort of get out certain aspects of the text. So now paul is in athens And all he's waiting for them in athens His spirit was provoked within him Let me we'll throw up the uh, one of the nice things that you can do in here is you can you can sort of make it Sort of an interlinear. I mean obviously in the other the other one you can you can make it full interlinear And here you can uh, let's just link these These panels, let's just do that. I think this one's This one's already linked. No Yeah, it's already linked okay, so Do d d d scroll up a little bit where are we going? Okay so paul's in athens and He's waiting for them in athens and his spirit is provoked Let's try not to lose my place now Proclaimed in baria Sent away silas and remain conducted him as far as athens after seeing an order So now paul's waiting his spirit is provoked Within him And he observed the city was full of idols Hmm city was full of idols. What does that mean? Well, it means that it's a Ancient very important Greek city and it's very religious and now as I tweeted today I can't use that word and not have tom holland now ringing in my ears about of course this church This city is religious. The city is ancient. The city is important. The city is storied And the city is connected with with philosophy and a good many a good many aspects of that world And going through this I just have to make all these decisions about what I want to stop on and what I what I don't Want to stop in So So the city is so there's all these well again, you're reading in an english You're reading in an english bible About well, the city is the city is full of images Now this full of images is obviously going to trigger his uh Jewish sensitivities with respect to things although paul grew up in tarsus and so he he certainly understood The way these cities were far better than any of us today do but he noticed that in some ways athens was more so And what do you mean full of images? Um, you know full of um eidos figures and so i've been spending some time with the Theological dictionary of the new testament those of you who are in the pastoral profession know it as kittle And there's big kittle and little kittle So if you get curious about this, um, you can always get a the one volume abridged version of little kittle which doesn't require greek greek knowledge and It's a little bit less exhaustive. But of course What's the meaning of these images? Well, these are images of people These are images of gods and and how are these images functioning in that city? and and what what power do these images give and And and how do they function psychologically and you know, are they religious and a little bit later So when you read, you know, let's let's just hop over to the niv When when we read these things as 21st century christians now Oh man as as protestants, especially When paul was waiting for them in athens He was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols She didn't expect this well, what's going on in paul's mind It certainly would have expected this. He's no stranger to To the helenistic world but but athens more so And and idols. Well, what do you mean by uddles? Now we've got all of this old testament Gods of of wood and stone and um He's provoked in spirit the one translation says and he's um Let's see what the esv says He was provoked His spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city was full of idols another fun translation that you can pull Is uh, which is one that's quite easily available the net Which often has a lot of good notes in there that's sort of fun while paul was waiting for them in athens his spirit was greatly upset Greatly upset with him But the words within him were not included in the translation because they're redundant in english His spirit was greatly upset see romans 18. Okay about idolatry When he saw the city was full of idols Why would paul be upset by that Because he cares about the greeks because athens is a prominent city So So he was addressing the jews and the god-fearing gentiles in the synagogue. Okay. So what does that say? Well, there's a there's a diasporic community in athens just like there seems to be just about everywhere else I read one I read one One thing that said that the jews were perhaps 10 percent of the roman empire, which is a pretty sizable sizable minority African americans are 12 percent of the population of the united states. So You know think about in those times those terms and of course, they're not they're not Distributed evenly i've done a little bit of reading about philo this morning because of where logo studies have brought me but Paul gets to athens and he's upset because the number of idols and so then you know This probably just sort of sticks in his craw But then he goes to the synagogue of course because those are his people and he's about You know, he might just turn that one over on its head too as he seems to be doing everywhere He goes and of course in the synagogue as there seem to be in all the other synagogues Are jews which would be people who are formerly jews which would mean that the men are sir are are Circumcised and then god-fearers and these god-fearers are people in the synagogue who are men who are not circumcised But they're curious and they're sort of participating and aligning but they've not gone all the way and now Again, if you take a look at philo of alexandria who does some writing on circumcision You know the circumcision is kind of a big deal in this little subset we could think of that perhaps sort of like women in office was a big deal in the christian reform church or Uh, same-sex marriage a big deal in a lot of denominations It's something that people are talking about and because circumcision Was was a big deal. It was a big deal for a lot of different reasons It's always in the synagogues, but he's got all the the the highly religious We'll use that word again the highly religious nature of this The city of athens and it's it's bothering him. And so he goes to the synagogues and Synagogue and he's talking and he's meeting with them Um So he's addressing the jews and the god-fearing gentiles and the synagogue and in the marketplace every day and get a sense of I guess what would paul be like on youtube? Probably be stirring up stuff too. We have way more subscribers than I do um, he would probably be more loved and more hated in some ways, although There's a troubling dynamic that seems to happen with respect to Jesus and paul that you know They both seem to have a certain small group around them that was fiercely loyal. But But beyond that, I mean jesus of course gets crucified while his at least hardcore male followers are hiding and just leaving the women and children to witness the crucifixion and You know to whatever degree you look at, you know the books of timothy with respect to paul The image of paul there is kind of dejected and a little bit alone Not a lot of people swarming around him and defending him yet Via these letters his influence has grown over history Far more than it was in his day. You also get the sense when you read the new testament carefully that You know, there's a lot of other people sort of doing what paul is doing and you look at the diddaki too this this early This early document where they're giving specific instructions on what to do with all these itinerant preachers you have itinerant preachers showing up in In first john as well in first second and third john Those issues so so it's a very live environment and and paul is one of these guys going around at paul Paul is a very noteworthy example of what's happening and now of course all of our focus goes to him because his letters were Cherished and copied and passed around and have been given high status for centuries and centuries to come So he's bothered by all of the statuary in the book in the in the city of athens and the way it's regarded And then he goes to the synagogue And he's arguing and wrangling in the synagogue, but he's he's also wrangling in the marketplace Every day And those with those who happen to be there. So he's just kind of you know Like who's that? Who's that guy who sets up the table prove me wrong? Jesus rose from the grave there in the marketplace of athens Is it crowder? Is that his name? I'm a bad i'm a bad youtuber Don't know my fellow youtubers as well as I should youtube is too big to know but So he's he's arguing with people also some of the epicureans and stoic philosophers were conversing with him Let's study these lovers of wisdom the epicureans and the stoics and now if you listen to nt, right these were you know, two of the dominant um philosophies in the region at the time And so paul's talking to epicureans and stoics and then he gets invited um In some ways perhaps paul sort of hits the big time here and and what's fun again if you if you look at the english It they were conversing with him. They were having a conversation But you know, i'm always nosy so then you take a little you take a little peek beneath the english and you say well What's what's going on with that? What's going on with that greek word? um, and this this having these conversations Well, what is what is that? It's a sumbalo and you can even have a we'll see if the see if the the computer picks this up sumbalo Sumbalo I guess it does I saw the little bar move, but I don't have the headphones on So and then you then you can like click on over to a greek lexicon you can kind of scroll down here and Well, that's a very interesting word because it's sort of You know, you're considering your ponding your drawing conclusion. You're what you're doing is you're comparing That's what you're doing when you're having this having these conversations. What's he doing in the marketplace? He's sort of comparing notes with the epicureans and the stoics and um They're mixing it up a little bit and and some of them are saying What does this babbler want to say now when you see a word like that in in english you think well What are they what are they trying to get at what a babbler? What's a what's a babbler who they're using it to in the niv? Yeah babbler now you can switch over to the net And conversing. Oh, look at this to converse confer Um foolish babbler ignorant show-off traditional english translation Um, and and here here the greek word is very interesting. It's a spermologos. What is that? It's sperm sperm Sounds sexual. Well sperm is of course seed Um, so he's a it's a word salad. No, it's a it's a it's seed wording. It's it's a nitpicker It's a it's someone who's picking up at picking up little little bits off the ground Now again, the nit has pretty good notes on this kind of stuff. So Uh, the the the the figurative expression of meaning a term based on the practice of birds picking up seeds One who acquired bits and pieces of relatively extraneous information and proceeds to pass them off with a pretense and show Maybe that's me um, because I i'll tell you the more I read the more I realize I know less and less and Then I think I shouldn't be on youtube talking but okay fair warning I can be wrong a lot of the time and go ahead and fact check me and please review my sources and If you come to different conclusions, well, I can't stop you So so yeah, it's a very pejorative sitting to say what is it? What is this idiot talking about? He's not part of us here in athens with our own schools where we know everything But of course he has his own little jewish community there and they there they know things and you very much get a picture of the world Where well then we're all sitting here in our little tribes and here in athens everyone's comparing notes But all of those idols all over the place is just provocative He seems to be proclaiming Of foreign gods and I thought oh boy, there's got to be something going on under the under foreign gods What what is he talking about? um, and again, you can just pop on over and what verse are we in? Be clean foreign gods the end of ender 18. Okay, these are um I'll pull up this will be a little easier for you It's also fun to read these Interlinears to see because they just kind of take the lexical use and they throw it in and makes no english sense So these the the epicureans and stoic philosophers were throwing together him at him basically And and some were saying that well, he's a he's a seed collector of spermologos and And he's standing up to tell them the good news he's preaching at them And then they want they want to take it where we're going, okay, this is what I wanted to get So as a xenon it's foreign gods foreign why would you in english use foreign strange xenon xenophobia? That's that's the word that comes in. So these are these are xenon Demons he's bringing in strange demons. What what does that mean again? You're never going to read that in your english bible Is a proclaimer of strange demons well well dimon what are those well, those are the spirits Well, those are the those are the things that energize matter. Those are the things that move us And when you think about an evil spirit, what are you thinking about? You're thinking about something that's moving people and it might be and this is why jordan peterson is some ways the Unauthorized exorcist because what he did was he exercised people of certain ideologies and that's why jordan peterson was the You know, he was you know, he he was the troubler of the youth he was corrupted the youth As jordan peterson has done And and so now the apostle paul he's he's bringing in these these strange demons Well, what are these demons these paul is a troublemaker and he's very demonic in this sense See, this is the thing about language I've just triggered a whole bunch of you because i'm just playing with words here, aren't I and maybe i'm being a sperm a seed picker a spermologos and See, this is what happens when I don't do my homework This is what happens when I just read because it's all messy and on sunday It's got to come out and make some kind of sense, but i'm not preaching on this sunday so He's telling them this this message and again in the english translation. It gets all nicely tucked in Epikian philosophers were conversing with him and some were asking what does this foolish babbler want to say seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods, so it's the it's the strange demons That he's proclaiming They said this because um, they said this is because he was proclaiming the good news about jesus and the resurrection So they took paul and brought him to the areopagus saying we may know what this um May we know what this new teaching is that he is proclaiming? So they took paul and brought him to the areopagus saying may we know what this new teaching is that he is proclaiming For you are bringing some surprising things more strange things to our ears. So we want to know what they mean All the athenians and the foreigners who lived there used to spend their time and nothing else But telling or listening to something new Something new they liked um, they liked new things. They was These were these were people of great luxury they could afford the statues and they had the time to sit around and talk That's what they prioritized in their life So paul stood before the areopagus and said men of athens. I see that you are very religious Well, what on earth word are you going to use for religious underneath there? Actually, yeah, the n.i.t is pretty good. I wasn't looking at the n.i.t when I was just looking at some of the stuff this morning Day You get it you get a you get a word like this Daisy daimone daisy daimone Well, what is that they're a Fear of of the demons of the diamonds. What does that mean? Well that they're they're they understand that these powers these spiritual powers are Shaping and molding the earth and they're they're fearers of them. Are they god fearers? Well, that would be winging their at least spirit fearers. Well now this fear is respecters and their fascination and it has their attention and it has their anxiety and And so paul says to them I see but of course in english, you're very religious What does that say about our use of that word? So So I see that you are all very Afraid of demons. No, that's not quite right. You're all very Concerned about the things that move matter and nature and that's why you're always talking about these ideas because People don't have ideas ideas have people and ideas rule the world and ideas go through our society and ideas mean Some people get elected and some people get prosecuted and some people get killed and some people win and some people lose I For human beings ideas count dramatically and so he says well, I see you're all very Um, I see you're all very dacey dimone Devout These frames these frames For as I went around and observed closely at your objects of worship Well, yeah, it's quite good. They're your sanctuaries Please oh, yeah, I did I looked at this this morning a little bit part of what i'm trying to do Okay, is god in the public domain or not part of what i'm trying to do Is is offer for you a sense of what the relevant issues are here? According to the conversations that we've been having Because in many ways if you read through it in your english bible And if you've had just enough church to make you cynical You're not going to come out of this with I think A little better view than you might have of what's happening At least through other frames and other lenses of what's going on in the ancient world So i'm re-translating some of this stuff I guess this is why people like eugene peterson and david bentley heart write their own translations of the new testament But boy, we seem to go through them quickly because well, what what what frame are we in here? Well, why do these men in athens spend all of their time talking and why are the epicureans and the stoics? so prominent and and and and why do they Probably well-heeled people, you know, they like philosophy and they've earned some money or they have You know someone supporting them so they go to athens so they can you know, it's basically what we're doing in the discord server Or here on youtube We want to know what moves the world Not just well and not not just my little world, but the whole world Well, what on earth is that? Can we get our minds around that? And so And so you've got your little synagogue in athens and you've got your your areopagus and you've got all of the people You know again, it's not different from going into the discord server and you've got your your people who are promoting this or promoting That are going to twitter and you find all of this and so paul is sort of using his nicest language here He was disturbed by all the images and he's looking around and saying well, you're all are pretty Concerned about these these diamonds these see if I use the word demon that that that sends us down a whole new path But but again, the path isn't irrelevant but but what language can I have to really to really use that will communicate with you and Why is a pastor on youtube doing this stuff anyway, because this is my quest Because I want to find language that can Work for you and in order to do this I need to listen to you and I need to listen to people in a particular physical address and and I need to read the bible and I need to learn about phyllo and I need to You know go to yosemite like I did yesterday with my family Which was a great trip and you'll notice some new pictures came on to the came on to the channel because of this it saw those You know got saw those ravens are they ravens I think they're raisins they're pretty big they're quite fascinating to watch Didn't put the picture up of the coyote that people were feeding don't feed wild animals Anyway I'm trying to figure this out. How can we talk about this? How can we understand it? How can we understand what what happened between paul? and the people at the areopagus and we're reading this via luke and so Okay, so you're you're you're quite interested in in these These diamonds these demons these things these spirits that are moving us the the spirits that are Are moving through the world and you're trying to map these and so you have the epicureans and you have the stoics And of course, plato was a while ago and a lot of people think phyllo was a middle platanist But phyllo was also a jew and so what did the jews believe at that time? And what are what were their factions and so paul goes into the synagogue and what is he about to know and about to Bump into and of course you can read nt, right? I didn't do enough homework for this Maybe i'll talk about this with jacob today And so paul keeps talking So so I found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god and then you read You read tom holland when you get you know a few centuries later and People are figuring out that the proliferation of gods is a real problem because if you're if you're very I should put my headphones on and hear this so I can at least say it with some kind of correctness Not zenos, that's easy boy. This is a bad video You know Dacey daimone dacey daimone i'm such an auditory listener If you're if that's what you're like if you're if you're always fearing the diamonds if you're always Fearing them and anxious about them and worried about them Yeah, we might in the secular society call that religious not a bad translation But if you're always fearing them then put up a statue in case you miss somebody That just makes sense and there's probably traditions of that too. And you know we have in our We have in our nation the tomb of the unknown soldier. Well, what is that about? Well? Not everybody in who's given their life in a foreign war Gets their remains identified and shipped home So this sort of covers them and paul decides like a good preacher finds a local illustration and is going to dive in in order to make his case For the the greeks who are so dacey daimone dacey daimone. It's kind of fun Just pressing the button and hearing the dude talk dacey daimone. I'm really a child anyway The god who made the world and everything in it that's pretty public domain Who is the lord of heaven and earth? That's pretty public domain Does not live in temples made by human hands This the guy who held the cloak when when stephen was basically making noise about that Iconoclast jesus who cursed the fig tree and said ah the temple's coming down next Did I say iconic did I say jesus an iconoclast? Oh boy am I in trouble? so So who is this lord of heaven and who doesn't live in temples made by human hands nor is he served by human hands? as he as Served and as if he needed anything and of course here you've got well what happens in these temples Well, you're feeding the gods and and and this is what the gods need and this is sort of the economy the religious economy with the gods that Well, you can go to the gods and have an exchange give the gods what they want And then the god will give you what you want Isn't that why you go to church and tithe? So, you know if you do all these things for god and he gives you what you want and that's why you're so offended This is tim kellers point back in 2006. That's why so you're so offended when your life goes bad And he says hey, I believed in all the document doctrines and I gave my tithe. I was a good person That's sort of a secularized generic i'm a good person things are supposed to be good for me You know, it's so ironic when people go around preaching karma. I'm thinking yeah, really you really want to go down that route As uh earl used to say karma is a bitch anyway Nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything because he himself gives life and breath and everything to everyone paul's making some pretty Public domain claims here about this god and yeah people are gonna be upset about this now They're used to talking ideas. So they're probably not gonna want to kill him after which you know Seems to be what happens to paul in in most places So maybe paul would be a little bit safer if he stayed in athens But of course, he's not gonna do that because he's a traveling man and he's just gonna keep traveling He's gonna say even more explosive stuff From one man he made every nation of the human race to inhabit the entire earth determining their set times and the fixed limits Of the places where they where they would live There's a whole nother interesting thing to go into which i'm not going to go into now So that they would search for god and perhaps grope around for him and find him Though he is not far from each one of us I like this translation. I think the n.a.t is It's got some pizzazz here. I like the fact that they use the word grope. It's good word In correct contexts So so the idea is that well He's in public domain you can find him and in fact, he wants you to go look for him Well, why why is he so hard to find? Well? Look into that question too What's really going on and what do we mean by this word god and because that's very much at play there In in many ways because the epicureans and the stoics and the various philosophical groups at play will have very different understandings And here paul is a paul is a jew Making this argument Um his god there's a lot of stories about his god And it's it's kind of a one god thing and not all the different gods and what are the relationship between the one god and the different gods? Are we really talking about the same thing when we're talking about these things? Where was I And then he's going to quote some of their folks for in him We live and move about and exist as even some of your own poets have said for we too are his offspring So since we are god's offspring We should not think the deity is like gold or silver or stone or an image made by human skill Paul has to get that dig in hey, it's about the statues here. You know enough enough with the statues. All right is it the statues or What what particular? Relevant aspect of the statuary is paul offended by is the fact that you can wield a statue Is it the fact that you think that putting up a statue might curry favor with the powers that the Because they're so dacey diamond Because they're so up about the diamonds See here again, it doesn't really work in english they diamonds and people you think you're saying diamonds If you say demons, then you got a problem. So Dacey diamond, I am a child anyway Therefore god was overlooked and Therefore although god has overlooked such times of ignorance How many times In our world don't I see conversations about well, why can't god just forgive just by overlooking? The peer paul says he overlooked it. Well, what does that mean? Well, what's what on earth is what on earth? What does it mean that paul says god overlooked this stuff? How does that fit in your christian narrative? Does overlook such times of ignorance he now commands all people everywhere to repent What do you mean when you mean everywhere do you mean the the people over and The inca and the maya and the aztecs and the chinese and the aboriginal australians and you know What what does now mean for that? Is it an existential now? Is it? Now through paul you greeks are being commanded to to to stop your ignorance and well, yeah and no and How does language work how does any of this work? Because he has set a day on which he's going to judge the world in righteousness By a man whom he designated having provided proof to everyone by raising him from the dead Well now it's gonna happen. It seems like paul can walk around and do a lot of philosophizing But once he talks about the resurrection of the dead the synagogue pops off and the areopagus pops off because You know you think about oscar wildes raised from the dead harrod speaking in oscar wildes play I will not allow him to be raised from the dead. Okay. Well go ahead and try and stop him Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead some began to scoff but others said we will hear Um, we will hear you again about this So paul left the areopagus, but some people joined him and believed among them dionysius Dionysius Who was a member of the areopagus? So then you get sets up the book for you know, pseudo do any dionysius and the areopagite Jonathan peugeot will tell you about him a woman named demaris and others with them now why again drop these names? well if you read um I can't think of his name right now But probably dropping these names so luke's readers could say well if you're in athens Look up look up dionysius the areopagite And talk to him about this conversation with paul and he'll tell you about it and this woman demaris She'll tell you about it, too. These are probably two fairly high visibility People that if you went to athens you could find them and figure out. Okay, here's uh Here's people that can testify that luke just isn't making stuff up Up But right here in this story and it's a very famous story and it's one that loves to get trotted out by preachers and there's There's all kinds of depths and levels to this story Someone's walking past back and forth past my door. I'm gonna go see who it is. Hang on It was a church member dropping off something in the church mailbox Text Well, what are we gonna do with this text and in fact this text is is so full of stuff it's then again, if you just dig a little deeper just like Dacey daimone, you know gets translated devout or religious Religious people are fearful of demons. Well, yeah, that's true. But what do we mean by demons or diamonds and Paul looks around and why does that fear result in statuary? And then paul quotes two pagans and says yeah, this is kind of like us and we're like, well So how are we supposed to relate now? Nobody's going to accuse paul of not being antithetical He was so antithetical that stuff popped off all the time And nobody's going to accuse paul of not You know putting jesus at the top of the hierarchy because well, you know jesus is lord and just read the rest of the stuff He wrote but at the same time He's Taking time and talking in athens and the areopagus and he's not going to stay there very long but others will stay there and Well, there will come a time when athens will become christian but there'll be a lot of history between when paul visited and When that would happen later and all of the stuff that would happen in between would all be part of this story So is god part of the public domain is the gospel part of the public domain? can we get senses of the gospel by by reading other books and and by reading other things I think part of what's Been so powerful about the work of cs. Lewis has been exactly that and part of why I enjoy his book miracles so much is because one way or another You're gonna have to figure out where jesus fits into the world beyond the church And there's going to be some antithetical elements to it. There's going to be some common grace elements to it What I mean by those things there's good. There's going to be sometimes when jesus makes claims that everyone sort of stops and That makes people uncomfortable and there's going to be other aspects about them where people like yeah, you know I'm okay with that part of jesus, but that stuff about being god's son. Okay. Well, what do you mean by god? Well and off we go Now at this point in the video i'm seriously considering just deleting it but It's a busy week and I hate to Just delete things part of me, which is why i'm probably Not a great youtuber is I just put out this mess and let you sort it out Which is not the way to have a good thriving youtube channel. There needs to be consistent quality so that when when the when the youtube consumer clicks on the video They they get their expectations satisfied in this video. I don't know if it's going to satisfy any expectations Expectations including including the king and the queen of the comment section But I guess I guess part of the reason that that the comment Sort of stuck with me and again, i'm not critiquing the comment. I I'm such a such a conflicted individual that on one hand part of the part of my consciousness congress when I read that Comment stood up sort of like you you folks out there in the uk with your very noisy Parliament with your two sides stood up and said yeah, that's right a bunch of the other people may have be I have a consciousness Parliament now to destroy my alliteration a bunch of people said no and and so ansa man sort of provoked that in my brain as as do many things and I Guess part of me part of me says if jesus isn't lord of all Then he's not who I was raised to believe he was and if he is lord of all Then he is the icon of the invisible god as the book of Colossians says and and if that's the case then You know what Paul was traipsing about the ancient world doing Was important and okay almost got him killed a lot of times eventually did got him arrested got him stone shipwrecked beaten all of those things You know, maybe Again invoking a narrative at the final judgment when I'm called up The Lord says vanderkley they gave you that name Paul, I don't know if you quite measure up Maybe your parents thought it sounded nice And in Dutch there's a there's a word sputton which is you know, maybe I'm making light of holy things Before the video my friend Hank called I'm naming you Hank I'm naming you Hank and Hank calls me now and then and we have a little chat and Hank's from Chicago and I'm from the New York area And so we have a we have a we have a degree of I don't know even what you call it We have a degree of culture between us a commonality of culture between us. Hank's been on the channel before and You know part of it is You both have to take yourself more seriously and less seriously at the same time and If you're gonna be a Christian You know You know, I'm not gonna be a Christian I'm not gonna be a Christian I'm not gonna be a Christian I'm not gonna be a Christian You know Maybe even be a bad one Know what I mean by that I mean understand understand where understand and be okay with all of the ways you fall short and Again, it's be okay and not be okay, but in the right way. I Tweeted today because I was you know, I Was thinking about what am I gonna do this week? I shouldn't do any more videos I should get down to work on my my my my good my New Year's Eve video which I'll put on this channel again in the rough draft stream as I did the The the Christmas Eve one and then my Sunday sermon because Friday I don't plan on being in the office because it's New Year's Day I'm gonna be with the family and Saturday is usually my day off So I don't really want to go in the office that day and I'm hoping that Some more of my kids might be home and because when you get to this age and the kids are in the 20s You spend all the time you can with those kids if you get an opportunity Because they're starting to get busy and they're starting to go out the cats in the cradle in the silver spoon Little boy blew in the man on the moon Anyway So I was reading through Kittle today about logos because I'm in the prologue of the Gospel John again What's with that lectionary? I keep going back to the prologue of the Gospel of John. I've got to preach it again I got to figure out how to preach it again And so I'm gonna talk about the logos because it's the same issue In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God well this logos and of course Jordan Peterson energized that word for a whole bunch of people and Anselman brought it up in his comment and it very much has to do with whether God is in public domain or whether the Gospels in public domain and and and the in church or outside of the church and all of those issues that get involved and I'm reading along and Kittle and a further demonstration is to be found in the fact that secular Greek and I think what on earth is secular Greek Stoicism and neoplatonism can split can split up the logos into many creative individual or or or partial logi In all the phenomena which invest the world with being in reality to be sure the logos is an expression of harmony It itself is the spiritual bond which holds the world together at its heart But it is not me but it is not a mediating figure which stands independently between God and the world only insofar as the Constructive principle is also that which reveals the no ability of things which can speak to the Greek logos having a mediatorial role says Kittle the big one And I can't after all of this Tom Holland stuff. Thanks Tom Holland I can no longer read a common term like secular Greek and not stop and ponder what on earth do we mean by that? Life used to be so simple Well, I complexified my life and I turned what seemed to be clear into that which was muddy Probably what I've done for some of you with Act 17 But why do we do it? Well, because when the gospel of John talks about the word becoming flesh There's so much packed into that and even you know I had to start reading about word and where where does this where did this thing go? Where did this Lego I speak you know speaking is gathering It's it's assembling and that of course triggered in me all of the stuff I've been thinking about how when I speak right now I take this world too big for me to comprehend and I I distill it down and I tried to distill it into words and I tried to make sense of it and and then off we go into all of the meaning and everything else and Jerusalem and Athens do have to speak together and I Guess I guess I would Maybe be in the Ariake Ariopagus be team because I'm not as well educated as I need to be and my Greek is in bad shape and my Hebrews and worse and I get stuff wrong and I read books that are too hard for me And I'm a spermologos I pick up things and I don't get them right and I get embarrassed by them and I make crappy videos like this one But I keep making videos don't time those who know me well personally know why it's like My wife says to me, you know You're probably on that video saying things wrong all the time and I said yeah I am and she said but you're not gonna stop I said no I'm not going to she watched me learn Spanish in the Dominican Republic And she was horrified because she said you go out there and you virtue the language she had a degree in Spanish I said Yeah, I do My one of my pre language teachers said, you know If you're gonna learn a language you need to make a million mistakes might as well get going So if I'm gonna learn something about the world and how it all fits together, I'm gonna make a million mistakes So might as well get going and That's why I have no I Have no problem with people say I haven't watched all your videos and I think well, that's probably a sign of mental health But probably the whole reason I got into Making videos and talking with you all and I suppose the reason you listen to me or however many people will eventually listen to this video is because we want to know how it all fits together and And and And we want to weigh to God. Well, what do we mean by that? Well, what is God? You know think about that little bit that I read from mere Christianity. He's the source of light and life and love and joy Don't you want to be close to that? Don't you want to emulate that don't isn't isn't This this this this beautiful gift of life that we've been given. Don't you want to make more life? Not just babies, but don't not include babies Yeah if this is gonna make any sense it has to be in public domain and and if Paul can Be patient with the areopagites well, let's be patient in this areopagus called YouTube and in the discord server and let's Let's be savvy about this what do I mean by that it means well sometimes sometimes be a little antithetical Sometimes be a little shrewd and sharp Don't sometimes use a little click baity title But in everything show love What I mean by that I Mean go after ideas go after the diamonds with with everything you've got But that that that person that the diamonds are moving Love that person oh Why? Because that's what Jesus told you to do and sometimes loving means taking a philosophical scalpel to an idea And sometimes it might warn them say hang on. This is gonna hurt a little bit, but then go after it and There people will get upset and they'll say ouch and things will happen but um, but go after it and Ask hard things about terms that are used secular Greek. What on earth is that? Is there any such thing? Go after these things try and try and pick up Jerusalem in one hand and Athens in the other and Watch the sparks fly when you sort of put them together We're full of all these competing desires and I thought about the title as so often happened to my My crappy little videos It's often not until after the video that I title the thing because it's not maybe it's only a few hours after that I think well that video was really about this and in fact, they might not have even mentioned that in the video, but Well, okay, I'll lay my cards on the table. I'm a Christian minister I'm named after the Apostle Paul that or my uncle's middle name and And I like to proclaim or evangelize as it seemed the English Bible was a little reluctant to say and Well, why would I want to do that I Think Jesus is good and I think God in the gospel In Some sense are their own thing and yet belong to everyone or actually everything belongs to him That's sort of what it means to be creator And so what I see with militant atheism is that it's a polemic against a Cartesian dualism Which it finds offensive to their heightened view of humanity and they also want one coherent world together Which means well, let's talk and let's compare notes and let's have a conversation which is a attempting to compare notes about things and and And yeah, if you say something that I think is crazy I'll tell you and if you think I'm part of what's so refreshing about YouTube and having conversations outside the church Is that when you say something which is really important or big people will respond to it Whereas in the church, they're all kind of drowsy. Yeah, Jesus is Lord If you really believe it it's really important We have a desire to know a desire to wield and a desire to worship So, oh maybe worst video ever Is God in the gospel in the public domain can we find it by looking around Apostle Paul seems to say God wants us to look around God wants us to ask hard questions God wants us to seek him. Well, what does that mean? What do you mean by God what do you mean by see God wants us to to put the world together and now I'm gonna Bear some of my Protestantism here. Maybe it's not just my Protestantism but if you're if you're working in a lab if you're seeking The best way to sell cars or the best way to to mine iron or The best way to Assemble amens in the Central Valley so that it can produce Ammon milk what on earth does that word mean and on and on and on and on and on that this is my father's world and Everything here speaks of him My father's world Speaks of him My friend John Van Sloaton does some fun stuff up there and Calgary Alberta with his Preaching through all kinds of other things But how does God Bear witness to himself in this world And how much can we learn about him? But then Anselman comes about and says yeah and Christians say He revealed himself definitively in the person of Jesus Christ What does that mean? How do we answer that question? How do we how do we assess that claim? I? Don't know I don't get tired of looking at these questions so Am I gonna put this video out? Yeah, I am Is it gonna be horrible let me know in the comment section but I like talking to Brett and I like talking to Anselman and I know Carl has given up on me because I don't I don't Pursue natural law and I believe in too much. God number two and in some ways That's the line that Anselman is sort of Playing with right here. It's got number one and got number two God number one that Paul speaks about in act 17 who These can be clearly known Romans 1 you can find him You can you can use reason which again Lewis via miracles is already a gift So we're using God's own gift to find him and you can use reason and we can talk about this and we can chew on it But at the same time he comes and In Jesus but Jesus doesn't sort of poof and everything evaporates all the questions evaporate and everything just sort of locks in no Far from it. Well, why not? Well if Jesus is God why why and then okay? Well, why do you have those expectations? What do you think about yourself? Do you think that you are so brilliant and bold that everything's gonna be clear to you and you're gonna know it right away And when people talk like that, I think I'm not that way I've watched myself and when I watch myself I realize how ignorant and Silly and stupid and lazy and all these other things that I am. I know that about myself and My wife will say yeah, and you still think a lot about yourself Don't you still making videos still not embarrassed by some of the things that maybe I should be Is God in the gospel in the public domain Yeah, God number one surely is God number two requires revelation And then once he is revealed and of course for Paul well the the The proof of it was the resurrection of the dead. Well, why would that be proof and of what? Well for Paul it's a linchpin and for me too. I agree with that because well why? Well, you can have all these all these right ideas, but again, you're judged by what? Again, you're judged by what you do. Well, what is what is doing and now we're sort of back in Peter Sonia land what is doing doing is in some ways the The final working out of all of the vague head stuff into the complexity of the real world And so Jesus comes and he does And what does that mean? and what sense does that make of the world and How should that change our behavior and then what is the church this this group of people that that tries in a very formal way to bear witness to him and Of course Paul goes and blows up all these synagogues not literally you know, they all have splits and fights because he goes in there and again, I'm talking to Jacob in an hour or so Jordan Pesin comes along and relieves people of certain things that had been possessing them And of course those who remain possessed by them continue to be a fat upset and offended by him and others Sort of say no, I'm free of some of these things because of him And he sort of does it in Jesus name and sort of not so Yeah, I I Guess we're getting towards the end of the year and I should thank you. Thank you for watching such a unorganized rambly youtuber I've certainly read plenty of comments that said word salad and get to the point and If y'all were Bob, maybe that's the selection that I've made in my audience That's the selection that I've made in my audience If y'all were Bob, maybe that's the selection that I've made in my audience that I Don't know what it says about you, but I know what it says about me and it's not always flattering what it says about me but I'm gonna keep doing it and I'm gonna keep with these conversations and I'm gonna keep talking to as least as many that I can who come my way if I can and Because I think God and the gospel do belong in public domain and I think they are the best way to live and the best way to think and I know it sounds really trite, but you sort of fall in love with Jesus and you fall in love with the God of the Old Testament even and as Mary would say he's male and we're female so I guess it's sort of a grand historical bachelor program and Our bachelor show and the only thing is that that while the church is his bride And on and on and on and now I'm really rambling I started rambling right at the start so Does God and the gospel belong in the public domain? Let me know in the comment section. I know the Queen and the King are gonna have comments about it. So I wish you well
