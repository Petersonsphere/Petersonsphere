 Hi, this is Paul and this is a little front end to a video that I'm going to share about It's basically the conversation that five of us had about an idea that that Job had which was when he asked Jeff basically when we're gonna have lobster con and Now actually lobster. There's a lobster convention or something out there. So we're not gonna call anything lobster con We're gonna have something probably talking about meaning and maybe bridges and something like that but One of the things that I've been a Impressed by in the last couple of years as I've been doing this work has been the importance of meeting in person And so one of the things that I was thinking about was what would it be to be able to have? more longer conversations face to face and sort of the two ideas that came out of this were retreats or conferences or Conventions and my initial idea was mostly retreats of more intimate gatherings of 15 to to 30 people Probably over a span of a long weekend or three days or something like this Where there might be a formal presentation or two there probably meals together there are probably down times maybe day trips and Something of this nature where people can get together meet each other so on and so forth so in this conversation I'm sharing is a conversation that that we had with Job and Jeff and Ryan and Cassidy all of whom picked up on this idea and sent me emails and wanted to talk about it and having conversations with some of my Local group here Rick and Joey and Tyler many of whom have a you've seen on my channel at one point or another and below there's a link to a survey and It's just a little survey monkey survey that if you're interested in this at all Please fill it out because before we can put together a an in-person event Where there obviously be costs and things like that we'd like to get input from people out there What kind of interest is there really in doing some retreats? Where would we do them and I've got a variety of places down below what kind of price structure is important and So some of these questions so listen to the conversation fill out the survey also a note on the discord server that we started Apparently the invites only go for a hundred people at a time So I'll probably have to update them regularly, but there should be a link to the one below today for the first time We sort of had kind of a virtual meetup audio only on The discord server where we had about 20 people and Job led someone else Guy named Andy and in conversation and and for Andy this was a You know the discord server was sort of his first real opportunity to have extended conversations with other people who have been within this Conversation and Andy shared a lot of his story And it was a it was really a moment many of us were just excited and touched and it was Speaking from a not everybody in our group obviously are Christians But it was really a sacred holy moment that that we had as Andy shared his story and shared it with Job and some others other people chimed in so if you're Feeling kind of isolated or alone join the discord server and jump into the conversation there so far the it's a little bit more live than in the comments section But the and then now we're playing with you know having people connect in you know online But also we want to look at creating spaces for people to connect that retreats or maybe Conferences and so we're trying to get the background information for that so drop to pick up that survey monkey link Fill out the survey only takes about two minutes. There's like five questions and And let us know what you think because if we're gonna maybe put something together Because you know, I don't have you know, I don't have A hundred thousand dollar grant project to do this kind of thing. We're just making this stuff up as we go along so watch the video Fill out the survey and the whole bunch of us who are kind of working on this. I mean everybody's volunteer We'll see what we can put together and we'll let you know what what what we can put together. I This is Paul and We're gonna talk about possible convention get together extended meetups some of these kinds of ideas and This this idea got started between Job and Jeff because Job said something to Jeff and Job's in a noisy cafe, so he's gonna be Muted quite a bit of this conversation, which will probably be disturbing for him Muted quite a bit of this conversation, which will probably be disturbing for him But go ahead Joe hi job and Jeff. How did this whole thing start? Okay, first off this was a joke So, okay, I don't know Jeff how did this happen because I think you and I were just talking We should have like this it would be fun if we had like a conference where we could have like real speakers breakout sessions Well, this is all your idea and it just sounded good to me and I was I was kind of half joking about it too And then shared it with Paul in our conversation and then his eyes lit up And I was like, oh wow Paul thinks this is a really good idea to I mean it could really work. So that's why we're here I guess but Yeah, I get all these ideas now The Dutch start everything that's just what they do that's their role Well, then I guess I guess just to add to a little bit more of it Paul, right? So we discussed it a little bit in our last conversation And then in the comments of that conversation I want to say Cassidy posted something like I'll I'll run your lobster con or something like that So I reached out to her still half kidding and just saying hey what get it done You know, actually this sounds like an opportunity for you to make a document documentary film And so then she responded to that and sounded even more serious about you know Trying to host it, you know, I guess this is an opportunity to bring Cassidy into the conversation Yeah, I wasn't joking. I'll run Um Yeah, so I don't know. I just when I heard Jeff and you talking about it was like Oh that has to happen a hundred percent has to happen and I helped Run comedy that's already have a little experience and like doing events sort of like that and we do like live podcasting and panels and different things so it's like I don't know I thought it'd be cool But I was like half joking half very serious like if it happens, I'm going to be a part of it But yeah, and then yeah a couple days later Ryan Messaged me going like we have to make this happen. What are we gonna do? I'm like, okay, we're really doing this We made a Google Doc Very serious Doc but it exists that's the standard of seriousness. Is there a talk about it not to be real Yeah, there's a URL out there Okay so let me give you a couple of thoughts that I had because I heard about it and I thought I Thought of it first in terms of the meetups that we've had here in Sacramento and in other places The meetups are are often at least our meetups here in Sacramento fairly loose and unstructured and They just kind of go on and on and and there are different conversations and conversations morph into other different conversations And I also thought about many church retreats that have been on in the past and churches do retreats You know fairly, you know, that's not uncommon where Where Whereas maybe you're getting together regularly Throughout the year at one point in the year for two or three days you get together in a more intensive way and you can kind of conversations can kind of go to different levels when you do that sort of thing and so then I so basically there's there's a couple different Things I thought about one was, you know, I'm surprised that the folks at Jordan Peterson's Management company, what is that? CAA or whatever it is I'm surprised they haven't organized a Jordan Peterson conference yet because that would I would assume that would probably be quite successful but my initial thinking was something more along the idea of a lot of retreats that I've done and gone to in the past and Immediately, I thought of two things one of which my sister my sister Owns runs sort of a bed-and-breakfast in rural, Connecticut where she's got a farmhouse and and You know a facility like hers could host and there's a lot of other bed-and-breakfasts around and even little hotels and stuff So, you know, you could have some plenary sessions where you could have groups of 30 40 people and then you could do breakout sessions, there's a fair amount of room there and And the thing the thing that's cool is is that if you have something that's sort of integrated where you've got overnight accommodations to you can I mean you have meals together you have conversations together and Just a lot of just a lot of different conversations can happen with something like that and something like that can be done you know quite easily and and You know fairly fairly reasonably so that's kind of the small idea I thought you know, I could do one on the East Coast in Connecticut and my sister's place There's a hotel that we used in the foothills here outside of Sacramento that We used for a pastor's retreat and that was also pretty relaxed. So that's kind of the small That's kind of there's actually a lobster con out there. I don't know I googled it right away and it's like there's somebody and it's not has nothing to do with Jordan Peterson I'm not exactly sure what has to do with lobsters probably Lobster farming convention who knows and my niece I'm hoping to get my knee so much on one of these days She's actually getting a PhD in marine biology about lobsters. So that's kind of cool. She's trying to save the lobsters That's kind of the little idea where you know, you could just kind of announce something and if 2030 people signed up for it, that's that's sort of how big that thing is and then there's the idea of Obviously, I'd love to see Jordan Peterson Do something or in fact, I was also thinking, you know, I I sent I have a I have a friend who's a pastor of a church that's right on University of Toronto's campus and I sent him an email and said, you know Wouldn't it be really cool if you know what how how How experimental are your church leaders in terms if we did a conference and If you did it right there in Toronto, you know bring in Peugeot have her vacay talk Peterson can decide whatever the heck he wants to do But just bring in a few people and and get some more interaction So that was another idea and I threw it out friend who's the pastor and he hasn't gotten back to me Which is kind of what pastors do and you hear an idea and you kind of think I kind of like to do that But I don't know if my board would go for it Because you know who the heck is this Vander clay and this Eastern Orthodox icon Carver and then this guy who taught a course in Buddhism and cognitive science and they're all gonna come into our church, you know, that doesn't sound like a good idea. So Good we get ideas that I had so they're there they all are just throwing them out there Well, first of all, I'm just gonna talk I would love to have it in Toronto because I It's easier to travel to for a lot of people because of how the US is some great policies I like that some people were interested in already live in Canada And I wonder what we could do it maybe you love tea Where we could maybe have some of the larger rooms to have to have the talks and then the large the smaller classrooms for breakouts I spoke at a conference recently in Texas as Jeff knows and That was the Catholic University of st. Edwards where the main keynote were in the large buildings like the Class where they lunch and then all the other talks would be in the fashions that works really well So a university or an institution like it would work very well And and it would make the Bomb or for fakie or and or for show to make it there a lot easier because they wouldn't have trouble to do it Yeah, yeah Cool, yeah, especially easy for her vacay in Toronto Yeah, I hadn't thought about the aspect of of international people getting in but that's a that's a really good point It's probably just easier to get into Canada than the US right now. I Have been detained once I would like that I'll add to that. I've I've traveled to Canada Several different times on business and I too have been detained Canada isn't as easy to get into As it might seem Yeah, I can also add my voice to the mix I think what um what was really excited me Paul and I heard you talking about this in the past episode was the idea of more of a retreat and less like a conference like when I think of conference I think the Marriott and I think of beige walls and I think of really badly designed signs and That Personally didn't excite me a ton, although I'd still definitely go but the idea of a retreat like a more communal living for a few days I think that for me at least the more exciting parts are sort of those Softer in-between moments when you're having breakfast with someone it's not necessarily the sessions That I usually find, you know after something like that that had the most influence It's just the people and just getting to spend time around a fire pit under the stars talking about this stuff in a very organic way So that's my take on it is I would love to see something sort of in that flavor Happen, you know, so maybe that you know, obviously there's there's some level to it where We want to probably also be careful for the first one We're not Too too optimistic about getting a stacked list of speakers because then that could sort of stall out the process nothing happens So we could sort of I talked to Cassidy about this but develop a minimum viable product like how many people? How soon like what's the smallest version of this that we think would still be worth doing and then do that as like a beta? Run and we'd probably learn a lot that we there's no way we'd really be able to find out without just trying it So yeah And and I really like what you say there Ryan and my sister actually has a YouTube channel where she does some videos about fixing up this property that she and her husband have and I can put that link in here and She would love the I think she has about a hundred subs or something and she would love the promotion she's always trying to get me to promote her her stuff, but But I I that's very much what I had in mind where it's it's communal living. It's relaxed. It's Conversations as they go and you know, I even I even sort of set up had an idea for a date I looked at you know Columbus Day weekend just to you know promote colonization and all those those sorts of things But but you know and especially with my sister's place. I mean it's something like that could be done Very in a very low-cost low-key way Because I mean for me I just you know, if I could get my expenses covered that would be great it's a chance to see my sister and my mother and You know drums up a little bit of business for my sister in terms of you know Some bed-and-breakfast lodging so on and so forth so and even on her property I mean some people if they wanted to have a lower rate that could camp and others and October is about perfect for for Connecticut in terms of colors and climate and all that stuff That's that's very similar to what I was thinking about Cool, but I also like the big ideas. Yeah. Yeah, let's do everything. I I think ultimately like trying to get out Sorry get out a survey would be helpful to see how many people are actually Like interested in this you don't want it to be this exclusive thing where it's like We're only gonna allow this many people whatever like and it's definitely good to start small But say you have a hundred people really interested in that you're not gonna find you know like if you did like an Airbnb or The RBO you're not gonna find an animal but like that's that's something when you're planning it you want to have an idea of okay Well, who are we actually planning for who would actually come to something like this? And Sort of you know starting small I was thinking it might even make sense to think the first one instead of going big saying we're gonna go to some other state that none of us live in and You know stay in this hotel like starting local so like you're in Sacramento Maybe even trying to like and I don't know Your church would let you so that trying to do something smaller there you can see okay What's there and not you know letting other people say okay? You're just paying a like a ticket to cover the cost of what this goes to you know Run this and you got to deal with your own you know Lodging and food and everything and maybe there's something you can have a couple meals or something But makes it easier on our end to understand that instead of saying oh, we're gonna do this big all-inclusive thing where we're doing a retreat which it sounds really nice, but What are people actually gonna pay for Yeah, and I said Cassidy needs a better internet connection Oh, I'm sorry But no I agree and that was so I actually had kind of multiple scenarios in mind and so for a long time I've been thinking about What is I've talked to my meetup group about this too in terms of what is a local type event that we could do that would be different from You know what would be different? From You know what we're doing now, and and we're actually I'm talking to there's an Orthodox Church that some of the people are coming to the meetup through and And the Orthodox Church is talking about you know well Maybe we could get Jonathan Peugeot out for Holy Week And then if Jonathan comes out here, then you know we might do something Jonathan and I might do something joint Benjamin Boyce was down and he came to a meetup So I'm kind of toying with that, but I really like that idea to something That's fairly simple with the church the churches that mean if I'd say I want to use the room. They'd say okay That doesn't I don't even ask half the time I didn't ask to do the start the this any of this so they just kind of like that pastors okay It's probably nothing wrong At least so far they still trust me so I think it's a great idea Cassidy Yeah, when when job, and I were talking about this a little bit after Mine and your conversation Paul where you know we first I guess aired this crazy idea I? Was thinking about it more on a smaller scale, and you know I would I would be Overjoyed even if it was just a bunch of us You know weirdos who like to watch your videos all the time just everybody getting together somewhere It wouldn't even have to be big you know like it just well I'm not saying it wouldn't have to be big, but what I mean big I'm talking about like higher Status folks showing up which I would not be opposed to but I'm saying it wouldn't have to be that you know we've already discussed this a little bit, but Just even the idea and you know I've talked to some people like offline her in the comments too who would just be interested Yeah, just keep you know if something develops keep me posted I would be so down for being able you know to get together with the people you know that we talked to in the comments and the people who have all of you know these these conversations in common and and just being around this and so Even just the idea for me of all of us making a pilgrimage so to speak to Sacramento and just you know having a gigantic meetup that Last for a couple of days. You know it's just at that point About finding the space and where the best place to do that is See see I've got a candle I've got everything in this room. I wouldn't believe what I have in this room It all goes down I'm coming to this room I can live here for days we You have a cell phone stand I Sometimes do videos from the other from my main work computer instead of this nice Semi-clean corner for like at your office. You know is a mess But anyway, I guess the I agree with you. I think a survey would be a good start I mean like I'm not gonna fly all the way to the US Yeah, I think I Don't know what else to do to really do at this point I think we otherwise kind of agree on what we want which people we want to involve Or am I missing something? Well like I said there's there's lots of layers we could do and I even thought of you know I even thought of just saying okay. I'm gonna be at this address And if you want to get a room you can get a room I'm gonna be there that weekend and if you want to hang out and if ten people show up then you know I could always you know something like that could happen. I really like the Sacramento idea of saying okay We're gonna do this tiny little thing But I think especially if it's a thing that people are gonna fly in for they probably kind of want to have an idea of What is the thing and some expectations? yeah, I've been on the organizing part of some developer conferences and I mean you can't just have this expectation. You sort of expect a lanyard and a goody bag Yeah, each goody bag contains a beard hair from Paul VanderKlaay Oh Honestly, I would expect that people would assume some sort of organized Definitely yep, so you're gonna Google Doc Ryan you getting all this down Being recorded too, so that's yeah, what are what are some next steps here? Ah the survey Already, I think it's just data mining right now right just like finding out from the audience like are we delusional would it just be us five? Which has already like over a hundred members would be a great Yep Yep, definitely definitely put something out on the discord server And I know you know I didn't we don't have Joey or Rick or any of the guys from the local meetup here But I know some of them would be would be down for that. I mean if it was in Sacramento Sacramento is easy because we're sort of building on the meetup the meetup the meetup list has about 180 people on it So of that hundred eighty people, you know a good number could show I'm talking to so in Canada there was a film on CBC about Jordan Peterson I've been talking to the producers of that film and I'm working with him and perhaps September we might do a screening of it or I'm helping him maybe find a way to do a screening in the Bay Area So there's there's some of these little things in the works but you know I I you know I very much agree with Ryan I I want to do lots. I want to do different kinds of events, but I really am excited about kind of a relaxed intimate in a nice setting Conversation for people that people can and and those are you know to me those are fairly smallish things Hmm I think yes, I think the next step is gather information and then sort of collectively develop a sort of a treatment as far as the The theme like what sort of the guiding ethos of this event is it it seems more like community rather than a class, right? it's not like when I think of traditional conference, I think a lot of like networking and Like overt education right like going to seminars breakout sessions, but this could be something that is more Free flowing etc. So I think that once we get that information then we can sort of work to Articulate like what is our guiding light behind this because I think it could go in a million directions very easily and feel jumbled very quickly if anything goes Yeah, I mean the disk book server currently shows that that like it goes from politics to science to religion to Philosophy and it just goes everywhere. So I mean if we're gonna do breakout session, I would at least have Predefined or suggested Subjects like okay, let's talk about this. Let's talk about that with some statements Like what do we feel about this this this this and that we can take items from things Paul has said JP has said the fakie has said and Maybe maybe some breakout sessions in combinations with a few speakers I Mean you see how hungry people are Maybe maybe in terms of language we differentiate conference from retreat so Ryan's talking about a retreat. Yeah, Robes talking about a conference and I think there's differences in approach differences and expectation differences in scale Yeah, but when I hear retreat I think shirtless volleyball Vanderklae I Write it down But I but but I think you're right job and that there's there's some people that are not gonna want to do a retreat It's just a little too shirtless volleyball Do a retreat and Frankly again, I like I like both ideas that but Cassidy's no Cassidy's The idea and and question about exclusivity and very sensitive to that and so, you know again people are always like Well, this is going to get big and it's like I don't really look forward to that bigness because it's nice Small things are nice and big things happen and there's some things have to be big but small things are nice And so I do like retreats with with or without shirtless volleyball and washing dishes together and sitting around Fire pit under the stars. I mean that's very much my sister's place. So Yeah Yeah, that's just it I mean you could fit 10 12 15 people other if they were staying at other places You go to go up to 20 30, but you wouldn't want that to go much past 30 and it would be like a weekend and You have some things that are sent kind of semi-structured and other things that are less structured I Think of a library a little bit. Yeah, we know how they have Few hours and then unstructured time together that that's sort of flow Right Cassidy you were gonna say something Yeah, we had looked at some VR bo's that were in the Sacramento area and there were some that Could sleep like 20 people and then there was some that was like 40, but there's only like 25 beds So depending on how close you I But there's also ways because what the Mission trip that I went on recently. We just rented several different Like houses and you had different people located in different ones and then we'd all meet up at certain houses at certain times Now with some of these if you do something like that there's an event fee so that adds the Cost of you know, that's just something we need to be aware of too. I Think you could probably get 20 to 30 people who would be Down to do that, but I guess it would just be able to say, okay Let's let's actually see who Would be willing to pay for that and then you know I think to the idea of a conference or like even a convention because I sort of think it see it like something like VidCon where you have like You know No different thing and they have different events or whatever now that's like a huge thing really big scale but if you do something a little bit smaller where you have, you know panels or You know people who have followings and they promote it and then more people are gonna be interested in that you just have a bigger Spectrum people but you would need something less retreat like you'd need something that's more Structured and you have different events or different rooms that have different things going on in a schedule And then you can still have those breakout sessions and then people don't have to go But all these events they people you know, like with your channel it's sort of different because you have all these conversations with random people and We all know each other but don't know each other all at the same time So like the idea of being able to go and meet people that's interesting for people who are interested in the conversations like I am Like I don't Care much about the whole Jordan Peterson thing that I enjoy You know hearing people's thoughts and you know getting to be able to talk to people through that so it's just I guess it just Depends on what people a lot more people interested in Something where you have multiple personalities where it is more structured than something like a retreat But I do like the retreat idea because I think that's really cool Hmm and that um that VRBO cleaning people is that like five or six thousand dollar cleaning fee Yeah, it's based on like amount of people so the more people you have in there the less per person but not by much because the Clean if you just goes in yeah Yeah, I'm assuming Paul's connection and Connecticut wouldn't have such a harsh cleaning fee But that's just the bigger places I think if you had Smaller houses that were closer together It's it's just gonna be like a regular Airbnb rental as opposed to this huge place where everybody's And then all together but many of where and all of that We did a we did a pastor's retreat in Sutter Creek, which is a it which is a foothills Community not very far from Sacramento is about 45 minutes from here. We used Hotel Sutter I think it was and it was a small there's there's a lot of these little small hotels in the foothills and And these you can do you can do things they're almost year-round the weather is very mild usually the prices are very reasonable and You can have you know one of those little hotels might have ten or twelve rooms and then they'll have a communal space and and When we did it for you know, we did for the pastor retreat. It was it was quite reasonable So I like the VRBO thing The thing is people have to have to do a little bit more housekeeping if you're using kind of a small hotel Then you know, it's people you don't have to you don't have to share a bed with job You can get your own room and your own Bathroom and you know if you want to spend a little bit more you can get a little nicer Accommodation if you if you say ah being job, we're gonna do it on the cheap then, you know, so on and so forth so What sort of options do we have regarding I mean this is such a niche thing that I wonder Can we get money from churches Oh Actually, that's a good point That we might be able to get some money for something like this at least some seed money for a conference I I could probably There might be some funding from my classes that would be interested in something like this Once you get fun, once you get funding from a church there. There are also certain expectations about About some things that churches can be fairly loose, but it's not completely without strings Honestly, I mean with jokes aside it would be interesting to see if we could have sponsors Because this is when I'm a technology sphere We're in some weird philosophy religion meaning area where So maybe that's just not not viable Maybe we'll just have to have people pay an entry fee Which we finance things Long term I can think of You know if someone wanted to work on grant writing This is something that hadn't even thought of throughout this whole thing, but there are there are organizations that Could be open to grant writing proposals for this type of thing That's a much longer term picture But when I think about the kinds of grants that the Christian Reformed Church gets for various things The Calvin College gets for various things there are organizations out there I think that would probably be interested in this and hopefully not scared away by I mean some of the denominational thing what things quite frankly my association with Jordan Peterson just You know people just back up And it's just the way it is and I'm not gonna let that stop me But it does it does impact going out and getting funds Okay in any case I got a run in about five minutes Is there anything else we need to discuss I mean I think as far as the survey goes Great for a start and we can offer like both options like what will you be interested in and do you have any? Yeah We can we can post this video and then put a link to the survey vehicle What would be a good survey vehicle for something like this survey monkey or anybody some of you might? Play form is really good Okay Yeah, yep, we could maybe collectively email back and forth and I can put together the actual survey link But yeah, it's pretty easy to put together and we can say like a be preference or Yeah, we can we can work offline figure out what questions are actually useful to learn about but Yeah, I think I think that the surveys will tell us a lot and we'll talk more about it, you know As we put it together, I'm happy to be involved in that but I just I just had the thought Paul just to I guess to summarize things about the survey, but just One other thing when you mentioned, you know the the the two different categories that we're talking about either kind of a retreat format versus the The conference format. I just wonder if there's also some kind of hybrid of those two That could somehow exist and you know, I think we've been talking about that a little bit in this But I just I just like to think more about that idea and what that would look like That sounds I I mean you can do a conference and a retreat They're sort of back-to-back and the people who really want to stay long I mean in some ways even with the Jordan Peterson events and the VIP and though the VIP things are not great That's kind of what you have So you have the the main thing and then you have the little more little bit more intimate setting But you know and especially I just wanted to something that's a hybrid sorry no, go ahead If you wanted to do something that's a hybrid you could even have different packages. It's like, okay So here's just like a day past the conference. Here's a three-day pass now. Here's a three-day class plus retreat You know, there's different ways you can do it. It just depends on How many people are really gonna be interested in the conference? Retreat, you know, there's different ways you can do it. It just depends on How many people are really gonna be interested in that you want to make sure that you're not? Having all of this room for all these people and 20 people show up As far as sponsorship That's I think it's your time getting Sponsorships for a conference sort of thing then like a retreat not that I don't think maybe you could but I just feel that that's That's That's something that a business or an organization is gonna want to sponsor more than just like a 20-person thing and we I One of the comedy festivals we I work for is a nonprofit so as far as grant writing and I don't know all the details about this, but there are some restrictions like you have to Be Eligible for a lot of grants. So that's something that you need to think about as far as grants and We also just reach out to local businesses because we run a festival and Flagstaff, which is a small town and Businesses see it as advertising. So oh you're gonna have all these people here Well, maybe they'll come to my business if you have some sort of discount or some sort of thing for that And they'll be willing to you know, pay for ads or something on you know What's going on Think the sponsorship definitely seems to line up more with the conference I feel like sponsorship for the retreat probably is not necessary Because if we can source a place cheap I feel like but also the the culture of a retreat is probably not very conducive to corporate sponsors either Like if you have an Arby's sign in the background behind the red lobster I Got a bail people I really enjoyed Exciting we might be on the start of something amazing You guys go and talk about me behind my back and I'll see the video afterwards Okay So any I like the way this is this is shaping up So we're gonna get a survey tool that we can I got I got a homeless people. I got deacons. I got all kinds of things going on here So we're gonna do a survey tool we can link that to this when we post it we can have we can talk about retreat We can talk about conference. We can talk about hybrid And anything else we need to put on the table No, I think that's it keep it simple one step at a time and Then we can we can always reconvene after Survey stuff comes in That the only one other thing that I can think of that would potentially go on a survey is like a location like regional Preference that I don't know if that would I don't know people would just naturally say naturally say oh, yeah whatever is closest to me, but I'd just be curious to see if if like interest aggregates around a particular area I Think I think also for different I mean retreats for me are I mean like I said I you know, how many want to go Columbus Day weekend to Connecticut. I mean, I only need you know Hardly any to make it worthwhile. Maybe I'll just do it myself But if you're talking, you know a conference or something then I you know, Job's idea of Toronto makes a lot of sense So But yeah, I think that's a good thing to have people maybe on the survey You know what how many people in what areas of the world are are interested in? You know West Coast Sacramento Sacramento is fairly easy to get to from lots of places Connecticut a little bit tougher you can get you can get there from New York and get there from Boston But there's a lot of people high concentration of population on the East Coast. I mean Texas obviously Toronto or I did a conference in Australia last year, so And that had about 50 people come to it Hmm. I think yeah I think people be more likely to fly international for the conference like job was saying to Yeah, and imagine someone would drop a thousand bucks on a flight ticket just for you know, hang it out for a weekend But so I think that's a smart idea to focus on Cities like Toronto where our ask for higher status speakers will be easier for them to say yes on right? Yeah, yeah Cool any last things I Would just say if we're thinking about doing something in Canada that has a whole nother Element of the business side of what that means to do business across a border Across a border so that's just something you need to think about and as far as like trying to get Jordan Peterson to come you're gonna have to pay for Jordan Peterson. He's not That into what the cost now, of course if you get Jordan Peterson to come there's gonna be a much higher interest in it like that because he just has such a big following and People are gonna be willing to pay to hear him speak But that's just something you have to think about Well, and my thinking isn't I think if Peterson's gonna do anything it's gonna be Peterson people that do it My thinking is is much more. I mean John Verveke. He seems very open to conversation Jonathan Pichot does part of me Actually Peterson brings his own complications to something like this. Yeah, and Some of those complications I That those complications are beyond us a lot of this stuff that gets You know connected with him and I'm not looking at frankly. I'm not looking to go near much of that at all frankly well, and I was and I was sort of thinking that Although I feel like you need to rename it because it's not it's not just Jordan Peterson and something different, right? And lobster con has that Jordan Peterson connotation That's not what I see your channel as And if it's based out of what you're doing, I think you're doing something different You talk about Jordan Peterson a lot, but you talk about a lot of different things and you bring a lot of different people So I feel like it could be something else to Peterson I think the I think long term at least right now. It looks like meaning crisis as a marker is Is a little bit more of what we're actually dealing with than just Peterson per se and under meaning crisis You can go to And that you know, I think broadens the conversation and also gets the focus away from Some of the social and political stuff that that tends to get Peterson all the attention Yeah I think that's the focus And I think that's the focus and I think that's the focus that's the focus that's the focus on the conversation Yeah All right, I really have to land the plane here too so So we'll talk on email. We'll get together a survey instrument And we won't post this until we have that survey instrument so people can Go there to it. Also people can find the discord server, which is doing very well And maybe Joey will give us a little hashtag under there where we can start Chatting with this there, too I'm excited. Yeah, and I just want to say is really good to talk to everybody I know Paul you're the only one besides job that I've talked to so it's good It's good to get to talk and and just this one last point You know the heartbeat of this to me is for all of us who have this common Who have Paul in common and and have all of this framework to be able to actually meet and connect with each other in person I think that's the focus In person I think that's that's just that's a really big thing for me. Yeah, and I think that will be true of most people So, all right, all right. Thanks. Thank you all and as Freddy says we'll see you on the flip side Bye
