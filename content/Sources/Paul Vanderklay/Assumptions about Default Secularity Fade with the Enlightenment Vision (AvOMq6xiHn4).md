 Hi, this is Paul. Time to get back into making videos. Just a lot of things to do when I get back. Someone left a message on Twitter about still no slots for randos conversations. More will open up in September, I'm sure. I've got to get the meetup back up and running, and there's a lot of Living Stones things. There's always a lot of conversations with people that when I'm gone for three weeks, pastors do a lot of maintenance conversations with people, where people just need to sit down and talk for a half hour or so and get things off their chest and get their heads right so they can go on with life. Pastors do a lot of that kind of thing. With the randos conversations, you see me do a lot of listening, and that's what you do as a pastor. Often you do a lot of listening. People tell you their stories, their troubles, and there's no answers for most of them. There's not a lot of answers for many of them. Sometimes there are obvious answers, but the people simply don't want to do it for whatever reason. You sit and listen to someone chew on the same problem year after year after year. You might have told them five years ago what they should do, and it's probably the most obvious advice you could imagine. Remember seeing that video with the nail in the head? A lot of that thing. Anyway, back to some of the things that I've been thinking about during my vacation, and we'll see how they spill out as we go. I should probably finish up the Verveke Peterson conversation, and I was digging into some Ian McGillchrist on my vacation too, so I've got some thoughts about that. But wandering through national parks, didn't see a lot of wildlife. I managed to hit quite a few national parks on my trip. I was in Yellowstone, I was in Glacier, I was in Olympic. So those are three pretty major. Unfortunately, Glacier was smoky, and so Glacier, which has just beautiful vistas, there was a lot of fog. So it's kind of disappointing, but I didn't see a tremendous amount of wildlife. Some bear, I'm pretty accustomed to seeing bear, Yellowstone, or Yosemite is the park I frequent most, and especially before they got the bear situation under control in Yosemite. Bears were fairly, running with bears was a fairly common thing. This picture of a deer was right in the parking lot at, it wasn't at Glacier, it was, what park was that? Oh, it was at Olympic, and it was Olympic National Park, and it was right over, by the visitor center. Here's the deer just munching. Rationality rules often addresses people as apes, because I looked at the Rebel Wisdom Books That Matter video, YouTube served up for me this Chris Williamson, 10 Books That Changed My Life, and of course I saw the ape that understood the universe, and it's like, C.S. Lewis of course in The Abolition of Man talks about trousered apes, and men without chests. We are a very strange creature, and I want to do a video like that about this, because I've been thinking, I've been, a lot of my monologue videos are just trying to develop language about some things, and you know for that reason a lot of the Vervecki stuff, and the Peterson stuff is helpful, because I can sort of leverage their language, and you know language is always meant to be used in community, and we always, we seem to have enough of a little community to begin to understand each other's languages, and to figure this stuff out. You know we are, we are very strange creatures indeed, so I was staying in an Airbnb right on Puget Sound, and there was a lagoon, and in this lagoon, the lagoon was just full of these tiny little crabs, and it was, it was often really fascinating to just sit and watch these little crabs go to work, and I took some video of it that I posted on Twitter, and maybe I'll play a little of that video now. So in that recent Vervecki Rebel Wisdom video, there was a, about an hour through, Sam, Sam sent me a note, and I've heard the door. I'm waiting for the fire extinguisher guys today, it's part of the little jobs I've got to do. Part of what you do with as a pastor is people don't know how to live, and well that's strange, because this crab knows how to live, and this crab scurries around this lagoon, and you know uses his little claws to pick up little things to put in his mouth, and in a minute he's going to try and scurry under this shell, and there's already another crab under this shell, and the shell, the crab's like, hey get out of here, this is my shell, and you know back and forth they go, and you know this, this crab is, is only about this big, and as I said, this lagoon is just full of them, but this crab has no problem knowing how to live. The deer have no problem knowing how to live, the bear have no problem knowing how to live, until of course they, they do, and well part of why we as human beings are so unique is we're just so simply adaptive, and this little crab, and this little lagoon just off Puget Sound needs an extremely specific environment in order to know how to live, but the knowledge of obviously of how this crab knows how to live is not, now this is where we get into this whole business of consciousness and knowledge, you know the, the crab, and the deer, and the bear can't fill out our surveys, and so we, we don't know what consciousness is like for them, they certainly have a brand of consciousness, or a level of consciousness, but not like our consciousness, and they don't abstract, and they don't have, this is sort of today as I was thinking about this video, they don't have what, what I'll call just vision for lack of a better word, and I'll have to, have to get into defining that. Brett Weinstein in his conversation on Unbelievable had a good, had a good talk with Alastair McGrath, and Brett nicely sort of laid out in a short way succinctly how we as human beings have these two tracks, we have the one biological track that is in many ways connected to the crab, and the deer, and the bear, but then we have this other track, and there are lots of different ways of, of articulating that, and for the sake of this video let's just call it the culture track, and often in my videos I talk about how we absorb these first draft maps of how to live out there in the world, we absorb them from our parents, and if you remember the, the earlier iteration of the Berenstein Bears, not the more populous one when Papa Bear would teach the young, the young boy bear how not to do things, because the father would try and do things, and they'd go wrong, and you know this is how not to do things, I remember my father always found those, those Berenstein Bear books quite funny as he read those to us as, as I was a child, but we, so we watch our surroundings and especially other people, but then we live by, again we live by vision, and vision, why am I using that word, desires, these, somehow you know the little crabs, you know they want to eat, and they have instinct, and they're doing all of these things, but, but we have visions of, of who we could be, or how we could be transformed, or, or how things would change, you know an ape that, Chris Williamson has a little quote when he has these 10 books, and so I just listened to the one book that had the title that seemed to relate, evolutionary, evolutionary psychology is the closest you're going to get at peering under the hood of your own behavior and discovering why you do the things that you do. So one of the books I read while, mostly while I was in Washington, watching the little crabs was Tom Holland's Dynasty, and it's a, it's a fun read, I had listened to parts of it on audiobook, but because I just basically had downtime, I could sit there with a, well not a real book, it's on my Kindle, but I could sit there on my Kindle and go through, go through Tom's book, and you know it's, it's quintessential Tom Holland, it's, it's well written, it's, the dude certainly knows how to turn a phrase, and, and as I was reading the book, I was thinking about how even this whole process of what was going on, where Tom Holland reads primary sources, you know, in Latin, Tacitus, Suetonius, and, and reads other contemporary scholars to try to, modern history tries to get at what happened, and what, by what happened we mean some particular correlation, some, some correlation in, in Euclidean geometry of time and space with visible actions, and so on, and so on, did this and that, but obviously you can't tell a human story like that, you have to get into motivations and desires, and so, you know, from Julius Caesar all the way to Nero, he tells the story of this dynasty, and, and even just the, even, even just the ability to tell a story, so I've got all of this stuff from the last few years rolling around in my head, part of it, you know, sitting in another one of the things that I listened to quite a bit on my vacation was Christine Hayes's lectures on the Old Testament, and a lot of what is sort of riddled, so what, a lot of what riddles modern Old Testament biblical scholarship are all of these questions that fascinate modernistic biblical studies about, well, we want correlations in Euclidean time and space of who did what, but really that's, that's sort of modernity trying to get a handle on the far bigger questions of the world, because what someone did and didn't do obviously matters, but we as very strange creatures are very much interested in why they did it, and what they did it for, and what they were thinking, because in this way we sort of enter into a participation in the story, as, as he was, as he was telling the stories I was thinking about, again, you know, what exactly are we doing? Part of what makes Tom Holland so fun to read is that he translates their world into our colloquial, colloquialisms, he translates their world into frameworks that we can understand, now this is, Dynasty is one of his earlier books, he wasn't paying, I would have, I would have liked to have read, and for that reason I should probably go to the primary sources, but if you've read primary sources of ancient history you know that they're harder to read because they're speaking not only from their own world, but their world is a great distance for ours, so what Tom Holland does with a story like this, or I also, you know, did a little bit more reading in his translation of Herodotus, where he does some of that as well, and again as a preacher I'm sort of halfway between doing what Tom Holland did to Herodotus and doing what Tom Holland did in Dynasty, and in fact I go a little beyond that because in many ways being a preacher I apply it to people's lives. So there's definitely a relevance realization layer there where Tom Holland tries to retell a story, and of course this family ruled the world as they said, and what on earth that means, they didn't rule the weather, they didn't rule the, the Americas, you know, what in fact, what in fact did they rule when they were ruling it, but yet this is a story that is intelligible to us and of interest to us, and we can look for patterns in it, and we try to derive something from, for our lives from the patterns that was happening in the telling of these men's lives, and of course it has to be compressed down into something that I can read in, you know, four or five days while playing board games with the family and studying little crabs and a little lagoon just by Puget Sound. I mean that's really what vacations are for aren't they? And it's a rather remarkable family, remarkable in so many different ways, a family that in many ways is suicidal because by the time Nero dies of course all the possible legitimate heirs have either died of natural causes or natural causes. Why are they choking? Could have they, could they have been poisoned? Or the Praetorian Guard taking them out and slaughtered them, and what's interesting of course Julius Caesar establishes the dynasty and Tom Holland tells the story well, but Rome had this tradition of their not being a king, and as Julius Caesar sort of slips into the role of being a king, he sort of energizes all of the stuff in Roman culture that said that remembered the tyrants and getting rid of the kings and having a republic and their their vast system of government by which you know one sole leader couldn't be trusted, and of course Julius Caesar's inability or unwillingness to mask the way he in fact had become by force the king of their world led to his assassination, and his adopted son Octavius of course then slips into the role, another power struggle, and is able to you know first defeat rivals at Pompeii and a little bit later to put down and and look you know make sure that Mark Antony is destroyed and Cleopatra as well so that the pox romana which wasn't really all that peaceful could commence, Tom Holland nicely tells the story of basically how Caesar Augustus manages to maintain a charade before the senate when everybody knows what's going on, everybody knows he's a king or an emperor except by name, and this whole charade that goes on and on and on where well he doesn't have any formal power but they're always giving him all of this power and they all sort of do this because they know that civil wars are messy and bloody and and tremendously costly to everyone who's invested in in all of this wealth and status and power and they just want to keep the game going but in order to do that there's this entire world of thought that has to be maintained and again to our knowledge there's no other animal that that does anything like this in any way that we do where there's all these traditions where Rome can't have a king and all of these traditions where where Julius or Augustus Caesar asks well you know they keep bestowing on him these these titles father of the country and you know just title after title and they give his wife title and more and more power he gets but all the time he and the senate just sort of acting in this way like well it's really the senate that's ruling the country and everybody in the country knows it isn't but as long as they sort of maintain things up there in the ideaverse as long as everybody's sort of able to maintain this vision of what's going on of course some some threats come around and see and Augustus is is good enough at making sure that they don't become that they don't become a problem and so of course he has to you know has to bring Tiberius in and of course they're all dealing with bloodlines the Claudian through Livia and and and Tiberius marries Augustus's daughter but Julia is you know it's it's you know it's it's the kind of thing that someone would hardly dare write in a soap opera because it's it's hardly believable if it weren't true but again the thing that keeps it going is is not just certainly the physicality the realm in which a deer or a bear or a crab would operate it's all of the stuff it's all of the names it's all of the titles that's the stuff that's really moving the world that's this because they mean these emperors are are have enormous power but that power isn't in their arms where does that power lie it's it's similar to the question uh Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris were asking about Elvis's guitar or Elton John's water glass where exactly is that it's it's it's in the story verse it's in the idea verse it's in the area of vision Caesar Augustus had a vision for how he could in a sense inherit Julius Caesar's emperorship without letting anyone say it's an emperor I mean talk about the emperor has no clothes the emperor has all the power and and everybody's just playing along with the charade for for reasons that if you had to have them sit down and explain it they couldn't do it but yet they all know what they're doing at certain levels even if they can't articulate it and that's how we live that's how we run all of these things just visions and ideas of who we want to become and how the world should be situated and we we manifest that those things into the world when we rearrange the furniture when we get a new job when we when we decide to sit down and make a video when we make a sermon when we have an argument with our spouse when we yell at the homeless guy outside the door when we get frustrated in traffic because we had this vision of sailing down and arriving on time and on and on and on and on and this is the stuff that that that completely dominates our lives but but what is it and where is it I listed here the the Julio-Claudian dynasty and it's it's very interesting because Julius Caesar of course establishes that and when his grasp on power is a little too naked for for for the Roman idea verse you know Brutus on the ides of marx famously takes his life and leading into another civil war and another another power struggle and and Caesar Augustus Octavius takes over and and manages to rule for a very very long time but always because he and the senators you know he's maintaining this story and again is story the right word it's kind of the best word we've got he's maintaining this drama he's maintaining this narrative he's maintaining this culture around the senate to keep the whole thing going and you know one of the most successful generals was Tiberius who is you know he's livia's son and then marries Augustus's daughter and other heirs manage to die or are poisoned or you know life expectancy I mean it's it's complicated back then so so he manages inheriting it but he doesn't really want governing but he sort of wants it and he keeps it but but he sort of maintains his his stepfather's legacy of you got to keep the senators happy and you know all sorts of other things going on of course but he manages to maintain the charade at least to a degree but with each successive generation it's it's harder and harder to maintain the charade and and Caligula who was born into all of this is one of the few heirs around that he can stomach so he has Caligula out in his island doing all of the crazy sex dramas that this bored paranoid Caesar is this is the Caesar that was Caesar during Jesus reign Caligula of course is raised in that and he you know Tiberius is ill and Caligula comes out and he's emperor oh this young man and now what's interesting is you have Julius Caesar of course founds the dynasty Caesar Augustus is an old man Tiberius is an old man Claudius had all of these disabilities that probably the only reason he lived was because nobody imagined he could ever be he could ever ascend the Kabuki throne that is going on and so he somehow survives all of the bloodbaths and the killings and the exiles and and all of those things but when Caligula's rule is is just chaotic because Caligula sees the the farce of all of this not being king and just is just embraces the naked power in all sorts of crazy ways well the Praetorian guard who have bit by bit by bit gained more and more power well they murder Caligula and Claudius takes over and Claudius in a sense resumes the old show of Caesar Augustus and Tiberius but of course it's waning and waning and waning that story verse that that universe is sort of melting away and then we don't know for sure but Claudius perhaps gets dispatched by Nero's mother who who wants him in power and then of course Nero and has all sorts of mommy issues and it's a great story where where Nero how Nero kills his mother and and he too like Caligula are is just young and so he's he's not about to maintain the charade and it's all about him so he's got a vision of how it can be and nothing's going to get in his way and he sort of runs rough shot over the vision of everyone else until of course again the Praetorian guard have had enough because they see that the center isn't holding and so young Nero flees for his life with his wife who is actually a eunuch who was castrated as a boy in order to continue to look like and in some ways manifest the wife that he loved so well but accidentally killed when he got home one night and kicked her in her pregnant stomach again read the book I mean it's an amazing story well told and many have tried to tell the story over the years and and few do it better than Tom Holland but what's going on what's strange how do we live well how did these people live and if you read a story like that you have a sense of how they lived but of course it's even that is this massively compressed story down into digestible relatable chunks to us that we can take it in and and find meaning in it and and apply it to our world because of course in in the telling of a story like that there's so much information to deal with and and and I bump into that from time to time again I've been listening to the rise and fall of Mars Hill and all the talk about social media and internet and well obviously to tell the story of the Julio Claudian dynasty you have to distill all of the information from really just very few sources and paint a picture and give it to us and is that picture true to reality well Tom Holland did his best but the reality was what it was and it's 2 000 years ago and it's not terribly accessible to us but even the reality now is there's just so much information to deal with and whenever I hear somebody say something like that I think about the fact that well if you go into the woods or if you're sitting along a a lagoon on Puget Sound you turn off the internet and you turn off the podcast and you turn off all of that and you just sit and you ponder a crab is there any less information what exactly is this information that we're talking about our eyes and our our ears permit in a sense the same data rate or the same baud rate so whether I'm sitting at a lagoon on Puget Sound watching the little crabs do their thing or I'm sitting in front of a browser and you know streaming through my feeds why do we imagine that there's so much more information what do we mean by this there's there clearly is something different about let's call it the natural data in the pond and the people data now again go back to Jordan Peterson's first conversation with Sam Harris we have this massive compression engine and again all of the cognitive science we have this massive compression engine to filter everything down into usable amounts of course pragmatism gets into this and and and but but there's but we notice something different about the people data versus the natural data at the beginning of guns germs and steel you know that that book gets launched because Jared Diamond is talking to someone who's lived their whole life on Papa New Guinea and he asked Jared Diamond why you white people have so much cargo of course that's all situated in a cultural context but that of course launches Jared Diamond on this this question about well why and and you know looking at because Jared Diamond had spent a lot of time with people who have lived their whole lives on Papa New Guinea who who knew the jungle and knew it well and and in some ways their memory is so much better than ours they could sit down and they could list list list list but again this what do you mean their memory is better than ours their memory is focused on certain things and of course there's relevance realization if you're living in a jungle you know that and and so you learn that and of course even in this little lagoon off Puget Sound there's there's enormous complexity but this people data seems well it's sort of like the difference between raw and compressed in photography what I mean by that well if you've got a camera of any kind of quality or a certain level of quality you can take photos in raw well what do you mean by that well they take they take way more room on your on your chip and well if it's not compressed like a jpeg if it's not compressed well then you can manipulate it more and so photographers like that because they'll they'll get one picture that they really liked and then they'll manipulate it and they'll they'll turn it into but again what will they turn it into and what's driving them to turn it into something this is where we get into archetypes and questions of what is beauty and and all of this sort of thing because somehow bear and deer don't do this to the best of our knowledge we are strange and and so we we take this data and we people it we we we crunch it and we compress it and we manipulate it and we and we we create things that we say are unnatural even while all the time we say well we're just animals well then the product of us is is as natural as the product of you wouldn't look at bear scat and say it's unnatural because a bear funneled it through its digestive tract but you walk through the woods and you find a piece of you find a starbucks coffee cup you say well that's not natural well please tell me of this distinction because it seems to be one of the most important distinctions that we have there's something different about the natural data and the people data it's a it's a again using some more fancy vervekey words it's a transjective complexity that people have created where we've compressed and compressed and organized and organized and and somehow these these people data are compressed and full of meaning and we still compress them further and manipulate them and so when you let a you see a book like time travel and you see a book like time travel and Tom Holland's dynasty that's massively compressed people that were ruling the world and then you read about their lives and what they're like and it's like they can't even rule themselves much less the world or what in fact is ruling the world and this is where we get into principalities and powers because to read about the dynasty of the Julian Claudi the Julio Claudian dynasty is to read stories of people who I mean Caligula and Nero they're killed because they can't control themselves yet they're controlling the world I was reading some Josephus as well and you know reading about you know these kings on their missions to Rome in order to appear before Nero and just after you read dynasty and you're thinking you're appearing you're appearing before this guy this guy can't manage a relationship not much not much you know better manage the world but yet this has been growing and if you read dynasty you get a sense of the the cultural development that has continued and so well there's so much more interest in development that has continued and so well there's so much more information to deal with there's so much more people data to deal with which which we all know is somehow more meaningful some more deeply compressed as I said this is one of Tom Holland's earlier books I wonder if he would write it in the same way and I'd love to see him I'd love to sort of see a cross between Tom Holland and and and Neil Gaiman in terms of trying once again to reintegrate and I think this is this is part of where we're going because if we're going to reintegrate consciousness we're going to reintegrate other consciousnesses into the world and perhaps that's the nature of this people data and and the vast compression that is happening now of course the the Roman emperors the you know the first dynasty was was highly religious but that's our view of them they're just you know working with gods trying to become gods declaring you know waiting for the senate to declare someone a god what on earth do we mean by those words and this is where you know I think back I think back on looking at Plato's Republic and finding God in the singular and Plato's Republic and thinking well what exactly is Plato talking about the gods the kind of you know emperors becoming gods well that's that's not a there's certainly principalities and and and they certainly have developed spirits again back to school spirit they have developed spirits that were ruling the world or maybe other spirits were ruling through them we live by these visions we live by vision Augustus had a vision for how to stabilize Rome and its vassals the ambitions of others to possess it and to maintain the republic at the same time you know he had a bit of a crisis when one of the generals won a great victory Augustus was smart enough to know that's how he got power so how can he both at one hand he has to celebrate the victory because everyone sees that well the gods have given this other general success maybe maybe he would be a better god to manage the empire than Nero and what if he and are then certainly the Nero but then Augustus and what if he manages to inspire to inspire allegiance and loyalty in his troops and could he march his legions towards Rome and then we're back to the messy civil war era so figure out on a way to well should we throw him a triumph should we parade him through the city of Rome but if we do that we have to make sure that he doesn't shine brighter than Augustus and that that his light is is derivative of the the light of Augustus that has brought peace to the world as they said what an earth what an audacious claim especially when you look at whose blood was being shed in order to maintain this peace and often the blood of the innocents now he couldn't explicitly detail his vision it was too intuitive it too was too felt he he could maybe you know derive little bits of wisdom but he probably couldn't tell them to many people either because that would be sort of explaining and exposing what actually was happening so so he works from any intuitively manages it he part he participates in it that's a really key word if you don't have time to read McGillchrist's whole book you can read his little essay on the divided brain which is also on kindle and and McGillchrist opens the book with a quote from Owen Barfield how is it that the more able man becomes to manipulate the world to his advantage the less he can perceive any meaning in it this is a paradox that has often been noted and has sometimes been attributed to fundamental perversity a sort of a sort of pure cussedness in human nature the world has changed since philosopher Owen Barfield wrote these words 35 years ago and even just think about that sentence the world has changed well yeah it's changing every minute there's cars driving up and down flooring road i've got new ideas in my head i'm just that much a little older and closer to death i wore the pineapple shirt someone sent me a note and said i really like the pineapple shirt and asked me about it and there's a brand there's a label on it says Molokai so i bought it at a thrift shop my wife and i were looking for some crazy shirts because i was on vacation we were taking and and she said well you can do videos but you got to wear a crazy shirt i didn't wind up doing any videos but i found this shirt at the used clothing shop and Molokai what does that mean the world has changed but the paradox as he calls it has got no nearer to being resolved while the evidence has continued to accumulate that his hunch was right our increasing ability to manipulate the world does indeed appear somehow connected with its loss of meaning for us why and does it matter well think about that with respect to the the the romans and the little theater that augustus caesar was able to maintain so that neither he nor the senators could say you're the king i can't say that if you say that we'll have to kill you quite literally so he couldn't explicitly detail this vision that he was operating by and operating through and operating under but he participated in it and he couldn't explain it because to explain it would be in some ways to destroy it but not really because it keeps coming back the outcomes are of course interpreted remembered and recorded they wouldn't describe it as religious that of course is an invention of christian late christianity and secularity we look back and say oh those those sacrifices that that that the caesars were doing that that was the religious thing that they were doing and commanding the murder of children and grandchildren the exile of of daughters and wives and the increase and the subjugation of more and more germany or or britain these were the those were the secular things and of course the religious stuff but that's our distinction which lewis points out in miracles which tom holland points out that's our distinction they were thoroughly religious but didn't call it that as tom wright points out in his biography of paul judaism wasn't this thing of paul judaism wasn't this thing that it is for us this this idea judaism was a description of a way of life and this way of life was deeply connected with a world view for lack of a better word of of how the world should be and and how to get to a better world and and and and and and so traditionally religion has been the integrated management system of all of this again his quote evolutionary psychology is the closest you're going to get at peering under the hood of your own behavior and discovering why you do the things you do do that little statement doesn't seem to give much credence to the frame that the whole thing is dependent upon what is this you that you speak of in your story well there's an entire story connected to it and that entire story certainly is in one way or another connected or at least attributed to the physical world around us but it's a story evolution you don't discover it in the ground you don't find it in dinosaur bones it's an interpretive exercise around the dinosaur bones and watching the crabs and saying what way am i like the crabs well you're very different from the crabs and so well why do you want to know what you do why you do it maybe how you can do it differently you have this vision of a better world what is this preferred you that you are going to manage or somehow attain because as i've poked at often talking about what about brett weinstein isn't the you that is trying to manage yourself via your vision of evolutionary psychology just as much a product of the evolutionary psychology as the you you're trying to dismiss there's no escaping it and once you begin to really go down that road well you're going to have probably one heck of a meaning crisis and we've seen this played out in how many movies where robots become sentient and you know movies are always playing on this riff this anxiety we have that there's no ghost in the machine that we're just going through the motions that we're just naive dupes of mechanistic processes that go back millions of years or is there a secret sacred self down deep beneath or is it all just as constructed as the hood religion has been the integrated management system by which we decided how we should live what we want what our desires are what is the good what is the beautiful what is the attainable what is the moral what is the righteous throughout history that's that's been what religion is tom holland and dominic sandbrook just put out an episode on the enlightenment and it's what well worth your time to listen to because religion was the way that we did this but now as the story is told we have other ways of doing this now the darkness is gone and the light has come so once there was darkness and then there was light once human beings lived in a state of superstition and savagery enslaved by magic and the doctrines of the catholic church and then beginning in the salons of 18th century france a group of thinkers in wigs led them out into the light of reason science revolution and the guillotine that's the traditional that's that dominic that's the traditional explanation of the enlightenment anyway and i'm joined by my very own jean jacques russo a man of chile cerebral faith tom holland uh tom was that a fair description of the enlightenment do you think well you you you could almost have been describing the protestant reformation of course i could yes well i will go on to say when we were and and that's so important to notice because holland's right because there's an aspect of the protestant reformation that is exactly for that but it's a it's a transition of course in the protestant reformation from this of course it's all infused with vision but the medieval sacramental system by which the bread and the words and the manipulation and all of this is how we manage the world to then suddenly in protestantism its belief and it's very cerebral and it's and they are different or not well yes i i mean i mean i know that um i'm kind of nervous about what i'm about to say because i i know that um certain listeners to the podcast have begun the uh a drinking game in which huge amounts of alcohol have to be drunk if i mention christianity but essentially i drink no alcohol when i make these podcasts essentially the the mythology of the enlightenment yes that it's an emancipation not just from the catholic church but from christianity and religion full stop yes whereas i think that that is a myth and the reason that um you know i i point out that your description of the enlightenment could equally have applied to the protestant reformation and indeed with certain kind of provisos with how christianity saw itself against the context of pre-christian paganism yeah is that i think that um the enlightenment is best understood as a one of the great mutational processes in the history of christian europe now now it's really interesting because i i chose the word vision and so now we have enlightenment and and i just think a lot of this is this exaptation from it's all about seeing and of course in modernity the monarchical vision is all about seeing we see the world from no place and western thought tom i mean it's just it's bigger than just christian europe isn't it well i'm not sure about that um i mean that so them so what what what what christians do is to say that um there was darkness and then there was light the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light yeah and the darkness is equated with with with paganism and and of course the prologue to the gospel of john uh the gospel of john jesus is the light of the world i mean christians and jesus won't be the only people to use these words but why these words what the protestants do is to is to equate the darkness with you know the romish church potpourri and reformation is about bringing people into light it's about toppling superstition it's about banishing idols what the enlightenment does is to is to cast the whole sweep of christian history as the darkness and to essentially identify philosophy as the it's not you i see you waving at me i am now now this is where um maybe i can pull it up that you're you're watching the you're watching the youtube get made as i make it um um you know this this book club books that that changed my life and and john vervecki begins by he begins by again the story that he tells often where he was raised in a fundamentalist christian uh traumatized in many ways by this fundamentalist christian group that he was raised and traumatized by the you know by the by the eschatology by the eschatological thread of the rapture and all that went into that and so then as a as a young adult embraces you know eastern forms of spirituality and then he finds socrates and of course there's a great line that that that sam adams sent me to does the world have to be like such that it could be intelligible um and then um can you and i i'm not going to just try and dodge that is a problem or something like that but the idea that like i said you can appeal to potentially universal notions that human beings find intelligible contact with a deep reality just inherently good inherently desirable and they and and the work i've done on higher states of consciousness and onto normativity when people have that experience very powerful it is a it trumps they will they will change their lives and their identities here's this and again look at look what we're doing all this stuff out there someone watching them their reference to the three-dimensional physical world to say oh they didn't move oh but their life changed reliably and from by objective measures they get better in order to stay closer and in control by objective measures they get better and again all of those objective measures that we have all this these are all deeply embedded and all sorts of notions about what is the good formity to that that really real um now the interesting thing about that really real is it doesn't seem to have a distinct propositional content other than sort of vague notions of oneness and realness and things like that um and so for me i guess what i would try to say you're absolutely right the cognitive science can't give me the ethics and can't give me the meaning what it can do is legitimate a home but it could also be rendered consistent with a vision of a good life it can't deductive ah a vision of a good life a vision again back to that regenerate it but if we talked about pre-sub i can build back into my pre-supposition for doing my science into something that is much more comprehensively a vision of the good life then at least it i think that's in that's an intellectually respectable way in which i could link the science to the ethical or normative question yeah yeah that makes sense um okay last question then because i'm sure the audience um have questions too and i see lots in the chat um i i guess i like you um i'm well actually i'm not in academia anymore i was and i was interested in the idea of um trying to help people to flourish and not being embarrassed about that and again why would we be embarrassed about that well because we don't know how to live and then we have to admit we don't know how to live the deer knows how to live the crab knows how to live well one of the amazing things about that little lagoon off puget sound and one of the really lovely things about puget sound is it seems things seem to be flourishing there there were you know there were seals there were porpoises we didn't see any orca but the the the ecosystem of that little lagoon was just flourishing and we have the sense of flourishing were the were the roman emperors flourishing like philosophy is like you know how to flourish how to how to how to have a good life and and philosophy well again this transition because philosophy became this stale dry thing and now philosophy is how to live a good life when justin martyr you know found christianity becomes my philosophy and and basically augustin embraces christianity because it's it's better philosophy like and but um academic colleagues are very wary about that they say look that's not my job they've got students coming to them now there's a whole kind of mental health crisis among undergraduates and they're you know they're like look it's not i don't know how to make you happy i can teach you you know facts about epicurus or about stosas and stuff but it's not my job to to you know i i i'm not a you know a philosopher in that ancient sense you know um like epic tetus or something but clearly what we we've seen i guess you know since the 60s or even before people like abraham maslow there was something of the kind of rabbi about maslow right and he was a hugely popular figure in the 60s more this from dallas willard's the divine conspiracy i'm listening to to jules evans say this it immediately reminds me of of dallas willard who taught philosophy at usc that suspicion now has the force of unspoken dogma in the highest centers of western learning of course one has to assume in practice that there is a right side up just to get on with life we don't know how to live you have to at least assume there is a right side up in order for human beings to know how to live what strange creatures we are but it is equally assumed that right side up is not a subject of knowledge derrick bock is president of harvard university for many years and his president's report of 1986 through 87 how many years ago is that 45 boy makes me feel old he referred to some well-known moral failures in financial circles in the political life of the nation and he wondered out loud what universities might do to strengthen moral character in their graduates list in the 80s they had a sense of what do you mean by moral universities all over the place are really striving hard to be moral and finding that their moral system isn't internally coherent religious institutions he continued no longer seem as able as they once were to impart basic values to the young in these circumstances universities including harvard need to think hard think hard about what they can do to in the face of what many perceive as the widespread decline of ethical standards bock points out that in other days the instructor's aim was to foster a belief in a commonly accepted moral values now all has changed today's course in applied ethics does not seek to convey a set of moral truths but tries to encourage the students to think carefully about complex moral issues we want to try to figure out what to do with some extreme medical case and what the ethical thing but should i sleep with my girlfriend one sense that the the governing assumption of this discussion is that these two objectives are mutually exclusive the principal aim of the course bot continues is not to impart right answers but to make the students more perceptive in detecting ethical problems when they arise better acquainted with the best moral thought than was accumulated through the ages and more equipped to reason about the ethical issues they will face later he quoted carol gilligan to the effect that moral development in the college years thus centers on the shift from moral ideology to ethical responsibility one should not miss the point that bock puts right answers in queer quotes well that word sure has changed and that gilligan holds that what one has before college to be ideology that is irrational beliefs and attitudes they are faithfully expressed the accepted intellectual viewpoint on the common moral beliefs as if we have a common moral set of assumptions that guide ordinary as if ordinary is something that is found universal and everywhere human existence finally in coming to the conclusion of his report president bock remarks despite the importance of moral development in the individual student and society one cannot say that higher education has demonstrated a deep concern for the problem especially in large universities the subject is not treated as a serious responsibility worthy of sustained discussion and determined actions by the faculty and administration it may well be that the rise of woke in fact was there to address exactly what dallas willard was writing about when did he write this book in the early 90s then he goes on to tell a story robert cole's professor of psychiatry and and medical humanities at harvard and a well-known researcher and commenter on matters of social and moral published a piece the chronicle of higher education the disparity between the intellect and the character the pieces about the task of connecting intellect to character this task he says is daunting his essay was occasioned by an encounter with one of his students over them over the moral insensitivity it is hard for him to say immoral be is it um is it hard for him to say immoral behavior of other students some of the best and brightest at harvard the student was a young woman of a midwestern working class background where as is well known things like the right answers and ideology remain strong obviously using ideology in a different way than jordan peterson she cleaned students room to help her pay through the university again and again she reports to cole's people who were in classes with her classes on ethics treated her ungraciously because of her lower economic position without simple courtesy and respect and often were rude and sometimes cruel to her they must have gone to the same school as calligula and nero she was repeatedly propositioned for sex by one young student in particular as she went about her work he was he was a man with whom she had had two moral reasoning courses in which he excelled and received the highest of grades and of course crisis in church is all about the same thing churches don't seem to be necessarily performing that much better or are they do we know more than just a professor in in the last 10 years your colleague jordan peterson is is a kind of old testament prophet isn't he yeah well and he wants to be moses and i want to be socrates that's the difference between us yeah that's a great line because i'm conscious that some people won't know what the enlightenment was so i think you should you are the master of this you should give a 90 second overview of the dates some of the characters um what are we talking about here because the people you know even at the time they used the word enlightened a lot um so we're talking 18th century but there's never really been an agreed definition of where it where it happened or indeed when it happened no so it's incredibly difficult uh but one of the things about the enlightenment that does set it apart say from the reformation is that there were people living through it who identified it as as you know they the name the enlightenment comes from the 18th century yes um and and it's it's such a kind of mythologized period because essentially for for lots of people today the the enlightenment stands as the kind of fountainhead of their sense of their identity so the enlightenment is often equated with kind of good things that liberal people feel about themselves yeah the enlightenment values i i am a defender of enlightenment values it's generally it's yeah it's the sort of thing colonists say yes absolutely i think that to see the enlightenment and idw and to equate the enlightenment as it existed in the late 17th early and 18th century with you know modernity with the fruits of liberal secular democracy as we have it now is is simply wrong because i think it's much more complicated than that and the complexity of it is what makes it so slippery a subject to define well what you've done is very nicely you've you've you've basically refused to give the dates okay well i i would say now there's sort of a well an ongoing joke between these two and this podcast because they're both historians and every now and then they're they're called upon to give dates and they and they don't have them that um i would date it from 1660 i i would i would identify it with spinosa do you know tom which is a fascinating fascinating choice the date i had i have written down in my in my notes here 1660 1660 but i've written it down because the foundation of the royal society really that's also fascinating i another one of the really interesting books that i was working through and haven't finished the clockwork universe and um isaac newton the royal society because in this book he's he's got a lot of lovely really interesting descriptions of the kinds of things they did in the royal society and and so this enlightenment again there's a real frame thing it's there's a real as if so many things in modernity a self-forgetfulness it's like everything is seen but we're forgetting that we are the seers well that shows how much more cosmopolitan i am than you well you why do you hate britain that's my question um i don't hate britain i love the dutch oh no don't give me all that so um let's say mid to late 17th century to the i guess we would agree yeah the french revolution is generally taken the advent of napoleon napoleon is often described as the last enlightened death spot so um yeah it's a sort of it's a ferment of ideas isn't it and and that sort of cliched um description as i gave at the beginning of men in wigs and salons i mean that that is a huge part of it it's about clubs coffee houses literary salons people travel like voltaire and didierot traveling across europe exchanging ideas writing books a very literate public um and this sort of sense of of intellectual excitement i suppose yes i mean and there are incredible varieties so so i think on the continent it's much more court-based yeah and i think in the netherlands and in england it's it's much more sociable but i think in both cases the the it's kind of fun i think there's with a lot of the the the kind of the key enlightenment thinkers you have a sense that these are people who are really enjoying themselves yeah there's a kind of sense of excitement about it and absolutely the kind of sociable quality of it is absolutely fundamental and and the philosophes see themselves as so the philosophes are these french french thinkers yeah that's yes you know identifying themselves with the philosophers of ancient greece they they see themselves as and and in a little bit they're going to connect because there's this stream that happens it happens over a great deal of time and tom holland's going to bring it back to the 11th century and so you know even with the rediscovery in europe of of aristotle and renaissance and protestant reformation and enlightenment it's all and and tom i think does a good job of storing that's this is nicely part of one one process that's been happening but not necessarily along the lines of enlightenment propaganda as um well it's just kind of you know a class apart they they they see themselves as people leading the way into light out of darkness and therefore they they are not in any way modest people well that brings up fordek's question one of our listeners and he or she um i don't know why i assume a man would call himself fordek it just seems like a more stereotypically you know i imagine him as a reader of the patrick o'brien novels which you foolishly despise anyway fordek says um was it really that big a deal and was it that's that's the that's the key question really so why does it matter why why is it a big deal i i think it matters i mean i think it's of seismic significance and not just for europe or for america i mean i think america is the united states is inconceivable without the enlightenment but because of the impact of of of europe and the united states on the world it's of global significance and in a way it matters um because although i think it's very culturally contingent i think it's bred very very specifically of um the particular cultural circumstances of of europe in the 17th and 18th centuries it's brilliant at disguising itself as universal so so folter who's probably the most famous of all the the in life and i think i just want to pause it's brilliant as disguising itself as universal and and what we're going to bump into of course i haven't listened to i just saw that today's wednesday i thought they usually drop on monday and thursday they're starting to do afghanistan which is you know astoundingly timely because someone just offered the church that she was cleaning this woman was cleaning out her she had all the volumes of tim lehays left behind series and wanted to know if i wanted it for my church library i passed some of you will understand the implications of all of that but what what we have we all hold visions of the world that in some ways have to be naive in order for them to be operable and and with pluralism we we bump into each other's operable naive systems and we have to figure out how to live with each other and and modernity did that in many ways quite remarkably but it's fraying and coming apart and again we can see that in afghanistan today i mean the history of afghanistan and let's say the english engagement my son jared who has game night at his apartment has a game that he can't always get others to play about basically about the afghan the afghan war with the british and the russians and the afghanis and it's a pax pax premieres that what is it's a fun game to play we played it we played it at the airbnb on puget sound but you have this conflict of naive systems and and they have to be naive they have to be base in order for them to operate and and and and the they're not all just like one thing such as a windows operating system or a mac operating system or android or ios they're they're multi-layered and nuanced and there are deep rooted aspects of it and they're much lighter aspects of it of course a bunch of this is you know maps of meaning and jordan peterson trying to chart this kind of thing some of the figures he says of the church fathers that that they the particular cultural circumstances of europe in the 17th and 18th centuries it's brilliant at disguising itself as universal so so folter who's probably the most famous of all the the enlightenment figures he says of the church fathers that that they thought the whole world should be christian and that therefore they were necessarily the enemies of the whole world until it was converted and he saw himself as being superior to that but actually of course volterre and the philosoph were doing exactly the same and if he was superior to it because he understood it he understood diversity and and and really enthusiasts for enlightenment values tend to feel exactly the same way that the entire world should be converted to enlightenment values but because they're able to kind of cast it as somehow universal yeah again you know folter talks about there being a commonality of intellectuals from p king to to cayenne famously he's able to pass off this very very kind of european west european phenomenon as being universal but i mean what do you think how would you identify the enlightenment well it's a massive question so i think it so there's a there's a very famous historian of it called jonathan israel and he argues that it's all about ideas and he says it's not out of circumstances it's the ferment of ideas so you shouldn't well that the social economic context have been overplayed but i think the social economic context are massively important so i think you know it's it's post europe has gone through the wars of religion after the reformation this this is a question from mark taylor yeah to what extent was it a reaction to the excesses of the early 17th century i think it is a reaction i think there's a huge element of that so i mean we've talked before about the english civil war obviously ireland scotland the the horrific impact of the 30 years war in central europe and i think you can see generally a sort of you know the next couple of generations that are they're not traumatized is too strong but they're very strongly affected influenced by that there's a reaction against it but also this is an age of sort of mercantilism trade printing obviously an explosion of printing so literacy yeah literacy going up so i think something like by the end of the 18th century about 60 percent of british of english men and women of english men rather could read and write i think a smaller percentage of women so there's just far more readers and writers and i think the other thing that we haven't the word we haven't mentioned is science um really and i think science the idea of the world as a machine with laws kepler and his observing the kind of planetary motion obviously newton is massive i mean newton is a colossal enlightenment figure i think everybody had read him everybody knew about his ideas and this idea that um this idea of the world as a kind of watch um i read a brilliant book actually a few weeks ago about um clocks in history do you see this by a guy who's the curator of the um grenich sort of observatory and stuff and um this is the key point really when people are making clocks and they're obsessed by this idea of the world as a clock and is there a lot of space that's the watch god god is the watchmaker and you can understand how it works i think that's something all those ideas again again barfield the more you understand the less meaning it seems to have yes you know on that topic a brilliant thing so voltaire yeah he settles in geneva and he also has a place at ferny across the the swiss french border and in the late years of his life he he wants to plow something back in so he um sponsors people in in switzerland um to to manufacture watches does he yeah so he's he becomes a watchmaker he becomes he's like well he's kind of he's the the presiding watchmaker where voltaire cast himself rolex followed yeah yeah where god had led yeah that's um yeah but i think um that's all the other thing that strikes me about the enlightenment and maybe you'll you'll say that this is nothing new but you get a real sense of you could argue this this is where the sort of the citizens of nowhere started so you've got kind of voltaire and didierot and all these french guys who are traveling to russia and stuff and actually spend a lot of their lives voltaire obviously in exile um and they see themselves as part of a republic of letters you know they're not bound by nationality um by the nationalisms of the of the not the nationalism of the wrong word but but by the the narrow loyalties of the past well but also but also by religious religious identification yes and and they're they're citizens of nowhere in both senses you know of course you know part of what goes under on this i'm looking for my my former professor of history's book on the religious roots of the of the of the french revolution of course you've got you've got france where france and southern europe france and spain and italy where where the catholic churches you know deeply entrenched and you've got of course switzerland and parts of it's not germany yet but splotches of the holy roman empire and the netherlands and england where the reformation is taking place and and so you know it's tough to live in france if you're going to be deconstructing all of these things now there's an anachronism in me using that word right now but it seems to be part of the flow well they i'll tell you what's really interesting there's so much sort of swapping of um of of identities so russo he was a calvinist wasn't he and then he becomes a catholic converts to catholicism i think and gibbon i mean gibbon is sent to geneva i think it is or certainly sent to switzerland because he has been flirting with converting to catholicism so you can you can find um you can find biographies of these guys on youtube gibbon and russo of course russo famously notoriously unimpressive as a moral figure gibbon very interesting guy these are people who are beginning to sort of i don't want to lapse completely into the 21st century and say their identities are fluid but they're certainly more fluids than they would have been 100 years previously and they see themselves as part of a cosmopolitan they self-consciously see themselves as part of a sophisticated cosmopolitan community don't they i mean i think that and of course that is dependent on this vision of how the world is we all must have a naive set of assumptions about the world because it's upon which i mean that's our operating system it's upon it's within this thing that we operate and and scale up our our rules and our and the ways that we manage the 18th century is a period of massive religious ferment so you've got a kind of incredible revival process is going in the catholic church you've got methodism you've got the great awakening in evangelical process and i think that the the enlightenment is best seen as a further kind of expression of that seismic yeah attempt to make sense of the world and i think and so here you know what holland is in many ways doing he's deconstructing this religious secular framework and saying you know secularity is embedded in religion and i think this is exactly what we're seeing all around the world now and going to continue to see and and that's when after 20 years of american participation in afghanistan people are shocked how how can they go back to the taliban and it's like have you not been paying attention it does absolutely exist in the context of the traumas and the carnage and the horror of the religious wars of the 17th century and it's often today that process is often cast as a kind of process of discovery of of toleration i think that that mistakes it i think that basically what people are after is to try and find a kind of what they would call a civil religion a way of and it's interesting that he uses that term because of course that term is famously robert bella's term and you can quite easily look up robert bella's essay which he writes during the kennedy administration because he listens to jfk's inaugural address and he's saying here here in america we're promoting the civil religion the the the washington memorial and the lincoln memorial and the jefferson memorial these are these are temples and any ancient person would see these things as temples but yet oh no that's not a religion we have a separation of church and state oh you mean church as you mean state as church we don't get away from these things a religious settlement i think that that mistakes it i think that basically what people are after is to try and find a kind of um what they would call a civil religion a way of um a religious settlement that will promote kind of stability civilized living virtuous citizenship and and now to flip all the way back to dynasty well that was cesar augustus's big thing i mean he was a i mean you had laws against adultery now you could do almost anything you wanted to your slaves up to you couldn't kill them um but you could do almost anything you wanted to your slaves and and how many different ways but don't you dare commit adultery and and so on one hand cesar augustus keeping up this charade of the roman republic is the is the moral arbiter of the world and you know it's all embedded in a system all these kind of things a way of um a religious settlement that will promote kind of stability civilized living um virtuous citizenship all these kind of things and how you get there you know it is contested but it's not so contested that people are going to fight over it and in a way that is the fact that you can travel you know as voltaire does to uh to protestant the protestant dutch republic to protestant london to um frederick the great likewise protestant geneva of that is absolutely fundamental to voltaire sense of himself yeah i agree with that i didn't and voltaire is in many ways dependent on it of course it's a little early during the enlightenment but but ideas will follow of religious toleration so so these ideas can be had and these other ideas can't i had a conversation with someone who was having other conversations within the christian reform church and heard a story of a 12 year old in in one of the christian reform churches and in grand rapids learning that his learning the position on same-sex marriage that his denomination held and you know this this this 12 year old pleading with the parents that they must leave their church because how on earth could they be a part of a church that that held that belief well it's all depends on what kinds of beliefs and how they operate in your system within this vision that's all true but i think um a key part of it is this idea of light and darkness graham brad beer has a question who decided and when that it should be given the name the enlightenment now tom i this is mean of me because i know that because i looked this up beforehand and you didn't so go on so give it to it's a man called jubo frenchman who used the word lumiere called talked about the lumiere the lights um but actually that the idea of light and darkness i know you're going to have loads to say about this but i'll just say this you see this again and again so cant talks about immanuel cant the great german thinker talks about alf clarung kind of i don't know clearing of light or whatever um you see people talking again and again about about light obviously the secret society the illuminati very enlightenment group but also i always think the great enlightenment paintings are those paintings which i know you all know and lots of listeners will know by a guy called joseph right of derby and the most famous one experiment on a bird in an air pump 1768 you can look it up online an amazing painting and people are all looking around and they're surrounded by darkness and shadows and they and from the experiments there's this sort of fantastic glow of light and that's how people thought of themselves in the 18th century they thought what has gone before was darkness and shadow and superstition and we are leading the world into light and i think key to the sense of the enlightenment is a sense that before that the previous 1700 years were all about darkness and night and and sort of foolishness and ignorance now i'm sure you will say that that is based on a colossal and utterly misleading stereotype won't you no but because i think that um no i think a sense that um that people are in darkness and they have to be brought into light has been a kind of abiding theme of european civilization yeah but they thought that was people in the in in 1200 or something were living in darnes but you don't think they were living in darnes do you i mean you don't you're not one of these people who because some people say oh uh oh before the enlightenment always medievalism and foolishness and they you know people lived in huts and doled themselves in mud and they was didn't care about side and that's obviously rubbish to my mind i think there was no lots of science there was lots of intellectual experimental discovery and i think there's almost nothing about the enlightenment that doesn't have medieval medieval roots and i would say you know what i'm saying is that the very idea of seeing of of worrying that people are in darkness and they need to be brought into light is absolutely because in the 12th century so the 12th century reformers that's exactly what they're doing you know they that it's the 12th century reformers who come up with the word modernitas the idea that uh modernity is equated with light you know this isn't something that comes that's invented in the 18th century it's it it has its roots in in the process of reform in the 12th century but they come to believe that they've invented it and that idea has lasted so people now you know you'll open the guardian or the times and there'll be a column saying well we're standing for enlightenment values against the medieval barbarism of the taliban or whoever yes in other words we've completely imbibed that enlightenment sense of itself and we don't even question it now well but i think that there have been three great convulsive processes where the ambition of kind of i guess kind of intellectual elites to reform the world has generated a revolutionary process one of which is the 11th and 12th century where essentially you get the medieval church the roman church and i would say the catholics today still look back to that as an exemplification of darkness being banished by light okay you have it they do you can ask them they'll tell you with the reformation and i would say that believing protestants likewise would see the reformation as as absolutely a process of enlightenment and then you have what we call the enlightenment and i would say that kind of liberal secular atheist agnostic whatever look back to the to the enlightenment so those three processes seem to me absolute you know they they are obviously each one in turn is a reaction to what has gone before but they also are obeying very very similar and identifiable they're repeating the formulas basically exactly okay so that raises owen williams his question what he says what did the enlightenment do for western intellectual progress that the renaissance didn't and that's a really good question because i was thinking telling you what to think about i think about shakespeare so shakespeare was obviously a renaissance figure but in in some ways he feels like a very kind of proto-enlightenment figure as well doesn't he's got a sense of himself clearly as part of a wider sophisticated european orbit he's looking back to the classical world there's lots of stuff about kind of you know he's obviously thinking through things somebody like hamlet is using the power of reason so shakespeare does seem a very proto-enlightenment figure even though we wouldn't put him in that so is there a difference tom between the enlightenment and the renaissance and is the enlightenment doing something different but again the renaissance is an incredibly slippery term and what we call the renaissance you know kind of whatever 15th century florence but the the idea of looking back to the classical world and finding things there that are worthy of bringing back to life is something that that's going on you know at least from the time of charlemagne and right so in a sense the enlightenment is a process of renaissance because you have you know the the way in which um many of the the leading enlightenment figures in their kind of ambition to shove christianity to one side claim to be the heirs say of socrates or whoever yes another form of renaissance but there is there is i okay i accept that this this is a whole massive continuum and that you know we just are putting dividing it up slightly artificially and putting labels on it but people at the time had a sense of ferment didn't they they had a sense of time intellectual history accelerating and a sense of ideas being swapped in a way they weren't being swapped before and that they're living into that's why they talk about themselves as li lumiere as enlightened it's why that and there's a particular kind of vocabulary isn't there i mean even edmund burke who's often seen as a sort of counter enlightenment figure because he's the father of conservatism talks about when he writes to the electors of bristol and he says i owe you you know my enlightened judgment and my conscience and he's using a lot of kind of and and i think this this makes tom's case that people have been using this way of talking a long time and yeah at least in the prior dispensation before our current one where let's say a group of conservative christians would look at what we would today might look at classical liberals and you know well when they become christians they will see the light when they go from secularity into christianity so this the these metaphors and this conceptualization has been around a long time and used by many and again one must have in a sense their own naive assumptions about the world in order to work within the world and and if those naive assumptions become too cross-pressured i think i think you will have a sort of a meaning crisis which will probably be become a process into which you embrace a new naiveté. Enlightenment words and reason science i mean those things do make it feel different there's even just the tone and the sort of well the flavor of it feels a little bit different than let's say the ferment of ideas in the early 16th century okay so they're not using the word science and certainly not in english because the word science doesn't take on the meaning that it does until the the late 19th century and i think that there is a tendency which is to kind of identify the the sense of a war between religion and science which emerges in the late 19th century back onto the 18th century and undoubtedly that's the case because Voltaire again in particular is brilliant at picking on say Galileo he enshrines Galileo as an example of an enlightened figure who is silenced by a repressive apparatus of the catholic church and so this gets reconstructed in the late 19th century as an example of this kind of timeless war between religion and science but it's not it that those categories are not seen as mutually opposed in quite the same way. There's maybe an argument the enlightenment has slightly been invented by Victorian writers do you think? I think absolutely I think our modern understanding the 21st century is is one that's been massively mediated by what's gone between the 18th century and and now. That's that's a huge statement and and I think he's right and I think you see it okay that's that all sounds right but reason I mean again reason so it's often again the enlightenment is often described as the age of reason yes but that's a very old-fashioned way of seeing it and and read that the relationship of you know the leading enlightenment figures to reason is incredibly ambivalent and contested they say Kant's great work is the critique of pure reason. Hume famously says that reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions. Well so this raises an interesting question about the difference between continental enlightenment and let's say an Anglo-Saxon enlight. So well I'll cut it there but listen to the whole thing and if you haven't subscribed to their podcast by all means do so. I played a lot of it on the trip and I played with my wife got frustrated because the sound is sometimes a little muddy and their English accent and they talk over each other and she's like do they always talk over each other like this and I'm like yeah it's delightful I love it. But it wasn't her cup of tea but it sure is mine. So in modernity we become these mechanistic agents in our world instead of personalities we can barter with. This is again sort of God number one and God number two and and this is our our spirit of a spirit of geometry versus a spirit of finesse Pascal's categories. You know our view of the enlightenment and I love that point they made and that's as far as I wanted to get through that I mean the enlightenment has become something else and so at this point you have to say well why and again pointing back to the metaphysical club the book on Jordan Peterson's reading list where you know there were plenty of theories of evolution before Darwin. What changed with Darwin? Sort of the assumption that well we can we can just be the we can maybe we're just the part maybe we're just the product of purposeless mindless processes that have been just going for millions of years but then you get all the way to evolutionary psychology and we lift the hood and what should terrify him is that if he lifts the hood and discovers nothing but a mirror beneath that there is there is no you that you can now suddenly with this these new terms of knowledge manage in order to pursue your desires. What was it that Hume said about desire? Not very different from Luther. This this vision that that we manage that we create all the little tiny little parts of it and how it gets manifest before us we inherit is so broad and pervasive and implicit and assumed that that we pass along most of it even when the visual relevance realization layer is drawing our attention but it continues to slip and eat away. We'll be spending some time I want to I was thinking of I should reread Molly Worthen's Apostles of Reason the Crisis of Authority in American Evangelicalism. Very interesting book I read before any of this YouTube stuff but but that of course in the light of George Marsden's Fundamentalism in American Culture is all of these things have been swirling around and so then we get to Christianity Today of All Sources dissecting Mars Hill. Again I put on Twitter it's sort of like Mikhail Gorbachev telling the story of the Soviet Union. I wrote a blog post a number of years ago when I noticed that Rob Bell and Mark Dristel both of whom planted churches called Mars Hill were only born 49 days apart so if you're into numerology or astrology there you go. They both they both come out of this emergent movement which is this pushback against the seeker movement and in some ways the story of the rise and fall of Mars Hills is Dristel sort of returning back to seeker methodologies and of course Rob Bell going in a very different direction both typifying the continual devolution of 19th century American Protestantism but in two very different directions. And then the haunting thing which I think lies beneath the anxieties of Douglas Murray Tom Holland and and Jordan Peterson is the question of is secularism too derivative to endure long beyond its religious roots and sort of a loving embrace of secularism because they'll sort of like Augustus's fiction it has afforded a vision of the world that was sufficiently dominant in order to establish a degree of peace and again someone on Twitter finding this picture of the Taliban you know pushing these people against a wall which of course had been a banner of the United States or the the UN sustainable development goals. And I wonder if I can enlarge that picture. No poverty, COVID health and well-being, there's good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, the last one seems like drinking water, affordable and clean energy, and now the Taliban are in charge like well this is going to be something. Goods purchased by generations of sacrificial worldview investment dissipated leaving people who don't believe, don't act, don't accomplish, don't care, don't know how to live, don't know what to do. Well I got the fire the fire well I got the fire the fire the fire extinguisher guy coming and we've got the fire marshal church inspection next month so and a little bit more pastoring things to do but that'll be it for now and I'm sure these ideas will continue to twist in my little brain can't wait to listen to the episodes on Afghanistan from the rest of history so thank you for your time and attention leave a comment
