 The city's the man who does not want you, Council of the wicked, for us standing in way of sinners, or to sit in the seat of mockers, but his delight is in the love of the Lord, and on his lawn he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by a stream of water, which yields its fruit in season, and his leaf does not wither, every faith he does prosper, not so the wicked. They are like chaff that the wind blows away, therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly, of the righteous. For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.

He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season, and his leaf does not wither, and on his lawn he meditates day and night. Watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish. The approaches are that's where that's where the alignment is between Graham and I. Okay so what is bringing down the fourth wall project room? A terrible spell and part of that spell is like humans have a campfire circuitry for whatever reason probably because it so like the television engages that and like that's when your tribal elders are passing on information and stuff so like those things are hijacked and make you everybody feel like they're audience and like you'll like if you watch characters and series that do break the fourth wall and that's that's what the fourth wall I'm referencing when I do it the wall that behind which you are audience and not a human so okay yeah hashtag paintball for jesus at grim grizz hashtag break the fourth wall you do like break the fourth wall that doesn't exist and be like break the fourth wall a little bit you really helped me break the fourth wall you know it's just people good poetry is definitely it's asking it's definitely always trying to break the fourth wall always tried as grim grizz says to break the fourth wall to the degree that I can all right here we are thank you for coming this morning I thought I might do question and answer usually the first Friday of the month I use question and I take my questions from the from the bridges of meaning discord I thought this morning I would just take them directly and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to drop the link in the chat there it is I'm going to pin the link YouTube come on yeah there we go now I can now I can pin the link and what I'm going to do is there's a limit to how many people can sort of queue up in stream yard but I will try to take first come first serve at some point because this is going to go on a while if one of you comes in and then I think you'd make a good co-host for me so I can do a bunch of things and and then we can have more conversation with the question we'll we'll do that too and look at this we have one we have one early take you are you are the first one I've broken the fourth wall and here it is so well you're gonna have to tell us a little bit about yourself because yeah yeah so excuse me I thought I'd be in a waiting line here you're a popular guy on these so anyways happy Friday everyone my name is Joseph Lambrecht my my my username here is my last name in the Anglo-Saxon form but uh Paul we actually have talked way back in the day like 2017-18 so um really long time ago it's fine um sorry yeah yeah yeah no worries it was a quick uh randos thing but anyways um I wanted to hop in because I'm actually in um so I'm in the the holy cross seminary um deaconate program and I'm in my final year and so it's basically a three year program and it's to train guys um who want to better serve in their parish and um possibly go on to become ordained uh as a deacon in the orthodox church and I guess my question to you I don't want I don't want to be rambling on here but my question to you is what what is the purpose of a seminary because because you know you Calvinists you love your seminary education right you're very astute with um you know all sorts of manners of of of learning and you know you think of a uh a Calvinist pastor reform I'll just say reform pastor you know your your duties primarily I would say your duties are primarily pastoral right you're visiting the sick um uh counseling and whatnot and you know you you do provide teaching you have a sermon so there's that pastoral on it there's the the I guess intellectual um sermon and then you know your liturgical participation or leading right you you correct me if I'm wrong but as a reformed minister you are the one that you know will pray before communion right do you do allow lay participation for that or okay so but but still there I look at those three aspects right you have pastoral um teaching and liturgical you know there's probably a fancy name for all three of those things but in the orthodox scheme right it's liturgical is probably the the most important aspect of um a seminary education then uh teaching uh doctrine and then um you know uh pastoral work right but I get I've thrown a lot out already but I just want to hear what you your idea of the seminary is in that regard great question that's a great question so at the I made a little short of this now a word to uh JWH I'm gonna need to see your camera on before I let you on to make sure number one that your camera works and number two that you're you've got skin in the game and you're breaking the fourth wall so just to comment to you it's got one other person in the cube there you are all right good good okay that's a great question at the at the German Breakwater Festival I made a speech you can find the video on my channel both uh both I've mixed it up a little bit one of the things I thought about when I was thinking about that speech and I was thinking about the little corner is that over time there's been a shift of focus in the different traditions with respect to what they saw was sort of as the center of ministry and so the center of ministry I think for the orthodox has tended to be liturgy now all of the traditions have done all of the main things they've all done teaching they have all done pastoral care they've all done liturgy they've all done Eucharist and you could add a few things to that but orthodoxy right now when I listen to the orthodox I hear liturgy liturgy liturgy and what you just said sort of confirmed that that the number one thing in in deacon training for you is you've got to do the liturgy if all else fails that's what you need to be able to do and if I may interject real quick the thing about liturgy too is you can't just open up a book and here you go you know there's a lot of motion and you know oh does this guy go here or you know that kind of thing so yeah it's not so clear cut because your liturgy is embodied yes and your sacred space is three-dimensional yeah and it's intentional I've been actually thinking doing a lot of thinking about the the relationship between temple worship in the old in the first and second temples tabernacle first and second temples and orthodox liturgy but I'll save that for now so the focus for you all of these different traditions are going to prioritize different things even though seminaries now seminaries in in a protestant world are outgrowths of the university the universities are outgrowths of the monastic movements now it's not incidental and please correct me if I'm wrong it's not incidental that for orthodox clergy clergy that work in local parishes don't usually ascend up the hierarchy it's the monastics that take the place in the hierarchy right however today that practice is a little uh it's a little interesting because you can go become uh you go to seminary and you are a single guy and then you decide I'm gonna go um get my PhD in this length Greek or Russian or whatever and then they they'll they'll make you a monk for like four months and then you're you're elevated to a bishop or you're made an archimandrite and you're put in a holding environment as like I'm the dean of this seminary and that's a holding zone for you're going to be made a bishop once you know so there's there's a lot of it's yeah when you say that it's like there's a way to idealize it but there's also just admin there's the reality yeah so so mark makes an important point your university grows out of seminary because the question then really is what is a seminary and and traditionally of course the the root of the word is semen which is seed and seminaries are supposed to be seed beds for the leadership of the church and so and so the particular the different traditions and what they prioritize in their seed bed will be indicative of the larger body and it's and where it sees its priorities with respect to the clergy so your question about your question about reformed seminaries has tended to be homiletics preaching that has tended to be the number one thing I remember when Neil uh Neil planting Alvin planting his younger brother who was a professor of mine at seminary he became seminary president for Calvin seminary for a time and I remember when he was talking about his vision for the seminary he said I want our seminary to be known as being a place that has developed great preachers I see right there the priority of that tradition now when I went to seminary you could already in some ways now when I talk about the recessionary of modernity these things are so massive it's not like yeah it's like a tide that recedes because when you the tide may be receiving but you might have a group of waves that come in and makes makes it looks like you don't only see recession on may over a long period of time and so what's been happening in Protestantism as we're I think reaching the end of the particular protest that has been going on for 500 years has been a lack of confidence in preaching now one of the things that I saw in Tim Keller was a revivification of confidence in preaching and that was one of the things that really struck me when I looked at Tim Keller and part of why I really saw that in Keller was it was clear with Keller that his sermons were doing the converting okay now I think in orthodoxy for many who are coming into orthodoxy it's the liturgy when I listen to them it's the liturgy that's doing the transformation yeah yeah I would say that the places that are getting the most buzz are environments that can foster a beautiful prayerful liturgical environment yep yep and even even right now some of the best engagement any orthodox youtube channel gets right now is actually a channel called orthodox tradition and they are greek old calendarists so they're not in communion with any of the world orthodoxy because of acumen you know participation with world council churches and all this other crazy history but they get three digit viewers for their their live streams of vespers or something you know that is not even a major thing and people are flocking to it because it is engendering a certain ethos and you know yeah so it's all about what is going on in the liturgy so yes so so generally speaking protestant seminaries tend to prioritize preaching the karrouge the proclamation of the word and then the rest of it is sort of scaffolded up to there so theological and doctrinal formation theological education and doctoral formation have tended to be key now part of what has been happening in protestant seminaries is that in the united states universities were founded by denominations and all right yeah specific traditions and so the this and so when mark says universities grew out of seminaries he's right especially in the american scene and it's true in the christian reform church they first founded the seminary and then they founded calvin college to be a prep school for the seminary and then they needed to train christian school teachers which were often women so that's the next thing that they had at calvin college and everything sort of grew out of there and you see this on the american scene that first they discussed the first they founded the seminary to do theological education and and then everything grew out of there but now when i went to when i was going to seminary i would say that the crisis of preaching was already sort of well underway and so there was a big many seminars 70s or the 80s 80s 80s okay many seminarians were losing their confidence in preaching and they they were looking for pastoral care yeah okay and if you look at the the conversation i just did with graham dempsey about modernity what happens in the main line is the main line sort of hollows out liturgy stayed in the main line because one of the interesting things about main line was yes i oh my goodness it's so weird it's so weird yeah low church logically yeah yeah completely liberal yes but yeah but they folk continued to focus on liturgy yeah but the church hollowed out in terms of preaching and so the church would tend to devolve into either political political activism or therapy and so that tension was in seminary in the 80s with me a lot of people were like all of this theological education this isn't what's important what's really important is pastoral care the therapeutic and so that wave was going on in the 80s and then sort of church planting happened and what happened in protestant especially young restless and reform circles was that when that sort of brought preaching to the fore again because a lot of protestant church planting was about a certain kind of preaching but also big box music and that became liturgy for the secret church so all of these elements and then many secret churches because they were zwinglian you you know eucharist became like nothing yeah but then there were other churches like church of the servant in the christian form churches anglican churches that began to elevate the eucharist so what you see are these various elements of the life of the church sort of taking precedent back and forward in different aspects of the tradition and then that gets reflected in the seminaries okay yeah interesting super great question so just one quick follow-up then what do you think lies in future the future for the the current orthodox model because to give you some insight here you know the the main seminaries in america for orthodoxy are you know holy cross in brookline massachusetts you have saint tcons which is in pennsylvania that's orthodox church of america saint bladimir's seminary that's in new york orthodox church of in of america and then you have holy trinity in jordanville new york all these things are in the the upper east coast right now you have all this swelling of these you know of protestant converts atheist converts you name it whatever in in the midwest in you know these more rural areas and you know just something that you know strike is striking is you have all these clergymen that are you know similar to the uh your denomination you know you have this this old guard that is going to be retiring shortly and how are you going to replace that leadership and i see it very strange that you're going to demand you know um some guy in rural iowa you got to go to brookline massachusetts for five years spend you know 200 000 dollars and then you can be a priest and come back and serve the liturgy what is going to happen there you know yeah so well that crisis has been happening in protestant churches already and that crisis has been in the christian reform church for the last 20 years because prior to 20 years ago or so if you wanted to be a minister in the christian reform church you had to move to grand rapids you had to spend three years in in grand rapids and canadians in particular they would come in and they couldn't work and so that's part of what was behind redeemer but then you had in the christian form church alternate tracks to ministry where you could get a an mdiv a masters of divinity in another in another seminary and then you also had the rise of just like we've had the rise of non-denominational churches we've had the rise of non-denominational seminaries yeah right okay and so and and no you're you're exactly right and another interesting tidbit was that in the christian reform church in seminary when i went through we had near zero preparation in liturgy yeah oh boy near zero to the point that when seminarians would get out of seminary now you had a fair amount to field education and the assumption was you're going to pick up your liturgical stuff in your field education but we had a little class on reformed liturgy which is pretty simple and again it was near zero but what was also interesting was that in the 1970s so church of the servant now in grand rapids is a particularly interesting church because it's sort of become a cathedral church for grand rapids in the 70s with guys like nick waltersdorf and a bunch of calvin college intellectuals that were into aesthetics they were exploring liturgy and one of the transformations that has been happening in the christian form church over the last 50 years has been a renaissance in liturgy but that renaissance has been caught in the same in the same battle in the christian form church between assimilation to the main line and assimilation to the evangelical so no your question is great and and and like you just pointed out for things to work in the world they have to work at all the different layers they have to work for people's economics and yep and so and that distance element i think is the biggest barrier to entry right now for anyone becoming orthodox because you know you said previously you know i think you said you recommend not going to church more than like 15 minutes away or something which is a brilliant brilliant point i drive like an hour and 20 minutes to get to church right and that's insane that is totally unsustainable and um you know i think i think orthodoxy is something that can appeal to you know like an 80 iq to 140 iq except for try going to try going to a pipe fitter you know who's who's uh questioning about things and he uh you know you're like oh well you know come to this orthodox church uh 50 minutes away and it's like really you know like yep i got to do this but anyways i i could talk go on and on about this one last thing i'll say you know i i it's interesting when you think of how this phenomenon is tackled in the old world um you know i i've heard it they said that you know in greece if you want to be there's a distinction between a city priest and a village priest a city priest will go to thesalliniki study for three to four years village priest will go to athens for eight months and then you're back in it and you're you know you're right in the trenches and i personally think we need to embrace the village priest mindset and just go you know especially for the orthodox where we're liturgy mode um you know there's there's i i think there's nothing more important so anyways i'd love to continue this conversation i really would because this i think that orthodoxity in america is going to face many of the same challenges that every church faces just by virtue of culture economics all of this and and the dynamics you're describing though paul it's what's crazy though is you have all the okay so right now this i swear this is my last thing you have all these um you have all this the so the the goa greek orthodox archdiocese is is by far the largest orthodox representation in america and they have the most uh infrastructure and what's funny enough is that there's a a very large divide between this the swelling of converts coming in with the uh you know the greek uh hierarchy with the greek infrastructure with the greek academics and even maybe the greek population um and so you have this this disparagement between these two and it's like the the greeks have all the infrastructure and it's it's disproportionately out east and you know none of their kids are staying in the church and then you have all these people coming in and it's just it's like you you said and i think in a past video you know if you are i don't know if this was you they all mix together you know it feels like we're in 1913 you know yeah yeah what's going to happen with this cultural clash here so yeah well thank you thank you so much joseph and um now i'm gonna i grim grim gris suggests we're thinking pvk is too soft to host a thing of this nature well maybe so and that's why we try so yeah when you i'm gonna take you out of the room i'm gonna bring somebody else but then drop out so more slots can be and i'll try to be i'll try to be economical take care paul thanks all right sorry whoops oh no no no sorry john you're third okay jjwh you're up i can't hear you you're muted sorry sorry haven't practiced this in a bit hi um i'm dropping in on this because i've never caught you drop a link right at the exact time that i'm watching so it happened for the first time don't have any particular uh question but i've been listening for years and i really appreciate all that you do as far as um processing your thoughts online and allowing us to react to it i've dropped it on the discord every once in a while but i'm i really haven't figured it out too well uh you may look around me and see i'm a high school teacher and i happen to be on my planning period and i happen to be getting some things ready so i just decided to pop in i know your your wife's a teacher too so i figured uh you might understand that all right so you don't have a question um not too much but might just comment on i felt uh spoken to about the liturgy topic that you addressed a moment ago because i'm catholic myself and have um gone through the whole experience of being a young adult and dabbling into atheism etc and felt for a bit that might make more sense to me and then it didn't after a while um so i have kind of a cerebral approach or what you need to think things through that's why i appreciate this little corner so much um i need some holes both in my axiom or axioms here and there uh just to fix them and anyway i've been dating a woman now for a bit that is a uh probably episcopalian leaning um so that's a different tradition than what i have she's most comfortable with that tradition simply because it's the most liberal tradition she could find um whatever that means now i know that's a term that fudges etc but they're right next door to the unitarian church in my town anyway there so they're right in there and they collaborate a lot but i've been going there but it's really interesting because my girlfriend is a musician as well and she knows a lot about the old mass and the old rites and this episcopalian church has a lot more old music and old rights than what i am used to in my catholic and so that's because again the main lines tended to preserve the liturgy which is fascinating right agreed so it's it's ironic that if you're a protestant even if you're conservative but you really love liturgy you're going to be probably going to a very liberal church and you'll probably get to participate because these churches are dying like crazy leaving these massive buildings yes yep it's wild and this too has been interesting for me um your video is frozen on my end so i don't know if mine's still working for you yeah i still hear okay good i fixed it um i've i'm in the i'm in the upper south slash lower midwest um so i'll give you i'd be a kentucky indiana region i've lived in both places also um i'm a linguist of all things i lived in europe for over a decade so i unexpectedly speak several languages language teacher etc so i've had to assimilate into different cultures um but it's been interesting transferring over into the sapis capillian center because i tell them i'm catholic and i say oh that's so metal oh you must be so hardcore so conservative but yeah not not not really too much i just get i'm interested to see where the conservativism and the liberalism shifts to in the different churches and different communities and this one in particular is bringing in a lot of young people which i'm very surprised by because in this catholic tradition where i've been uh for the last about nine years after i moved back from europe um it's been mostly older folks i'm the only one that's like under 50 in my congregation usually they've been asking where you've been and i said i'm going with my girlfriend to the southern church but i go to catholic mass during the week and then i'm a piscopane on the weekends and uh she plays some she plays some presbyterian churches uh as a musician sometimes so uh ma monday thursday which is the term i just learned this year we're going to be presbyterian i think sunday we're going to be a piscopane friday catholic i don't know so yeah i know that isn't always well received but i'm open to trying different things i usually score pretty down openness um but yeah so one thing before i before i just go on and on because i'm kind of nervous as you may tell this feels like i'm talking to a bit of a celebrity here with pvk on the line uh i know you you're probably used to getting starstruck people and that's me right now um but this particular church has all these old rites uh but they also do drag shows for example which i have not been to but would be interested and seeing how they handle that um not something i want to go to repeatedly not something i won't necessarily invite anybody to but i am interested that somehow they're pulling this off go to the episcopal church for the liturgy but you gotta you gotta tolerate the grid to drag queens and we this is you know i did this conversation about metamodern christianity this is it this is this is what we are going to be facing so and all the flips we've seen throughout these just a couple years since you came onto my radar have been wild uh never saw them coming and then my my pastoral experience has been in um catholic franciscan churches and uh a lot of the like stereotypes with thin catholicism i've been met with a lot more gentle approaches from the the pastoral side i want to say like i've had great priests in my life that really cancelled me through a lot of different difficulties individually and have really taken time for me yeah i really appreciate that yeah and uh one of them is in his late 80s and they recently moved him from the church he had been at for like 20 years so i still meet him individually but i'm just not at the parish anyway i've taken up plenty of time here thanks for having me on thanks thanks for dropping on yeah it's a pleasure keep on doing what you're doing and i enjoy listening to you all okay thanks a lot bye bye all right john good morning paul good how are you it's good to see you again i'm doing well good um what's your question my question um in his heyday chris verhitchens was probably the best uh atheist best spokesman for the atheists and to me his strongest um steel man on his side was that he was a humanist and he believed that abortion was murder and he would ask every once in a while do you believe in abortion and if the christian said no said no he'd say well then aren't you condemning all these human beings to eternal torment yeah because a good portion of them won't um you know if they live their lives they're they're not all going to go to heaven but if they all get aborted they all go to heaven so what's your question well my question is i it's the same question i've asked before it's it's just a different way of trying to understand how and i know that you know our whole society is built on uh on the christian tradition that without christ the declaration of independence is probably the most powerful and best political document ever written and it is because that document puts it in in black and white that we get our rights from god we do not get our rights from um the king or from any human um the king or from any human and that's that's got to be correct i mean even if that's not right it would be best to act that way that's the thing i think jordan beterson says that and he's probably shifted a little bit but they constantly ask him do you believe in god and he finally settled on i act as if he's there so so john you gotta have a question for me you're a known quantity here so i'm not looking for a randos conversation so do you have a question or is that something you wanted to say that's some i wanted to say all right sorry i guess that's okay john that's all right thanks thanks for coming on i'll just again make the note that when i drop you from this it's good to drop out of the waiting area down below to get off of stream yard so that more people can come in because grim briz is is rightly concerned that i'm going to be way too soft on all you people so um i understand it's good to see you i understand you need the justice and the and that's right that's right i'll both be there tvk he's just way too soft until he isn't and then he's way too mean that's all the way it goes take care john good seeing you thank you paul hey dale hey paul how are you pretty good pretty good doing good what's your first got two quick questions one was from your first conversation okay has to do with way back in school if i remember right the the primary piece of the pulpit of the crc is the preaching therefore they put the pulpit center the communion table out in front type thing is that correct yes and that also sort of answers the question why the seminary because the key to crc is the preaching of the word therefore you need all the knowledge correct yes okay that was that just piece along with the liturgy because i i'm now in the lutheran church which has that reverse which i happen to just be looking up what does it take to do communion and you have to be ordained to give communion because i forget the word they use but it's basically uttering the the pre the preface to given communion the you know what jesus spoke type thing has to be done from a preacher only yes so if a lutheran church so my my wife my father-in-law her her father was killed when she was young he was a lutheran minister and i remember visiting the lutheran church in little town um in eastern michigan and it had that lutheran church had a rather famous little altar it's a little church but as an altar and again you're exactly right all of this architecture reflects the more in churches so you're exactly right generally speaking often in protestant churches the pulpit will be the main deal and then the christian form churches there'll be a table where there's communion in a lutheran church you'll have an altar and you know and then of course with lutherans it's um that's sort of intention but of obviously in an orthodox or catholic church the altar is the main thing and then the homily is a separate thing you're exactly right so was that your question dale oh that was just a question i had since i was watching the first question has to do with um your discussion of catechism that we used to have back in the crc i'm like you went once a week to catechism had to go before the uh i was in an urban church so we had it for sunday school okay so my question is what is it today in most crcs i grew up first crc or in city so i'm sort of curious what's what's the standard for catechism because in the lutheran my daughter's going to catechism classes right now they learn it in school from beginning from first grade on they're reciting catechism for the lutheran which is small catechism which is much simpler than the heidelberg ever was but what is the current um structure today in the crc all over the map so it's interesting because after i made that comment i heard from some crc people that said we still have midweek catechism other christian-informed churches you're not going to find the catechism even if you're looking for it and i would say generally speaking there's a whole bunch of other trends that you're going to hear so richard is in here talking down the crc because he's uh because he's richard um a particular richard that is a brother of a particular more well-known person in the corner here but you will find let's say if you go to a crc that looks like a seeker church then you're probably going to if any catechism is there if they're using even crc materials it'll be way down deep perhaps beneath their sunday school their their middle school and high school curriculum the catechism will be under there now it's helpful to remember and i'm still thinking about how to do catechism things on my youtube channel it's helpful to remember that generally speaking catechisms touch on a few standard elements of the bible um they'll touch on the apostle's creed they'll touch on the lord's prayer they'll touch on the ten commandments they'll touch on um so so in other words catechisms by their structure themselves try to give sort of an overview into the bible and the christian life and so what you'll find in christian-informed churches now that there'll be some places still teaching the catechism directly there'll be some places still doing catechism sermons at night and there'll be other christian-informed churches where you'll be really hard pressed to find or identify the catechism but if i remember right i mean it's been a long time since i studied the heidelberg catechism um if i remember right it's pretty much just a theological framework beginning to end how you get from original sin to salvation it's an application of what the tradition sees as the heart of christian teaching okay would be the same thing i'm saying yep yep that and so again apostle's creed lord's prayer ten commandments sacraments and then they'll get at things like holy living through the apostle's creed which are in the which are in the gratitude section so i'm actually getting more and more excited about doing some stuff on the heidelberg catechism in my channel so because you actually can touch on a whole lot of these different issues that we're dealing with now in terms of the church so it's a really cool thing and the only really quick question do you ever attend brookside up on eastern just off of 28th and grand rapids i never attended it i had friends who attended it and paul de vries who is now famous because of last year's senate paul de vries pastors there paul de vries grew up in the church i now serve the christian-informed church is a very tight little network as you know and so brookside brookside became so one of the interesting things about grand rapids churches are they reflect the migration of christian-informed people both geographically in the community and also in terms of american social stratas and so i mean churches are fascinating elements where you can learn sociology you can learn economics you can learn all sorts of things just by watching how people migrate and a church can become sort of a frame through which to watch these trends go in america so interesting stuff all right thanks paul thank you dale sandy how are you no that's that's the question of the week oh i i'm still sick so hang on i'm on two devices oh you have a question sandy yeah i'm gonna read something and i got a question and the question even regardless of what i'm about to read the question is um related to um your thoughts on peterson and um shoot the guy i told you i didn't listen to this morning that you did the talk on destiny yeah him um and why we're talking about liturgy okay all right so uh googling liturgy the dictionary says it's a four a form or formulary according to which public religious worship especially christian worship is conducted or to in ancient greece it is a public office or duty performed voluntarily by a rich athenian that's not um jeopardy this is an actual dictionary definition yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and when when so i i just vented quite a bit on jacob's discord about um my thoughts on peterson i can't imagine there's much venting on jacob's discord is there i'd go on i'm sorry i shouldn't interrupt never ever never no it usually ends when i vent it usually when i vent it usually ends with him going i have no idea what you're talking about so bearing in mind the definitions i just read you um do you and the fact i have not listened to your breakdown on um peterson and destiny okay about 30 minutes in i got quite angry at peterson's i sorry i sorry i did not you can get angry at jordan peterson that's okay i'm just interested to hear why you got angry at peterson um the short answer is the stuff i bring up on jacob's channel where he goes sandy this is not always about your life um and the fact that i had an amazing psychologist at my son's um provincial school for the deaf um had peterson been there he and i would have come to come to words at words i mean seriously okay now now sandy i know you you're gonna have to focus here because that's right one two three four five six people in the queue behind you so um yeah so is your question did so i'm not even going to ask other people want to know about destiny and this conversation too i saw that in the chat so did you have an issue with and this is my issue did you have an issue with peterson's behavior in this stream um and did you feel that he was leading the question repeatedly or the conversation repeatedly in such a way as to give him simply a platform to vent on his favorite these are the five billion reasons why everybody that i don't like is woke and this is impossible so why are they asking it because quite frankly um show me impossible i'll tell you how to do it it's one of my key venting phrases that i've used over the years with a lot of stuff going on with that this is not all about your life places and um now you asked a question and then you kept talking and so it leads me to wonder if there's another question coming or if that's the question you want me to answer because what i what i've done now if i as just so i can remember i have starred what grim gris's fear is here um oh yeah no don't let me go there um i i want to know it i do what i asked were you completely in favor because what i heard on other spots was so you've destroyed somebody and now you're going to go and destroy destiny which means in my mind you're probably going to go yay peterson are you or are you actually taking apart all of the reasons why i related this to liturgy and a young pastor uh who is dutch but was not in the crc's favorite so what does this look like on monday morning okay let's let's that's what i want you to talk about um well let first on peterson and destiny what did i have a problem with what peterson did no no he didn't destroy destiny because the problem with that conversation was just like how much other stuff on youtube where you have the big showdown whether it's peterson and sam harris or one redirect i asked if you were gonna try to destroy destiny i don't think peterson did okay well let me finish my answer people going to that was a big deal for both peterson and destiny because destiny's audience for the most part would listen to this and they would probably say well see destiny didn't just sort of tuck tail and run he argued his points and so destiny won and peters some of peterson's audience would have listened to this and said oh peterson got to make all his points and so peterson won and i didn't think anybody won i think it was just kind of we're going to shout our points back and forth now i just made a little video in the membership section and i see that there are five gifted members at memberships out there um and i made a little video because in the exclusive daily wire section was once again the best part of that conversation where they actually talked back and forth and what i think what i think this little corner is growing out of um there was a good discussion on luke's recent live stream where sam was talking about his his his appearance on the council of trent where you know this little corner is part of a much larger manifestation of exhaustion on youtube over um over the knights and mooks game where our knights wind up just shouting at each other now i'm going to bring this all the way around to liturgy and the definition that you just gave us because what liturgy is at heart is our attempt to participate in moving the universe towards its telos that might sound like word salad but i think you understand what i mean so when the greeks did liturgy and again it would be the wealthy people again the wealthy people innocent in a society or those who are favored by god because they're wealthy that sort of direct that sort of direct karmic understanding that the book of job tries to tries to deconstruct so so i thought that i was hoping that peterson would start in therapist mode and that regardless of whether anybody starts changing sides on climate change or immigration or excess deaths or any of the kinds of things that they talked about that that destiny and jordan could begin to have more of a relationship and that their participating audiences could begin to have more productive conversations around these different little things and then i also had my point about the monarchical vision versus let's say the phenomenal the phenomenological or the personal passage so there's my answer so do you have a follow-up sandy you got to keep this brief they're hanging up behind you um yeah i i thought peter part of the problem was that peterson did start in sorry my brain's shutting down the therapist mode um and um i thought that destinies well that's a general you know generalization kind of responded to that place um so i'd be curious about that at some point not necessarily yeah exactly was your problem i mean to get narrowed down in and say okay so you watched it and you had an emotional reaction and you're trying to make sense of your emotional reaction and when jacob says it's not just about you that's half true because i'm certainly interested in what's going on out in the world but the only way you're going to know about that again and this is more of this personal way of knowing versus sort of a monarchical vision that then the real interesting questions are why am i having this emotional reaction to it so to answer instead of just projecting that onto peterson and destiny then it becomes a question about who are you and why am i having this reaction so to answer your question um sorry and the brain's not cooperating a bit because fog um my problem with the conversation was um that they didn't actually get to a conversation they gave a they gave a topic and um what was it uh there was something that i wrote okay wait back up a bit because you referenced jacob jacob's main issue with um this is grizz's main issue with this that jacob accepted jacob points at um how too many research things are story not actual real science um and that's where they go off track so um and and so i responded in part in my discussions of what i was bringing up there to having heard that about three times um and it reminded me of um say within before they hit i remember seeing 58 um when at one spot when i was looking at some of what they were talking at um and between 30 and 58 i was already flashing to um his labeling of destiny's character as somewhat more feminine than masculine because he couldn't possibly be um well anyway go back and watch it if people are curious and a particular um day in the uh deaf school where i literally leaned across the table facing down the principal vice principal and a series of other um you know labels of various um uh professionals um who were trying to kick my son out of the deaf school um because he wasn't using a sign language and so therefore they said it didn't matter if he was deaf he wasn't really because he wasn't using asl they're going to put him to and i said what you need to understand is i would walk through hell and back for this kid okay and so and here's here's an interesting here's an interesting point in that when we watch videos we are we are sort of mingling with them in a transjective place in a transjective liminal spot which we need to if it comes back to the practice what is the p the four p's you know the practical one where you're going to put feet on the ground and hands to a task that one procedural that one all right sandy i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna call time here and thank you because i have a memoir to finish writing it i'll just listen to that i think i think Memoiring is exactly what you should be doing so thanks andy bye thank you Mr christian how are you i'm good my question for you so try to get right to the point is do you feel like um your conversation with brendan graham dempsey was that he is past the modern and he that he is actually metamodern i think he's the whole idea of metamodern is to try to appreciate what modernity had to offer appreciate what was right about post-modern critique of modernity and then move forward in the best way possible now where brendan and i disagree will be on what of modernity should be kept and actually in the again this morning i watched the exclusive member section on daily wire with bishop barron bishop barron actually gets right into this because he says when i was studying in seminary we were taught in the historical critical and that is deeply modern and so brendan and i started talking about that a little bit but very quickly we got hung up on the fact that he thought that it was illegitimate for a public person to publicly believe in things like the physical resurrection of jesus and the virgin birth and my point was there's a modern hang up that actually when you get into metamodernity whether whatever side you're on with respect to that those hang ups and those rules are going to pass because that's what's happening and that was my point about saying a whole bunch of people who used to sort of worship sam harris are now kissing boxes of relics in orthodox churches that's metamodernity and but it doesn't mean that they're no longer driving cars and so when you look at say the john vervecki corner of the corner that tends to be you know because john vervecki will also have he will also be a little bit more wed to modernity with respect to some of these issues and then you've got the jonathan peugeot that are basically saying we don't give a rip about these issues we're you know but then they're going to have to deal with all of the the real world engagement and so my first conversation here about seminary really was tied up with that because it's one thing to talk about oh orthodoxy and mysticism yeah but you're if you're actually going to deploy orthodox churches around america and grow your movement you're going to have to figure out the leadership challenges and i mean scaling is one of the most difficult things when it comes to just about everything especially with respect to religion well that's that's where they could learn from evangelicalism and that's and i've been having that conversation i had a long conversation with lance about liturgy and there was some interesting pushback on that podcast yesterday and stuff so but yeah i i think that uh patrick uh or what's his name uh brendan it was hard for me to hear that he wasn't a modernist like i know he sounded modest to me too that's what i so that was confusing i mean i studied the sources in my undergrad like the j sources i we did luke timothy johnson's take on the jesus seminar and all that kind of stuff so like i'm familiar with that stuff but it didn't sound like he was past it so it was hard for me to know where the connection was and that's where my my conversation so that's why when i got all the way to the end of the conversation and he just starts telling his story and you said that's where that's that's the conversation that's where we begin in the meta modern and this is where peugeot is right and vervecky's right and peterson's right we begin with the personal in the meta modern because in the personal you you do have to integrate the modern but you don't lose those other three p's so that would be that that would be uh tlc using uh very fancy technology to do personalist uh conversation and knowing about god and exactly exactly so that's where that went so all right thanks thank you christian all right marcus how are you uh i'm good i'm good can you hear me i hear you fine all right perfect tell me a little bit about yourself so i can have a little bit of context for your question all right well um the main thing about my question is it relates to my journey sort of through this this corner and more broadly through the uh what did you call that path the atheist to peterson to peugeot pipeline yeah that lots of peas in that one too yeah uh and that's not even getting into five peas of knowledge and all the other peas that are floating around this place um but my because i started off sort of nominally christian um in the broadly moved from baptist kind of to non-denominational as a child didn't really understand much of anything went to sunday school learned the stories and that was about it and then like all smart 12 year olds who are way too smart for their own good i decided that i was too intelligent to believe in all this religious stuff and moved on uh a few years ago i started listening to peterson mostly uh funnily enough because of this political stuff put him on my radar i was like okay that's interesting because i'm invested in politics to my own you know dismay uh yeah politics has a way of punching me in the throat whether i like it or not um but but yeah so i i started listening to him for that and i was like okay so he's got some interesting takes and then it moved on to the self-help stuff and his you know advice and all this stuff and clean your room and all those memes i was like okay this guy's interesting and then i found the genesis series and i was like okay this is there's something here and then like a whole bunch of people like that part of my story is not really all that unique um i moved through the the whole thing of going through it and being like okay well it's symbolically meaningful but yeah it's not true and then at some point i had to go okay it's true because it wasn't just peterson and then it was peugeot and then it was other people like um i'm forgetting who's the guy who wrote cold case christianity oh i don't remember but yeah i don't remember either i'm sorry if you know but yeah so books like that talks like that channels like capturing christianity channels like um the whole apologetics thing the whole thing so i i kind of fell into that and then over time it sort of became like okay so this is true now what do i do with it right yeah yeah and and that's kind of still where i am because i like i'm in the hallway i'm definitely firmly in the hallway i just i can't decide which is my room if i start checking rooms out i have and that's the thing is because i'm like i'm leaning into a bunch of different places but i do i do want to know like in your opinion how important is overall church unity to like the process of kind of what we're doing and you know i realized asking a protestant about church unity probably isn't the best idea but uh like that's something that i've been it's been united since i've been in it at least the christian reformed church no that hasn't even worked out for us either exactly and i'm starting to wonder like because i do think it's important that the the church the we would say the little c church yeah across the world all the the whole body of believers in every stripe and fashion i do think it's important that we be united but it's like how does that play out and how do you even deal with that i like the anglican church in their model of like well here are the core stuff that we believe and here's all the other stuff that you can debate about because we don't really have enough every church does that yeah every that's how you have to deal with unity you have to say what's essential and what's indifferent okay because it's just and it's so interesting to see this and i see this a lot in in smaller churches because you'll have these little tiny disagreements that sprout into well we're splitting off a new denomination or we're going to become non-denominational and we're gonna like everything's going to be separate and everybody's all atomized and their own little things i think part of that's just because i live in america and america is very individualist place so i part of that i think comes from the culture but part of that also i i don't know like i don't know and i don't know how how detrimental that is because there are positives to it but i also wonder if you take this and put it into a question what would it be okay i would say i kind of wanted to get your perspective on on specifically from what you know of anglicanism how they deal with the aspect of church unity and trying to like bridge the gap between protestants and catholic and also orthodox and what your personal take is on how important and on how important church unity is to the whole project of bringing god's message to the world anglicans well it's right there in their name they're anglophiles yeah anglican church basically means english language church so there's anglo-catholics there's liberal anglicans there's charismatic anglicans there's evangelical anglicans the anglicans have sort of managed sort of to keep a degree of of institutional unity amidst a lot of diversity that usually cracks open churches now they've not been as successful at this as the roman catholics obviously because they and then you have the acna the um you know the the anglican churches of north america there's a there's a nigerian acna that meets that rents out a room from us here at living stones so the anglicans i think and and the anglicans are also a pretty good group because they're fairly self-aware uh recently someone pointed a book to me i never finished it but i read um a crc minister a friend of mine pointed a book to me and it was writing exactly about anglican unity and and how anglicans think about unity boy i don't know it's been a while in um the this i'll see if i can if i can pull it up but i i think i think if you're if you're asking questions about unity there are worse places to start than the anglican church because the anglican church has sort of managed to not necessarily achieve the kind of unity that let's say the roman catholics have but at the same time um have managed to try to keep it in tension let me see if i can uh anglicanism by gerard uh gerard bray um i only have this i only downloaded the sample i'll see if i can uh i'll see if i i'll put the see if i can oh let's see uh present uh share screen window tab share there's the book anglicanism a reformed catholic tradition and i read the beginning of that book and it was really good i haven't uh sprung for the rest of the book but it it very much barks up the um the same tree that you're um okay that you're that you're looking for so okay and then how would you like how important do you think that is even in the grand scheme of the church's mission in the world well it was important enough for jesus to pray for it in the gospel of john it's kind of hard to say it's unimportant if the church is jesus himself is asking that all of his all of his children as it were would be one now how exactly is that because if you if you look at let's say evangelicalism in america that's a striving for a particular kind of unity but it's sort of the opposite pole from let's say roman catholic unity and from what i've seen the orthodox are struggling with this unity thing too because i think once people get beyond once people get beyond well the first thing you have to realize is and somebody said this recently to me i don't remember where it might have been on a live stream it's a very dangerous thing to try to be a christian all by yourself it's not just unworkable it's dangerous you have to you have to move towards a church of some kind and and that's clear okay that then scales up to the next thing it's dangerous for a local church to not be part of a larger broader body and it's very dangerous and so and that's why churches do sort of the same thing and this movement of course just keeps heading up until it fills the universe so it's very important but details matter and many evangelicals sort of pick a certain kind of unity roman catholics work a certain kind of unity orthodox are working certain kinds of unity so this has also been a deep work of the church right from the start and you know what's again a fairly close reading of the new testament suggests you know a fierce debate between judiizers as paul calls them and and you know and and word was james the just the book of james were they the judiizers and did everyone then get a spot in the new testament so all of those tensions are right there in our canon i think probably so yeah it's important but then figuring out how to pursue it it's a work of a lifetime yeah that always seems to be the hard part i suppose okay well i appreciate your time thank you all right marcus thanks for jumping on yes thank you christian unmute there you are good good how you doing i'm doing well i'm doing well what's that what's that what's your question what's on your mind yeah i'm not doing any randos type stuff with faces that should be known to the corner so yeah christian is well known even though people can't say the name of his channel so just say the name of your channel right now so grim grizz can get it aga paul gia aga paul gia yeah aga paul gia there we go all right christian what's your question yeah so um i've watched the destiny jordan peterson conversation i've watched your reaction to it um and then i saw sandy's response to uh to it as well and i thought oh no she's gonna have the same question as me but it ended up being totally different so good because you mentioned liturgy um so my question is um well it seemed like your your kind of issue or your desire with it was that it would have had a different kind of liturgy about it like that that jordan or maybe even jordan jordan peterson would have a different sort of liturgy in general with his conversations right um but i wonder right well some of these guys some of his conversations are really good yeah and that's fair it's like my sermons there are sermons that are turds and there's sermons that sing right same with conversations so right so so what i wondered was because i started i saw first i saw that the video was uploaded his his video that jordan peterson destiny video and i thought there's no way i'm watching that like i won't be able to handle it because i'm like non-confrontational i'm agreeable i'm like this is going to be a disaster right and then i'm like but i have to like i have to watch this so i start watching it and then um then i stop then i keep watching then i look at then i'm like all right i'm going to look at the comments and that will tell me whether i should keep watching i'm going to get to the question question very very soon um so i was surprised by the comment section i was like okay like because it was respectful towards destiny so i was like oh okay so i continue watching through all of the uncomfortable parts and i'm surprised by how well destiny handles the uncomfortable parts right and i'm uh pleased with how jordan peterson responds to destiny's responses right so i'm so i'm okay this is this is great so i came away from it thinking overall this was possibly one of jordan peterson's most important conversations to date not because of anything particular that was spoken but because of how it unfolded right yeah so each of them has a has a sort of liturgy even though they have exceptions which which which are more palatable to me but to the to their general audiences i would assume most of their conversations that are like heated and stuff like that conversations most of their debate things are what the people want to see so to see a a very uh a conversation characterized by a lot of conflict actually unfold i would say successfully uh overall right i would say it unfolded uh nobody walked out nobody exactly yeah i was thinking of what's his name with for like for uh uh peter hitchins yeah exactly um so okay so my question um should uh while i agree with you about my personal preference would be for his liturgy in this particular conversation to have been different i think it was actually exactly what it needed to be because it's like it's like uh animals testing each other uh uh brutally at first right and then coming away with greater respect for one another now what now my desire is i want to see that conversation that you're talking about right now that they've tested the waters they've tested each other right like almost like dogs right but but they've come away respecting each other yeah given that like that's my perspective yeah um do you think um that what do you think should be the liturgy of of a jordan peterson conversation with someone like destiny or i say god forbid jokes am i jokingly vowsh in the future or something like that right oh so so number one i was super glad he did it yeah because it's been a long time since jordan has sort of had been sharing a platform with critics and that he shared it with a streamer critic and i i take jordan peterson at his word when he says he has invited many people on the left to come on his show and they won't i completely believe that and so it is in to destiny's credit that he went now there's of course a status differential and so it was it was also in destiny's best interest i mean it's the same reason why gavin ortland hasn't taken up sam teetumans challenge or some of the same reasons and it's some of the same reasons why i'm not expecting an email from bishop barron um because i didn't necessarily say the most approving things about him in my recent video and but there's gonna be no other videos when i say very approving things about bishop barron because actually in a normal relationship um you you say some things that are really flattering let me say some things that are critical and that's why when when i turned on my video and i saw you know because i knew when i was inviting someone into the virtually not alone network grim grizz in terms of the status hierarchy hierarchy of the virtue now every time i mention grim grizz i'm gonna have to put this thing out um in the in the virtually not alone network grim grizz has higher status than i have because it's his baby and i'm just coming in so you you know there's a sign of health when you can actually give positive and negative and it's okay that's how real relationships work and that's how they're that's how they're supposed to work so yes it was a good it was a it was a it was a sign of health that destiny was on there now peterson the difficulty that jordan has is he has reached some amazing heights in the past like with the cathy newman interview you could argue about the helen lewis interview because it's not necessarily bad to have a contentious interview but um and so i thought that i think your point is right so and it was i think ironic the fact that i had just had that rather contentious conversation with brandon dempsey and but you know he early on in the conversation said you know i just want to be really careful and that's what you do early on it's like let's keep checking with each other to make sure that this is play because i'm gonna i'm thinking you know i'm gonna i want to have my sister on for a randos conversation and that could that could turn out into an all-out brawl but i know it's okay right because my sister and i we can really go at it and she's gonna tell me about the home you grew up in blah blah blah blah that never happened what do you mean that didn't happen and then off we go i mean that could happen um but so so i think everything that you said i agree with and i would have liked to have seen and and again this is the point of my video was not just sort of a low resolution like don't like the talk in fact again the membership section of the talk i've only listened to half of it but that sounded like much more like the kind of talk i was looking for but that of course was two hours into the conversation and in many cases you have to sort of achieve that and part of the reason i do what i do and part of the reason like elizabeth oldfield does what they do if you begin with the personal instead of the monarchical because if you're beginning with the monarchical all you do is fight over you know who has the right facts and if you begin with the personal well let's start talking about your life and so if brandon dempsey talks about the fact that he grew up in a in a more of a fundamentalist household and then he went and you know sort of a bard urman story then he went to seminary and a lot of these ideas were challenged and he basically accepted the framework that he got in a modernist theological education well okay so let's approach it this way and then i can share because i also have a modernist theological education so so yeah so i i think um you know and i i want to resist sort of the low resolution youtube approach which says good or bad right come on people there's some good and like or don't likes a little bit better but there's a lot i like almost every conversation or video that i see there's some things i like there's some things i don't like but now when i have to talk i have to bring that in and put a point to it so then people might say paul didn't like the talk with destiny why and that's where just like i did with sandy you turn it around and say okay well what in you paul what's your agenda with this my agenda is to see the evolution of this space and well what are you doing to change that well look at the tlc and my participation and involvement in it this is my attempt to change youtube and you might say how can a channel of 29 000 subs change youtube probably very slowly so that's where i'm at so yeah i how's that christian any any last minute rebuttals otherwise i gotta you know oh just just really quick if you also go check out uh the comments on destiny's upload of the video because you did a like a 35 minute upload oh and the comments on there are actually like respectful of jordan peterson as well oh good yeah i'd also be curious to see what 35 minutes he chose yeah it's pretty hot and that's just it because of course the hot stuff gets the clicks by virtue of our you know we we are we we look for action because it's dangerous yeah so we got the screen between us so it feels like it was a good model of like not every time you have a heated conversation with somebody you're going to be able to do the tell me about the house you grew up in right like if you're if you get into a heated discussion even at like a family get together right it could blow up quickly and i think the the dynamic between jordan peterson and destiny was actually a good model for how to handle that kind of situation yeah yeah so thank you so much paul thank you christian hey chris how are you oh i don't hear you i still don't hear you oh no all this time waiting and it isn't working how about now oh i hear you now i i almost had to reach and play some branding yeah i see you down there smiling grizz you little colonizer you you know i i i know i know what you're about there mr grizz but i'm in charge right now there you go chris hi nice to meet you nice to meet you i'm jazzed to be on the show as a guy said i've seen your comments for a while so um my question is uh do you have some hope in the future generations you know old guys it's like oh those kids you know old guys it's like oh those kids you know but the it reminds me of the book of jona and his outrage that god wasn't going to judge judge these people you know like they should be they should be judged and he's not doing his job um we're in a time where like the social justice thing you know does that give you some hope that they're at least they have a vision of justice and how things should be to me it gives me some hope but also i'm kind of discouraged by the people who should be believing that it's going to be taken care of but they don't act like it's going to be taken care of amen what's your point on that amen no i think christians of all the religions that i know and what do i know but i think christians more than anyone else should be optimistic about the future by virtue of that doesn't mean i'm a post millennialist it means that christians know how the story ends that it ends in a good way and there are you catastrophes along the way but no i look at the young younger generation and i see i i see tons of things that they know and embody they'll have their challenges just like we have ours but um i i do not despair i do not despair so that's my answer all right thanks thanks chris oh look at this someone we've not heard a lot from shane how are you this is jesus's secret weapon oh my i i was actually um oh well i became a catechumen since we last talked oh wonderful congratulations thank you thank you thank you um i was thinking because when you were talking to all those other people i was like instead of like talking should i just send you like this little postcard of notes it's just a million like scribbly deals um but so i think like one of the main things i was trying to well what's what's your question because this show is about questions yeah okay so i guess my question is and in looking for like a sense of wholeness in in the church because okay well first question okay so there's there's in does the totality of the story actually happen wherein there's an actual guy who is the anti-christ who is absolutely done he's done or is that a recurring story and this is something i've been trying to like because in my sense when i would go to like these bible churches and stuff yeah the way revelation played out would play out in an actual literal like uh in a physical way that mapped onto revelation one-to-one yeah so and so there's the preterist that says it happened there's the perennialist that says it always happens and there's the futurist that says it's going to happen right right and they're all they're they're they're all right in Christ like those those i don't think that those came about in um in like absolute falsehood right those things you know if you make a sect out of any of those things it's wrong but none of those things are wrong in Christ right i i think that's a good way to say it i think it's a good way to say it nicely done shane yeah another question or should we because i gotta i gotta keep moving i still got i got some celebrities behind you now there we'll see how long grim and chad wait they're used to getting uh access right away so go ahead all right um so i guess the other thing would be and then there's teachings outside of the church so jung had a quaternity where he thought that wholeness had to do with so there's the trinity which my patron saint defended but then there's also this weird uh the quaternity which puts satan somewhere in the story and he's not necessarily a bad guy like he's he's all the things that you know playing the devil's advocate is something we do for the sake of like wholeness and a sense of like uh what like not we played the devil's advocate because we don't want anybody to be that or something like that or i don't i don't know anything about young really so i ask me young questions i really can't answer because i've tried to read i've read some of young i started with his biography because of course my personal approach to things but some of his other work it's really tough sledding so yeah my father has all the guys i talk about that aren't saints he's like stop reading them yeah great to see you shane all right and oh there he is i was i was you you might not be here so good how are you no no i'm here i just uh i'm at work i've been running around um i was in the car before well your time has come what's your question so tiny bit of context but uh my best friend and i both kind of he was a as you can say i believe a raised in church that his whole life um myself not until after college but he would say that he um kind of had a resurgence in his faith around the same time that um i came to believe it's when we became best friends playing tennis together at the university of mississippi go revs um and the kind of first i came through the sort of jordan peterson um this little corner started listening to you quite early paul and lightner kind of that stream of a lot of content online but then more in the practical side kind of within my life came through some friends himself and my best friend included and sort of the first resources i guess you could say or stream at the church that i was sort of directed to um was through people like john mark comer uh that that conversation he commented on a few weeks ago um and threw him pretty quickly into the sort of dallas willard richard foster kind of spiritual formation um and so uh i've sort of had on one hand um physically going to a evangelical megachurches in texas where i live i'm a coach at baylor in hueco so sort of a mecca of the sort of southern baptist megachurch movement and in dallas that's where i've been going to church met my wife amazing experience a lot of amazing people um on the other hand uh you know very much a lurker in this little corner listening kind of you know non-stop for probably four years now um and then maybe a third thing would be reading a lot of the the more dallas willard richard foster tradition and so um i guess my question would be this is a topic of discussion between my best friend and i lately uh is you know where are some thoughts from you on the sort of gap i guess what he and i have been talking about i've identified of of older men uh specifically men within the church and sort of relationships between older men who are not pastors or priests necessarily and younger men not necessarily their sons uh within the church that are you know from that the comoran newhoff conversation sort of that discussion of stages four five and six yeah um and the necessity for these close long-term relationships yeah and so i'm sort of poking around the the question but do you see that as a pretty big gap and what do you see as i mean maybe i don't know potential solution is sort of a big thing to ask for but you know that's kind of all the inputs there and we've just been talking a lot about that because we both felt that as a felt need in our life and a lack as well and not necessarily wanting to cross over into the therapeutic you know like i hear your your critiques of john mark and that strain and the tendency towards the therapeutic yeah and so yeah just curious if you have any thoughts on that i do that is a great question so part of what happened in the counterculture and the rise of the jesus movement in and the see i think in a lot of ways the the breakdown of the american church began in the jesus movement in the counterculture and what you began having was uh churches that were segmented by by by generations um demographic generation and so then so obviously the jesus movement tended to be younger people now they're they're boomers now but they were younger people coming in and after that you had waves of church planting so the this this the the jesus people seeds the seeker movement and pasadena the church growth movement which had an ideology of birds of a feather flock together and so you had the you have the jesus movement you have the born again movement the rise of the evangelicals you have the seeker movement and that all sort of starts to come undone with the boomers and behind the boomers you have the x's with the emergent movement was sort of splits between kind of a mainline revival nadia bolts weber would sort of be a headliner for that and then a young restless and reformed which would be like mark driscoll and the young restless and reformed and then you have an audit that are sort of in between because you know people don't think about rob bell um mark driscoll uh nadia bolts weber they're all in the same generational cohort and john mark comer they're all in the same generational cohort and so then you get this you get this wave again of every time we planted churches in sacramento it was always young people young families and the older churches were over here and so then very quickly some of the people were looking around and saying we have all this wisdom dying in older churches all younger women were looking for older women to mentor them younger men were looking for older men to mentor them and actually when we got the jordan peterson then estuary movement going one of the things that we got from a lot of the young guys who started coming to it were i'm here because i want to find older men to listen to that are not clergy and i think i've never heard this point made before but i think actually one of the key elements that have made the young restless and reformed movement go especially in a church like the pca or in the axe 29 networks was that presbyterian form of government had lifelong eldership only for men and so what that produced in a lot of pca churches were older men who were mature in the faith then discipling younger men and they had to be men because it was the pca so i think one of the things one of the reasons that axe 29 and the pca and the young restless and reform movement flourished and has flourished in the way that it has it's got plenty of its own problems too but is exactly this point and now it's going to be interesting to see if this is a strength of complementarian churches what i mean by that is churches that won't allow women leadership because what then it tends to happen is that because women are sort of barred this entrance into the institution they sort of set up the dual tracks and so and this is what i saw in churches and other cultures and korean churches and hispanic churches were generally speaking they wouldn't go complementarian is that you'd more often have older men mentoring younger men and older women mentoring younger women now how this is going to play out in american orthodoxy will be interesting to watch but that is i think an element of conservatism and what's going to be happening there so does that answer your question at all yeah yeah i think that provides a ton of context and it rings true in the sense of a lot of the churches i've been around both as a member and then just friends i was in dallas for years and so you have a mix of the matt chandler's as well as a bunch of other axe 29 churches with more baptist churches yeah and they have these slight differences but there's a lot of similarities especially especially theologically really because you know the pastors if they sit down they could hash out the the differences they have but the the bodies of the church are largely especially young people are largely formed through relationships like what you're talking about and because of the thirst for those relationships with older men and i'm not saying this is a negative i might disagree with some things but the the theology tends to be shaped in the same way right like through the young wrestlers and reformed and it's often you know if you dig a little bit past the surface of why do you believe or why are you in this particular tradition or have you thought about these things it's you pretty quickly realize it's like oh well this was you know my dad and my dad's friends and the only men that i knew who were ever going to invest in me you know and so these men invested in me and and that's why i am you know i believe in jesus and i have this life and maybe that's how i met my wife and all these kinds of things at these churches and so you know it's a it's a communal thing like you talk about all the time it just for for my friend and i it makes it puts you in a little bit of a strange situation if you are uh you know fully committed to the to the church but not necessarily fully committed to all of the the axioms and the propositions and that can get a little bit in the way of that more sort of discipleship relationship that you're talking about uh past the first couple stages so anyways um great question i appreciate it great question thanks for jumping on good to see you yeah all right take care are we going to get to talk about dune you know that wasn't what i was planning to talk about oh okay well we we don't have to talk about dune sometime maybe you and i should have a conversation about dune because i just finished the book first book and i started the second and i had thoughts and um so and i love that you're engaging with um with damien i'm going to talk with damien coming up in a little while but um yeah keep i it's the corner's working baby keep uh keep doing what you're doing but what was your question now michael my question so is more um related to symbolism and um i had listened to the the audio book that uh josh butler put out and i know you would at one point you said you were going to have a conversation with him is that i have to circle back because that was before a whole that was like before my trip to europe and everything and so then i couldn't i couldn't make it work so i have to get back to him and do another conversation with him but i do want to do a little bit more reading of his before we talk so yeah i mean the book was great i thought and i think it's what was the he put out an audio book you said beautiful beautiful union it's the one about sex oh oh it's the one he got into all that trouble for yeah it's great it's great well so so here's my my thought so you know because um you know he's evangelical and and you know so you know we're having more evangelical maybe people you know a guy at my church actually came up to me the other day and said hey what do you know about jonathan pageau because um jonathan is speaking at like a conference for the um he the uh his kids go to like a classical charter school and he's gonna jonathan pageau is gonna be a speaker at their conference or something so he in you know so so like this stuff is cropping up or whatever but um you know i've noticed and and what you know that book is kind of talked about like in our culture like there are um there's a couple symbols that paganism looks like um let's see like if you can if you can see i don't know if you see it somewhere back there i love it we have a we have a question with a visual aid yeah well i'm at a job site and you know there's those like um there's these portable toilets here and if you go into those there is a handful of symbols that will be displayed by board people in there and they're the same ones you find in pompey and all over ancient greece and all their archetypal yeah yeah but you know when we're getting a lot of our kind of um uh newfound knowledge of symbolism through these christian traditions where they've had monastic orders and celibate priesthoods you know these are people that spent all their time contemplating every symbol except for those ones but you know on the other hand like you have like uh people like malcolm and simone and they're just putting that like that's a central topic in their you know their their conversations or whatever you know just a frank discussion about about sex and and all these things and i mean i think are we missing out by not taking advantage of that powerful symbolism oh boy uh attention um attention is important and uh whatever is true whatever is just let me think about what the apostle paul says in the book of philippians focus on these things so i would say let's find symbols that edify rather than um uh yeah i mean i think that's a good point edify rather than um uh yeah so i don't know i don't know it's an interesting question yeah i mean because i think you know there's certainly because i you know in my hopeful my hopeful take in opposition to malcolm and simone is i think that you know like the the jesus people kind of thing the jesus revolution there's going to be at some point an influx of urban monoculture people to our churches and they're not gonna they're not gonna have the the we don't talk about these things that way like filters built in so i don't i mean how do we how do we prepare that like his book is great because he diffuses a lot of the awkward i liked his first book a lot and so i haven't read his next book i'll have to look at it before i talk to him but i think i think the reaction the reaction just there was just recently an article in the new york times by ruth graham looking at like the conservative calendar with like hot conservative chicks with like guns and bikinis and stuff and she's like what's this about so i i think i think your question is a good one because um uh stuff comes around and it's it's good it's good you know peterson's quoting of young that sometimes you have to look in low places so uh that's a great question michael all right michael well you you uh you you keep doing what you're doing man and keep talking to doing stuff i'm enjoying it i'm i could think uh that's interesting stuff so leave comments paul if you're watching my stuff i want to comment so just just to know you're there you know all right i'll leave a comment say it'll be like my bathroom graffiti should i figure out how to make emojis and look like look put bathroom symbols in your comment section yeah sure i'll share my twitter all right michael thanks a lot all right corner citizen here he is hey best of all you don't use your real name anymore you've gotten that big that you know i'm you know now i just i mean honestly this is just a dodge i side note i have no idea where that came from are you putting that on i i had to represent i mean i know i get in trouble now and then because i i represent and i don't do it in the right way and then i get called on the carpet and and you know pretty soon what's going to come is some sort of vna disciplining and uh maybe grizzle you know i'll get a cease and desist letter from who would send me a seat from lance saying he is now he is now representing grim grizz and i have to stop using uh broken clock tower discord branding and symbols because i haven't paid the licensing fee he's gonna do that he's gonna do the licensing grift that's coming back wait everyone everyone's about to make money you know everyone's probably i don't know if it was on the freddy and paul show but ryan is sometimes on ryan is the guy who goes to the african anglican church and eat they baptized him recently but he always comes out in the middle of the service to eat our snacks after our church service and to be on the freddy and paul show and and last week he's like we're not getting paid for this oh i'm just waiting for freddy to find the grim grizz show i'm just waiting for freddy to actually maybe i'll send freddy grim grizz's phone number that could be interesting because because once once freddy has your phone number you hear about it you hear from about four or five times a day so chad you want me to give him your number chad that's not your i'm sorry go ahead alan what's your question yeah and yeah i'm still going by alan i just didn't want to channel with my name whatever i totally understand the um yeah a uh for the chat uh i want to point out that paul's doing the magic trick right now like he's doing like i like pointing out that he's it's about asking questions but then he ends up talking to getting you to talk more than you want to talk so this is how the magic trick gets done so i'd like to point out this is the spirit you know spirit of the age spirit of the corner in my opinion but uh and i'm really bad at it because i like talking but paul's really good at it so um the question i had is um the uh the you you've talked a decent amount about a youtuber who a relationship youtuber initials go by hm i'd prefer not to use his yeah yeah and uh one thing that i keep thinking about every time i see his content is we're not no one's talking about he's talking about the agent and no one's talking about the arena is all he talks about is how to win the game wow and no one talks about the game we're playing and it's like the reason he's popular is he because he explains how to win the game but we don't have to play the same game you can make a new game or the new i mean and the game's always changing anyway so it's always going to be different and you're always having but it's like as someone who goes to like a conservative church yeah girls think it's cool when you know how to like when you can quote the bible and quote scripture and that's not like they're not pretending that like they actually do that because you're winning in the arena of you know this particular arena but if you go up to a girl on the street and you're like hey like ever heard of john 316 like i mean that one hey christian girls in the church arena that are really into it find male christian competency hot yeah that i mean anybody who i've had pictures of me and my wife especially when we were young anybody that saw the two of us together would say wow paul sure married up well you know again in that church arena christian competency is hot and so i'm actually we are he and i are going to have a conversation coming up it's on the calendar so which could be interesting because i don't know if he's going to show his face i don't i have no idea how that conversation is going to go but i'm going to approach it it's it's it's more difficult with people that are they don't use their real name and they never show their face and so then i mean by virtue of what we are doing in this little corner is both sort of the epitome of what youtube could be and anti youtube because it's it's anyway so no you're exactly right and i've i've watched a lot of his content and i i often come away thinking yeah he's he's he's a sharp guy he's making good points but there's way more to the story that doesn't get committed it in his little three or five minute videos so hopefully we'll get at that and i know he's into integral theory because that comes through in his videos so i don't know did you have a question in there oh yeah i just how can we talk about the arena how can we talk about because i mean he always uses the like women now are like x and i get that that you need you have a three minute video you gotta bet it up but it's like maybe there's a spirit of the age that is broad that broad but like you're you're you're obsessed with like this this like oh well the arena is just kind of always there and it's always the same so women are like this these days they used to be like that but this is how you win the game and i'm like no there are a million different arenas that you could win that game inside of and maybe there's some threads that pervade all of them like i think it's sam is talking in the chat is talking about competency but competency and what competency how and that's just one i mean like and what you define is being attractive competency maybe you worked to become competent and looking good but maybe you were just born beautiful it's like are you competent and like competent you know it's something like competency yeah it's it's across all domains but because it's across all domains it's so broad as to almost be meaningless well competency as a term but each arena has its own competencies yeah and so and and like beauty is a really tricky one because it is it does cut across but it's a transcendental yeah so is goodness the good guy yeah and so the truthful guy you want to see a woman angry lie to her oh i mean there's a transcendental you lie to a woman or lie to a man so those are the transcendentals but um maybe what we need to do we need to have some more um maybe we need to have some more group conversations if you want to put together a group that wants to talk about this because i've done it with rod and catherine and amen and you know i hope to do more with them but if you want to put together another group to talk about this i i think it's good you know and and if you can't wait for me put together another group we got enough channels chad will put it on his channel chad will put chad will put almost anything on his channel right chad he says yes so um yeah but i think we this is a perennial topic here because well we got a lot of young men and a fair number of them are single and uh they'd like to not be single and we don't have what we maybe what we should do is find the female tlc out there and uh i don't know is there is there a is there another flotilla of eligible young women that would be compatible with our tlc dudes uh we've crashed landed and this planet of all we've crash landed on the planet of only women who need to reproduce their species you know i i don't know if we'll find the we'll find that um you know the amazonians have captured us and you know they you know but yeah i mean absolutely i i guess maybe this isn't a question and maybe i'm coming on tomorrow make a point but i just in my mind the arena is doing the heavy lifting that so often someone like hm puts on the individual and he's saying become so big and important and good that the woman you she derives all sense of she she can't help you're the one percent dude a hundred women are going after one guy becomes so big and strong and powerful that you that you can provide everything you can provide shelter food uh you're beautiful you're and and i know this isn't that much of a question but it's just like i keep screaming on my phone that's what the community does that's what the community like you can't every guy can't be the one percent but a definitionally yeah and b uh it's just like that like it's great if you can be that but like i don't even think you'd want to if you could yeah you're every she's every you know i mean imagine saying to your wife like you're gonna be my therapist you're gonna be the maid you're gonna be like it's just um it's just like why don't we talk about communities that are healthy enough to provide some structure and also support that like not every man is gonna be the like ultra nitchie and ubermensch and it's just like i get it because it works in some sense like if you become an ubermensch like good things probably will happen yeah but like not everyone so i don't know that wasn't much of a question but it just i don't know i'm just screaming at my phone like this is a way to get people interested in church in community is it's not just like oh you'll feel good and it'll be so nice it's like no it'll actually the things you want are better uh served church can be a great place to meet women yeah that's that was my strategy but i was already in school so all right great to see alan here he comes we're saving some of the best for last here i see the assassins i i just read something this morning grizz and i was thinking of making a video about it where this dude he was like an ubermensch and assassins were coming for him and and so he knew that he was a great guy with a bow so he shot the assassin with a bow but the assassin was able to sort of stagger up there and stick him with a knife and i thought oh this could be a good assassin story that's uh anyway they get close sometimes they fail doesn't mean they don't get close well i'm glad to see that they have they have failed up until this point it's good to see you grizz it's always it's always good when i do i'm going to try and bring a saint with me let's see real quick that one i have to get steven to translate but that's that's the one i'm bringing i have great news for you i have great news you're uh you're hosting a q a this is what this was supposed to be and um i only have one question for every time in the stream you've said grim gris and just that's how many questions i have for you you ready yes i think a lot of these people needed to be demonstrated how to ask you a question on a q a that is always the way it is so i thought i thought i would do that the first question is who is vowsh he's he's a streamer who that thing came about the guy who was trying to make a channel on modern debate he contacted me and he contacted this vowsh guy and i guess he's a very he's kind of a left wing streamer on left wing twitch and youtube and said i want you two to debate about jordan peterson i said okay um that's what happened who is destiny i so that's the only thing i know about destiny is that there's this one rationality rules video where rationality rules is trying to figure out about papa peterson and he says oh destiny gets him right so that's all i really know about destiny who is grim gris and but and yet and yet um you're devoting significant portions of your channel and the stream talking about these people oh so define significant portions it's the day last day and a half well yeah is that significant portions i've been doing this for seven years what's the connection between vowsh and destiny they're both streamers they're both left wing streamers and why did you decide to be or unprivatize your vowsh interview so close to the destiny peterson release because i thought that was a good example of having a conversation with a left wing streamer that actually went pretty well um man have you seen the new beetle juice trailer no it's it's coming back out this fall i'm terribly excited i'm gonna bring chat in because because we're all just friends here you can keep asking questions for us if they come back to me i certainly shall the those men have uh so as sullied or sullied more sullied reputations andrew tate really and so for peterson or you to voice them is significant really because they're because of their character so is this like analogous to uh trent's uh trent horns following complaining about them platforming him platforming sam i don't think the reasons that we think that these men are bad men are the reasons anyone would think sam is a bad well why are they bad men i don't know anything about them um the allegations i've been familiarized with are like cohabitating as man and wife with 14 year olds and such really that's that's the nature i've been told of the character of these men i didn't do my due diligence on the subject but i took the source at their word and because they're usually reliable on such matters and that's that's the area of concern wow we have about uh peterson i would have thought they'd be in prison for that yeah or or perhaps um under the thumb of an agency that could send them to prison at a moment's notice and therefore they do what that agency says but anyway the the stream was glowing so hard and my name was dropped so often i had i felt as though i needed the beetle juice well i think jordan peterson needs a grim gris to keep him up to date on these things because nobody i would never know this if i didn't have you gris so you know it's the the other the other a lot of other flotillas on the internet uh obsess around these sorts of uh character defects and people getting away with it and famous and rich for it um and so i hear things i hear things in the saltier parts of the internet wonders oh okay well sorry i dropped your name so much gris it's okay it's okay it's done great it's done great for me for so far but now that you're going into the dating sphere it's getting a little awkward this move here is i don't know that i want to be associated with that sort of conversation but yeah all right all right well chad has left me so i don't know maybe this is the end of the stream chad we like him about two hours right yeah i usually go two hours it's two hours and two minutes now i could i could i could play some branding i suppose that would that would seem appropriate so anyway so thank you all for for joining us here on the live stream and um maybe i'll play this one so that's my old name oh we're not done yet i chad i i you know i was worried that maybe either the assassins or the traffic had um had ended it but um you're muted so i can't hear you so this isn't going to do much for the audio version of this chat i don't know if i can unmute you oh now i've got you unmuted and then he's gone oh my so so okay now we're ready ready for freddy ready for freddy are you steady are you rolling in a chevy are you getting it ready i set the mic straight to the top talk to this hip-hop gang no shame doing it chad i'm i'm doing the best i can for you man man you're unmuted uh i don't know if your cell signal's gonna hold it so all right gonna call it my friend gonna call it we'll we'll we'll get out of here on psalm one do do The city's the man who does not want you Council of the wicked For a stand in the way of sinners Or sit in the seat of martyrs But his delight is in the love of the Lord And on his lawn he never takes day and night He is like a tree planted by streams of water Which yields its fruit in season And whose leaf does not wither Every faith he does prosper Not so the wicked They are like chaff that the wind blows away Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous But the wicked of the wicked shall perish The wicked of the wicked shall perish The wicked of the wicked shall perish Blessed is the man who does not walk Blessed is the man who does not walk In the council of the wicked For a stand in the way of sinners Or sits in the seat of martyrs But his delight is in the love of the Lord And on his lawn he never takes day and night He is like a tree planted by streams of water Which yields its fruit in season And whose leaf does not wither Every faith he does prosper Not so the wicked They are like chaff that the wind blows away Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous For the Lord watches over the way of the righteous But the way of the wicked shall perish The wicked of the wicked shall perish The wicked of the wicked shall perish The wicked of the wicked shall perish The wicked of the wicked shall perish The catchphrase I say people, I say go to church. What I mean by that is in some ways you have to engage in the human relationships around you. That's like the best way to go about that. You know, you have a relationship, you have a family, you have some kind of community around you. And so that's the best place to go because in some ways that's the place that will have this procedural aspect to it that will ground the other stuff. It's like if you have to help your kids with their homework or you have to do this kind of really grounded stuff that has very little to do with the ideology. You get engaged in other people's lives and it binds you in a different way. And then like my father would, he was going to church and I wasn't really living with him. But he was going to church and he would like kind of see that. Those are elements of this conversation. I got to go to church. It's being part of a church is part of Christian discipleship. And in that word discipleship, there's this word discipline, which is it's a discipline to go to church. I was what would be so great about actually going to a church is like you start going to a church so that when you do need like to be prayed for and you have something to be prayed for about, you have a place to just say that. You're dead on right, Grizz. And that is what the church is for to know and be known, to love and be loved, to have a place to go where people can pray for you, where they will welcome you in. And this is again part of why I'm, you know, I want churches to have estuaries because I know that it is difficult in many churches for people to, in a sense, come in and bring their real self. And what I mean by that, you have to say what's on their mind or you can't wrestle with them. It's like, you know, so Plato, you know, that's John reminds us is broad. So he's a wrestler. You can't wrestle over a screen. So maybe if it's paintball for Jesus, maybe it should be wrestling with Plato because and in church in a real space, now often it doesn't happen. I understand that. But at least there's a chance to actually have a relationship with grip. And that's part of why churches are local. They're relational. They're face to face. They're in real life. That about why would young people want to go to church? And I feel like I want to have some kind of dynamic message or something that if they do find some reason to come, you know, I'm trying to fish on throwing bait and I'm trying to hook somebody. That's what Paul is going to do. He said about being evangelical evangelism of some sort. Well, fishers of men is the is the promise. Yes. Yes. Correct. We did go to church today. I took a meeting. I don't go to church to think or to rationalize God. I go to church to worship him. Right. And I'm happy with that. And I'm very happy with that. And afterwards, during coffee hour, we can all argue about the God of our understanding. Right. But I think you're right. I think that the wild twin, I mean, I the thing that led to my my sort of dawning to consciousness of Christianity was a 101 day vigil that I did in forest. And I went into the forest.
