 I received a number of comments that people wanted my videos in audio only format and a more convenient podcast format I batted that around a lot in my head and Finally decided to go ahead and proceed with it So I'll leave some links below where you can find my audio versions of at least my recent ones I haven't done all the back ones yet on Podbean and then I also sent a feed to iTunes and I'll leave those links down below So if you want to get my videos or you want to share my videos with someone and it's for many many more people It's can more convenient to listen to them and most of what I do here is audio so you can find the links below about how to Download them and stream them via podcast instead of on YouTube But I think at this point YouTube will continue to be primary I'm trying to figure out if I'm gonna put some of my church stuff on Podbean as well That'll probably be on a separate feed just like my church videos my sermons and my Sunday school classes are all on the Living Stones YouTube channel and or on the Living Stones Facebook page, and I'll put those Links in the comment below as well, so I hope this meets some of your needs those of you who have asked for it and Go ahead and download
