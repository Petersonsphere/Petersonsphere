 Hi, this is Paul. I'm back from my vacation had a wonderful vacation visiting my mother and my family in Massachusetts And I'm back in Sacramento. I give a little update on my channel. All my projects are still out there and I Just keep plunking away at them as I can. I've got a number of conversations with pastors planned I was there was a reddit conversation a couple days ago when I was in Massachusetts and Someone may had questions about pastors and they're thinking about Peterson So I'm gonna actually have a number of conversations planned with pastors some about Peterson And then I wanted to do some other conversations with some CRC ministers about some other things So my channel isn't just about Jordan Peterson, even though right now he's occupying a lot of my thought and a lot of my attention, but my Channel is about stuff. I think about and work on so I'm gonna do some more work in this monarchical monarchical vision that I was talking about in my last two videos and Yeah, so there'll probably be a couple more videos coming out about that I'm getting more requests for doing some writing I want to keep both video and writing and of course my day job So I'm gonna have to see how I can do all this and I you know I was away and so I'm I haven't gone through the comment section for a week I'm probably not gonna try and go back through all the comments. I missed I'm sorry It's there's just too many comments for me to work through I might do it if I get a chance if I get some time, but we're coming up to Easter on April 1 and Easter's a busy time for pastors. So Things aren't things aren't slowing down, but there were there were a bunch of really interesting Things coming out recently just today. I saw Bishop Baron did a video about Peterson, which I thought was a lovely video and Quite you know quite positive and now we mentioned Gnosticism and and the the way Bishop Baron used the word Gnostic in in that video I understand because that's one of the uses of the Gnostic word the my objection a few months ago to the use of Gnosticism with Peterson was was much more relating to whether Peterson is aligned with ancient Gnosticism Baron is using the the word more in this in the sense of how does Peterson relate? Christianity to history and is Jesus death and resurrection an archetypal story or is it historical and You know obvious as a as a pastor of an in a conservative denomination. I believe it's historical But I think we have to do a lot of much more careful thinking about Our own culture in terms of our own assumptions about history and this for those of you who have listened carefully You know, this is an issue that I've got I'm doing a lot of thinking about and so We'll hear more about that coming up, but I thought Bishop Barron's video about Peterson was was really quite good He was very very positive. So that was that was quite interesting. There's also a very negative Article about Peterson that came out in current affairs very long and and I commented on Twitter that I Mean if there's a little bit of irony with this guy's complaint about obscured tism Did I say that right? Obscure and tism with Peterson is his article was pretty long But it was you know, it was also very negative. I think I know a lot of Peterson fans will object to it It's gonna be interesting to see, you know, if Peterson takes this article on or not or just lets it go by He's got so much on his fork right now He can't take you can't take everything on but it was I found it an interesting article and yeah, I read it I don't I don't just I I don't think you know If you're a Jordan Peterson fan, you should just you know, read the positive things and then disagree with the negative things I think it's important to read all of them and weigh them because the truth is sometimes we learn the most from our critics and so if if someone's If someone's making criticism well listen to them and see if there's see if there's anything that you can gain from it there was a there was a David French who's who's a who's a writer that He's written some really good things in the past that I've that I've read in National Review had and again of quite a positive Review of Peterson's 12 rules, you know now that now that Peterson's got a much a popular book out It's much easier for a lot of people who are not going to sit down and and Watch hours and hours of YouTube to get a picture about who Jordan Peterson is And so I thought it's part of the reason that we're seeing So many people out there writing about him and this is part of the reason I've got some friends saying now it's now it's time to do a little bit of writing because I've done, you know, done a lot of blogging and stuff in my past but Writing is it's a different medium But but you're able to engage people who don't have time to watch hours and hours of YouTube I had the opportunity on my vacation to try to explain Jordan Peterson to a number of people including my family and Maybe I'll do a little video about a three or four minute elevator pitch in terms of who Peterson is Why he's important and why I'm getting involved with him, you know part of this is because in terms of politics, I've I've always kind of been center-left and And so some of my Friends who are you know from different periods of my life or a little alarmed at the new company I'm keeping But you know, that's that's that's their problem more than mine. I am who I am and I've always been who I am. So It's it's been interesting watching this and going through this journey for me also first things now now first things is a Christian blog and Periodical mostly from Roman Catholic groups You know quite quite intellectual and and you know politically tends to lean well And this is where our left-right distinctions in politics really don't hold true because you know The Roman Catholic Church has their own political weather. It's a it's an ancient huge organization And so, you know trying to put the Roman Catholic Church on the US political left or right Doesn't doesn't really fit very well But but Matthew Schmidt who's written a number of things in first things again had quite a you know Quite an approving article about Peterson and first things I was you know, that was quite interesting to read Also the Gospel Coalition Joe Carter Joe Carter is a another he's a very sharp in this case a reformed Christian writer writes for the Acton Institute the Acton blog But also the Gospel Coalition the Gospel Coalition is a group of conservative Reformed Confessionally conservative reformed churches and pastors some you know some celebrity pastors like Tim Keller John Piper and And a variety of others and so again it was it was interesting to read Joe Carter's take on Peterson and you'll notice that most people are talking about the the Jordan Peterson phenomenon because it's the it's the interest of many of you who are thinking about Christianity in a different way because of Peterson that is getting the interest of the likes of Bishop Barron and myself and Joe Carter and and first things and I'm really happy about this because one of my concerns is that Those of you who are gaining interest in Christianity will get the cold shoulder from the church because the pull you know in terms of the The mainline churches many of you won't tolerate the mainline churches because of a lot of what Peterson would call neo-marxist post neo-marxist post modernism and and a lot over on the right hand side of the church You know their their fundamentalist streak will also kind of alienate a lot of Peterson fans and so my concern has all along been will will those of you who are Looking to explore Christianity find good Conversation partners and those of you who want to join churches. Will you be able to find? Good churches where where you can begin Where you can begin What is of my interest obviously as a Christian minister where you where you can begin to explore the Christian life So, you know, these have been my concern. So i've been happy to see a lot of these these pieces come out Another piece which wasn't about Jordan Peterson directly But some of you might be interested in was was in was by Andrew Sullivan And again, Andrew Sullivan for years had the Daily Dish an early important blogger He contrasted Steven Pinker with Patrick Patrick J Deneen, I haven't read his book why Why liberalism has failed but this was this was quite a good piece by Andrew Sullivan and and Rod Dreher commented on this piece that and I think he's right that Andrew Sullivan is doing some of the best writing of his life as many of you know, Andrew Sullivan is a um a gay Roman Catholic man, you know, he doesn't fit into a lot of boxes easily I mean the last third of his article he usually writes these three-part articles, you know goes back over into his um Very interesting piece on anti-semitism but then but then on to his battle against circumcision And that's something that Andrew Sullivan has been at but but this but this piece talking about Steven Pinker and Deneen if if I don't know how to say Deneen's name but you know how You know according to Pinker, you know life has never been so good and then Deneen points out well Then why are we feeling this nihilism and this angst and this is very much the the space that Jordan Peterson is walking into and the space that he is he is dealing with and also I'm In my to-do list I've got um the Jordan Peterson's Melbourne speech, which is an audio speech That's been posted and it's in on youtube in a bunch of different places when it comes to his the question of him and religion I think this was an important speech in terms of him continuing to think out loud It's pretty clear that Peterson does like to think out loud and and then also the swede Um has the second interview with Peterson and they and the swede mentioned CS Lewis So i'm gonna have to do some treatment of that. So these are these are some of the things in my in my upcoming videos i'm getting the There we go. These are some of the things in my upcoming videos that i'm going to be Doing and so just wanted to give you a little channel update and maybe tomorrow I'll have a video i'll have a rough draft to sunday video out because i've got to preach this sunday And then might even have a conversation about realism with a Dutch graduate student in philosophy who was also a reformed christian. So if we're able to pull that off tomorrow Should be some interesting stuff. So thanks for watching. Thanks for subscribing to the channel and for posting interesting comments this entire experience for me has been It's it's been dramatic and And those of you out there who are listening I'm a little backed off i'm a little backlogged down to my emails, too I've gotten emails from a number of you and and facebook messages So i'll try to get i'll try to get responses to you again when i'm on vacation I prioritize spending time with family, but but this entire process has been You know are really one of the most interesting chapters of my professional life In terms of dealing with peterson and this youtube experience learning all that I have from from so many of you in the comments and the emails that you've sent me and the facebook messages that you've sent me and the You know the links that many of you have sent me sometimes I can't keep up with it all But as if many so those of you who remember when I first got into this when I had 2,000 subscribers I was kind of freaking out because I wasn't used to that now we got about 4,400 subscribers and and that's okay. The rate of growth isn't too crazy again for me this has been a process of of learning and exploring and So many of you out there have made this process enjoyable and rewarding and so I really appreciate all the Fascinating conversations I had I wish I had double the amount of time in the week to devote to this But you know, I'm a I'm a pastor and a father and a husband and all of those things So this kind of squishes into the time that I can carve out for it So thanks for watching and you'll be seeing more of me this week
