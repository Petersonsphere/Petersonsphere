 Hi, this is Paul. I had the video I posted this week, a conversation I had this week with Poe the Person, another YouTuber, an engineer from the UK. Really a tremendous conversation. I've let it play for two days now basically on the channel because I thought it was that helpful and productive a conversation. And you know, we went, when I talked to her initially, I said, well, I usually plan out, just make space for two hours because, you know, sometimes it goes that way. And she's kind of like, well, I don't know, I don't do anything that long, but it went two hours went fast. And so I hope to hope to talk to Poe again. And I thought it was a really productive conversation. Part of why I do conversations like this is because it prompts me and challenges me to extend myself and to grow and to reach. And one of the most, one of the points of the conversation that really grabbed me was when she basically asked, do you think I believe in God? And I thought part of what's interesting about Poe is that she sort of came about at the same time in terms of YouTube that I did. She corrected me. It was really her first video as a woman who's an engineer talking about the James DeMore business that that's sort of the first video that caught attention. And then she was fascinated by Jordan Peterson. And she just had a real good way of throwing out some of these one liners. You know, the Tolkien is the fan fiction of the Bible and came for the culture war, stayed for the religion. That was I think I'd heard it before. But the way she said it and the context in which she said it was really terrific. But the, you know, the degree to which we were able to have the conversation, and this has been true of all of my estuary type experiences, is based on the fact that in many ways the Christian church and society in general, for some real reasons, and I'm going to go into some of those reasons in this video, but not all of them, has really divided the world into God believers and non-God believers. But that distinction is not quite as obvious as all of the YouTube atheist versus Christian debate videos would have you believe. For example, in Psalm, when I do this stuff off the top of my head often get things wrong, I believe it's Psalm 14, the fool says in his heart there is no God. In the ancient world that's not an atheist, the ancient world basically someone is saying God does not see. I'm going to do two videos today hopefully, one is on, one is the one that you're watching, the other one is for my church channel which I'm going to post probably today on my church channel and maybe on my personal channel a day or two later depending on how it goes. But on whether, you know, to what degree, and this came up in my conversation with Poe, to what degree the Bible is related to other ancient literature? Is the Bible just like every other book? That's a really, just like more, most of the important questions are in some ways simple and in some ways so complex we can't fathom them, and that's a question like that. But in the ancient world when they said the fool says in their heart there is no God, they weren't an atheist like someone today would be. And that's why Charles Taylor wrote his massive book, A Secular Age, because something dramatic happened in Western culture over the last 500 years and Charles Taylor begins his book saying why is it that 500 years ago belief in God was axiomatic, everybody assumed it, everybody understood that. You could find people who were charged of atheism and accused of atheism, but you know in many ways we have Jordan Peterson to thank for sort of defanging this cultural trope around atheism, and here I've got a picture on the slide of Jordan Peterson at Lafayette College during the question and answer when that student says, you know, what is religion? And Peterson basically talked about someone's axioms and whether or not, to what degree people are conscious of their own religion, and so to what degree people's ideas of the do you believe in God, whether that actually yields a productive and illuminating conversation is very dependent on, I hope my sound levels aren't too low. There I turned him up, I'm not going to, I'll probably yell later in the video or raise my voice, but the degree to which someone really thinks about that or knows what they believe in is not entirely clear, and of course Peterson in the tradition of Jung and Freud, the discovery of the unconscious and the subconscious knows this, that we are mysteries to ourselves and we are not open books to ourselves and we are not in control of ourselves, and this is why it's usually unproductive to suddenly lambast someone for something they say they do or don't profess belief in, and actually as a pastor, this is a very common ministerial trope that basically pastors are continually telling their congregations they don't believe sufficiently in God, they don't trust sufficiently in God, they don't believe in the resurrection because their life does not display what their profession says it should, and so this has been well known in church circles and this is basically a common thing for pastors and for anybody doing ministry, so the idea that we're just going to pay a whole lot of tension, again it's worth paying attention to, if someone says they're an atheist, okay, I listen to that, I take them at their word, but I also have a context in which I understand that and that's why you have this saying, no atheist in foxholes, and I know it really annoys some people and it is a generalization, it is a clich√©, it is a truism, but there's something behind it that for many of us when push comes to shove, when everything hits the fan, we find ourselves praying, praying to something or someone or the universe and in Poe's experience she finds herself giving thanks and C.S. Lewis had a comment to the effect of, you know, the truly terrifying moment for an atheist is when, you know, praise wells up and who do I thank, who do I praise, and so Jordan Peterson, you know, do you believe in God or you don't believe in God, that interview on firing line, you know, he was, you know, he could be annoying, Jordan Peterson could be deeply annoying, but in some ways with respect to this he was annoying in all the right ways, yeah, Coy, yeah, he's playing games, but what he's doing is he's prompting people to reach deeper for better answers and that's not entirely different from what preachers do and so he was very right that he didn't want people to assume agreement on what he understood, how he understood God, and how he understood belief to be and so, you know, fair enough Jordan and keep giving your quirky, mysterious answer. He actually got a lot of mileage out of it and, you know, he had a couple speeches and always seemed to be in Australia that these speeches came to a head, Sydney, Melbourne, but I think it was in Sydney where he talked about it extensively and then made a clip from that video and so in many ways it's an invitation to dig deeper into the question, well what do you mean by God and what do you mean by belief? Those are really important things to follow through on. Now again, and, you know, talking to Ryan Bennett, and I've got another conversation with Ryan that may or may not air here, you know, it was the rise of the celebrity atheists, the new atheists, kind of prompted at the same time Rose when YouTube came about and created a genre for what would sort of be the predecessor for the Pangburn Jordan Peterson Sam Harris talks before, of course, Pangburn didn't do it right, let's say it that way, but you know, so I found this picture of William Lane Craig who in some ways became, you know, the celebrity and here he's got, you know, like GI Joe with like life beard and kung fu argument grip and, you know, so there are these videos just proliferate about, you know, William Lane Craig owning and defeating atheists and the atheist owning and it's a game and, you know, we never saw that more clearly than the recent Trump Biden debate. This isn't about argument and part of the reason, part of what's exposed in this game playing and I'm not saying that the people doing this are doing anything wrong. I think it's a perfectly legitimate thing to do in many ways, but what's really at fault underneath is the implicit assumption of what a human being is and how a human being works that somehow human beings are these rational creatures that believe things on the basis of argument and this modernistic correlative assumption of truth and of course, Jordan Peterson said, well, when we say someone's aim is true, what are we saying and does that relate to truth? Well, it does, but most of the language that we use, we're only 60 to 70% even aware of everything we're saying or in touch with the larger scope of what that word or that language is actually meaning or doing and so I think these debates are, I think they're helpful, appropriate, but they don't result in, they're also illusory and deceptive in that they sort of tease us into imagining human beings are and are capable of the kind of supposed modernistic rationality that these debates play on. That, well, okay, once all the arguments are there, then I'll believe it. Again, humans do sometimes reach to those heights and that experience is important and again, I don't want to simply dismiss it, but probably only a tiny fraction of the human population actually is that way or is capable of that, whether by formation or temperament or whatever goes into this mysterious thing we call a human being and for that reason, we watch the debates, we learn from the debates, the debates can be productive on and on, but the debates never finish the story or close the deal or very seldom in the way that we imagine they should. They become data points and points that we plot all along the way because that's simply not how human beings are, at least most human beings are or most human beings work and this is why the work of the celebrity atheists always will only reach a certain degree of population and why in many ways atheism numbers remain a minority in the population because it's just not how human beings are or at least are not today. Atheists imagine that well with proper training, yada, yada, yada, but no, it's not going to happen, not in anything near any of our lifetimes given everything that the atheist evolutionary biologists assert to be true of us. The programming is simply too old and as I'll talk about a little bit later in the video, the best science suggests that this approach is perhaps an aspect and a reflection of a certain archaic science that actually started to deconstruct and decompose at the beginning of the 20th century and socially was reached its peak but also began to decline in the killing fields of the first world war. So yeah, I continue to enjoy these videos to a degree but at some point you realize they never achieve what we imagine they should achieve and so for that reason rather than doing let's say some bloodsport atheist debate, I would rather have a productive conversation with someone again similar to what I did with Vouch. I think it's, and again that isn't to say that a no holds barred going at each other can't produce certain amounts of insight and light but they tend to produce more heat than light and so if you're able to produce more light than heat, you always need a little bit of heat because we need that too as human beings but you want to get the mixture right, you want to get the relevance realization correct in terms of where it goes and that's why personal testimony, you can find a ton of that here, you know Brian Korn's Brian Head Welch surrenders to Jesus and you know one point, you know over a million views on that video and it's, I don't know the channel that it's on or anything like that but it's sort of a common Christian exercise to have people tell their stories. Why did you decide and if you listen to his, if you listen to his testimony as Christians call it, if you listen to his story he, and this is sort of a Kanye West story and it happens to to many people who in our culture we suppose have everything a human being wants, status, money, access to sex, access to material goods, financial security, you name it, discover that it's empty and then you know he goes to church because a friend invites him and he embraces Jesus and it's all that kind of language and but on the other side here's another video with six million views on Buzzfeed, people tell a pastor why they don't believe in God and and again as a pastor many of the reasons they give in terms of their personal testimonies are common and I hear them all the time and none of them would surprise most of you, the problem of evil, all these sorts of things and actually in the, because when I make two videos in one day they're they're really kind of intertwined and so once I post this video on my personal channel if you're really curious about the other video you can find it on the church channel and the church channel is a lot smaller and part of the reason it is is because I've actually got some ideas about what we like in YouTube, you want to know what we, you know, want to know what we like in YouTube which is in some ways the child of television, what we like is the face, up close, the eye contact, the emotional connection and as Pajot said you know right now I'm a being of light telling you what to think and that plays on our circuitry in in deep ways and so for that reason videos that are personal and up close and connect with us in the ways that we connect one on one with human beings well you know you can manipulate people this way, you can you can do lots of things to people this way so that's part of the reason I started using OBS so now I can do all these fun things in the video I can make me bigger and smaller bigger and smaller but I part of the reason I make these videos the way I do with myself in the corner is that if you're watching the video and if you're looking at me it doesn't really matter quite how large I am I have to be big enough so you can see and connect and again it depends on what size screen if you're watching on a television or if you're on your smartphone but there's stuff going on in here and that's part of the reason the personal testimony is so enduring and so powerful and it's part of the reason that that this type of debate is of limited use the personal testimony in many ways is far more powerful with normal human beings because we are personal and that's how we operate and I'm going to get into that a little bit later in this video too now here and there's another one of these videos a friend of mine is really into Durbin and and so I'm winding up with more and more of because we he and I work at church and we do stuff at church and so he's he's some of his video YouTubing taste have colonized some of the accounts that that we're sharing as I'm putting as we're doing work at church here but but um so here's a you know epic debate over God's existence over a million views and so I listened to a little bit of the debate and like so many debates there's a mutual assumption again there's a modernist frame that that both are sharing and again there's modernity just is I mean you don't have to feel guilty about it it's better to understand it it's it's it's brought us tremendous power and wonderful things and um we should thank God for for modern liberalism in many ways and many of the fruits that it's offered as as NT Wright said I don't want a pre-modern dentist and I don't want a post-modern dentist I want a modern dentist I you know I want someone who's going to work on my teeth it's a great quote about Napoleon's I'm in a biography of Napoleon again right now and um Napoleon you know Josephine was this remarkable beauty of the Napoleonic era and of course so colonized Napoleon but but one person remarked if only she had had teeth because apparently she was from the the Caribbean and Martinique and she just had these little black stubs so all of her smiles are closed mouth because if only she had had teeth she could have ruled the world Josephine the great beauty women women don't know the power they have and they so often want masculine power and it's like you've got that power great power comes great responsibility anyway Josephine um both in these videos usually embrace the the modernist assumption that the the mutual assumption that God is one super thing amidst the conglomeration of other things and so basically these debates boil down to is that super thing real can you find that super thing and well if if that super thing were real we should be able to find it and have evidence for it because you know there are lots of super things in in the physical world like gravity etc etc etc but of course the key the key mention is physical and those of you who've been following my my sermons either on the rough draft on my personal channel or you know you do I'll make an admission here the rough drafts are exactly what I say they're rough drafts and sometimes they get better and sometimes they get worse on Sunday so if you're ever curious about if you listen to a rough draft and you think I'm kind of curious about what happened to that rough draft you can usually find the sermon either on the church website or on the church youtube site but you know God is the super thing but in the third commandment part of behind the third commandment or the second commandment you shall not make a graven image you shall not make a little statue or you shall not represent me from anything in the creation to one degree or another Christians sort of violate the second commandment when they kind of creep towards indulging this kind of thing now if you listen to my remarks on the second commandment it's impossible for us to relate to a god which we are invited into if we don't have at least some sort of representation in our minds or in our communities etc etc of course the incarnation comes with Jesus and I talk about that actually in the other video because again these videos are coming together because I made these these videos kind of co-created at the same time but but God is not one super thing amidst the conglomeration of other things and and I've talked about that on my channel a lot with respect to the meta divine realm and the hebraic conception of God so these debates boil down to is that thing out there and if it's out there surely there would be evidence for it and if there was evidence for it the world wouldn't be such a mess and again in the other video I'm going to talk about you know the great puzzle that I think has has been at the center of a lot of religious and philosophical and personal debate about this question but when you start the question in the wrong foot as if God is one super thing amidst the conglomeration of other super things it isn't going to go well and and there's not going to be any real winning and as I said about modernist assumptions about how human beings operate even if you do win the debate so what people aren't necessarily going to ah suddenly they're flocking into church maybe one or two well but the majority of human beings don't work that way the Christian Hebrew assertion of the conception of God is not that that God is not one super thing amidst the conglomeration of other things he's not like Zeus he's not like um he's he's not like any of those things and Jesus is not a demigod that is not Christianity at least confessional um consular Christianity that that was founded by Jesus Christ and his disciples and was was expressed through the church councils as it went on and I keep pushing this point again it's an analogy and I love the way Brett Sockel talked about analogies that you need them but they all fall short and can Frodo find Tolkien in Middle-earth Tolkien is not a super thing in Middle-earth like Sauron or Gandalf or anything else Tolkien is shot through Middle-earth but you can't find Tolkien in Middle-earth but you can find Tolkien everywhere in Middle-earth and and I think in many ways and this argument isn't new to me CS Lewis made this argument with respect to the space shot and the the atheistic Russians made the point we went up into the heavens and God wasn't there and so in many ways I'm borrowing this argument from Lewis and Lewis probably borrowed it from someone else I just updated it with Tolkien and Frodo because why not but but that's the point and so many of these debates they go nowhere because they start from a bad place now Glenn over at speak life in the UK I did a little interview with him recently and he's been doing a series of videos and pulling in some clips from Zizek but also Tom Holland and Douglas Murray who you know come for the culture war stay for the stay for the religion and and basically they're making what should be an obvious point but we've simply have neglected in our haste and in some ways we've neglected it because of this both church-fueled and atheist-fueled game of accentuating the line between atheist and Christian at least in the in the contemporary frame now again remember what I said about psalm is it psalm 10 or psalm 14 I think it's psalm 14 remember what I said about the psalm the fool says in his heart he is no god that's not talking about the kind of atheism that people find themselves being today it's talking about a much more common thing that impacts Christians as well that God is not present and you can touch on that and you can see some of that in my my most recent sermon on the third commandment you shall not you should not take up the name the name of the Lord your God in vain and what does that mean so so Christians are motivated to accentuate the gulf between Christians and atheists for a lot of reasons partly for you know their tribal reasons of enlarging their market share and as at least in the United States church attendance has declined and God was recruited to help fight the cold war against the atheists atheistic Russians yada yada and then after 1991 the emphasis on resisting religious fundamentalism and so the the the popular conceptualization of do you believe in God and how this plays in the culture well again it's it's reasonable it's it's fine looking at but it doesn't tell us what we think it tells us because that's not how human beings are and so Christians want to grow their market share and their institutional market share and you know being a pastor I loved some of Poe's questions about what a lot of people have a lot of questions what's it like to be a pastor and being a pastor is so many parts of so many different things you know grow I mean part of what my job is that I've done poorly at is you know keep living stones alive you know grow the market share make living stones grow that's a legitimate aspect of my job but it's dependent on lots of other things so Christians you know hammer this Christian eight hammer this atheist drum a lot for these reasons because we feel influence and cultural power and institutional durability slipping away and so well let's go out there and attack some atheists and and people are sort of in the middle we can kind of energize them and get them into church because if we if we have all these have all these debates we kind of ramp people up and get them excited and it's it's sort of again like well we're playing on all the kind of things that John Verveke quite rightly says we shouldn't play with which is let's sort of con people into my institution and and let's woo them and persuade them and let's get them all excited and as as what we we've seen the political parties do I think to the detriment of the nation is keep pushing the fear button and both sides do it because you know you can drive people to the vote the polls with fear fear the other candidate and and what percentage of people are going to go into the elections now voting against Trump or against Biden and they say well I might not like the guy or agree with him but I hate the other guy more so you keep pushing that fear button and churches in some ways have been doing this and churches should stop see I know I'd raise my voice you know but not this whole motivation isn't all bad as you know almost everything in this world is multi-variable and then there are there are better variables and worse variables and so Christians are also motivated out of authentic love and concern about eternal damnation and that's a complex thing too that I'm not going to get into right now but that's a big whether you believe it or not that's a big thing that motivates many Christians and and many and Penn Jillette noted it he said you know if you really believe in an eternal damnation you should fight me tooth and nail to get me to believe in God fair point Penn Jillette right on and and many Christians that I know who are wonderfully loving people are are deeply earnest and concerned about an eternity God that many people face any a Christless eternity I'll say it that way and that's true it's legitimate I agree I'm evangelical enough to share their concern and to be motivated by this okay and it's not just evangelical it's it goes all the way back to I believe to the apostles but but again all of our frames get different over time and just like the fool says in his heart there is no God that atheism is not necessarily exactly like the atheism that we're experiencing today or I have in my mind and the way you know part of being a Protestant and a Catholic and Orthodox of course too but part of being a Protestant is to is to work the questions hard and to say to what degree can I at least capture some of the essence of Christianity that we see in Jesus Christ and in Paul and the apostles and to what degree can I bear witness to that because of course the book of Acts as Jesus telling us you will be my witnesses and so part of what being a Christian is is continue to try to to get at the essence of Jesus Christ but now in the context of the contemporary world to manifest that in the place I do today and so there is no God I think it's going to be awfully hard to relate to God if you say he doesn't exist so I think that's a real reason to engage in that but but the point of of Tom Holland and Douglas Murray is and Jordan Peterson is you're way more Christian than you imagine even if you don't believe in God and the point that preachers tell their churches are you're way more secular than you imagine even if you come to church all the time and pray and give money and do all of those things and keep you know your prayer gyri so you can see which prayers get answered and and and when there's a real crisis is the more people pray we're like Horton here's a cue a hue Horton here's a who and of course the who's are these tiny little creatures on a tiny little bit and and the if you've ever seen the the cartoon version of Horton here's a who the evil monkeys have the elephant because the elephant is faithful 100% and the elephant with his big ears hears the little who's in Whoville and they're about to be about to be destroyed by the by the evil monkeys and the little who's are out there with their little ear trumpets and things we are here we are here we are here and so Christians are like we need all the Christians to devote ourselves and to pray and they have biblical warrant for such a thing but atheists look at that say oh gosh roll their eyes these Christians and the the games that they're playing and atheist apologists have have had their own moral crusade like that you know since Voltaire although Voltaire was not an atheist Voltaire was again one of these people that was you know Voltaire's religious beliefs is complex but but you know sort of a like many people who say things like it's important for the culture to have religion because some people need it and of course you've got Jesse Ventura Christians you know the people with their crutches of religion but you've got other people that say yeah human beings need religion it's good for them and now depending on how good the religion is it might be good or might be bad but you know there's that market share too and again we so reliably we so reliably BS each other and bring the camera in close and talk with the smooth voice and give the earnest appeal every preacher knows how to do this and and again it's not illegitimate it's a way of communicating but but we we tend to fall you know we we're tend to suckers for this for these kinds of tricks and tropes because there it is but the reality is well you can energize an atheist base you can energize a church base if you keep pushing the fear button and again fear is there for a good reason it's important that we become afraid and fear should motivate us and it's legitimate but oh be careful with these buttons that we have and increasingly know how to push have more and more powerful tools to push them because at least Chris speaking from a Christian point of view God will judge you on how you push others buttons one of the things that Tom Holland and Douglas Murray keep pointing out is that and others have too John Gray there's been a lot of effective deconstruction in the West and Voltaire was in many ways the beginning of a lot of it and few people have been as effective as Voltaire and just pointing out you know if there's if there's if there's fooling each other and BSing each other and bringing the camera up close and using a smooth voice and tricking each other and of course Vervecki's done a I think a good job in in detailing a lot of those tricks that we play on each other and the church was full of them and and and deserve to be called on a lot of it and continues to be deserve to be called on a lot of it and I was you know again sitting with a friend and looking at the pot the most popular preachers on YouTube and and some of that just disgusts me because it's just one trick after another you know how to how to colonize a human being with all the old manipulative tricks in the book and again this isn't to say that Christians shouldn't use tools at our disposal but we are responsible for how we use these tools and generally what happens when you overuse a tool people begin to catch on and cynicism rises and we've seen plenty of this in our consumeristic marketing culture well but part of the fact remains in the west that the that the morality of Christianity at least the morality that has developed of which Christianity has been a deep influence continues to hold sway in our culture you know assume the truth this is what this is what celebrity atheists do and and it's what Rene Girard really notes and observes quite powerfully the trick is assume the truth of a morality inherited from Christianity and use it against Christianity assert that there's no such super thing out there that exists that can deliver the promises of this morality because every morality has built inside of it again I was just this morning reading a listening to a biography of Napoleon and Napoleon Napoleon took a little while to maybe never in fact sorted his sorted himself out with respect to women okay Napoleon had real women issues and not the most attractive guy um and you know especially before he kind of got some money he was again not the most attractive guy and he was really pursuing gorgeous high status um women who were sought after by the highest status wealthiest most powerful men in France well Napoleon was you know he's playing in the big leagues for the for the hot chicks and so had a bunch of swings and misses and so at one point he writes this little 17 17 page short story and it's this sophomoric fantasy of this of this army officer and a beautiful woman yada yada yada and of course anybody reading that's like yeah any morality or any good has implicit within it a narrative and a telos generally speaking and and and and that's simply how our minds work these are our dreams and we're pursuing our dreams we're pursuing our passion well there's this there's this whole mental construct and narrative or maybe it gets expressed in narrative of this dream and so the morality which is currently in use pretty much wholesally borrowed from Christianity invites some vague foggy implicit utopian dream of and and that's what in many ways what I call progressive liberationism pursues it's sort of a process theology implicit in I wrote a blog piece yesterday that I wrote on CRC voices about um you know it was all over the paper that California governor you know put the first openly gay member of the California supreme court okay well is it or isn't a big deal why it's only a big deal within an imaginary a moral imaginary that there's some progressive narrative that you know okay so he's the third black justice on the supreme court so okay and we're counting and you know well the transgender one is next and the gender by you know the gender um non-conformist is another and on and on and on well there's a there's a whole implicit imaginary in that moral universe however you imagine that moral universe to be and there's telos and goods there's all these kinds of things to it and so basically you assume the Christian moral universe and aspects of Christian eschatology and then you say but in Christianity it's that super thing that's supposed to deliver to us this good great wonderful utopian world but since we can't find that super thing it's up to us to make it happen oh okay now one of the things we do is we're forgetting that ourselves this collective again John Gray brings that out quite clearly ourselves is this imaginary collective that isn't actually in the material world you know us we is a is a an act of relevance realization a fact an act of of looking at an essence of a group an act of of saying there's a we here that humanity must be preserved but that assumes that humanity is a thing and if you're kind of a physicalist what find the essence of humanity it's not easy and and and so this stuff sort of breaks down but but this is the game that we're playing so take Christian morality expand it along certain lines into some utopian eschatology point out the fact that there is no super thing to deliver that to you and then basically foisted on us to pursue that together and well well we got to get all of the competitors out of the way and of course a constant group of competitors are sort of the majority of the population that is saying no the the the super thing out there has to deliver it to us so we're going to do all of the religious things to get the super thing to deliver it to us usually don't answer the phone but that one was important so i'm glad i did so basically what we have is a community that assumes a morality that's at least been deeply shaped and based on Christianity but God has the the traditional conceptualization of God the orthodox conceptualization of God has been reduced to this super thing and new moral imaginaries and new eschatological utopias have arisen from the moral imagination and the argument is that well you can't rely on the super thing to deliver it to you now in terms of Christian conceptions of agency the Bible is that the the the answer to the question does God bring the kingdom or do people do is complex because the answer to the question of God's agency and human agency is also complex and again that gets me into the other video which now i'm increasingly thinking i'm probably going to have to post on this channel eventually but will probably be posted today on the church channel or at least by today depending on when i post this video so so again we say there's this there's this moral imaginary that that sort of yields an eschatological utopian vision and there is no super thing to provide it because there's no agency above or there's no conscious reasonable rational agency above or beyond human beings to the best of our knowledge in the current secular sort of materialist frame and so it's up to us to bring that world into being God will not help you it's up to you and of course but then we forget all other elements that we've sort of smuggled into this entire formulation such as this imagined community and even our own selves i'm going to talk about this a little bit later there's all kinds of constructs in there that can't be found in nature either they have to be found by people who are pattern seeing patterns and projecting them on and all of that so so part of this and part of this fight between atheists and christians has been assert actions against a religious belief and then at some point in order to pursue this utopian vision and because there is no super thing available well you're going to have to break some eggs to achieve the utopia the moral utopia and the best response to that was Orwell's show me the omelet show me the omelet before you break the eggs because that's where this goes but now to come around and argue for the other side why has this been so effective because it has been effective and i was actually listening to a classical interview of a couple of a husband and wife they're immigrants from india and they are now ministers are going to be ministers in the christian reform church and they minister to a an indian community in in california and one of the uh filipino pastors retiring basically said yeah but you know the kids the kids start you know because you have all these immigrants from asia and it's like the kids come here and they're sort of like us but the longer they're here the the less they stop going to church and you've got you know ret and link who i haven't talked about for a while you've got ret and link who are you know high profile youth leaders in the celebrity evangelical pantheon who you know have deconstructed and this then becomes existential terror amongst some communities how can this happen and they get a little defensive oh it's not because we we stopped going to church it's not because we we we moved to godless california to pursue our our youtube careers it's not any of those things well there might be some of that there might be something to that it's it's because we can no longer be mean to gaze oh well i didn't know that you had to be mean to gaze by being a christian or i could no longer i could no longer not believe in evolution oh i didn't know that was part of you see all these other things kind of come in and again if you listen to the both the personal testimonies and the reasons why people leave the faith they've got lots of reasons and they're not all bad reasons and the church is a mess you know the church is a mess church is full of people so why has this been so effective and and what exactly has been effective and again there's multi-variables here but maybe just a few points that can help us to see something now religion now again what do we mean by this word well what do we mean by this word and is it going to be the you know it's going to be emile dirkheim's definition of religion jonathan height's definition of religion or this sort of this modernist thing that identifies it with certain cultic behavior but again back to tom holland the ancients didn't consider themselves religious in that sense what it mean religion this word and judaism christianity these words sort of come late in the game to describe certain things and and how each generation at each time uses them to describe things so these things vary so religion in sort of the modernistic reduction definition involves a variety of practices that are outside the frame of direct action that the now the absence of the super thing um they're crusading and they imagine will result in the christian morality world or some derivation of it that they intend to deliver because they have to deliver it via now how do how are you going to deliver it you have to use the tools at hand for humanity so so politics and technology and social effort and convincing people and influence and mass media and social media and yada yada this is this is what we have to do but the religion well what is the religion it's the we might say in a little more technical language the cultic behavior well what i mean by that it's the prayers and the going to church and you know and and so again when you get to the end of vancouver one jordan peterson sam harris brett weinstein and jordan peterson well what kind of god do you believe in jordan he opens up his he opens up his surface book and he starts reading this list and sam harris can't recognize anything and so no no that's not god god is this super thing that we pray to and and the super thing that we pray to is supposed to deliver goods to us now again there's this whole implicit imaginary that is operating that is not unfair and and sam harris has learned this from christians okay and and it's not unfair and there's a super thing that we pray to that's supposed to deliver it and sam harris says that doesn't work that doesn't work like technology works that doesn't work like politics works that doesn't work like social effort to work these things have a direct causal relationship to the outcomes we desire or at least we're asserting they have a direct causal relationship to the outcomes we desire or at least we're asserting that because we're greatly reducing the variables because the truth is history is way too complex for us to actually manage hence god history is way too complex for us to manage but we're gonna get there if we can all be rational because even though 2019 nobody predicted 2020 and you know pandemic and election and then ruth vader ginsburg dies in september it's like oh there's gonna be drama around this and then trump gets coveted oh what's gonna happen and and and what's really happening and on and on and on and on there's way too many variables we know that now but all this cultic behavior those prayers and the lighting a candle and the and the sermons and the sermons well they're protestant they're more direct but it's all that indirect stuff that we say why going to church but again evangelicals have been talking this way for a long time keith green this you can't get any more more evangelical than keith green says going to church doesn't make you any more christian than going to mcdonald's makes you a hamburger that's what keith green says in one of his songs and you might hear that thing it's not a great comparison but yeah but it works works for people and again the illustration the point is pastors have been saying these kind of things in churches for a long time and and so in many ways what's so effective about the deconstruction is the directness and the assumption of directness and i can see a direct causal link between this action and this outcome but when you actually look at history i mean when you and this this again is one of the abiding lackings of the idw is no historians because the truth is history is enormously complex and so what caused the civil war now you can talk about john brown and you can talk about slave slaves and free states and the compromise of 1850 and you can talk about 1619 and you can talk about malaria and you can talk about columbus and you can talk about malaria in africa and west african culture as opposed to other cultures in africa and on and on and on and on there near infinite number of variables that caused the civil war but this was the key one the key one these were some of the key ones fair enough but if something over here had happened differently we can't run that math in history but there's this infatuation with a certain directness and because again there's no super thing to bring about what we need and so religion is about manipulating the super thing and getting the super thing to act on our behalf and again this is not very different from politics because and if you look at ancient politics and ancient religion they're sort of the same thing because a lot you know basically most other religion in the world was about manipulating the super thing and a lot of christianity and a lot of stuff in the bible is about trying to influence the super thing and get our hands around the super thing but part of at least my tradition says you can't grasp the super thing you can't manipulate the super thing and it's frankly offensive to manipulate the super thing just like we can understand that it's offensive to manipulate a smaller little super things that have agency and power and things like that if granny realizes you're just kissing up to her to get into her good graces to get some inheritance granny's gonna say you don't really love me and now someone might say well what is you you're just the sum total of all of this formation no whatever even if you say that's true i am somebody i am something i am an agent i am an actor and unless you somehow and jordan peterson was dead on right about this point unless you somehow acknowledge that there is an element to me that is categorically different than all of the other things in this world that are simply the products of other things in this world and other processes this world to say it in the canadian unless you say unless you treat me like i am a part of that super thing or there's an element of that super thing that's in me or i somehow participate in that super thing or something like that unless you treat me like that even with the reduction of the whole imagination of the super thing unless you treat me like that you're out of the will sonny that's how we are and we're not going to escape it and even if you say well i believe we're just i believe there's nothing but the big show c.s lewis miracles there's nothing but the big show all i am is the products of history and biology and evolution and all of these things it's all paul vanderkley is there's no essence to him that's different i'm going to be offended my dignity is hurt my feelings are hurt you've you've now lowered me in status and and you remember my group a and group b you've taken me out of group b and put me into group a and you're treating me like i've been group a and that's exactly what people hate which is why politicians are always playing this little game they're manipulating but but don't let them know i'm manipulating and same with parents and and and and and and and and and and anyone once they get past a certain point they realize oh they're seeing me there i'm seeing them see me and and and they've got designs on me and that's why pastors are often not liked because they can be manipulative but but where is the difference really it's because we say that does going to church mean and praying to god mean i'm not going to get cancer now now part of the problem is that and you can have what was her name um i got it out of a skepticon video um bruster was her name but but you know many people have noted but religion is good for you but why is it good for you well we don't know well if you understand that there's massive amounts of things out there that we are incapable of all tracking and we don't have enough time in our short little biological lives at some point you say i don't know why but i'm going to do it but then you have the belief problem that i bumped into again with poe and with and with ryan bennett and with many many many of you but the big divide is all over about whether it's direct or indirect because the prayer and the worship and the and the obedience and all of this religious stuff that stuff doesn't work like my cell phone works yeah but your cell phone's way more simple than your life now back to the god of the hebra's let me see it may make sure because again this god the god of the hebra's is well you've got the agent arena relationship out of meaning again verveki stuff out of which meaning springs this god is a renek in him we live and move and have our being this god is also a gentic he i've again i preached on the third commandment taking up god's name upon a vain thing don't do it why because the lord will not hold him guiltless who takes up his name and places it on a vain thing god's gonna get you see we're skeptical about that because that's direct i mean no no no i've i i i walked into a church and i took the lord's name in vain and lightning didn't strike me yeah but again people are all skeptical about that now but they'll talk about karma plenty karma's indirect too and that's the thing in terms of the whole thing our our our intuitive senses are built for looking for indirect patterns and yeah can you bs that yeah a lot con men work on it but we're not going to give up our intuitions because we need them but but the god of the hebraeus is a renek and a gentic and and the common sense ancient assumption was you've got to work with this intuitive system that's how the world works and now what they did you see they didn't who who recently made the you know someone went to the pyramids and shrugged and said that was pointless um they didn't build the pyramids because they were stupid they might have been wrong about some things but they weren't stupid and it looks religious to us and that's the word we put on it but it was life and death for them and so that's why you look around the ancient world and the prayers and the sacrifices and the temples and the idols and and again with the subtraction story well we're beyond all that oh really first of all who's we because the majority of human beings are not beyond all that because when they tend to give up a more organized structured community-based religion then they just get off into really other forms of bs-ing themselves that are less organized and usually well less well thought through and the truth about human beings is that when we can do intuition together just like when we do other things together we're much more powerful and much less subject to the bs-ing that vervecky calls out again and again and again that's the enemy the all the ways that we fool ourselves the the parasitic processing again he's got all his fancy words and i should probably relisten to his stuff to to have the fancy words get to higher resolution in my mind all the parasitic processing all the bs-ing all of this stuff that we do that you know lots of people you know thinking fast and slow the truth is if we're doing intuition together we're doing it better than we're doing it apart and so when people walk away from religious communities they just start doing it by themselves and they're dumber for it and that's almost always the case with human beings we're smarter together we're dumber alone which is part of the reason why the covid isolation is so costly for people we and the phone call i had was a beloved member of my congregation that i haven't been able to visit in his care facility because of covid and he's going into hospice and he's lost he's lost a lot of what he had even six months ago the last time i saw him why because he's not been able to be with people and family so now he's going into hospice he can now i can visit him now i can pray with him now we can we can't talk as much anymore but now we can nurture those things and why do secular hospitals let christian ministers who have religion go in and visit because the doctors aren't dumb and they say whether or not i believe what that preacher has to say it helps the patient because together we're doing better than alone and and if you're not doing religion together you're doing it alone and you're probably not doing very well so the god of the hebra's is arenic and agentic and and that's part of the complexity of this religion and so the arenic is in him we live and move and have our being the agentic is he will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name he's watching he's listening he's gonna act he's gonna get you but he's patient now you say well i don't believe any of that okay fair enough you might not believe other more distributed systems are going to get you how about eating all that junk food is that gonna get you well that's different why because i imagine a causal relationship explain it to me well i i don't really know i tell me about the tell me about the the blood chemistry and the biology and how much we know about how we eat no but but i i i read doctors and they told me and i believe them oh so you believe on the basis of authority well well well there that the doctors know the science really and human beings know what we should eat now are you going to be on a keto diet are you going to be on you know why do we keep changing the food pyramid because we don't know what human beings should eat well well well human beings in general well what about me yeah what about you what you should eat is someone really gonna go through no no doctor's actually gonna really go through my do exhaustive science on me to find the particular diet and even if you had that time and money i bet you they would get it wrong and truth be told probably your intuitions are gonna help you a little bit more and even better if you're in close relationship with someone and you talk it through out loud and you work it out you'll probably do better see i knew i'd raise my voice all of that is in some ways religious well what about the big questions of the world what about the big questions of the world what we're doing right now and what we've done in religion and philosophy and history all of that is to try to think about the biggest these most important these hardest questions ever and to bring not only our rationality but our tuition and our pattern recognition and to try and do that together and yeah we almost all get almost all of it wrong nod to the good place you know this little weird guy got everything right well fair enough so look at the subtraction story the enchanted world it's rightly it's right that we look at other people and say are their insides like my insides does does the color red look to you like the color red looks to me i can't see what the color red looks like to you now we do all of this science to say well brain blah blah blah maybe because from the we have this is the manifest of the scientific image we have the insides versus the outsides and you know grandma's upset if you treat her like like something from group a you have to go to my group a video and figure out what i'm talking about with that we i i inside it's real to me and my passions and my love and my meaning and my morality and and and from the inside it's all there are your insides like my insides and we listen to each other talk and we hear enough commonality intuitively we say yeah i'm not a solipsist i'm not alone in this world you have insides too just like i have insides and but it's not unreasonable again i was listening to a thing by rupert sheldrake and you know he keeps making his point whatever you think of rupert sheldrake that you know how do you know the sun doesn't have consciousness you don't know what the inside of the sun looks like you don't know what it's like to be the sun it's not a stupid idea we just have this convention that says for the sake of science let's assume oh where's my where's my where's my cell phone stand oh here it is for the sake of science let's assume that when i flex my cell phone stand it doesn't say oh vanderkley's pushing on me we act like it does we sort of treat it that way and in fact with the spirit of finesse if if i'm let's say i'm oh screwing in a light bulb there's a good idea let's say i'm screwing in a light bulb i remember talking to an electrician and sometimes use like poles to put in light bulbs and things and electricians say yeah some people screw in light bulbs like they're doing plumbing what do you mean they really screw it tight and it doesn't have to be screwed in that tight you just need to have electrical contact so it has to be screwed in enough but not as tight as you can and again if you work with almost anything you know overtightening is a problem so what's going on there well it's the spirit of finesse well you learn that so so on one hand am i flexing my my my cell phone stand does it feel pain i really don't think so but i decide that for the sake of how i'm going to use it and we've got the same issue with respect to animals and that's currently you know keeping chickens in cages versus letting chickens run happy cows in california i'll tell you most of the dairies i see in california i think i'd rather be a cow in some other place but how do i know what makes a cow happy you know is a is a lion happier in a zoo where it gets medical animals and zoos live longer so is happiness the right word or is it meaning that we see the lion out there on the on the serengeti and it's being all lionish and we're like yeah that's that's the way the lion's supposed to be but that's not how we live take away our clothes and throw us out among the lions and yeah you'll feel meaning but you'll say i want back into my living room with my clothes and my fridge and my food and my and my netflix so what is it from the inside and the outside well we don't know and you can't know so we make assumptions and we think together and we make conventions about how to treat things and there's no um there's no united nations organization that's going to to to file charges against me because i'm stressing and i'm torturing my cell phone stand because we say well this is group a animals they're sort of group b-ish they have feelings they suffer rightly so we still kill them and eat them or we're going to kill them humanely what do you mean we're going to kill them like we kill people now we kill people worse than we kill animals sometimes so is everything else's insides like my insides so then we struggle with the definition of life what is what what really is life and and again this is the 60 to 70 word thing that we all use the word life we kind of know it when we see it we think we think are plants alive yeah yeah is my cell phone stand alive i don't think so but what is life and so there's all these gray areas so so we talk about complex things but we can't direct that we can't directly bend to our will so we talk to our car when it won't start and we talk to the u.s government when it does something and we talk to the president when he's not there and we talk to our dead relatives and we talk or the memory of our relatives and and on and on and on and on we interact with things as if they can hear us why for the same reason we shouldn't turn the light bulb all the way just enough it's the spirit of finesse and so come on car why won't you start well does the car hear me well now my car does hear me i can press a button and say things to the car and navigate to dairy queen and off we go and and cars are going to get more we're going to be talking to our cars and it wasn't dumb to talk to your car now most of us would say well the car doesn't really hear you but we don't know that i'm pretty sure it doesn't well now it does and this is the point if ancients if the ancient practices were so ineffective why were they so common durable and why are they so resurgent today well they were stupid for all those sacrifices and well i i agree i think a lot of it was wrong it wasn't because they were stupid because the truth is we don't know either and and jordan peterson's point that he made with respect to sacrifice it's in it's you know he really went into i really so when he did his easter things in 2018 and he did his easter video which fortunately is back up on the on youtube now um he says part of the reason sacrifice works is that and this is david sloan wilson's point humanity is so full of people that it's not it's not just our relationship to things like the cell phone stand it's relationship how i treat my cell phone stand other people watch most famous cell phone stand on youtube maybe how i treat my cell phone stand people watch and it gets into it gets into the symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary and we don't know where this stuff goes there's too many variables but it gets into the us that's out there sacrifice works because the world is so full of people and and and history is so full of people and history again is to track there's the genetic track and there's the culture track and that culture track is all people and and you might say yeah but the direct things and so gavin newson you know find me a woods that's burning wow there's lots of them and so go up to the woods and go up into the smoke and talk about climate change this is a climate damn emergency i don't know why now damn fits into the sentence but there it is and a visibly angry governor gavin newson warns the rest of the country friday that california's record wildfires is a glimpse into the future if political leaders do not start taking climate crisis more seriously so then he he declares that after 2035 no more gas automobiles will be sold in california okay it's 15 years from now maybe we'll just be driving electrics because they're better than i don't know i don't know but but again we say well i see the direct relationship and again i'm not a climate skeptic i'm kind of a climate skeptic on both sides are we monkeying with the climate that doesn't seem unreasonable are all the assertions about how it's going going to be true not all the old models were true so probably we are and probably it's more complex than we know and so but we should only have the direct approach well a lot of the climate stuff sort of looks like religion because it's sort of communal intuitive and there's reason and i should check the phone again hang on so again as you can see we're deeply religious all over the place even when we don't know we're being religious which basically says we're not that different from the ancients but now then how did science develop well at least part of it was christian assumptions about god's reliability and and the faithfulness of god agentic and arenic was so dependable that you can literally set your atomic clock by him see now again when i use it that way people kind of no no no we're setting we have an atomic clock because we're measuring yeah yeah yeah i get that are you saying that the atoms are part of god i'm really careful with our language because that's what you do when you do theology you're really careful with your language but in him we live and have our being the whole earth is full of his glory and again that leads to another question which i call the great puzzle which i now i really have to post this on my channel after i make that video so but that's going to be on the church channel so if you get this video and you want to see the video where i talk about the great puzzle you can find it on the church channel if i make that video i think i will this is not a universe of chaos there is chaos but it's not what the universe is about that's deeply christian that there is order there is purpose and that part of the problem with saying everything is chaos is that well how do you conceptualize non-chaos in other words any non-chaos is an illusion because chaos is all there is so this is not a universe of chaos deism was an intermediate step charles taylor talks about that and as more and more reliable habits of god were revealed the mysterious enchanted god receded there's where you sort of get the subtraction story and you have the the god of the gaps and so if see now again language is difficult because we wouldn't say a part of god because god is indivisible so it gets really hard to talk about but yeah let's say it this way the faithfulness of god agentic and arenic is so dependable that you can literally set your atomic clock by him is that a hymn then god number one and god number two but a civilization so this gets pushed and eventually that that that god sort of recedes into the laws of physics civilization has so many sunk costs in the old system the agentic and arenic system that you're trying to save god from the deconstruction of god number one by doubling down on god number two read thermons when god talks back that's god as agentic and and and this is where sam harris learns about god and when jordan peterson reads all about his idea about god sam harrison sam harris says that's not god no sam you haven't read enough history because if you're at least versed with even as i am a degree of reformational stances if you're well versed in the heidelberg catechism you recognize it now it causes issues fair enough but you recognize it jordan peterson jordan peterson wasn't wrong in calling that stuff god just like god is reliable enough to set your atomic clock by him this is why again sam harris couldn't recognize god when jordan peterson answered the question in vancouver this is the god number two this is and this is you know this is the god scott number two and god number two people are are skeptical uh this is the god people are skeptical of god number two because christians attempt at manipulating god aren't effective as technology and again so the christians are trying to influence the super thing but for sam god is the super thing and they don't recognize god in nature in creation god is the super thing and and all the christian technology about manipulating the super thing doesn't seem to work but christian theology right from the start will say uh don't try to manipulate the super thing that's why you shouldn't represent him as anything in the world because once he's a super thing you've already you've already reduced him so don't try to represent him in the world don't try to manipulate him well what do you have to do you have to worship and serve and obey but will worship and serving and obeying get me well that's not part of the deal well you tell you hey hey read the last bit of deuteronomy if you fulfill the government here are the covenant promises if you fail the covenant here are the here are the covenant penalties and guess what that they failed and that's what basically the entire old testament is about they failed and christianity says well jesus fulfills and comes in and makes good and alters the relationship jesus at the last supper says this is a new covenant in my blood do this in remembrance of me and if you watch me serve communion on sundays you'll hear me say it this is a new covenant in my blood but that's the story and but now christians continue to have the bad habit of well god says i'm open to your influence but i'm not open to your manipulation i'm open to your influence i'll listen to you i'll hear your prayers but i am still god and you are not and i'm a reenac and a gentic i'm both now one of the things that sort of popped up in my conversation with poe was and again this is why i like having these conversations because things occur to me in new conversations that hadn't i hadn't you know in my intuitive whatever we're doing right here hadn't really come together in my mind so so what really what really provokes the meaning crisis well two tracks in science and culture have emerged at the same time on the one track over the last hundred years we've realized that the physical world is far stranger than we imagined before then we're imagining all these atoms and all these atoms are building blocks and and that's sort of what we can do and then we learn that there's more space in atoms than there are particles and they're really energies and then you have fields and and and so even talking about particles kind of gives way to talking about these fields and and and and it's like oh gosh i i was hoping the world would be these little building blocks and and that was the state of the model at the time but the model broke down and so the world is really strange so we got that on one hand on the other hand we've got well we're increasingly understanding the degree to which okay so group a and group b group a are all of the inanimate non-agentic things in the universe that we we bend and manipulate and destroy and that's group a they're they're just the sum total of everything they're the whole show and they're all the little pieces of the show and the processes and and matter and every all that all that's group a group b are these from the inside agents choosers agents best word human beings are increasingly hackable and we know more and more about hacking them and we're doing it more and more and we're doing it to each other and and and that's causing a meaning crisis what if what if all there is is group a what if all there is is the whole show what if all there is is mechanisms and and oh maybe there's emergence but even with emergence if you have the time and knowledge you could do the math because all there is is math and that leads then to visions of determinism but none of us can have that but but the vision of it then again turns in on itself and then suddenly we have a meaning crisis that there's no there's no there's no me in here that there's no inside view in the inside view the view from inside to outside is illusory and that's when you have patch sam harris flipping back and forth and saying no life is wonderful but it's all determined and it's like watching a movie but you can watch a movie and know how it ends yeah but some movies are horrible and and we can walk out of the theater but sam i've got no agency your agency is an illusion oh okay then screw this isn't that agentic and that's where you get to dostoevsky's the underground you know the the underground man give him everything it'll destroy it for spite what a what a book that is so we doubted god's agency well i think i think i think it's just i think it's all determined mechanistic and god in a sense returns the favor and say okay i'll doubt yours let's i'll i'll make the mirror up there and you look into that mirror you're gonna have one you're gonna have one heck of a meaning crisis because why shouldn't i waste my life on cheetos and video games and porn and and and doing whatever satisfies me because i know it's just all an illusion we doubted god's agency and now it appears god has returned the favor and and this comes into the question of love is love real no i'm only acting towards this being because of the the way evolution has constructed the chemicals i'm not saying that those chemicals aren't operating but you've got the scientific image and the manifest image and there's the insides and the insides is the is the manifest image and that's where there's love and that's where there's choice and that's where there's value and that's where there's morality and that's where there's the building blocks of this vision of a new world and hope and satisfaction and peace and all the things that are worth living are all from the inside, not the outside. And so inside, group B creatures use the organizations and the mechanisms in order to achieve those things. But we gotta cut God out. Okay, well, that's not a bad scientific trick to say, well, why does... Why does water evaporate? Well, God. Oh, okay. Well, what about God? Well, what about God is so reliable that we can look at the very regular and count on the effective practices of water evaporation? What about God is so reliable you can set your atomic clock by him? Well, I didn't think about God in that way. No, you didn't. And that's exactly where Jordan Peterson changed the conversation. Even though, again, what are the insides of Jordan Peterson? To what degree did he know it? I don't know, but that's what I've figured out and that's what I think because it's all part of the manifest image. So then Jordan Peterson comes along and basically one way I think to summarize what he said and did was the indispensable God variable in the Western equation. Okay, so let's think with the spirit of geometry. Let's think about massive equations. Let's use our intuitive and our reasonable skills and let's do this together and let's do the best we can. Jordan Peterson basically says, if you don't have God in your system, you'll have to invent them. Well, what do you mean by God? And then he gives his list. Well, and this is where if you're looking at the slides, I'm putting God in quotes. It's the idea of God. It's the mechanism of God. It's the system of all systems and the person of all persons. It's where systems and persons come together, but it's the manifest and it's the scientific image embedded in the manifest image. And basically the world is too complex and over human history, what we have not rationally deduced, but intuitively collectively come up with is that you need these kinds of things in the equation for human civilization to actually work. And it gets, it might get a little fuzzy on the individual level, but when it comes to all of us cooperating and competing together, you need God in the equation or we don't work. Oh boy. What if human civilization can't really run without some sort of God or religion? Civilization is sort of the software. It's the data going through the wires. It's the how that's organized and how all of these systems, the moral and the cultural and all of these systems come together and the practice and the liturgies and the symbolism and the dramatic and all of the imaginary. What if human civilization can't really run without some sort of God or religion? As protestants construe it is involuntary, but it's participatory. What if there needs to be a certain level of behavioral herd immunity? This is where my conversation with Ryan and Andrea went. What if there needs to be a certain level of herd immunity to have society keep running? What if there needs to be a certain degree of narrative agreement for us to actually be able to cooperate and compete productively? When that narrative agreement breaks down then we get things like civil unrest and civil wars and what's really happening in society is we're sort of negotiating together the elements of this and we're trying to deal with really important things that we need to deal with them like bias, sexism and racism and economics and colonialism. We're dealing with all of those things and how are we doing it? We're doing it with arguments and analysis and books and all of that. That's what we're doing. We're seeing what happens right now when communal stories break down, but it's the indispensable God variable in this civilization. And that sets then up a problem for people because what if human beings compete and cooperate given the symbolic, dramatic, liturgical imaginary? It acts sort of like the software platform of a civilization and updates keep coming online but it's massively, massively larger and not as distinct as Linux or Windows or any massive software project. And these systems compete and evolve and degrade. And when they do wars are fought and civilizations implode and it's full of chaos and bloodshed and suffering and winners and losers. So much for your utopian ideas. Well, I thought once we could all agree that the super thing will not deliver to us the kingdom of heaven on earth, then suddenly we could all come together. We've all always been working on this stuff and praise be to God over the last 200 years. I think in some ways we've done better. In some days we've done worse, but it's so massive that how we work on it, well, that's the story of history. Well, if there is no super thing, but if in him we live and move and have our being and holy, holy, holy, and the whole earth is full of his glory and don't take the name of God in vain because he'll not hold you guiltless who lifts up his name upon a vain worthless thing. Hmm. So what do you do? And I had another conversation with Ryan that I just sent him the copy and see if he wants me to release it. But what do you do? You talk to your lawnmower. What do you mean I talk to my lawnmower? That doesn't help. Yeah, you're going to at some point need some spirit of geometry to take the lawnmower apart or at least take it to someone who has the spirit of geometry with respect to lawnmowers. Why am I mentioning lawnmowers? Because that's where Jordan Peterson's conversation with Matt Dillahunty engaged. And again, I think that was a really interesting conversation because that one seemed to be put together at the last minute and there was some fallout after. But I think Peterson sort of walked in there and in his newfound status and thought, I'm just going to own Dillahunty and at least respect to me, I think he sort of did, but not with respect to Matt Dillahunty because Dillahunty lost status and this has been the atheist Christian religious game he's played. But Peterson is right. Why do you talk to your lawnmower? Why do you talk to your car? Well, it's the spirit of finesse working out in you. You pray, you act, you get religious when you have no other options. And nihilism reasonably looks like a dead end. And so you go to church and you find a pastor or a priest. And what most people do is they get religious all by themselves and it's a demotion because they're doing it by themselves. And what they really need to do is need to be talking to people and talking with better people and having better conversations and getting at this, which is what Estuary and the Stoa and and Vervecky's religion that isn't a religion and John and then Pajos, the symbolic word. That's what all of this stuff is about that we actually now again, so I'm not going to do any of the praying or the religious stuff. Okay. I come for the culture world, stay for the religion. That's about right. This is what you do. You work on it. You try and work it out and you try and have conversations and you push each other. And Jordan Peterson leaves us sort of with God and scare quotes and says, that's what I'm willing to do scientifically. What about you personally, Jordan? None of your business. Okay, fair enough. But a civilization needs God and humanity is hardwired for religion and religious behavior as a whole. This is what I did with my argument with John Vervecky in that one video when I made the argument to him in the little slide below. Here's the last one. And it's the it's the last public picture of my father taken by a friend at a at a conference when they're singing and he's worshiping and I can look in my father's eyes. Am I being manipulative from the inside? I'm being sincere because it's a precious and special thing for me. And on the face of my father is joy. Religion is the practice of approaching God in quotes as a person. Theology and doctrine approach God with the spirit of geometry mode. Science approaches God in this way too. He's so reliable you can set your atomic clock by him. But worship approaches God in the spirit of finesse mode. And so this picture was taken of my father in joy singing a song at a religious conference. They're doing some spirit of geometry there. Church work does. But there in the worship it's the spirit of finesse. And then my sister took that and put it along the background of a painting that she did and imposed the verse. However, I consider my life worth nothing to me. My only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me the task of testifying to the good news of God's grace. Acts 20. That's how my father lived his life. And in that moment he's enthralled in the rapture of a glorious God and a kingdom that is to come. And somehow this kingdom is God's work and he brings it yet he involves us. And exactly how the agency lines work I don't know. But if civilization needs God humanity is hardwired for religion and religious behavior as a role. The most reasonable approach is to relate to God as a person with the spirit of finesse. This involuntary experience that you have as belief from the inside it'll follow. You have to act as if. And hey I got my yeah buts and my doubts and those in the back of my mind too. Yeah that's why I do this. I work them out. But then I go to church on Sunday and I talk to God and I pour my heart out and you say that's so offensive you talking to God. Is it offensive when you talk to your car? Is it offensive when you talk to your lawnmower? Is it offensive when you curse at the fridge because you stub your toe on it? Well it's not the most reasonable thing to do. Okay but reason isn't all it's cracked up to be. Reason is a part of the whole picture. And again it's the intuitions we live by which has its own rationality and the left and the right brain need to work together. So I guess that's the sermon at the end. That's my last slide. But I guess I better make the other video now. But thanks for watching. Leave your comments and I'm going to start doing a little tag. People loved it when I asked for money before. So I'm just going to now that I've continued to tinker with my technology I'll do a little commercial at the end of the videos. It'll be at the end so you can stop if you've heard it once. We'll see if I keep doing it. I'm a very inconstant person in many respects and I think I'm going to keep doing this and then I don't. But yeah so thanks for watching and thanks for being a partner with me and thinking all this stuff out loud whether you're an atheist or whether you're a Christian or whether you have another religious system or another tradition within Christianity. That's you know my channel is more estuary like and that's what this is and estuary is a great place to do this kind of thing. If you've gotten to this far you've gotten to the end of the video. If you want to say thank you for this content there are a variety of ways. If you want to say keep it up and keep this channel independent. Keep this channel from being corrupted or controlled by a platform or the audience. There are certain ways that you can say thank you. One is by supporting Living Stone's Christian Reformed Church. The church pays me a salary and they've been supportive of me making videos and so obviously if the church goes under I'm going to have to figure out a new job and I don't know if my new bosses will like me making videos. So one way to support the channel is by supporting a church. And if you pay U.S. taxes donations to the church are donations to a church which means that you will get a tax. You will get a tax receipt if you pay American taxes. One of the advantages of supporting this channel by supporting Living Stone's church is that the service fee is very low. It's less than 4%. And so whereas Patreon takes almost like 10% this is a pretty efficient way. Some of you however don't want to send money to a church or want to thank me personally and so there are a variety of ways to do that. You can use Patreon. That is out there and the links for that are below. PayPal pay me. The links for that are below. There are some bitcoin links below and of course subscribe and like. Another way is to just get involved. I'm still working on Living Stone's online and estuary but there are lots of different estuary projects. There's Bridges of Meaning, Discord Server, start a local meetup group, build relationships, have conversations with people with whom you have religious differences, think creatively about bigger projects and find people to collaborate. And all of that I think is part of ways of saying thank you to me and keep doing what I'm doing because when I see people do these things I'm encouraged to keep on keeping on and it gives me a signal or at least some kind of evaluation that the time I'm spending doing this is helpful to a broad group of people. That's very meaningful. So thanks for your support.
