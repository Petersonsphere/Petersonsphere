 Hi, this is Paul Sam Harris was on Ben Shapiro Sunday show I've grown to really enjoy bench bureau Sunday show He has some interesting guests on it. Of course, Jordan Peterson was on the first one and I commented on that But this was an interesting interview and obviously I get more interesting when they decided at least for me when they decided to talk about Religion, so here's a little bit of it where you think morality comes from so in the religious view obviously there are certain things that I believe are Capable of understanding by any sentient human being so I don't believe that all human beings in the absence of religion are Immoral people who go around murdering their neighbors and raping their sisters I think that that and in fact this is pretty well embedded in even Judaic philosophy The idea that there is a sort of natural law theology Where you as just a normal person know not to kill people and know not to steal and notice that of courts of law This is what they call the seven the seven commandments to Noah But the idea is that anyone can basically discover these things and there are universals across culture about you're not supposed to murder your brother But the the biblical reading is that to reach a more sophisticated level of morality that leads to a sort of right-based society we see here you at least need the the catalyzing enzyme of a Judeo-christian religion in order in order to get here that I think be the most Rationalistic argument on behalf of Judeo-christian values, but where is here again? Here would be a civilization that values individual rights above the values of the collective That says that that people are to be treated to use the biblical phrase as made in the image of God that we should treat individuals as made in the image of God that that that does not happen in the absence of A Judeo-christian value system. That's that's the religious argument. So the and which although that is more of a historical argument That's right That's what I'm saying It's a rationalistic argument because the the deeply religious argument would be God said so to do it right but that's not the argument that Okay, right there. The deeply religious argument is that God tells us to do it. I Want to talk about that Because that is usually how the frame is set up and it goes like this Well, especially for Sam Harris, there's a make-believe story There's an old man in the sky and this old man is something like a European despot or Donald Trump they have ideas about what they want the world to be and They're a bit slow on the trigger with things. But for the most part if you cross them, they'll make you pay So is Ben Shapiro, right? Now he would resist this characterization as would I I don't think that's what God is. I don't think that's what Ben Shapiro thinks God is But when I listen to Sam Harris and some of the other celebrity atheists that kind of sounds like what they say God is and then you wind up this is back and forth. Yes. He is. No, he isn't Now Ben Shapiro will go on to argue that God's will is built into natural law And if you follow natural law things will go better with you or for you than if you resist it and as Ben Shapiro said there's this this covenant of Noah which everyone should be able to appeal to and the the atheists aren't that far from it either because they say well there's these you know at least part of the Ten Commandments they could agree with and so on that conversation goes Well where this usually boils down is that the difference between religious between religious and irreligious people is the difference between rebellious people and God's people and that God's people obey God and The assumption is that God's people will be rewarded for their obedience that religious people will eventually be punished for their disobedience and It's God's mercy that makes him wait for the religious people to maybe hopefully see the light now I refer to this as common religion. This is not too different from karma It is not too different from the basic assumptions of many religions and religious people and religious cultures You can find ideas for it in the Egyptian Book of the Dead I haven't read the Tibetan Book of the Dead, but just about every Just about every religion will either posit Do right and you'll be blessed in this life if the religion has an afterlife do right You'll be blessed in this life and if not in this life, then you'll be greatly rewarded in the afterlife now you can find That those arguments made in the Bible But what's important is that these aren't the only arguments the Bible makes that this position I would assert is nested within some other positions and that in fact this is one Low resolution take on religion which doesn't fully describe especially all of Christianity, but this is a take on Christianity that you will find many many Christians have and In fact, I think many many Christians wrongly Assert that this is the ultimate take on Christianity that and I've mentioned this in other videos what the Bible is Fundamentally is a list of rules basic instructions before leaving earth if you comply with the rules God will bless you if you violate the rules God will curse you and that reduces life down to this kind of drama and that therefore sets up the drama that God is an a man in the sky who's got particular ideas about how we would live and If we follow those rules would be blessed and if we disobey those rules we won't but here's the problem with religious pluralism Not all religions really necessarily agree on all the little rules and this is where Sam Harris will really come into his own with the argument because well this religion over here has these little rules and You can find rules in the Bible that that people of good sense even religious people no longer follow so get into questions of within Judaism of of what is the law and how the law is supposed to be applied especially as cultures and Technological context change Christians of course in a certain way modulate the Old Testament law with the New Testament and that even differs between different tribes of Christian religions and that quite frankly, and I think the APS have a great point with this is often Inconsistently replied for example a Christian would say well we I know I have no problem wearing a shirt that has cotton and Nylon woven into it and so and you know I love lobsters. I love to eat them That's against the Mosaic law So why do I eat lobsters when it's against the Mosaic law then you have all these? Convoluted religious answers and the religions the various different tribes within religions Much less the tribes between religions can't agree on the law so therefore God is on work is an unworkable framework that It makes no point to try and continue with this with this process And then you get to the great problem now a friend of mine named Matt had a patreon one of the one of the last straggler patreon conversations with Jordan Peterson and he's got a video of it, and he has Peterson's permission to use it and Matt and I have been talking for a while and this video might come out but it was a very interesting conversation that Matt and Jordan Peterson had together and towards the end of that they got into some some very real Matt is a Matt is has a seminary education. He's currently teaching high school. He's currently teaching math He's about to get married I did a little video with Matt and we might put that video ahead of the Jordan Peterson video because I thought it might be Helpful for Matt to explain himself a little bit more because the Jordan Peterson patreon conversation goes fast Matt's also thinking about setting up his own channel So he's currently trying to figure out what he wants to do with this video And but it's a it's a it's an extremely interesting conversation with Jordan Peterson and like I said Jordan Peterson gave permission for him to use the video, so Don't worry about that well, I was very interested when I listened to the video because where this video came down to towards the end was The great problem. What is the great problem? well the great problem that you will find Calvinism wrestling with and Lutheranism wrestling with and Methodism wrestling with and Christianity wrestling with and Islam wrestling with to a degree. I don't know Islam nearly as well Judaism wrestling with is finally do we save ourselves through some moral effort through some Through some obedience to the law as in a sense Ben Shapiro says well, you know, we're given the law So religious people obey the law and they are blessed by it. Well that fundamentally Puts us in the driver's seat and us in the decider seat and for those of you who often comment on my Calvinism well, this is exactly where Calvinism gets interesting because Well Calvinism let's imagine a spectrum and let's imagine on this spectrum way over on one side There's a religious group that says well if you really want to be saved you have to go door-to-door and Preach our religion or you have to become a monk or you have to become I remember two-speed religion or you have to become a religious superstar or you have to fast regularly In order to earn God's favor you have to do all of these things now again There's the problem of well which God and which revelation and all of that stuff But in order to turn to do got to earn God's favor you have to earn your way into heaven Well Protestantism comes along and says nope, that's not right. You can't earn your way into heaven, but that then poses a problem Well, then how do we know who makes the cut and who doesn't well some solve that by saying well, it's universalist Everybody makes the cut and then Rob Bell comes along says well everybody makes it eventually and there's variety of other universalists out there Universalist Christian Universalism is a pretty handy thing because it just eliminates the problem of Everlasting divine punishment and the difficulties that that sets up CS Lewis addresses the problem in other ways in his book the great divorce I'm not going to go into all of those problems But but but the great the great problem the great conflict here, which is where Peterson goes with my friend is but Essentially, but finally is it on our side or is it on God's side of the line in In terms of our rescue our salvation. Well our salvation from what our salvation from everything is Christianity merely hell avoidance this is something I've been talking about for years because sometimes when I listen to Christians you would get the idea that Christianity is basically about going to heaven and not hell when you die and so you live a Christian life to do this But as I mentioned before this gets really squirrely if you go to an evangelist crusade You're sitting there and you're listening and they're just saying all you have to do is accept Jesus So then you walk down the aisle say I accept Jesus and it's like I'm in and they say okay, but now you have to go to church. What? What do you mean? I got to go to church You said all I had to do is accept I accept now Leave me alone and let me do what I want because I got my card punched and then even all these Protestant people like oh No, that's not it. You're gonna have to do these things and so this issue is is engaged and you'll find it in in churches all over the place and you'll find it haunting Anyone who has an idea of hell and an expectation of divine judgment even without hell But at least you know God's gonna give super Christians better places and lesser Christians worse places anybody with that kind of living attitude Deals with this anxiety. Have I done enough? Well, you're saying well This is based on me doing enough and and there are many many many many ways in which religious communities including my own try to navigate this question and try to resolve it and These questions as you know with Calvinism because most of you know about this much about Calvinism And so your Calvinism determinism predestination and well, how can you believe that? Well, if that's about all you know about Calvinism and Calvinism gets reduced to Determinism or divine election or the five points of Calvinism from the from the canons of door, etc, etc So there we are all in this mess and what's interesting about this conversation with Peterson is that he and this this this young Christian man who's got a very interesting story go back and forth and Peterson finally gets to that point and basically says, you know what you kind of ask them that I answer this for me and Can we really answer this If we know the answer can we put it in words is The answer actually more lived than articulated if you listen to my conversation with with Nathan You know in a sense Here's here's a little factoid for you. If you read the New Testament again and again you find verses that says you know Jesus returns to judge the living and the dead and on what basis does he do so based on what we do? Wait a minute. I thought if I just accept it, are you saying I have to qualify for this? How do we get there? What does that mean? Why would on one hand all of you Protestants say no You just have to accept and believe Like Paul says if you believe with your heart, I guess he's using biblical anatomy if you build not modern anatomy if you believe with your heart and if you profess with your lips, then you are safe and You know some people then accuse me because when people say that to me I usually start picking at them and saying what do you mean by this word? Then what do you mean by this word and then in this Jordan Peterson conversation people would say yeah, that's that's what you That's what you people do. You you don't make it simple Paul made it simple and I think Paul is very right. But what does it mean? What does it mean in terms of our lives? Well, then Paul and talking with the Corinthians has Declared some things some expectations on their behavior and tells them that they should cut out They should cut out their communal meal because it's doing more harm than good this communal meal that has come to be the the Lord's Supper or the Eucharist or Christian communion, so Yeah, I'm not I'm not going to simplify it but I'm going to talk about it because I don't know that the question is unknowable and I suspect that the question is best answered by one's life and I think actually that's what the Heideberg catechism says But we'll talk about the Heideberg catechism a little bit later on Does God save us or do we save ourselves? So you say you're a Calvinist so that does put me way over on the end of of God's Of God's work instead of our capacity to save ourselves. In fact, the great Calvinism our Minian debate was was very much over this issue If we're not capable of doing right is God just punishing us for doing wrong? And how can that be reasonable or just? Because if we don't have the if we don't have the capacity to Comply with God's law then it isn't reasonable or just for him to hold it against us. It's a powerful argument What does Jesus mean by it is finished on the cross? Pause and have a drink of water Now this Sunday this isn't exactly rough draft for Sunday because the the my thinking is still way too Not quite well enough put together, but I am thinking a lot about the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel and If you don't know your Bible there were two kingdoms northern and the southern kingdom after Solomon the kingdom split between Jeroboam and Riabom and the northern kingdom was for the most part larger and more powerful than the southern kingdom But the northern kingdom had far more troubles with The northern kingdom had far more troubles with assimilating the religion of its neighbors and this is This is this is shown in the book of Kings and in the book of Chronicles the book of Kings the book of Kings communicates this as the Old Testament does in these little episodes and All cultures communicate in their own ways and the Hebrew scribes as I've said before these guys were geniuses the way they could Bring all of this history and distill it down and say it in a different way and for for many years a lot of people Thought that these guys weren't very good at what they do, but through the work of the likes of Robert Alter Yeah, here's this stuff if you're looking for he's a Jewish scholar. Actually. He's not a Christian scholar He taught for years at Berkeley Robert Alter the art of biblical narrative the art of the book poetry The better we learn to read the text the more amazed we are at the Artistry of the text and so in my sermons I'm down to second King 17 and the fall of the northern kingdom And so what happens is that the Assyrian Empire decides that it's been raiding these little kingdoms and basically Running up to them and saying, you know Give us all your gold or I'm gonna burn your city and rape your women and take the chill it take your Men and take the women and children as slaves But then we'll go back to our own country because Assyria had plenty of its own internal troubles and troubles with other more powerful kingdoms the the the region where Israel and Judah Were was was always kind of a middle. It was kind of the middle ground between Egypt and The powerful nations of the Fertile Crescent and so they were good for raiding or they were a highway and The strength that Israel enjoyed during David and Solomon was at a time when both Egypt and the Mesopotamian Empires and civilizations were quite weak But at this point Assyria is has decided to have a change of policy now It wants to establish an empire and so it brings its armies down to conquer not just to Not just to extract gold and wealth and slaves And so they come down to conquer and they're they intend on turning this whole region into districts or provinces of Assyria and you can see here some of the provinces that the Assyrian Empire laid out What they did however after they destroyed Samaria and the northern kingdom was a strategy of Assimilation and one of the interesting things that you see in The Bible are that the different ancient empires had different strategies of assimilation And my video seems to have frozen Now I'm unfrozen. You'll see if it freezes in the recording or if it just happens there But the different empires had different strategies of assimilation and the Assyrian strategy of assimilation was fairly simple You come down you take the people out of their old land and you bring them down to conquer the region You take the people out of their old land and you bring them to another land and you take the people from the other conquered peoples That you have and you mix them up with the other people and you bring them back and you you install them then in In Israel, so you take the Samarians out of you take the Samarians out of Samaria And then you take people from other parts of the Assyrian Empire and you put them in their homes now Why is this a smart strategy? Because what it does is it cuts off people's ability to leverage their familial connection their ancestral ties to the land all of their history and you cut them off and then you mix them up and they won't be Anywhere near is able to organize and assimilate. Let's imagine that if the United States had conquered Iraq and Let's say the United States has decided to conquer Iraq and North Korea at the same time So it would take people from Iraq and move them over to North Korea and take elements of North Korea usually the the elite and the army and let's say move them into Iraq now, how would that go? Well, it would be a pretty smart strategy by the United States because what happened when after the US conquered Iraq was well people People reverted to all of their religious tribes and their clans and you had the militias form and it was bedlam Now you haul them off to North Korea and let's say well, let's have South Korea manage North Korea And so they've got a bunch of Iraqis there and well, it'll be a problem for a generation or so But these ancient empires were were both brutal and effective and so maybe for a generation or so you're gonna have trouble But if you if you repress them thoroughly and have you know a well-stocked network of secret police and don't let them give arms within a generation or two the the wealth and affluence of South Korea will probably win out and I don't know what the North Koreans are gonna do in the middle of the Middle East because that area of the world is plenty turbulent as it is but this is this is what the Assyrians do and Now this as we're gonna see this that's up a lot of interesting situations And if you read the book of if you read the book of second King 17 It's just a little brief description of the fall of Samaria and the last bad Israelite king and then there was a sermon and the basic heart of the sermon is Israel sin They worshiped other gods. They practiced child sacrifice I spoke about that in my rough draft for for Sunday last week and in my sermon on my church channel They did child sacrifice. They worshiped bail. They worshiped Asherah. They had high places They observed they didn't observe the law or the covenant of the Lord that they were supposed to They did wicked things that made God angry and they didn't heed the warning of the prophets And so therefore God let the Assyrians come in and destroyed them Now this seems to go along well with with Ben Shapiro's Version that deeply religious argument is that God tells us what to do now I don't mean to cast Ben Shapiro in an unkind light here I'm sure Ben Shapiro and I sat down and had a conversation about this it could probably be quite an interesting conversation because The Jews have had plenty of time to nuance these kinds of arguments and he's giving us a low-resolution summary of What is basically common religion deeply religious argument? This is from above and I'm still thinking about Talking about from above and below because that's very much what's going on with the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversations The deeply religious argument is that God tells us what to do and then the assumption behind that is that then we do it And the assumption after that is that if we do it God will God will bless us and it's certainly true with natural law if you used to there was when My homeless friend was living outside my door and I'd run him to the emergency room on a fairly regular basis one day He asked me he says he says Paul Why is it always you driving me to the emergency room and not me driving you to the emergency room? And I said well, let's let's think about that Well, let's let's think about this a moment number one, you don't have a car number two you don't have a car because you are a pretty much you've given yourselves Oh, you're giving yourself over to your alcohol and your drugs and you you're fully aware of your mental illness issues because you used to be a used to work in the area of mental illness and you're fully aware of the medications you should be on and you have By your own admission decided to live your life this way and you eat out of the dumpster of the grocery store next door And you sleep outside and if like the one time you found some You found a bag with some little bags in it and a needle and you thought oh this must be heroin So you decided to shoot it up your arm and when you shot it up your arm Which you discovered that no it was just a bunch of dirt made to look like heroin and then you had a horrible Infection in your arm and so I drove you to the emergency room so they could clean up your arm Because otherwise you just injected a whole bunch of crap into it So is it really a mystery about why it's always me driving you to the emergency room and not the other way around? Natural law is a thing and if you decide to abuse your body You will probably not have a good time with your body and if you decide to live in disorderly life There are consequences to what we do and we can appreciate these consequences and we can predict these consequences And you don't necessarily have to be a religious person to understand that now obviously religious people go another step further and say There's a god up above who is watching over things and exerting a degree of control And if you please this god he is going to bring good things to you That's again common religion But now when we hear this story and we read 2nd corinthian 17 Especially in our cultural context, maybe this is dating me a little bit But I think it I think it plays I think it plays pretty well now, too We kind of imagine this as children of the 60s or maybe children of the 80s or maybe children of the aughts Trying to get away from a repressive angry religious father The father has archaic or capricious rules about what is right or wrong and they don't really bear any They're not the natural law type of rules of eat your vegetables and exercise and then you'll be healthy They're more the irrational religious story type rules from these ancient books and and ideas about ideas about sex or ideas about going to church or ideas about Whatever archaic thing these ancient books drag out The kids just want freedom to explore the truth and make life work for themselves. And so That's how we can understand israel that this god of this ancient god The lord is you know, he's he's awfully strict And why doesn't he just get a clue and be happy being one god among many and let the polytheistic strategy that i've spoken about in some of my previous videos with the polytheistic strategy work to manage religious pluralism and you know go light on that circumcision business because after all who on earth wants to do a wants to do circumcision back in the day without anesthesia or Or antibiotics So No one god can have all the truth anyway So it's only reasonable for someone if there's no option to be a secular person or not to believe in any gods Because that simply wasn't thought above to at least work the gods as best you can and pick the god that works for you and Find whatever practices work for you Now this isn't really any different from what most americans do we are consumers and we are consumers religiously And so we decide to pick whatever god suits us now again ben shapiro We come into that and say that's not really a way to go And actually if you I that was quite interesting in my conversation Yesterday with with nathan how how nathan described his own story about you know being spiritual but not religious and he he realized that If he actually wanted to make progress with himself he needed Something outside of himself to be accountable to and that's actually what many religious Religions do is they structure you and they discipline you and they they help you begin to make progress in a straight line But it's very easy and i've i've seen I think many people if they pick up If they pick up the book of kings and they'd read this little sermon in second king 17 They would say ah, yeah, this is this is that religious god And I mean if I put this if I slid this document before sam harris and say sam What do you think of this? I think this is very much the story he would tell me But is there anything unusual here to assyria samaria the capital of israel is no different from gath or Or ashtad or gaza or any of the other places they conquered probably when they got to israel they realized yeah here's yet another polytheistic people working on a local virgin version of a of a Religion of a regional fertility cult balea bale and all these different places To be assimilated so that the empire can colonize the natural resources of the people in the land People are people so let's get the people out of here. Let's Cut them off and this is the key thing. This is really what let's let's work in ways to cut them off from their story and in fact if you If you want to help a alcoholic become sober to one degree enough you Change their story if you want to assimilate someone into a prison system You take away their clothing and you change their story if you want to in world war ii take the jews and massacre them You take away their property you take them to a new place you cut off their story It's interesting that even adoption. I mean, especially the way it was practiced up until a number just not too many years ago you know you cut people off from their story and If you cut someone off from their story you can in a sense if you especially if you do it young enough It seems that you can somehow Make them anew now a lot of the very interesting tests with identical twins suggest that There's more that's built into us than we can imagine when you look at people identical twins separated at birth And they marry women of the same name and they drive the same cars and they have the same jobs Those kind of things are fun. But generally speaking the asyrian strategy is a pretty good one And so they come to israel and yeah, here's just another kingdom. Yeah, they got their they got their god But they've got lots of gods and they're pretty much just like everyone else So if you strip away the flags and the pretense of being special Everyone is simply keeping step with the times. It's the 21st year of king a has after all This is morality by calendar and if you listen for it, you'll hear it all the time They wouldn't say it's 712 bc after all because of course, they're not telling time that way By religious and political consumerism or in my best interest ism is pretty ubiquitous. This is what we do But now I wanted to ask a question this is what i've been thinking about i've been working on my sermon When did israel stop being israel did it really happen with the fall of samaria? I think what the book of kings has been saying all along was that israel stopped being in israel a long long time ago And it had everything to do with the bales and their behavior and all of those things that second kings 17 had been talking about israel stopped being israel long before assyria took away its people The people could be israelite or subjects of assyria or anything else. It didn't matter once they were divorced from their stories Sure, they might have had some individual stories and cultures but within a couple of generations that would be all gone One of the things that we don't like to think about is that if you actually how much do you actually know about the generation? Beyond your grandparents or your great-grandparents, you know very very little Do you practice their religion? Your religion has probably changed considerably every time I hear sam harris talk about these dogmas and how religions don't change I think you don't know anything about religion because I watch religions change all the time and you say wow You're a protestant protestants are used to be changed used to changing and that's true The orthodox and the roman catholics haven't changed as much but almost every religion has a spectrum You can find this in judaism. You can find this in islam You can find it in many many other religions that religions are in fact always changing one way or another and often the changes are Unconscious and the people themselves don't really know quite how much they are changing along with everything else So when israel gets destroyed what would be gone? Well, it's their identity and the story it is built upon And again, if you look at my conversation with nathan And he and I talked quite a bit about this About the idea that I have of well, what are we we are a story? We are a story more than anything else now Someone sent me a kind of sent sent me a note on twitter after listening to the conversation and said, you know I'm here. Have you reserved resolved this stuff about the resurrection and I think They mentioned embodiment said yeah, that's why in christianity It's a and jordan peterson has brought this up. It's a pretty amazing thing that unlike many religions Christianity imagines our Re-embodiment Well, what is that? You know knowing now what we know about science. It's kind of like well, of course, I can't be me without a body I need a body and it may very well look especially if you consider the resurrection of jesus And if you believe that was a historical physical event It may very well be that My paul vanderkley 2.0 the resurrected perfected paul vanderkley 2.0 in the resurrection You'll look at me and and and you'll kind of recognize me But it'll also be kind of hard to recognize me because that's what we see with jesus going on And it's really hard to know what's going on in those stories, but i'll be like me and not like me Now it's very interesting that my my grandmother had an idea which I even as a young seminary student kept trying to debunk for her she had an idea that After she passed she wouldn't recognize my grandfather and this gave her quite a bit of trouble and I said lord I said I could say lord I did talk to god about it, but I also talked to my grandmother about it. I said grandma I Really don't think god is going to play tricks like that in the age to come That you know your relationship with grandpa Might very well be different than it is than it was in this in this age but uh, you'll recognize him you'll see him because That would be a that would be a rather cruel thing if we had to just Try and find all those people to question. Are you my grandma? Are you my grandma? And if you read that little book that I read on this kid. No, i'm a snort Someone old pd eastman was that who made that book it was it was bound with all my dr Seuss books that I loved as a kid. Anyway, I digress What was I talking about? Oh, yeah the resurrection The me that I believe god will Reincarnate somehow although that's not exactly the right word because that'll get a whole bunch of other people excited about something I'm not trying to say The me that god will resurrect Yeah, it'll it'll be me it'll be the perfected me it'll be It will be a me I can't fully know or appreciate right now because as I mentioned I mentioned to To nathan If I even just ask myself well Well, what me can I know that let's say I have a list of everything I know about myself I compare it with everything that my wife knows about me and there'll be some conflicts in there That's what happens in marriage and there'll be the me that all my kids know because my kids see me in a different way than My wife sees and there'll be the me that the people of my church see And there'll be the me that the people I worked with in the dominican republic see And there'll be the me that the children that I knew growing up. I went to christian school went k through 12 Pretty much with the same hundred people all the way through And then there'll be the me that my that my doctor knows and sees. I mean, there's just so many aspects of me that It really takes a god to actually allow there to be a me Or a knowable me in all of its manifestations and all of its realities so And therefore only that type of being could actually resurrect me Into the me I could be in and we really have very little idea about what Process looks like in the age to come and I love c.s. Lewis's stories and he plays around with that a little bit But we really don't know anyway Israel what is israel when assyria came and knocked it over I would assert I think the book of kings is asserting Israel was already gone. That's the point of the story That's the point of the way the book of kings keeps telling the story That israel bit by bit by bit in corruption is vanishing and and we talk about this This this greek ship that you know kept getting replaced and is it the same ship? well your car if you live I I live in lovely california where Rust does not consume our cars, but I live plenty in michigan where rust does consume your cars And is the car that the rust is eating the same car that came off the assembly line Israel was rusting away Israel was corrupting away and the entire book of kings is the story about the corruption of israel And we see this happening. We see it happen with governments. We see it happen with people We see it happen with institutions george peterson talks about corruption all the time So by the time assyria gets there I think the part of the argument to the book of kings is Israel's already gone israel's already dead. Well, then you have the question. Well, what is israel? What establishes that identity? Well, it's a story But it's it's not merely a story because the story is tied obviously to to physical history And it's tied to the relation verse and it's tied to all of the different aspects that reality is and again I should really do a video continue to work on videos on reality because as you could hear and again in my conversation with nathan yesterday I'm this is something that i'm continually thinking about now and how how If if we have reality on a spectrum as such highest reality is Highest reality is real on more layers Something that is real on more layers is More real than things that are just on a few layers and layers isn't the right word aspects, we don't really have language for this because this is terribly difficult and And my friend who keeps writing me about heidegger. I got your email. I hadn't heard from you for a while I was getting worried But I got your email just having that time easily trying to email in the afternoon Otherwise if I start writing emails, I never get anything else done. So Yeah, that's Right now That's right now my working draft of reality and and kind of incorporating a lot of peterson that Which is why that which we act out is often more real than ideas now It isn't linear like that and and it can be It can be out of proportion in ways and I can I can think about way more things than I can articulate And I can think about and articulate way more things than I can act out And that is part about me being a preacher bound in time and space But as a preacher that's often true too. I can talk about goodness much better than I can be good and so, you know when jordan peterson for example, i've i'm into the audiobooks of max maps of meaning the introductory chapter I found fascinating but the The the goodness that I can articulate Obviously the get when peterson is working on getting his speech right I mean that's part of the process to getting your life right And actually the book of proverbs talks quite a bit about this where where words are many sin is present basically the book of proverbs says and Well to me who talks and the new testament says be careful those of you who aspire to become teachers because you will be You will be judged at a greater standard. Oh now we're back into the judgment thing anyway So the so israel has a peculiar identity and story and I blogged about this and I wrote about this to crc voices One of my listservs that I participate in I just don't have time for crc voices. I did before now i'm doing the video but Very indebted to them that community for 20 years of great conversation What then to do with the strange god who got angry at the prophet who got angry and the prophets and scribes Who attribute the dissolution of the nation to her sin? That doesn't seem to be a wholly different story a peculiar people are only peculiar if they are in fact peculiar And israel is not and despite the efforts of elijah and elijah never really had much of a taste for it It seems if the lord was was putting out for them. They were happy enough with it But as religious consumers they were always open for a better deal Jacques elul points out that we imagine the post-hoc religious overlay would demand that israel had good times when those kings Had scored a bit better on the deuteronomist scale and bad times under the more idolatrous kings But this seems to be exactly the opposite Now if you take a look at uval harari sapiens, well, that was just such a fun book I enjoyed reading that book He gets into a lot of these things and whereas I obviously will differ from harari on a great many things He really had a way he really packaged things in that book in in a really cool way in many ways He asked the question was it what is an empire an empire is a political order with two important Characteristics first to qualify for that designation you have to rule over significant number of distinct peoples. That's what different differentiates kingdoms from empires kingdoms tend to be these clans or family groups and they're You know, they may have one or two other groups that they Assimilated or enslaved or dominated like the the dutch did to the phrygians. Yes, it's true But Empires are way more How many people groups how many people exactly two or three is not sufficient 20 or 30 is plenty An imperial threat the imperial threshold passes somewhere in between Second empires are characterized by flexible borders and potentially unlimited appetite as syria decides now it wants to eat israel and aram and And the old philistine cities They can swallow and digest more and more nations and territories without altering their basic structure or identity And talks about britain now. What then does it take to create an empire? Well, how are empires created? Empires are created by stories usually multiple stories inter interweaving stories money is a story as And here's the thing bad people people make bad subjects the same reason people make bad slaves We're we're too smart. We're too rebellious. We don't like being subjugated or dominated So many empires use brute force as assyria did assyria was known for its violence and its brutality To the degree that an empire could convert itself peterson talks about this in terms of piaget, too Trying to do this fast. I didn't have time to pull up the clip But if you know your peters if you know your peterson videos You know he talks about this with respect to piaget or that or either just my mental million minions grabbed on to it Because they're interested in it, but to the degree an empire could convert itself into a compelling story It would have to do a lot less over repression And I think this is part of the genius of the american empire because the american empire Certainly has subjugated land and peoples but it what it has managed to do is assimilate Many many many different nations the pluribus unum the melting pot And how does it do it? It does it through story? That's the strongest thing about america is it's story and part of what's Part of what people are feeling right now in terms of the instability of america Is that the old stories that were felt? That were reinforced in the cold war and now And these stories are no longer holding and actually david brooks talks about this quite eloquently Um, i've got a video and one of the one of his talks on the news hour He talks about this america's in story transition right now and that's It's one way to understand the political upheaval that's going on. We're in story transition now well this happened after the cold war too because we You know at each point in the 20th century when we faced a new challenge We were at story upheaval while we were in story upheaval during the depression and There were there were many in the united states who were interested in communism and many were interested in fascism and some wanted to preserve democracy and so You know every revolution is really story upheaval and stories dominate us we live out stories our lives are stories our nations are stories Why is this probably because the only way we can mentally actually Deal with this mysterious world in which we live is by story and so story colonizes us Story colonizes everything like jordan peterson that says, you know stories have us we don't have stories We ourselves are stories. This is how this this thing mixed together So if people willingly give themselves to empire well All the better And one way to understand the bible is to understand israel's god versus empire notice in second kings 17 Back to exodus. I brought you out of the land of egypt. But what is egypt egypt is the paradigmatic empire? and when you get to When you get to the book of revelation Because those within the roman empire don't want to be talking about rome so they use code talk So who do they talk about they talk about babalon? And they talk about egypt and even though babalon gets mentioned again and again in the book of revelation Commentators for a long time have read. Yeah, there's plenty of egypt in there It's all about exodus and it's it's all about dealing with empire And so the exodus the exodus story is israel's origin story and many of us are waiting for november apparently For peterson to start his biblical series again, and i'm certainly very excited about what he's going to do with exodus But read daniel and ezekiel this stuff is crystal clear In the book of daniel the son of man comes and is given an eternal kingdom and you have all this imagery in the book of In the book of daniel about it. And if you want to know what this imagery looks like, yeah Look watch jonathan peugeot's a really cool take on the robots and monsters pacific rim Cool video that jonathan did on that but you know, this is this is all coming from the same place the sea the monsters all that stuff This is this is all in the bible So assyria does this mishmash with the people And the lord sends in lions and again jordan peterson jordan peterson people should just be Cited when they read this the king of assyria brought people from babalon um cutha eva hamath and Zephar vayim and settled them in the towns of samaria to replace the israelites They took over samaria and lived in its towns when they first lived there. They did not worship the lord So he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people was reported to the king of assyria The people you deported and resettled in the towns of samaria do not know what the god of the country requires This is the basic religion and this is why When the israelites went up to take the land in the bible They listened to all their neighbors and says yeah, of course You're not going to do well with that god you met in the desert. That's a desert god You need a god from here You need to have the you need to have the god that's in charge of this and bale is essentially just kind of a local Mob boss that's in a sense what bale is and so King of assyria finds some priests from samaria sends them down there and that's going to take care of the lions, but Then the text goes on to say basically well, what do you have? Well, they're you know, then the then the new people from all these other places Well, they got their little shrine to the israelite god because you know You don't want the lions to get at you But they got the god that they brought with them and they got the gods of the other they got the bale and some Of those gods and it's the basic polytheistic soup You keep working with all these little gods and so, you know The lord keeps away the lions and bale keeps my wife pregnant and ash or ashra keeps my wife pregnant bale Keeps the rains coming so that my fields can grow and this guy over here, you know molek keeps my kids straight And this is this is basically how religious consumerism worked So what died when the north fell I think what the book of kings is saying not even a story the story died and was corrupted years before and so now So on one hand religions change and change and change and change and they get corrupted and you know The story of the protestant reformation is a story about that about martin luther eventually reformed the church either via the protestant churches or the council of trent and the counter-reformation Because everybody in the in the medieval roman catholic church understood that there was horrible corruption and it needed to be fixed and Thanks to the threat of martin luther. It did get fixed but Here's the thing so Why do you both have religions that have changeable pieces and religions that have things that stay the same? Well Keeping a canon that you don't change is one attempt to prevent Corruption. Okay. It's not a guarantee of preventing corruption But it helps to prevent a corruption corruption and anybody who deals with texts should understand that because you don't want to go to 1984 and have oh, this is the you know, everyone keeps throwing away history if sam harris wants to study Bertrand russell and Someone comes to him and says oh we've rewritten Bertrand russell Here's his book, but i've rewritten it sam harris would say no, I want to read The book that Bertrand russell wrote I want to know the one that he wrote. Well, why i've improved it No, how do I know that you've improved it? You probably corrupted it So what religions manage to do is religions have one piece that stays the same there's your There's actually your text that's your canon and then it has another layer and In my church life for a number of years. I've been arguing that the church needs to have confessional conversations And what we're having there is a confessional layer. So in the christian reform church, you have the bible, which we don't change even though we have Some would argue yeah, that's you should use the king james. So it doesn't change Well, we actually don't use the king james We use the niv and so we actually do keep tinkering with the bible and we say we're improving it You can judge for yourself if that's a good idea But we're we're basically trying to have the best text we can and trying to not change that text and even all of the Conversations we're having around the text or an attempt to at least keep the baseline Okay, because if you don't have a baseline Because if you don't have a baseline it's really hard for a community that travels through time To maintain itself because you don't have a baseline So the written document becomes a baseline that becomes your canon that becomes your text That becomes your holy scripture then what you have on top of it and again Jews muslims mormons almost all religious groups do this then you have another set of documents on top of it And this set of documents is potentially changeable and it's accountable to your canon So in confessional reformed christianity in the christian reformed church We have the heideberg catechism the belgian confession and the canons of dor and these are in theory changeable But they've been getting pretty They've been getting pretty stiff Because there's there's real reasons not to change them too quickly So then the christian reformed church just recently added another level level called a contemporary testimony and those things can be Changed and whether they're ecumenical documents or not. Anyway, that's a whole huge conversation Well, this is how it works and and so that's why you want something that doesn't change and if you listen to rupert Cheldrake him talking to the people who keep the constants of the universe Well, we're gonna we're gonna make sure that light stays the same constant even though when we keep measuring the the speed of light It keeps changing a little bit, but we don't like that We want it to stay the same and that's in fact how the laws of physics as matt della hunty talks about them Why they're all looking for that which is basic upon which to build and again if you look at jordan peterson's Easter videos what he talks about there's got to be something at the center There's got to be a stable ground and so materialism tends to look at these laws of physics as their canon That's their stable ground. Well christianity, of course has the bible and and muslims have the quran and Well the book of the mormon the latter day church of latter-day saints is very much a prophetic church They can seem to change a whole lot of things just with new prophets. So Religions sam harris's take on religion is just simply not true In terms of the fact that religions don't change religions are changing all the time What religions are are an organized conversation to try to manage? the reality That you don't understand change if you have nothing that doesn't change in order to To in order to manage change you must have something that doesn't change. Otherwise Everything is change and then quite actually you probably don't see any change at all because everything is just consciousness and in the now So what died when the northern kingdom fell not even a story the story died and was corrupted years before now a little bit later If you keep following my sermons and my rough draft for sunday They're gonna find that they're gonna find the book of the law They're gonna keep finding this book and then they open it and they're like Uh We failed why we haven't been looking at it Why we didn't have something around that at least didn't change for us We need that otherwise, we can't measure ourselves We can't we can't orient ourselves in the world if we don't have something that doesn't change And in fact if jordan peterson were here, he'd say this is deeply psychological You need something that doesn't change and this in fact if you listen to his arguments about marriage This is part of the benefit of marriage because if you're changing people if you're changing intimate partners all the time Pretty soon not even you is you? Because they're changing you and you're changing them What happens in a marriage is that well you've limited the number of variables and well Right now you might think well i'd rather be married to this person Ah, but you have no idea what being married to that person would be so you divorce this when you go get married to that person And maybe say it's better or worse, but i've seen plenty of divorces They're never simple. Okay How many ways are there to language this so ben shapiro had this way of languaging it and and second king 17 had its way of languaging it and Does the diversity of language to tell this story mean that the story? That this story doesn't exist or doesn't have boundaries or isn't most real if it's acted out In other words, even though there are many ways to tell a story it doesn't mean that the story itself doesn't have solidity or reality or ontology of Whatever ontology stories have Israel was always a story There were there was some element of ethnicity, but israel was never just about dna And you can find this with a close reading of the book of exodus a mixed group comes out of egypt and Circumcism becomes the sign and of course any male with a penis can be circumcised non-israelites non-israelites could be enfolded and so israel was always a story and I would assert a Relationship more than it was just simple ethnicity Then you have the question of why didn't god show up? Why didn't god bail israel out of her messes? And even though if you read the book of kings you would say that god bailed israel out plenty In fact a lot of the elijah and elijah stories are god bailing israel out in these acts of deliverance And it's always premised on god remembered david and god remembered You know god remembered his relationship and he remembered his commitments. So when he said, okay I will I will not let them go down in this way Okay But let's go back to the origin story god didn't show up at egypt because the children of israel had a favor to call in In fact, they had even forgotten his name And part of the reason that story is told that way is I think to emphasize the fact that god is the initiator God is the instigator god is where the story starts The story doesn't start with us and this is how the consumerist story starts the consumer story always has myself in the middle And myself at the center and then this is moralistic therapeutic deism and then god is an asset I employ in order to shape the story as I want it. But again if you if you go back to my conversation with nathan It's not so easy to know How I want my story to be partly because with not too much self-reflection I'll realize that What I want changes from day to day and what I want is constructed in the world around me So if i'm living in a in a house full of car nuts I want a nice car and if i'm living in a house full of computer gamers. I want a great gaming ring rig and if I live in a house full of sex addicts, I want sex and we're people are like this and so implicitly when we place ourselves at the center of the story what we imagine is that we are We are the Foundation and and that's part of my criticism about the idea of Coming at us through consciousness that well, that's that's the undeniable. That's the starting space And and sam harris kind of undermines that with his consciousness being dependent on the brain but I'm I'm a very short-lived fickle Creature that okay What I want is going to be my guide. Well again as nathan said quite clearly One of my big challenges are my wants I want keep my Keep my hand the time My wants get me into trouble and read augustin If I All the guy who was sleeping against my door here his wants are his master And it's making a disaster of his life. Is that good? Is that bad? How can you tell he thought it was good? There's one time where he you know the weather'd get bad He'd get himself into the mental hospital for he'd always be careful not to be there too long to jeopardize him getting his check from social Security and so I remember one time he came out of the hospital and I could tell he had he had the correct psych meds dialed in He had all the other drugs out of his system He was looking healthy a bunch of the sores he had on his feet were healed and he was decently dressed and he was clean and he comes up to me and I look him in the eye and his eyes are clear and I'm like, all right. What are you gonna do with your life? You're you've got a clean head right now you're in your right mind what choice are you going to make and I came back later that evening and there was a There was a There was a mattress that he had found somewhere dragged over back behind the parking lot at church And he had a joint in one hand and a beer in the other and it came up to me and he bragged about the crack Orietta in the mattress way ready to do her and it's like Here we are here we are I'm going to base reality on me None of us would agree to having reality based on any other person around us What will I base reality on? Well, here's the thing about God you get rid of them Suddenly you have a problem of what to do instead of him. It'd be like getting rid of Dark matter out of your equations of the universe. Well suddenly your equations don't work Israel is built on the initiative of God Not her ability to maintain her side of the relationship And this is where all of this talk about divine election comes from and divine election doesn't just show up in the new testament What you find in the new testament has its roots in the old God elects israel and the old testament talks about this all the time God sang to israel through the prophets. I didn't choose you because you were the first of the nations I didn't choose you because you were the greatest of the nations. I didn't choose you for any of those reasons And in fact, there's this amazing story in the book of ezekiel where god tells a story with israel about finding a baby That was kicking in the blood and the mud it was like a an infant Abandoned in the mud and god takes this this little girl in and raises her and makes her his queen um You can look you can you can maybe find that in my My many videos on the book of ezekiel that are on my church that are on my church site But now we get back to the strange tension and this is jordan peterson talking to my friend where Okay. Well if god is choosing Does that then destroy Free will does that then destroy our agency and and this is where and i've been thinking about this a lot lately with all the Thinking i've been doing on sam harris This is where you know, there's a certain again There's a certain alignment or a certain resemblance between you know some of this materialism and some and calvinism that You know there is there is a recognition in both philosophical systems of how deeply constructed we are and that Yeah, well, why are you a christian reform pastor paul because your father was because your grandfather was well Well, why did you maintain your religion and and many other people have gotten rid of it? well because my parents were wonderful parents and maybe my temperament is such that i'm temperamentally conservative because because in some ways I am even though i've i'm politically not that conservative temperamentally i'm conservative I Growing up I my mother would make my lunch and I would eat the same thing for lunch every day My mother said don't you want a different sandwich? I said no same sandwich. I like eating the same thing every day Maybe that makes me autistic. I don't know but Why am I who I am My parents my grandparents my great-grandparents. I'm the sum of all of that well, then you get into jordan peterson land and i'm all of this stuff from Thousands or millions of years and it's all been built into me from the bottom up and the identical twin studies and the separation and and I am a deeply constructed person and part of what science and the materialists many of whom are the many of the material What that vision of the world emphasizes is that we are deeply constructed that if I had been robbed from the hospital at birth and Raised by a different family an abusive family. I probably wouldn't be here telling these stories or doing this in this way maybe In some other ways I would but how do we know how could we know we know history is like this We know reality is like this. That's why science works. That's why technology works, but is that actually sufficient to Account for who we are and to me the answer is clearly no there's way more to us And and so then again peterson comes down to it says no, okay now I'm working on the god stuff and what impressed me and and I talked about this in the little video that I did with matt that If I post that i'll put that little video before Maybe I should just post that little video anyway, um just ahead of time but if I Peterson was amazing in that video because again, this is what strikes me about this guy How well he worked that crowd of 160 people at the vip event listening to them, but also When he was listening to my friend matt peterson at this point is a no place in the hierarchy where he needs to deal with Paul vanderkley or my friend or any of us nobodies He's got the attention of the mass media. He's got money from his book sales and his book tour He doesn't have to deal with Someone like me and some of you out there will say paul You should talk to sam harris sam harris isn't going to talk to me Why isn't sam harris going to talk to me because there's nothing in it for him Because I don't have anything to offer him and we see obstacles and obstructions and so you know Who's in charge of vox? I mean he'll have a sam harris will have a debate with him because they're at same status wise I mean, you've got your intellectual dark web these people aren't going to pay any attention to me. I'm I'm a nobody and I am a nobody. I I really am and I know some of you write me He said no, you're not a nobody I really am i'm a nobody but peterson Listened to this guy's take on christianity and peterson asked him questions and you could tell by his voice that he was sincere and and this is This is something alarmingly Refreshing in our world where someone of high status would now i'm going to use theological language condescend To listen to a low status person You know what we use that language when christians talk about prayer because there's nobody higher status than god And so part of I think the the offensiveness of the idea that god listens and answers prayer Is that he busts the hierarchy when he does it that the god of the universe Would care about me and actually matt talks about that in my conversation with matt a lot That was a central thing to his conversion that Someone of such high status would care about me And I talked about that with matt so at some point at some point my video with matt will be seen and if If matt decides to never post the peterson video that's up to matt but My video with matt well i'll show that at some point So how could the disobedience of the people um the people bring israel's destruction But her obedience not guarantee it and I think this is what's right at the heart of this problem because this is the This is the piece of logic that we bank on if israel's Obedience brought her destruction We therefore it is implied that our obedience Can guarantee our salvation? And that I do not believe is true And I don't think it's true of natural law and we see this all the time. I go to the doctor and say doctor I haven't smoked Oh, but I can still be hit by a car What it shows is that Who we are and what we are Could the disobedience of the people bring israel's destruction, but her obedience not guarantee it Yes Can empire be obedience? Is the prophetic or are the scribes of the book of kings saying that if if israel had complied with a covenant Then israel would have shined like the sun and stood above the nations as the prophet so often imagined Could israel have fulfilled her end of the deal? That's exactly the question that troubles us because if we say israel couldn't then it's unfair or unreasonable for god to hold her accountable but if israel could Well, then god is able to punish her But this is always the question with how many different things in life questions with alcoholics and people who are messing up because we we look at an alcoholic and and we say You could stay sober if you wanted to Really do we know that and if you've dealt with enough alcoholics, you know have a little bit of humility about that question Question Once that question is posed your glance should go directly to jesus why well this is how jesus answers the questions of the old testament Because jesus was faithful israel. That's how he's portrayed in the new testament He's faithful israel And shouldn't say she oops And he too was dismantled by empire of the day He was spread naked on a cross for the political sport and mockery Even though he unlike israel had fulfilled the government. Here's how the new testament sets it up and this is set up by the book of Job and it's set up by how many different places in the old testament boy my My software is running terribly today. I hope my video is in better shape than this But you know the the sound recording I hope should be good So The idea of karma and of religion is this If I obey and comply then I will be blessed And if it's just a this age religion, i'll be blessed in this age Then it's my name is earl a tv show that was on a few years ago do good and you'll receive good We very quickly learn in this world that that's not true Okay, well adding god if you add god to it. Does that make it true? Well, there's the question the book of job suggests no So then you run a thought experiment. What if someone fully complied? With the law what if someone lived a perfect life? Well, this is exactly how The new testament and the church sets this up because it said well We can't really answer the question about israel if israel had fully complied and fulfilled the law if she in fact would have Become the center of one world kingdom and all the nations would have flocked to her And the and the earth had been filled with the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea so says the prophets But what if one man what if one man were perfect? What if one man did everything right? What if one man could answer all of the questions correctly and in fact live correctly could not only Speak with authority but live perfectly Wouldn't that man then? Go up to the top of the hierarchies and rule the world from Jerusalem wouldn't israel be fulfilled in a sense That's what israel is looking for and waiting for and the answer of the new testament and of jesus is no Why Look what happens to him in a vicious culture war where romans and zealots and essenes and Pharisees And herodians could not agree on anything the one thing they could agree on was that the world would be better without jesus and that should temper all of the ideas that jesus is some real nice guy that we would instantly love whether you're a christian or Or whatever kind of person you are no jesus People found jesus deeply disturbing and troubling and attractive all of that at the same time And I've brought up tim keller's great appropriation of jonathan edward's observation of the of the discordant Excellencies that jesus was he was attractive and he was repulsive. He fascinated and he horrified And this is why he caused so much dissonance among people. They decided to kill him That's what jesus was now He was also perfect and if you think about what perfection would be That's how we would respond to perfection Part of us the the better parts of us would be attracted to him And the more imperfect parts of us would be revulsed repulsed by him and so even peter his his number one Disciple when jesus lays his plans out in front of peter peter says i'm not going to let that happen And jesus says get behind me satan And jesus says get behind me satan Well, why is this playing out this way? Well, this is exactly what you would expect from a perfect person in an imperfect world If you found perfection you would both lust after it and want to get rid of it because it would destroy your life And this is the story of jesus so the question is can empire be obedience Perfect obedience will be destroyed in this world, but really So if disobedience yields dissolution israel pre-dissolved its identity even before assyria Just made it obvious by moving the flags and and again you can you can see this all the time Organizations are corrupt and fail from within And finally the outer edifice collapses we saw that with the soviet union we're probably seeing it with north korea You see it all the time Institutions arise if they corrupt they they break apart from the inside out and it falls in and this is what happens all the time with human hierarchies Why doesn't obedience secure the kinds of blessings our religious consumerist hearts long for doesn't that seem fair? And this in fact is something that people Implicitly or explicitly bring to me as a pastor they say pastor. I am going to church I am tithing I am Not having sex with my girlfriend or I am being faithful to my wife or I am being a good wife And I am submitting to whomever you say I should submit to and I am holding authority over whoever you say I'm supposed to have authority over I am obeying all the rules. Why isn't my life working? And I have to say are you more perfect than jesus and anyone? Anyone that's been catechized and the church will say no And then i'd say If you look at jesus life does perfection get you This imagined good life that you think you want What did it get jesus? In fact the better you are the more you will be attacked Well, can we triumph can we crack the code let's take god out of the picture again And and let's just have natural law and and can we if we crack the code of natural law can we fulfill it? Think about how many times you heard jordan peterson talk about dostievsky's Piano keys he quotes this at length in maps of meaning And i'll quote it myself a little bit more length now I ask you this is dostievsky from notes from underground Now I ask you What can be expected of man since he is being and since he is a being endowed with strange qualities Shower upon him every earthly blessing drown him in a sea of happiness so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface Give him economic prosperity such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species That sounds like a someone who's needs to read 12 rules for life because he's in his mother's basement eating cheetos playing video games looking at porn not even propagating his species, but just I won't go there And even and even then out of sheer ingratitude sheer spite man would play you some nasty trick He would even risk his cakes and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish the most uneconomical Absurdity simply to introduce into all this positive good sense his fatal Fantastic element. This is who we are It is just his it is just his fantastic dreams his vulgar folly that he will desire to retain Simply in order to prove to himself as though that were so as though that were so necessary That men are still men and not the keys of a piano, which is the laws of nature Which the laws of nature threaten to control so so completely that soon one will be able to desire nothing, but the calendar And this in jordan peterson 2015 maps of meaning ascribes to the celebrity atheists and that is not all even if man really were Nothing, but a piano key even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics Even if sam harris had his way with him fully with his rational mind Even then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something perverse out of simple ingratitude Simply to gain his point and if he does not find the fight and if he does not find means he will contrive Destruction and chaos will contrive suffering of all sorts only to gain his point He will cause he will launch a curse upon the world and as only man can curse it is his privilege The primary distinction between him and other animals Maybe by his curse alone. He will attain his object. That is convince himself that he is a man and not a piano key If you say That is all if you if you say that is all this too can be calculated and tabulated Chaos and darkness and curses so that the mere possibility of calculating It all before would stop would stop at all and reason would reassert itself Then man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his point You'd almost think dostoevsky's sitting down with matt dilahunty or sam harris at this point I believe in it I answer for it for the whole work of man seems to consist in nothing But proving to himself every minute that he is a man and not a piano key It may be at the cost of his skin. It may be by cannibalism And this being so can one help being tempted to rejoice that it has not yet come off And that desire still depends on something. We don't know Yeah, tostoy dostoevsky He's brutal Okay little self-important center of the universe what independent Unconstructed self-existed platform will you stand upon to put god in your debt read the end of the book of joe? How will you stand and say I can save myself When my sister was a little girl She was angry with my mother and decided she's going to run away from home And so she announced to my mother she's running away from home And my mother said fine But you have to leave everything i've given you What do you mean? No clothes no toys She's probably six years old. You're a six-year-old girl. What have you done? What have you done that you cannot credit your parents for what have you done that you cannot credit your culture for? What have you done that you cannot credit your religion for what have you done that you cannot point to someone else and say? I am the heir of this long list of things If you're an evolutionist a lobster What have you done this mind that you have the education you received the dna that you inherited from countless countless generations? The likes of which you don't know you do a spit test just to get a little percentage of maybe who they were On some scale or another we are all heirs of this incredible line yet. We stand up and say Me I will do it Your story is Another continuation of this much larger story and if it weren't for that entire story you wouldn't exist Everything you have even yourself your dna your story your identity came from god Well, no, it didn't come from god. I don't believe in god. Where did it come from came from the universe? You got verizon lisa there came from the universe you didn't make you You can't construct you if any group should know this it's the materialists They are the ones that are beyond a doubt Should be aware that They can't attribute to themselves this great insight of rationality and the promise that it holds for the world None of us can on any score We are all We are all heirs of our past Is that all we are now? I would say no They would have to say yes. So how on earth can they imagine themselves by their own rationality to Self-create this world What could you possibly give a being that literally owns Everything can we save ourselves? We can't even establish ourselves We can't even credit ourselves and now you're saying well, but but are you saying are you saying we can't between ourselves? Credit us things when we do so we always assume a certain pattern Let's say Lebron james is a great basketball player. He is Should we credit his mom? Yeah Did lebron james add to it? Yeah What is that thing that he added? We really can't say we don't know What's what's the difference between lebron james and some other great person? We don't know We just don't know why are we so scared to admit that? Well, I think it's scarier to admit that in a universe in a universe in a universe without god Than it is to admit it in a universe with god So then we find other gods and this is what we do You can't save yourself for much of anything much less everything Without employing that which you haven't borrowed or stolen or been given by birth. It's preposterous You can't save yourself Your smarts your character your education the matrix of morality you judge the world through are inherited Materialists should admit this more than anyone because they say it's all inherited launched by the big bang Give me one miracle and i'll explain the rest baby If you watch any of my sermons, you know, I always use the heideberg catechism why Because it helps me structure this reality The heideberg catechism is structured misery deliverance gratitude misery. I'm fallen and I can't get up I can't get up often my attempts make things worse deliverance out of no obligation God gives grace God saved israel out of egypt because he chose to Simple your obedience Can't affect your deliverance gratitude Now I need to get to work With everything that's available to me This is I respond To god's grace. That's the christian life. That's human life. That's the good Because i've been given something I say I'm going to use what i've been given And i'm going to respond in gratitude. I am going to do just like My hero has done for me watch saving private ryan Earn it what did that mean? It meant that tom hanks and his little crew gave their lives to find private ryan What does that do for private ryan? It made him the man he is Now can we do all the math on this no Can you throw questions at me about this? I can't answer yes But I think this is the outline. This is the best outline I've been able to come up with Heideberg catechism locates the ten commandments not under deliverance in misery it says we can't keep the law But under gratitude my accomplishments aren't from a clean room I am no clean room I'm the heir of all these past generations. I borrow the stuff of god to work in the world He made It's a stewardship. I don't own anything naked. I came into the world naked. I'm going out of it. Well I hope they put a suit on me But this is this is how it is I'm a story. What can a story grab? What kind of story how can a story fill a suitcase? My stuff of my body is from god It's borrowed i'm stewards of it and god says here have this stuff use it play with it I want to see what you can do with it Please do something great and god all the time is you know, just like we look at our kids You give your kids something and they they mess around and they make a mistake and they do stuff and See, I don't think it gets rid of agency but it's I just we we are just not sufficient creatures to take credit For something as large As the salvation of our story It's more than just from above and so The deeply religious argument is that god tells us to do it Yeah The deeper religious argument is that we can't so what is god going to do? When we can't do it now. Yes, all kinds of questions come in You know, well why me and why not me and So with with with nathan's That's where we went with my conversation with nathan too why Why does he get it and he doesn't get it? Why? Why does that why can this person go to a? And get it and start leading a sober sane life and this other person's been through rehab eight times Is it biology? Maybe Is it Is it The circumstances of their failure Is it the circumstances of their family life? Maybe we don't know are all those factors factors. Yes Remember reality the more real the more all the layers. That's why acting is more real than just talking That's why I can say the good better than I can act the good I and that just gives us a sense of what limited agents we are and how small and powerless we are Which is why? It brings such tremendous comfort that despite the mess I can make of my life the shortcomings I have that It is not a matter of qualifying It is finished it is done for us because if I have to do it for myself I can't get there And I think that's the best answer because Even the good that I do is what the heidberg catechism says I was trained in the catechism at my youth. I'm just Fulfilling my program and I know there's always some commenters that say your church and your parents really messed you up I'm a happy mess my friend Even the good that I do is dependent on what he gives me go ahead and build a house Without The materials of this earth that do not come from you Go ahead and think With the gray matter That you cannot take credit for you did not build your brain Well, but I ate and I exercised and blah blah blah blah blah. Yeah genetics had a whole lot to do with it We all know that It isn't just compliance compliance alone can never finally get there That's why It's grace I think that's my last slide The computer's not really working well today Yes, it is my last slide So I was watching a I was watching I was reading a thing on how to be a better youtuber and there's all these things i'm supposed to do that i'm not doing and maybe i'll do them sometime, but It's just a little me in my office in my tiny little church, so Just a little program note rebel wisdom was here on sunday It's just delightful this is what I mean by you can't take credit for things but The turn of events in my life over the last since last december when I started making videos is absolutely inconceivable That you know these guys from the uk would come and spend a day at living stones and my congregation Boy the shock on their eyes like who are these people? What are they doing? And you know, they don't watch my youtube So like what are you doing on youtube that these people would come and do this? And when I when these happy things happen, I just think god is good god is good and What god will do with any of this? I have no idea but Another thing that I wanted to pick up Was was in on the rubin report? Episode with jordan peterson and eric weinstein I've got to find it again because I watch things in my my my minions Stored away for later then I got to find the dumb thing again Weinstein at some point makes an argument that The reason the intellectual dark web can can merrily proceed is that there's a level of trust that things will be okay There's a religious move because isn't that what religion does all these stories that sam harris complains about Hydro-bacatechism first question and answer What is my only comfort in life and in death that I am not my own but belong body and soul and life and in death My faithful savior jesus christ was fully paid for all my sins by his precious blood And has saved me from the tyranny of the devil He watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my father In heaven, in fact all things must work out for my good Believing that is often aspirational But if you can believe it Even in suffering and again, I think this is something that peterson gets deeply right We need meaning to deal with the inevitable suffering of this world if even the world's most perfect man Would be killed by empire handed over by his own people When he hadn't done anything deserving death and everybody agrees on that Well, that's the kind of world we live in so How do you want to live? How can you actually have joy in this world? And I would argue Even the best things are yet to come As I told as I told my friend nathan I i Why not believe this story? This story is just simply too good not to Not to see your story inside of it there's a good ending
