Catherine's of Sinai I grew up in Berkeley and traversed the New Age spent 12 years in a Hindu Hindu meditation cult begged God to save me met Christ then wandered into Protestantism for ten years before trying the Roman Catholic Church of my birth after Pope Francis was elected I finally studied church history well I didn't do that earlier with a PhD in clinical research psychology is a mystery I became Eastern Orthodox in 2014 at 56 was training to become a monastic when my widow deacon stepped down and got me to marry him in 20 this story has everything and has a romance thread it has it has a business side it has this this pitch was the pitch of pitches especially for this corner we want interested folks to come visit our place we have two RVs right now where there or we are currently trying to get permits to build a small RV place our eventual goal is a small Orthodox community of a few who are serious about gaining ceaseless noetic prayer and theosis bam wow yeah I bet need some savings throws the okay get ready Alexander I'm bringing you in and here she is oh you got on mute good morning God bless you morning God bless you confessions of a control all like this case we don't get my whole story in here this is the book oops which is being edited by an orthodox monastic publisher and the title is always up for change but confessions of a control a holic will stay the colon after it might be chasing healing chasing healing because that's what I've been doing since I was 15 and here's my wonderful Orthodox boomer grandpa I told him I needed to come and sit next to me to give me bravery and things let's see which side of things this way okay there he is there he is so yeah that's Elias Union he is the Chandler and he's been doing the candle business up here in the 8000 square foot warehouse since 1998 the year I had my first biological kid but not with him the other subtitle of my book used to be don't destroy your second marriage too because I destroyed my first marriage but anyway he found me and talked me out of becoming a nun and he was ready to retire anyway from the diaconate we're here in Sonora at St. Susanna Orthodox Christian Church and so that's a little bit of the later history how we got together was crazy and like you said it was it ended up to be a romance at first I just ghosted him for like 12 weeks and told him to leave me alone and got the bishop involved and told him to tell him to leave me alone but he needed a wife because his matushka had passed away and you know widowers who have a wonderful marriage they get married again rather quickly some of them yes they do he needed a wife to help keep him alive basically because he didn't know how to cook or not that I know how to cook I didn't even know how to do the laundry especially widowers of a certain age we used to always tease my actually we've said you know if my mother had died first I tell my father you go to my sister's house now you go there now and you and and then we'd have to put a fence around him to keep the women away because of course there's tons of widows at that area and a man who has been has who's had a wonderful first marriage oh it's it's brutal but we only have 20 minutes and where I love to have two hours we have to get going so Alexandra tell me about you said you were you were raised Roman Catholic talk to me about that okay and you can stay honey or not and just make sure we get enough time for me to do shameless plugs for our print mount icon business that we only recently started and our mainly church prayer candle business but we also make I guess I'm doing the plug now and and we make molded campus okay since you're doing the pitch how can people find you okay the pitch would be okay so union of all icons calm is our Shopify website which we're working really hard my husband believes in stocking inventory and we're not doing custom orders yet and we're running out of inventory we're making icons by a wonderful priest who reposed last year father Luke Dingman my husband came into orthodoxy when all those seven or eight hundred people in the Santa Cruz Mountains went from the Wee Kirk independent Protestant Church into orthodoxy together like on a group so father Luke Dingman became an iconographer this is his last judgment behind me which is very popular these days I it's it's used as a link or a thumbnail on even Jonathan Peugeot had it as a thumbnail so I went up there and said hey you know I've got the rights to this you know you should have me on or come visit me yeah why haven't why hasn't Peugeot had you on well see we are very below the radar I mean I don't have a real blessing on my channel all I do is make videos not of myself I make videos of our dogs the candles being made the icons being made because I am the biggest ham in the whole world and I struggle a lot with vainglory and pride so he has kept me reigned in I did do one other interview with young penitent so go sign up to young penitent you guys he's a orthodox guy middle-aged she used to be a rapper he's doing some new music now he'd be a good person for you to also have on gosh so anyway anyway so back to my story I guess because yes we're here for the stories and you're just brimming with them I am you know we grew up in Berkeley Kensington I didn't realize that I was sort of privileged at the time but my parents were doing very well as chemists but when Vatican to hit my father was brokenhearted because he wanted to be a priest in the 50s very traditional Latin Catholic he knew Latin fluently he was always reading his bravery and everything and his heart broke when the modernization happened and then my mom threw him out of the house for he had mental illness they're both deceased now so I feel like they they're up there and I can talk about them freely you know I love them I love them more the longer they're reposed which is very interesting in orthodoxy we pray for the reposed a lot and it's really changed how I think about my parents and I forget interesting and I was a brat but so they fell away into Berkeley intellectual culture music but basically hedonism so they were too old to be hippies really so they were very educated high culture jazz people into art and you know we always had black jazz musicians at my mom's house after so the 70s got very rough I don't think our parents knew that sex drugs and rock and roll was pouring into the high schools from the hate Ashbury yeah all under their noses and I mean they had no idea they have no idea so I started to emulate my parents basically I figured you know we were very upset about the divorce they never told us why they were divorcing we just came home one day and had no dad so brutal yeah it took me like 20 or 30 years after that for my second shrink I think to tell me you know you had a really crappy childhood I thought it was normal so I had a lot of fun being a bad girl I embraced sex drugs rock and roll starting at 15 I went to every single day on the green by Bill Graham I was we had bottles of Jack Daniels in our high school lockers we were my girlfriend and I were stealing people's pharmaceuticals out of their medicine cabinets you know we drive up to their house and say oh our car overheated can we use your bathroom this is at 15 yeah and they let us in and we'd rifle through their medicine cabinets to find barbiturates I mean I could have been Karen and Quinlan probably six times okay yes yeah look her up I also had many people don't know that but people who are our age know it I could have been I almost I missed getting picked up in a car by Edmund Kemper my friend and I were standing at the bus stop in Berkeley to go to ballet in whatever year she died and she got in this car and I said no Wow yeah I only remembered that like three years ago like so it was all sort of repressed but now I'm gonna speed this up because this these are speed rando conversations so talk to me about okay so you can be rebellious and high school did you go to college so then I was smart enough to get into college luckily and that really saved me because I developed intellectual interests in things and I decided because I got straight A's in psychology that I become a clinical psychologist and pursue a career because my mother told me the most important thing in life is intellectual satisfaction that's all she knew because yeah then I she led me into a well so yeah college I was pretty much non-religious at all then I became a little new age II yeah crystals and LSD and lots of you know really good assets and stuff like that yeah and then my mom led me into a Hindu meditation cult in the early 80s it was Swami Muktananda who had died his the person that took on after him was a female guru and so my mom went to India I tried to move to India but luckily God stopped me after I had a lot of Kundalini awakening out-of-body experiences demonic visions so many things they're all in get you know in the book and one day in 1994 there was a big scandal in the cult and I had just been on my face on the floor begging God to save me out of this cult and I heard myself literally saying I need a safe religion I need a savior and as soon as I said I need a savior I took it back instantly like yeah that's the scary part you know I'm fine but three months later my brother almost died in a hospital in Oakland Kaiser and I ended up at his bedside and I met Christ so he remembered that I had asked him and he and then I just yeah I was Protestant for a lot of years went to every church in the county loved it I have so many friends but it started to get a little dry for me and I wanted to go deeper in prayer so I went and started researching my Roman Catholic roots and got into st. John of the cross st. Teresa of Avila but you know for a long time I mixed the Hindu guru group with Jesus and I got confirmed as a Catholic while I was in the cult so later I after st. Francis after Pope Francis got elected I just had like a shiver go up my spine and I said no something's wrong here I mean we've been to Rome in 2012 I loved Pope Benedict because I was a rad trad you know I had covering everything because basically what also helped me was I moved to the mountains here in Sonora and met a mountain man and got married and had a normal life I became a red person instead of a blue person so that helped a lot to become more conservative and family-oriented I raised four stepdaughters not very well and had two boys I've repented to all my stepdaughters many times you know I just so then not Roman Catholicism just started to look a little crazy as we know and then I just started reading church history and found Orthodoxy online there wasn't that much in 2014 but I visited my local church and met the deacon and all the wonderful people up here and yeah it got baptized pretty quickly there 2014 and then just a couple years later got married and now he says if he reposes before me I can still go be a nun if I want now that we live in the 8,000 square foot warehouse where we built a place to live and we are waiting permits to see if we can have a very small RV place and we know we can have people that are just off the road we were right on the road to Yosemite so we're gonna have four spots and maybe a few trailers but we have two RVs now if anyone wants to come visit I am just very much into prayer and studying the Saints and trying to do the Jesus prayer ceaselessly and go to church as often as possible together and so that's like brings you a little bit up to the present and I just try to let God you know rule over me because I need a lot of ruling over because I'm unruly well that was that was definitely a speed rando you you you put into and as a number of comments are saying you know this is a this is a life story this is a life story needs needs two hours at least and that's that's true that's true for many people and especially when when you get to be about our age you you know you have a lot you have a lot and you've had a full life everybody has a book too I mean I was ballerina I worked at the of health I've toured Europe with the singing choir yeah I mean I had a great life I had and I have a great life because I was chasing healing and I was always searching for everything beautiful good and true except for the self-destructive part you know that was in there so yeah everybody I think has a book I we had a lot of big ideas here before COVID like we built out this place we have a flotation tank which I'm not really advertising and we're certainly not doing anything public like we were gonna become a health spa no more I I dropped my license I dropped my clinical license because I got old all of a sudden COVID aged me and I just said I can't be that much out there you know as far as a business in terms of healing like no I just wanted to be prayer and God whoever God brings but yeah we built out this whole 2500 square foot living space it does have a ballroom that Paul you could come and give a talk in we can have I just oh crossover potential here you can come here and we have a 700 square foot ballroom it's got Murphy beds in it so we can get out of it if we need to but yeah and the two RVs are fully equipped so anytime you want to come and stay there's a luxury 40-foot diesel pusher you can come stay in Paul Wow Wow I so I was I've been thinking I have to do in 2018 I did a thing my sister has sort of an Airbnb in New England yeah and so I did a I did a I did basically a two days with about a dozen people there and we just had we just sat and talked the whole time it was awesome I could do something like that by you I mean just have a limited number of people and some people would want to camp and we'll have to we'll have to I'll have to keep thinking about this you could do it right here now I have to plug I have to plug the new monastery so st. Silouan the a thanite monastery had two monks that I was really good friends with they both died they both reposed last year and it's the Russian Orthodox Church outside of Russia has given it over to this wonderful nun named mother Catherine and things are happening over there it's going to be transformed and she's very much interested in outreach to the community she's going to do some aquaponics and have a garden and training young people we might use our wood shop over here where we cut the icon boards to help young adults learn skills so you should come up just to visit that too and I don't know if I left anything out but there's a lot going on in this little corner of Tawalami County believe it or not well Yosemite is one of my favorite places on earth I what I should do it when my son Jared gets married my sister will probably come out you remind me a lot of my sister and I should bring my sister up there and have you and my sister meet each other because I think that would be super interesting and you know I think Jonathan Peugeot might be coming up here soon for something I'm not privy to what it is but he knows somebody that knows somebody and so I go on his streams once in a while and try to invite him to come up because we do have an encaustic beeswax art studio maybe maybe Jonathan and I could come up there and do something together yes but then you might have too many people see I made this in costing thing of father Sarah from Rose in my little art studio just for fun so you know that was part of the initial thing was to have all these activities and people and then we just really withdrew during COVID and it it made me just not want to be as public but you know how God takes the seed and then you have to let it die and crucify your intellect and let it go in the ground and then let God bring up what he wants to bring so but so before we've only got three more minutes before the next speed rando so I have to ask you a question tell me what you've learned about living fast and living slow so living fast you your noose you don't even know you have a noose when you're living fast so has a Kia chasing stillness and at least just slowing down that's what we do have the float tank and the infrared sauna and we have a prayer cave I want people who come here to at least get a taste of stillness because going slow forces you to see the truth the very ugly truths about yourself I didn't know what repentance was till I really became Orthodox and then found out it's a way of life and so I think you know going slower is is better for for people to be able to actually process what's going on and maybe make better choices if they're stuck in addictions and things like that so yeah good wonderful all right we've got two minutes closing thoughts oh I wore your husband you and your husband well my husband is so great I I'm just thankful because I had pestered you before to be a rando and I don't oh yeah just in the comments one time but I don't watch all your videos I don't watch it so I'm a moderator I am a moderator on Church of the Eternal Logos with Harry so he's good Orthodox content and I follow a lot of Father Peter here's Orthodox ethos that's helped us a lot but my husband is just the sweetest wisest person that I know so maybe he can give us ending prayer you could just do a prayer huh you can do a prayer all the sudden Holy Spirit thank you Lord for blessing us today with this talk it's very enlightening and that it might touch a few people amen I can think a few better ways to land the plane here Alexandra Union Union of all icons comm yeah and my email is dr.alexandra.union at gmail I'm we're public because we have a business people drop by yesterday we had some Caltrans guys drop by because they heard about us and they came in and one of them was a wonderful born-again Christian just talking non-stop about how Christ saved him from addiction and everything and we just hit it off so anybody could stop by where it so if you look up San Jose candle on Google it'll map you you know right to us right on right off highway 120 to 70 Paul and I hope we do get to meet in person it'll be very important San Jose candle beautiful yeah I drive 120 that's my that's one of my roots to Yosemite at least during the summer so we'll be seeing you all right wonderful thank you both so much thank you God bless everyone
