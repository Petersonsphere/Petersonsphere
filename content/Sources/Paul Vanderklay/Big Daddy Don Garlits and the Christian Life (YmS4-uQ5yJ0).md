 Hi, this is Paul and many of you will remember Warren Mills. Warren was my host for the Jordan Peterson conference that we had in Australia and I spoke with him not too long ago about his first published book, How Good Is the Golden Rule, and we talked about that before and today we're going to talk a little bit about another book that he has written. Actually he wrote that first and then did the Golden Rule book and then came back to this and I've read about half of the book and it is really a fascinating and lovely book about a topic that I had never given any thought to until I met Warren. So Warren, I really appreciate you taking the time and being with us. This third person is, well who is who is Nicky again just in case people wonder who this Nicky Douglas is, Warren? Ah, Nicky Douglas is my publisher here in Melbourne and her business partner Michael Murphy was responsible for my first book and really she's been responsible for the second one, which I'd put aside as being you know a good try but fail and she liked it enough to encourage me so I started working on the revision of that late last year and it's very happily coincided with the the lockdown so I was able to spend a lot of time revising and I've had lots of insights into why I wrote it. That was really the key and so I've... Well talk about that a little bit because in previous videos and I'll link those previous videos that we've had and we've told a bit of your story you know in the lingo of Australia you're a petrolhead and so talk about talk about why you wrote the book in the first place and then what what changed so that you really you know began to rework it. Yeah, my motivation for writing initially was that I was part of a men's Bible study group, a small group, in the home of Stan and Gigi Hankins from North Carolina. He was a great guy and I really enjoyed his hosting and the fellowship of these guys. We had quite a few in that time and so we started doing the ordinary things that you do in small groups you know we did alphur and a few things like that and we started becoming a bit broader and more philosophical in our discussion and I remember a particular incident where I quoted the scripture that says some of you cross land and sea to win converts and and turn them into bigger devils than yourselves and the group was astounded that that could appear in scripture so I went away did some work and you know got the references and started to do some writing and and so then the writing just sort of kept going that happily coincided with my partial retirement and I knew I had a book in me because I had first planned it about 40 years ago a long time ago and I kept my original notes about what this book should be about and and so I thought then that it could be about my lifelong hero whose name is Big Daddy Don Gallus who's an American drag racer and I'd followed him since I was about 12 literally when I I bought a hot rod magazine with my vacation pocket money and I was fascinated by this guy who was an underdog and Australians love underdogs because he was from the swamps of Florida and he would drive across the continent to compete in California where the action was and he beat them and take home all of the money and he did it with a car he designed and built himself and it was initially was an awful machine it was just a an old Chevrolet frame with a Chrysler hemispherical V8 in it and anyway that really captured my imagination his tough grittiness and his innovation and so he kept on winning from the mid 50s when I first became aware of him or late 50s I guess until he retired from open competition I guess in the late 80s and so I I found his email and sent him a message and proposed that I would do this story about his spirituality because mid career he put the cross on his car and and the words got his love and he never explained it at least not to my satisfaction and we didn't have YouTube in those days so do I he encouraged me and he thought it was a great idea so I started to to write and I shared bits and pieces with my men's group and a lot of it actually came out of the discussion with them and from that my bunch of blokes project was was born which I've mentioned before and I finished the book and submitted it to Harper Collins with a very good introduction from Julian Clark my my mate who was at the time the head of News Corp Australia and Harper Collins is part of their stable and they thought it was rubbish so I was severely chastened by that and it was too really it just it was as I said before maybe a good first attempt but not good enough so I I parked it and and then I did my golden rule book which we launched in March last year and I must say that the response to that has been has been disappointing and so I guess that's the problem that all people like me have you've mentioned pastors with unpublished books or books of which they've sold a hundred copies. Mostly to their church and family. Yeah yeah well there's there's one person that's bought a lot of this book how good is the golden rule it's me I have I have got some readership in Italy though and and other places that I know nothing about and it's available on Amazon so who knows but it seems as though everyone takes the golden rule for granted they say oh of course yes that's what you have to do you've got to treat others as you'd like to be treated and love your enemies and it sort of stops there it's part of the liturgy that we say every Sunday in church and I remarked in the book actually that I did some search to find previous books and sermons on the golden rule and there's there's very few it has been significant in different places at different times but it seems as though it's hard to generate any interest in taking it seriously as a discipline that we actually consciously and purposefully implement in our lives because what I've learned and the reason why I think it's significant why why significant to me is that when you do it when you start to try and apply it in a serious and consistent way you realize that you can't do it and that it defeats us and that we're actually hypocrites and what we really want most of the time is for people to do to us what we want right and we dress it up in in the clothes of the golden rule but actually we're only kidding ourselves and so that's where the charge of hypocrisy comes from which is often I think well-earned and so I've I've taken that as a salutary lesson and I've revised that book as well and I've called it the golden rule a panacea for every pandemic which is a bit opportunistic I know but and I've changed the introduction and the conclusion to the book a lot and and that's come about both as a result of you know the apparent lack of success over the last year but also as a result of my writing the the Garlots book and and I realized that the Garlots book is is really about me and this whole thing of hero worship and I've discovered a very well established theory called memetic theory by Renae Girard who I whose name I learned from you and the memetic theory is that we learn from others by mimicking them of course that's what an infant does and mimics its parents and then its its siblings and friends and that's why little kids develop accents that their parents don't possess and and so this whole thing about learning from our peers from our surroundings is is a very important insight but I think it's got to do ultimately with with what we desire and so we we form these desires as a result of all sorts of unseen forces in our lives and then they perhaps sort of manifest in a person in an individual who we idealize and we we consciously or unconsciously want to be like them and that's the influence that Garlots has had on me all my life and so I visited him with my friend Eugene Eugene Neiburn and he shocked me because he'd already warned me that I'd made him into something that he wasn't and so his lack of pretension and his brutal honesty was really a surprise but that's that's one of the insights I think of the book that he's a no-bullshit guy. Well let's talk about that really you know I really appreciate that you know you've worked Gerard in and and this this hero worship and idealization why do you think I mean at a very young age Garlots got your attention what what about him what about him really struck you because it wasn't just I was watching a show on Netflix about a year or so ago where people were racing super cars against the cars that they were putting together you know in their garage from their pieces and stuff and and of course the I mean the premise of the show is you want the little guy who puts the car together out of stuff that he finds and yeah he's putting some money into that car but he doesn't have a lot of money that compared to the racer who has the the big money he can buy the the six-figure Lambert you know the Lamborghini or the Ferrari and just tuned by the professionals so so talk a little bit more about about Garlots and and then and then probably go a little bit into you know his faith and and how that formed and I like the way you told it how mysteriously suddenly there's a cross and God is love on his car about that yeah I think the interest first of all it has got to do with the Australian pioneer spirit and that's shared I think with Americans who came into this apparently big open unclaimed land we know that's not the case but that's how we took advantage of it and we had to make do with bits of fencing wire to tie things up and repair wagons and and so that idea there was another thing too in in Australia I'm not sure if you had this in America but if you go into country towns you'll see mechanics institutes everywhere and they're old quite grand buildings in some cases now disused or repurposed and so I guess they were built in the the late 19th century and and they housed a library of all of the latest technology you know engineering stuff and how to make machines and make models of machines and and so it was this very virulent apologies spreading of the of the the the new technology of engineering through books and and libraries and and people going to their sheds and building machines from principles that they had just learned from a book so I think I think you see that in in the you know the explosion of creativity with people like Henry Ford and and the Chevrolet brothers and Dodge brothers I think they were and of course the Wright brothers and and there was so many others at that time often who had previously been buggy makers or bicycle repairers or bicycle makers and they jumped on the on the bandwagon and started building cars well that's that's really inspired me to be able because I had a lot of those basic engineering skills that I gained as a as a teenager at home and and then later in the work that I I did as I when I started work as an engineering research technician and so I I have all these capabilities and I could see what other people did with those things and Garlett sort of he he sort of manifest this this spirit of making because the idea of a hot rod is to take something old and to lighten it to simplify it to increase its power and make it perform like something new and so drag racing is that just taken to its logical conclusion well he was the master of it and he and his brother were hot rodders and street racers and then they got bitten by the competition back and started turning their hot rods into drag racing machines that didn't drive on the road and of course that was the process of evolution and and then Garlett's went through a couple of relationships where he was in one case about to be engaged to a girl but she didn't like the job the idea that he'd given up his job as an accountant to become a mechanic because he had dirty hands and so that was the end of that engagement and and then he met his wife Patricia who he was completely head over heels in love with and he gave up hot rodding for her but she obviously knew that the passion still burned and encouraged him to get back into the sport which he did with a streetcar and then of course the evolution took hold and she encouraged him well he by his own confession had gone forward in a Baptist church service that he'd attended as a teenager but it was it was more initially in pursuit of the pastor's daughter but then he met Pat who was a Christian and come from a Christian home and she managed to to bridge the two cultures you know a faithful Christian on one hand and and this this wild-eyed hot-rodder on the other and she obviously she was very capable person and obviously really loved his creativity and his focus and his energy and so she encouraged him and and initially when Noah first married she would travel with him to these events all across America in California in particular but but into the Midwest and because it really the sport really exploded and she was responsible for a lot of his innovations because she was concerned for his safety and would do things like buy him a leather jacket when everybody raced in a t-shirt and that was immediately before he was using a supercharger for the first time and the engine was in front of the driver and running on nitro methane he created the potential for an explosion which is exactly what happened and he was sitting in an inferno and he'd only just started to wear this leather jacket that Pat had given him well that sort of tension between encouraging him and restraining him happened throughout their life and it culminated in him running for a championship event in Long Beach and he was he was on the starting line his car for the the eliminator this is the last run of the day the two cars against each other the car had an experimental transmission in it and he had to service it during the rounds and didn't have time to fill it properly with oil so he ran it only partly filled with oil and the transmission exploded on the the start line and cut the car completely in half and it took half of his right foot with it so he ended up in hospital in Long Beach and he refused to take painkillers because after his previous experience at being badly burned he he hated the idea of becoming dependent on painkillers so he just refused them and so they refused to attend to him during the night and change his bedclothes and his pajamas that would become saturated with with sweat and so in in the midst of this agony he recalls that he he called out to God and the sense of God's presence came into the room the pain went away never came back and so it was while he was recovering from that that he he reconfigured the design of his car in his mind so that the engine was behind the driver which had been tried unsuccessfully before but he he decided that the risk wasn't worth it and even if that was a disadvantage that's what he was going to do so he upon returning to Florida built this new car but as everybody predicted they couldn't get it to run straight and at the at the end of the drag strip at top speed it would be unpredictable as to which way it would deviate and and so everybody said that these cars were all fated that that was a fault that you couldn't fix and it was really Pat who made him persist and she said don't risk your life and she's get back to it and apply yourself to the task you'll solve it and it was his fabricator who realized what the problem was and it was to do with the fact that the driver was now sort of much closer to the the front axle than he was before and he was overreacting and so he was over steering over correcting and and so they made a new steering arm for the car to reduce the ratio and that fixed the problem and so he turned up at the next major event with the car and everybody ridiculed it and but it was successful and within a year almost all of the the top fuel cars had been now conformed to this rear engine design and so then a while later I guess I forget the exact time but some three or four years maybe more later he was building a new car with sponsorship from the Navy who wanted it painted blue instead of instead of black and the car was sitting in the workshop freshly painted and he was in the workshop at the end of the day by himself looking at the car and he he visualized across on the cowl with the words God is love and so it's what he did he painted it on the car and then turned up to the next major event already for the new sponsorship from the Navy to the ridicule of everybody including the press and his competitors and people were saying he's looking for you know sponsorship from the Sky Daddy and things like that and the Navy said well we can't continue if you leave the cross and the words got his love on the car so he said that's fine with me and he points out that that was the most successful car in terms of prize money that he ever had and he won something like six hundred thousand dollars from that one car without sponsorship in the next 18 months or so and and so then that motif stuck but he didn't bother explaining it too much I guess he might have here and there and he wrote a book quite early in the piece called close course and he sort of alluded to it but it wasn't explicit you know wasn't laying out his experience as a Christian and things like that but initially it was a tribute to to his wife really but he's he's attributing God with the insights and the innovations that he made to resolve this tension between taking a risk and and winning races and earning money and keeping safe and so I was always fascinated by that and when I started writing the book I saw a clip on YouTube about him sitting with Pat talking about his experience at Long Beach and then building the the rear engine car and so that that really galvanized what I wanted to say because because I think that he was he was addressing some of the real challenges of making faith relevant in everyday life that wasn't just using religious words and and you know playing the religious game by going to church and appearing to to be a religious righteous person he didn't do that at all and and he went to church and and he often talked about praying and he and Pat would pray together and extraordinary things happen when they did and he acknowledged that but he wasn't religious in the ordinary sense at all and so that was the big shock for me and when I turned up in Florida to interview him and he had some surprises in store for me to really put that notion about him being some sort of sanctimonious religious person to rest. The video I'm working on right now and I said this in an earlier conversation I did today because I always warned that the videos I'm working on might not always see the light of day but one of the I'm working on David Putnam's book American Grace where he he notes the polarization in the American both in the American political sphere over religion and this is a this is a this is a dramatic change from the situation during the Cold War and they try to come to grips with this dynamic via religiosity. Garletts it sounds like is a an interesting mix of religiosity because obviously spurning a potential sponsor by putting a cross and got his love on a car seems religious but then other aspects of his life don't look religious even though as you know you dug into his story saw that he is deeply religious. What are some of the ways that that he resisted sanctimony? It's sanctimony that that catches people's that catches people's attention and deeply turns them off. Hmm yeah I see that that's a really interesting puzzle for me and Eugene D. Bone who went with me and David Wright who was my co-developer of Bunch of Blokes who who understands the American culture very well because he he lived in Colorado for ten years as the president of Youth for Christ and he he thinks I'm backing up the wrong tree and he says that I guess he's saying that Garletts has pulled the ultimate contrary of claiming some sort of spirituality or religiosity at a certain level but ignoring it for the rest of his life and so I see I think that's wrong and the shocking thing about Garletts is that he he talks about garage talk or locker room talk and and sometimes he he falls into it too and that's a shock because Christians as a rule are very careful about their their words and I'm the same you know I occasionally use bad language for effect but if someone else does it I'm always shocked by it and I'm offended but he doesn't care and so I'm not I'm not approving that but I'm just saying and here's here's how it really is this is this is how he is and he admits some tension but you've got to push him to to talk about it and to to try and sort of make it conscious and and so I don't think he's being opportunistic or of course he he grew up in a religious atmosphere where it was expected that you'd go to church and Sunday school and things like that and that that being saved was part of what you did and so that's that's a an influence but he it's really Pat who with her consistent faith and that playing out in in her and her relationship with him and with their daughters and I guess her witness to him that he's he's convinced that this is an absolute reality and so he's saying realities that other people are and so I think even religious people sometimes take on you know the gloss of religion but it's superficial and it's it's it's not deeply rooted I've been guilty of that for a significant part of my life and it really is hypocritical and so by the way Garletts is also interested in extraterrestrials and UFOs and he's not ashamed of that at all in that that's that's outside my league but but that's just the way it is and so I'm saying there's a tension to resolve here and above all else we ought to resolve it on the side of being honest now I I was deeply impressed with my first encounter with Jordan Peterson about exactly that the whole idea of the logos of telling the truth and and being able to to do that regardless of the consequences that we we had to do it and so I guess in a way it's it's playing that out and and taking that to its logical conclusion and and saying well Don Garletts is an ordinary sinner and so am I and ultimately we're dependent on God's mercy and so we're just going to get on with our life and do what we do make our mistakes and not wear them on our sleeve necessarily but like Martin Luther says sin boldly but love Christ all the more. Now you mentioned you rewrote the book what what prompted because because again you first turned it in HarperCollins didn't want to have anything to do with it you you know haven't you you wrote the the Golden Rule book but then you said you know something happened in you and tell it tell me about that what what changed what changed to make the book a better book from the first one that you wrote. I guess it was the insight that the Golden Rule is really intended for us to learn about ourselves and so of course it it has it sets up the goal of treating each other of treating other people well and being under God's scrutiny being accountable to God because that's part of the formula but the real outcome of applying it seriously is that we start to learn about ourselves we get some insights into our motivations and to our character and what do we do when we find ourselves making the same mistake over and again. Well with that insight I started to see more clearly about my interest in Gullis of course the books there and it's for all intents and purposes finished but not not really able to be published and so why did I write it and you know am I trying to make something religious out of a very ordinary obsession or is it does some sort of insight that I haven't really been able to bring to my consciousness and articulate and so I think when I started to over the years I'd made several notes and and I'd retitled it and had some attempts at trying to to reframe the argument of the book but when I started to write it I that coincided with me hearing you talk about René Girard and so I started to do some investigation there and and slowly the picture became clear about memetic theory and hero worship and scapegoating and all of all of that that's implied by Girard's theory and and so I've never seen anyone write quite like this and but it's it seemed to hang together as a story. Incidentally it's it's really been confirmed by Mike Lewis who's the vice president of Don Schumacher Racing which is one of the biggest drag racing teams in America and he's a good guy he's a Christian guy and runs a very smooth operation you know huge sponsorship dollars and he's reading an earlier manuscript of the Gala's book and he says oh this is fantastic this is going to be a best-seller he might be the only person in the world that likes it but I don't care because because he's got deep insights into the sport and Gala's he knows him personally in fact it was Gala to introduce me to him and so he sees the resolution of this tension and he's absolutely loving it and is making some suggestions as to how to improve it and some of its technical detail but some of its its insights that he's had too so I'm encouraged by that and on another level it's it's it's just me taking on a new career at age 74 or whatever I'm and and and being you know a creator just making stuff using my imagination overlaying that and with my experience being a contrarian liking to think differently disagree with people but I do think that I've tapped a vein which is to some degree why Jesus preferred to deal with prostitutes and and publicans because they're real people and and he condemned the Pharisees and the people who crossed land and sea to win converts and make them into bigger devils than themselves and so I find that a really fascinating tension and and then to try and understand it see how it applies in my life and then to tell the story through you know the character of Don Garletts seems like something worth doing there's a there's a great quote in the book from Don Garletts character determines how far you will go and whether you will still like yourself when you get there but talk about he's obsessively competitive and he was well known for being parsimonious a penny-pinching and he was accused of that and of course in the early days of the sport it was it was complete almost completely amateur and the national events where you got the headlines there was almost no prize money was a trophy and you know and enough to to buy a hamburger but that was it and so to to make a living they would do what they call match racing which was to turn up to small country drag strips and run against another top-line competitor like Tommy Ivo or Chris Karamasini's or Shirley Maldowney so Shirley Maldowney and Garletts were perennial competitors and they were always putting each other down and but of course it got people to attend and so that was what you had to do to to make a living out of drag racing and I guess Garletts is observing in himself what happens when you take something to its logical conclusion whether it's being a competitor or just in it for the money or whatever it is that you have developed as your shtick and what happens to you when you're successful doing that and are you changed as a person are you is your life enhanced or is it depreciated he probably didn't use exactly those words but I think that's what he was getting at yeah well I think about that you know I think about that in terms of Jordan Peterson's story and if he will you know if he what comes with the second book because you know for him fame was rather accidental when he was making noise about C-16 even though you know being on Ontario Public Television and such he did everything possible to become famous and a lot of that just really didn't work and then when he he does something which was deeply himself and deeply unpopular suddenly becomes tremendously famous well now suddenly you know that there's the real test there's the real test and you know you and I have spoken before too about I'll often think about Peterson and compare him with someone like Billy Graham one of the one of the qualities that that was enduring for Billy Graham was that it didn't seem well while that level of oh fame observation wrecked a lot of Christian leaders it never took down Graham he certainly had his stumbles sometimes especially with in terms of relationships with presidents such as Richard yeah yeah it's I mean that's a that's a big thing to become to become a legend even in a legend in a sport and not lose yourself yeah yeah you can see all the time and and especially amongst religious leaders I mean it's inconceivable that people like Bill Hybels and others like him have failed so spectacularly and and and there's others like Jimmy Swaggart and there's plenty of them isn't it and it's seduction and and it's it's our failure to recalibrate I is a term I like to to go back to what you say is purpose and meaning and to say why am I really doing this and what what am I trying to achieve and am I fulfilling my goal what does success mean and I can be successful in terms of money sex and power but is that really what I want and so I think that that's that's the essential question that that Jesus asks of us and he's saying to us continually what's important and I think that the whole idea and you have touched on this a bit too with your discussion about communion and transubstantiation and and taking on the body and blood of Christ I've seen that in in a new light too particularly as a result of my experience at being at St. James where it's it's traditional and liturgical and we have communion every Sunday which is served to us by the clergy and I I've got a new appreciation for the solemnity and the seriousness that that implies that we're taking Christ's blood and body into our cells and becoming like him and that's that's the goal of being human to to return to our first condition of being being made in the image of God and of course the image of God that we're becoming like is Jesus and so I just think that that's just wonderful and and so so I guess being able to understand the theory from scripture and Paul's teaching in particular and and mesh that with the experience of of being uncompromisingly honest with yourself is is the task and I think it provides a vision a foretaste of what's to come I've peppered you with questions anything that you wish we'd have touched on or or anything you want to touch on no um now you you're you you keep on feeding me you're a long way ahead of me and I I try to watch bits of everything that you do and I I pick up more sources here and there and I'm I'm I'm really fascinated with with the discussion with Eric Weinstein and Peter Thiel and and and people like that and what they're attempting and I haven't quite understood what you're uh you're getting out of them but what it does to me is to to bring me back to the elements of faith hope and love and how different they are from wrestling with the ordinary problems of life the material things um and and making them central and you can't contrive them can you you can just see them when they emerge I think as a result of our obedience and so I I'm I'm being dragged along by your coattails as it were and I'm not I'm not in a position to um attempt to keep up with with where your mind and your discussions take you but just to observe them and and see where they fit and then to take from it the things that that seem to enhance and to fit uh with with what I'm doing I I don't think you know you know one of one of the things that you know I'm working on right now is the question of religiosity and I was listening to uh Eric's conversation with a young man who's uh a writer and he's been writing about stoicism and part of the and I think this pertains to the garlics book because you'd say well okay so here you have a here you have a drag racer who's got some rough edges you know he's tremendously competitive doesn't suffer losing very well um you know he's got some fun ideas about UFOs has had some real close calls with death clearly has a very godly wife whose influence has molded him and shaped him you know you have to ask and this is where you know some of my formation amongst the Dutch Calvinism has come from because there's there's always this tension in in Dutch Calvinism between the antithesis which which emphasizes redeemed and unredeemed and then the common grace which says that Christ looks over drag racing and claims ownership of it too and that in there there's something sacramental about um taking cars from the 30s and buying a buying an engine from a junker and and figuring out exactly how this works so that you can do something which seems completely pointless you're not going to the movie theater in this car you're not driving to work the only place you can really run these cars is you know in a straight line down a track in front of everybody who just wants to get from one end to the other quicker and and somehow somehow this bears witness to Christ and and and in a way that the you know the cross and the words on the hood do but even without those it does so too you know what would Jesus Christ have to do with drag racing exactly and it gets into the it gets into what I think and you know you you you sent me some things from John Milbank and I still have to I'm I'm sort of approaching him at the edges right now but it's it's getting into what I think is the attempt to to re to re-put together the two streams of western thinking you know we that they were kind of divorced so that via science we could um understand the world better and and via science you can tune that engine and understand the physics of the frame and all of that but it has to be put back together with the other and in Garlet's unique way he does this without you know knowing anything about Thomas Aquinas and transubstantiation but in a in a strange way yeah he is working he is working something is working something sacramental yeah in the hot rod yeah that's right yeah it's really enchanting yes it is yes and I reckon that the coronavirus is is the perfect opportunity to reassess all of the things that we've been pursuing for a long time you know Australia's had almost 30 years of continuous growth and we've become a wealthy nation but I'm not sure we're better off and so I've I've written a paper actually that it talks about you know whether or not continual growth is is a good thing or not and I conclude that it's not and that we shouldn't we should have other measures of progress rather than just growth in gross domestic product for instance because it perverts everything it perverts the value of the world because the only real value that we'll find in life is with each other and then eventually with our accountability to God which is what the whole which is what the golden rule is about and so I'm I'm not sure how to do that but I'm I'm completely convinced that we need to do it and we need to have new language so I've got really no idea where to begin other than to criticise what we've defined as success and so getting back to the the the Garlots observation and to say well okay we've achieved that has it given us what we want is it really satisfying is it really fulfilling does it in any way resemble us being transformed into the image of Christ and the answer is no and so now we need to so I'm not trying to bring the kingdom on necessarily because I I think that that won't happen until the end of this age and in the age to come but I I think we can do much better by valuing people more than things and by seeing real value in something other than money Well well said well said well I think that's um I think that's what I've got and well just before I go I I I see Nikki's name up there um she will want me to ask people to just make a comment as to their interest in in this book which is called Don Garlots the Enigmatic Hero and so we're not quite sure when it will be available we've still got to resolve some issues with regard to who's the publisher and where it's printed and things like that most likely it'll be printed in the USA because that's that's where the the big market is but we we would love to hear from people um but we we would love to hear from people who uh think that that might be significant to them that they might be interested in it or those who think it's all rubbish and we're going to just get back to you know being religious um well well um I will I will post this on Friday and and I think um we'll see well I I don't have any I mean I don't know that my audience necessarily is in alignment so you'll have to you'll have to figure out how to work your network to uh to get it in front of other people and to get those questions out there so we'll see what the YouTube algorithm does and I'll post it on Twitter but we'll uh we'll see what kind of good feedback we can get for you but I I think it I I really I really want this you know I I wish your golden rule book to succeed too because the the central insight of your book I think is absolutely correct that that people continually imagine that that the golden rule is somehow some qualification and you're exactly right that this is how we want other people to treat us but the the fact that this is in fact a a tool of discipleship and sanctification which is is designed to show us who we are and where we need to go I think is you know the heart of your book and and deserves to be read but I also think the um I I like I liked I like this other book too and I I think you're right that Australians and Americans both have a heart for the underdog and a heart for someone who reclaims parts from a junkyard and and retains his character sufficiently so that after he's wealthy and famous he still likes himself so I think I think that's all good anyway Paul it's just a wonderful uh journey and a wonderful adventure and I'm so glad to uh to be part of your audience and I find you to be a constant inspiration and encouragement I just want to say thanks well thank you and and the feeling's mutual um I just mentioned I just told my wife this morning I say I'm talking to war and she's like oh every time you mention his name I think of Australia and such such wonderful memories and that's good yeah so all right well take care and like I said I'll publish this on Friday and if you so those who are watching this if you know someone who might like the subject forward the video and get the questions out there and we'll see what kind of feedback we can get for Warren and Nikki yeah good on you super thanks for you Warren thank you bye bye
