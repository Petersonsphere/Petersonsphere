 Hi, this is Paul and I just wanted to do a real quick book review. A number of you have asked for book lists and I haven't really put one together. I find making a book list difficult But it's a good challenge and maybe I'll take it on one of these days But I did want to give a book review especially because this book was pointed out to me in the comment section And I know a lot of you drop in links and I do try to At least take a look at Everything I try to look at all the comments I know I don't hit all of them, but I do try to look at the comments and I this book was recommended to me in the comment section and What I often do with books if there's an audible version because I'm an audible member I I usually try to get the audible version and the Kindle version It costs a little bit extra money Sometimes Amazon makes that a little a little bit sweeter of a deal but I so then I listen to and skim and then highlight and sometimes reread and I'm an auditory learner, but I just finished a hobbit a wardrobe and a great war and I loved it I loved it if you're a Tolkien fan or a Lewis fan or a history buff about the First World War I'm more of a history buff about the Second World War than the First World War when I was Growing up in the in the 70s. I read I couldn't get enough Stories from the Second World War and do enough history reading about that But I didn't I don't know nearly as much about the First World War and and this book takes Really highlights now. I've just I just recently read again reread two biographies of Lewis that I both of which I've enjoyed the Alan Jacobs biography and the Alistair McGrath biography and I did that because of course, I'm working on my miracles videos But I and so I was a little reluctant to read this because I know a fair amount about Lewis I know less about Tolkien But I I deeply appreciated this book that this book looked at Lewis and Tolkien from the perspective of Both of them being veterans of the First World War both of them were Injured in the First World War and it's interesting to think about the fact that for both of them their wounds saved their lives and and that I think that really speaks through both of them and and I think the author does a terrific job of highlighting how He highlights the social history before the world First World War the ramifications of the war after The First World War there is another book that I read a couple of years ago See if I can pull it up Great and holy war By Philip Jenkins, which was also a book. I enjoyed that book isn't on audible, but the book highlights the religious element of the First World War and And really shows how the war was a holy crusade and this book That I'm that I'm just highlighting now the Hobbit the wardrobe and the Great War Is was written in or at least published in 2015 and so he builds on he clearly has read the McGrath Lewis biography the the Alan Jacobs Lewis biography and also this Jenkins book So it's it's a very contemporary book But I just a beautiful book beautiful book and see the problem I have with writing book lists Is that if if I read a good book I fall in love with it But it's good thing I don't marry books because I keep finding new books and I keep falling in love with them So if if books were women I'd be in trouble But fortunately they're only books so I can fall in love with them safely and and move on to another But you know some of you who are looking for book recommendations. I would very much. I would very much recommend The Hobbit the wardrobe see now I've messed up my work. Where's my okay? you can See you can see why it's hard to give book recommendations because I Like books and these are some of them and these are some of them and yeah There's there's books all over the place, so I would very much recommend a Hobbit a wardrobe and a great war It's a it's definitely a book written from a Christian perspective If that means something to you positive or negative you can figure out what you want to do But for both an insight into Tolkien and Lewis in terms of how their experience in World War one Shaped not only the details of the the Narnia series and the Lord of the Rings but but also the Engagement with myth and that's of course the intersection with my Jordan Peterson conversations that come in here and and why both Tolkien and Lewis were two of the most important authors English authors in the 20th century I believe And and two of the most outstanding Christian authors and And why and why and how after the first World War a lot of authors fell into despair the The myth of progress that had been so dominant was was really destroyed in the first World War to a great degree and and that left a a cloud of despair and cynicism Over over Europe and and just in the last chapter what I just I just actually finished this morning He talked about it. He talked about it quite well Let's see if all my see if all my Well, he talked about how you know how It's a great book. So if you're looking for a book to read I hardly recommend it and I Haven't got taken the time to go through my comments because finding comments is not easy finding past comments so Whoever recommended this to me.
