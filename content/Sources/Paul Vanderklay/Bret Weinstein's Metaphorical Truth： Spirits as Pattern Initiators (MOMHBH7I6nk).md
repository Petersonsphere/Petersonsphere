 Hi, this is Paul. I know I've got a promise to give the Brett and Heather 50th Dark Horse podcast the full commentary treatment, and I still want to do that. I was just listening to it a little bit this morning. It's an hour and 40 minutes, and if I do commentary in an hour and 40 minutes, it'll be almost three hours long, probably, and there are segments of it which I'm less interested in than other segments, so I'm trying to figure out how to cut it up. But as I was thinking about it and working on it, I thought about how I wanted to address the Brett Weinstein's metaphorical truth idea. Adam Friended had, in a number of ways, wanted to engage me in conversation with it, and obviously it's something that we heard about a couple of years ago, and so I've had time to think about it and process it as I've been processing everything else. Actually, I woke up Sunday morning with just a head full of ideas about it and quickly wrote down a bunch of notes. Often when I do that, I have to check those notes later on because how you can have a dream and it's like, oh, I see everything, and then you wake up and you look at what you've written down and it's like, I was insane, or I wasn't thinking straight, or I was high on my own thoughts. When we sleep, we process things. Actually, Brett talks about that in one of his conversations about metaphorical truths. So I wanted to get into that and what it means, what he means by it, what he's trying to build a bridge with it from and to, really between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris, why it's very modernistic, which is part of what's going away about it, and why it's insufficient, which is why it's going away, and how to move beyond it. I thought that was really important because his understanding of metaphorical truth very much shapes his take on what he calls religion. Again, we have religion S and religion W. Religion W is pretty much the communal, symbolic, dramatically liturgical imaginary, this operating system that we use to compete and cooperate and things that human beings use within a culture. It's the culture net. Religion S is sort of the enlightenment idea of religion, that this thing has to do with the supernatural and gods and rituals and praying and all those types of things. Obviously, this is what I've been talking about a lot in my videos lately. If you've been following my channel for a while, you've noticed a pattern. This morning, I also watched Kanye West's interview with Joe Rogan, and then I watched Scott Adams' interview or Scott Adams' take on that interview, and I found that enormously interesting. I haven't done a lot of little clips yet on my clip channel, and a number of people have commented on my clip channel that if I just start doing just clips as they are, the DMCA and YouTube, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada. I've had so much material I've wanted to get out recently. I was sort of thinking that I might do shorter take commentaries on little soundbite things like on the Sam Adams, Scott Adams video on the clip channel. My challenge is always that once I get in front of the mic and start playing a video and start talking, it becomes an hour or too long, so I'm still thinking about what to do with that. That clip channel is called Vander Clips with a K, and I made that channel because there were a bunch of little things that I wanted from my own channel and from other channels to sort of isolate and to play with, and so I might do something on Scott Adams there. I'll try and figure out how to do that because part of the way YouTube works is because this channel has what it has, which is about 15,000 subscribers. A certain number of people will get notified of things, and if I put stuff in the clip channel, which only has about 250 subscribers because there's not a lot there, most of you won't get noticed or won't get notification, so I'm trying to figure out how to work YouTube in this algorithm, and I've been fairly active on Twitter over the last couple of years, and I tend to post things there too, so yeah, so that's sort of what's going on. Now Jordan Peterson begins Maps of Meaning with sort of a fork in the road observation. You can imagine the world as a world of objects, or you can imagine it as a form for action, and Peterson often sees himself within the tradition of the American pragmatists with respect to the form for action, but I think part of why Jordan Peterson has been prescient and helpful moving forward is because some of these insights of the American pragmatists, but also beyond them, come through his form for action, and I think we're probably going to go beyond that a little bit too in this video. So two ways to approach the world, a world of objects. A world of objects, if you think about it, it's very, and when I say objectivistic, objectivism, you know, Ayn Rand comes in, and I'm not at all thinking about that. I've never read a whole book of Ayn Rand's. They're really fat. I know a little bit about her, but just the portrayal of that imagines that we see things as they are, the world is a bunch of, back in my videos, like these little Amazon boxes or discrete facts. It's very static. It's very, it imagines again that a camera can see when a camera can't see anything because just like my eyeballs can't see, if you pluck an eyeball out of my head and run it around and, you know, I can see over the crowd by plucking my eyeball, no, my eyeball is not only attached to my brain and the rest of my body, but as Jordan Peterson, I think, nicely laid out to Sam Harris, whether or not he understood it in Vancouver One, that eyeball is in some ways attached to my ancestors because there's an entire structure behind it that allows my eyeballs to see and I think as Brent Weinstein and David Sloan Williams and I think as the director of the to see and I think as Brent Weinstein and David Sloan Wilson have noted that that eyeball is attached to thousands and thousands and thousands of years of living beings. It's attached to my ancestors and I only see the world as I do because of the genetic material I inherited from my parents, but also the culture net, that other layer that co-mingles and co-generates with everything. That's some of what Jordan Peterson, the key, really, okay, I've been thinking again about doing some more writing and I might start writing some little self-published books on Amazon where I take a bunch of my thoughts. Now because I've been doing this for three years, I think I've, some things are settled enough in my mind that I'm willing to put them on paper rather than just putting them on YouTube because YouTube is, these are my rough drafts, so where was I going with that? So when Jordan Peterson talks about, and with Susan Blackmore, talks about how the genetics and the culture net aren't discrete, that's basically what he says to Susan Blackmore, they're not discrete, that they get into each other. When I first started getting interested in Jordan Peterson, I was thinking a lot about the world that my church members live in, which is a world of science where there's the sun and the moon and the stars and we're on a globe and that whole world versus let's say this world of Genesis 1 where we're sort of on a tabletop and there's waters above and below and there's the heavens and I was thinking about those two worlds, I was again continuing to read C.S. Lewis's Miracles where C.S. Lewis talks about the ascension, how do we understand the ascension when we imagine ourselves living on a globe, and C.S. Lewis thought about these ideas a lot and that really comes through clearly in his book The Discarded Image. So one of the things that I felt, so intuitively, and again my right brain was sort of chewing on this and my left brain, it's taken a while for my left brain to sort of to systematize it and get it down and perhaps that's the way to understand video, my video monologues versus let's say if I finally get to writing something concrete, which I'm nervous about given my experience with John Vervecky and Christopher Mastropietro's book and y'all will see that come out when it comes out, because really when you write something, and Peterson says this often, when you write something it's already digested because putting it to paper and putting it down in paper is concretized in a way that even though my videos are recorded and replayable, it's concretized in a way that the videos don't feel concretized. So this world of objects is this concrete world where we imagine that well there's just all these things and I'm this thing and we're just all these things and that's where you talk about truth and facts and it imagines a very static world in which there's just basically objects and they're not even in time and we see them directly and their identity is knowable and again if you work on, I mean John Vervecky's work has been so helpful, it's not 50 episodes of Awakening from the Meaning Crisis and John sort of has his own language and once you get deep enough into his language you can begin to see the real value of the work, but it's not as accessible and easy as some of Jordan's stuff but I've benefited greatly from John's work. So this world of objects is just kind of static out there, timeless and I am not that thing. I am not static. Last week I had a tooth removed from my mouth and I'm still feeling it and over the course of this week or so I've been thinking about how, what this means, my sister, my one remaining sister who has her own YouTube channel, she does videos about decor, she's an artist and she just last week had, I don't have a problem saying this here because she says it on her channel all the time, if you think I'm high in openness, I'm not anywhere near as high in openness as my sister, but she's an artist and a photographer and a musician and she suffers from what Jordan Peterson describes, people who are high in office openness have difficulty monetizing there. That's my sister. So she's got her own YouTube channel but she, there's a growth on her pituitary and so last week she had surgery and they go up through the nose and they go in through the skull there and they took off this growth around her pituitary and she's recovering. How did I, how did I get here? Okay. I am not the same object I was two weeks ago. My sister is not the same object she was two weeks ago. We live in a very dynamic place and when we talk about objects, get back to the Verveckian stuff, we use labels for objects and those labels, if they're going to be helpful and durable, those labels relate to the essence of something and as Vervecki nicely laid out, the essence of something is not something in and of itself but that thing in relation to other things. So label me father to my children, label me husband to my wife, label me pastor to my church, label me citizen in the United States in the political realm. So you have this agent arena relationship that Vervecki nicely lays out and so this world of objects is very low resolution, it's very static and it breaks down but all of this other language about truth and facts and the way that we use the language now is baked into that world and that's part of why this is sort of going away and so when Jordan Peterson comes up with a form for action, it doesn't mean that there aren't objects but in a sense they sort of recede and they become more dynamic and what's different between a world of objects and a form for action is very much time and agency and a conscious actor and so as we've talked about, again I was just this morning at my little drive to, I went to the bank between here and work, in my little drive to the bank, I was listening to Will Durant on Rousseau and listening to some of his treatment of Emile, one of Rousseau's books and thinking again about how so much of our contemporary world is a product of the 18th century philosophes and these ideas, you know the Protestant Reformation was a big pivot but the Enlightenment was a huge pivot to this world but so many of those ideas of the philosophes are now in decline and part, and I think again Dr. Jim from Idaho, part of what he recognized is that part of the reason Sam Harris, Brett Weinstein, Jordan Peterson arose when they did, James Lindsay, Peter Boghossian, all these individuals is because their world is disappearing and sort of like the 19th, late 19th, early 20th century conservative Christians arose to fight the modernists, well these individuals are arising to challenge the postmodernists and again those are the labels we use but you know there's a fair amount of postmodernity in all of these individuals and I know that always really bothers some of you in the comment section but I think it's true and the American pragmatists I think in that way really moved the ball forward in the 19th and early 20th century and I think Peterson gets that right and you notice the long delay with these things, these things move very slowly, we as a group deal with these very big questions very slowly and it takes a good amount of time and so Peterson really benefits from the American pragmatists and says hey that this is moving us forward and so when you look at the critique of let's say Thomas Nagel, the problem that we have is we have to reintegrate time better, the enlightenment sort of some of these enlightenment ideas sort of excluded time and again that's a real powerful thing to do because you're eliminating variables and you're trying to, if you've got an agent arena relationship even let's say oxygen, oxygen means different things based on the agent arena relationship, oxygen against copper or iron brings rust, oxygen in the context of scuba diving means life and so you know what is the essence of oxygen? Well the essence of oxygen in some ways is dependent on the arena and so you have this agent arena relationship and so what science does and why it's so powerful is it gets very granular down into these distinct processes and says well okay electricity plus water makes hydrogen and oxygen, that's really cool. Now when is that relevant? Well it could be relevant if you're trying to produce hydrogen cars to put less co2 into the atmosphere. There's a lot of things that are relevant to it but and this is where again a form for action really really moves us forward. Now Brett Weinstein did a podcast with Sam Harris and I thought it was well worth listening to but also extremely frustrating listening to and I begin to notice a pattern Jordan Peterson tries to have a productive conversation with Sam Harris and it gets frustrating and Brett Weinstein tries to have a productive conversation with Sam Harris and it gets frustrating and a lot of this has to do with I think the inconsistencies at the heart of Sam's position. They keep getting stuck because Sam basically holds these two ideas as such and when he talks he keeps flipping between them okay so I've in the past I've talked about the manifest image and the scientific image. Sam doesn't seem to understand that there's a nose between his eyes and he never sees out of both eyes and in many ways Brett in that podcast pleads with him to see out of both eyes and to try and put these two visions together and Sam just keeps saying no I already have we don't have to do this well if you have you certainly aren't explaining it to us. They keep getting stuck because on one hand we have this deterministic scientific view scientific image of the world that we are not agents we have no freedom everything is determined and JP Marceau just sent a tweet this morning he wrote a really good article on on reading CS Lewis's miracles and integrating it with some of Vervecky's ideas. I thought it was really excellent there's a video that goes along with it and I'll probably forget to put it in the notes for this show but if I do forget leave a comment and hopefully if I don't see it someone else will see it but that's that's that was a well worth video I didn't see the video I read the article which is again part of the reason that I'm thinking I really have to figure out a way to do more writing. Anyway part of the reason Brett and Sam kept getting stuck was you have these two visions one is that we're not agents we have no freedom everything is determined and very much looks like CS Lewis's miracles the whole show and on the other hand when we watch the movie you can have feelings of purpose and illusion of meaning and agency and and and and and even if we don't really have it and for most people that's simply not satisfying and it always gets buffered by the usual well he he writes about meditation and he has a meditation app oh okay but it's it's really the difference between let's say you have a son and he pays spends all of his time on computer games and he says I'm perfectly happy and I intend to be in this chair and play computer games until my biological functions cease and maybe you know we're talking at our meetup last night maybe a universal basic income is cheaper to is the cheapest way to deal with unproductive people and so we're just going to make sure that they all have virtual reality and computer games and a good internet connection and and they can all live in basements and spend all of their day days playing computer games and who cares if their lifespan is only 30 or 40 years because biologically it's not a very healthy way to live and who cares if they don't actually produce anything or or get anything done as long as they're happy they're watching the movie they're playing the computer game they're acting as if they are agents in a world when they're really and and we look at that we say that's not how a human being should be well maybe that's an illusion this this moral image of going down in the basement and seeing our children now again a lot of we don't have basements in california um going into our child our children's bedroom and watching them play computer games all the time and saying I want better for you no there is no better for me I'm just watching and so we keep getting stuck here and so this really is where um we get going with the metaphorical truth business and there are a number of videos out there a number of times when when Brett gets into this uh one of the and so I'm going to play a few of them one of them was on this is a little clip from Joe Rogan experience um with Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein on the nature of truth that so we're treading kind of close to the the argument you got into with Sam Harris about the nature of truth and and since I heard that I've been sort of itching to have this conversation with you because I think there's a a way of viewing this that will actually um perhaps reconcile the two points of view but there's a bitter pill that comes along with it so here's here's my argument um we tend to think of intellect has evolved as having evolved because knowing what's true gives you an advantage but there's actually nothing that says okay knowing what's true what do you mean by that is there a lion in the bush objects knowing what's true again almost always when we hear about these truth conversations it's almost always correspondence between a mental map and a world of objects all right pay attention to that as we go through this conversation as the literal truth is where advantage lies and so okay literal truth that there's a there's a lion in the bush that if I could you know we see this in movies if I could stop time see but now pay attention I'm not really stopping time it's like I'm stopping time out there in the world I'm freezing it and then I'm walking over and there's the lion and I can touch it and well if I stop time it's not really breathing but maybe it's still warm and I feel it's fur and it's a certain it's and now what's the relevant aspect of lioness with respect to that picture it's that the lion can eat me okay and of course celebrity atheists for a long time have talked about hyperactive agency detectors where we're always anxious about the lion and that has a an evolutionary as an evolutionary adaptation it keeps us alive but what that means is that that we're we're worried ancient people were worried that there are these other agents out there in the world that are moving the world and and that's what sort of creates the world around us I have a category that I call literally false metaphorically true these are ideas that aren't true in the factual sense but they are true enough that if you behave as if they were true you come out ahead of where you would be if you behaved according to the fact that they're not true so let me give okay now pay attention to these are ideas are they really ideas because as we dig into this a lot of these are not so much ideas now again think about verveckis four types of knowledge the four p's propositional there's a lion in the bush lion is a proposition there is a lion in that bush okay perspectival that's my perspective about the line well I'm here and the lion's there so it's very much spatial participatory well I can get my gun and shoot the lion procedural well I'm gonna I'm a stupid American on safari in Africa and I don't know anything about lions but the Africans that are with me have for thousands of years lived in a context with lions and very much will say okay do this do this do this do this those are all forms of knowledge and those forms of knowledge are not facts they're knowledge and and and so often when we get into this conversation we're just talking about the propositional and this is so deeply ironic because it's all the propositional stuff that people complain about with respect to church I just can't handle the dogma oh okay but I like the music and oh you like the procedural the participatory you like those things but you don't like the the propositional and see and that's just it it's a conflict between the propositional's and when you get to the celebrity atheist or someone who what is an atheist and again the distributist just did a really nice video on this what is an atheist when an atheist is someone who says propositionally there is no super thing and so procedurally participa- um perspectively participatorially I don't have to relate to this super thing because it isn't there but there's a lion in the bush and so this is where now it's in this phase that we get into the metaphorical truth because Brett is trying to really adjust for at least perspectival and participatory and he's using this metaphorical truth idea but part of the reason I think he's getting into this is and we're gonna it's very the choice the choice of the word metaphorical in this is very telling okay we'll keep going give you a couple of trivial examples that won't be controversial now there's a little book that I ordered because I ran across a quote this talks about um it's an anthropological book and and it talks about common sense as a cultural system porcupines can throw their quills not true porcupines well what I mean they threw they can throw their quills not true they can throw their quills not true they can throw their quills not true porcupines well what I mean they threw they can throw their quills they can launch them no you got to touch them they'll get little barbs on them you know if you watch alone you know they've been eating porcupines it's one of the few animals that they can eat up there in this in this arctic region that they drop these strangest game show participants into and so untrue how about try something like this a stitch in time saves nine is that true it's not talking about a world of objects well there are objects involved it's procedural is a stitch in time saves nine always true no in what world is a stitch in time saves nine active well how many different objects well certain objects like clothing you know that's where the metaphor is coming from a stitch in time saves nine stitches because if you don't address a little tear it can become a big tear sometimes it's not true sometimes it is true it's it's it's there living in a world of objects it's also living in time and you would very much say that a stitch in time saves nine is much more of a form for action and even this a porcupine can throw its quills that's much more living in a form for action than a world of objects because okay you see right there the difference between those worlds this metaphorical truth it's trying to break out of this world of objects it's trying to break out of it but it's really hesitant it's a little bit scared and we're going to use the truth word because we kind of want to we know that we're going to have truth has to do more freight than just propositional truth of 1p it's got to do more freight because there's proceeds procedural truth participatory truth but suddenly we're getting to the question of what is truth and again jordan peterson very famously said things like well the your aim is true well what does that mean well it kind of has correspondence or how about your spouse is true now if you haven't listened to my my conversation with uh joe where i think i named it deconstruction and a bunch of other things i don't remember what i named it we get into that because okay what does it mean to be a true son this is their biological connection okay but but there's a much bigger world in which there's loyalty to the father there's obedience of the father and you might say well well he might not have been his biological son see the relevance realization the age and arena relationship between that even the word son has he might not have been his biological son but he was his true son and what you're doing is you're looking at an essence of the father and finding that in the sun and you are looking for correspondence but it's not in a world of objects there are objects in the world but that's not where it is and you imagine that porcupines can throw their quills you'll give them some space if you don't you may realize and that they can't throw their quills get really close to one and it may wheel around and nail you with a porcupine quill which can be extremely dangerous because okay now we're talking about wisdom and actually a little bit later in this clip which i'm not going to go that far joe rogan is going to talk about wisdom well how do wisdom and knowledge relate well knowledge is a little bit more staticky and wisdom is a little bit more over time and so knowledge might say a porcupine doesn't throw its quills wisdom says yeah but they can move quick and they can be erratic and you're not always so good on your feet and you know something might happen and the consequence that the payoff of getting so close to the porcupine which is why you want to get close might not outweigh the liability if you get a quill stuck in your hand and all of the trauma and possibility of infection and all of that kind of stuff you're going to have to deal with and so wisdom comes into the picture here as they are microscopically designed to move in from where they puncture you over time and they can puncture a vital organ or you can get an infection so the person who believes that a porcupine can throw their quills has an advantage that isn't predicated on the fact that this is actually a literal truth right okay what does he mean by literal there see it's not entirely easy to say well in this physical world of objects there's these little knowledge chunks true or false porcupines can throw what is throw they take their little paw and they go no well they they fling or they see metaphor is built into this thing all the way through and we're just so good at dealing with it we don't even pay attention to it and so literally true so met so question and answer porcupine can throw its quills false okay that's what you mean by literal it's sort of what he means by literal another one might be people say everything happens for a reason right well unless you're talking about physics as the reason everything doesn't happen for a reason however okay right there presupposition assumption can brett know whether or not everything happens for a reason what do we mean by a reason we kind of what we think is that well now we're suddenly in a religious realm where there's a there's consciousness somewhere in relation to us it's an agent arena relationship okay everything happens for a reason that's an agent arena relationship he says no it doesn't how do you know how can you know is that non you know is that not is that falsifiable can you verify it it doesn't mean it's a good reason it doesn't mean it's a knowable reason the fact is our knowledge is about this big and so now when people make claims such as well everything happens for a reason so katrina hit new orleans because of the immoral behavior of people who lived in new orleans is that the reason for the hurricane is that the reason for the hurricane or was it were there atmospheric reasons or i mean so very quickly we're getting into well what causes this and she says well unless there's physics okay but in many ways we're back into aristotle here because there are multiple causes well which cause was this and you know but again his assertion he just slid it right in there there isn't well how do you know that's an assertion it's not a fact it's nothing that you can actually have a you stated as a proposition what it is is a belief of yours but you just slide it right in there and you know nobody pays any attention to it because you know pay attention over here about the quills and everything happens for a reason and all the other things our brain is paying attention we just slide it right in there okay but it's not true it's just an assertion however if you are the kind of person who believes that everything happens for a reason and then some terrible tragedy befalls you you may be on the lookout well what's the reason that this happened maybe it's supposed to open some opportunity and you won't miss that opportunity the way somebody who was preoccupied with their misfortune would so literal falseness okay so now he says well maybe believing that everything happens for a reason is a um is is an advantage is adaptive to us maybe we'll do better if we believe that maybe people who believe that outperform what do we mean by perform they outlive people who just say everything is random and you go into your doctor your doctor says um you know well you have lung cancer well everything happens for a reason and the doctor says yeah you smoke three packs a day for your whole life that's why you have lung cancer oh no the reason i was thinking is that okay how many reasons are there for this person's lung cancer their genetics that they've smoked three packs a day that you know other people out there smoking their age there are multiple reasons and the reasons don't all act equally and the reasons also don't all work in the same level of knowledge are there propositional reasons are there perspectival reasons are there participants participatory reasons are there procedural reasons it's an agent arena relationship what's the essence of the situation now so that's why he's going to say well there's metaphorical truth well he's saying things don't happen for a reason well that seems totally wrong i would say that things happen for lots of reasons the question that we're asking is much more of a relevance realization question which reason is key you know it's sort of like we're having this grand experiment in coven deaths well cove it doesn't really kill people okay but we've got a bump in number of people and i'm just raising this issue we'll get the comments so go ahead have at it it's fine but a certain number of more people on average are dying you want to know what causes death old age you know and it's and it's not the reason that a lot of people pay attention to they died of you know we say natural causes it they died of old age their body wore out and and you might say and and you might say well that's you know bias you know people of age are dying at way higher rates than young people of cove it and therefore that's systemic that's systemic injustice because people don't choose their age they receive their age and so you know we should move heaven and earth so that people don't die of old age okay which reason and metaphorical truth well he's trying to patch something here because he says well this is truth truth is you can produce hydrogen and oxygen out of water with electrolysis that's truth but you have lung cancer that's a much more complex truth now a long and a short of it in terms of relevance realization is don't start smoking when you're 16 so that you're still not smoking when you're 55 so that you have lung cancer well that's a reason or maybe another reason is um don't be born to oh no can't do that because you don't choose your parents you know on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and what we're doing with these conversations we're trying to whittle them down to certain things and so okay don't get cove it because if you get cove it and you smoke and you're old and you're overweight well which reason is it there's lots of them but metaphorical truth is actually i would argue the category under which religious truth evolves okay the category under which religious truth evolves okay what do you mean by religion here i would assert he means religion s okay not religion w worldview religion s that and and so he's got this categorical truth okay or this metaphorical truth all right and again he's trying to patch something here because and when we play a clip with him and peterson you know again he's sort of in the middle there and we'll hear his both the value and objection to this metaphorical truth now the problem the bitter pill that i mentioned is that i've heard you say that the truths that are captured in the the religious version of things are basically okay religious okay religion s all of this bible stuff all of these old writings now what's interesting is are plato's writings religious depends what your religion is right if you're a neo-platinist yeah they're really religious are aristotle's writings religious are russo's writings religious are voltaire's writings religious are newton's writings religious are darwin's writings religious okay now we've got this relevance realization issue with respect to religion and as we'll see i mean what what he's responding to in terms of peterson's work is peterson has said that over long periods of time human beings have been writing stuff down about how they see the world and there are valuable things encoded in those writings that should be taken into account in terms of how we see the world today because actually they are they do not have a religious they are they deeply shape how we see the world today and it has value and so in many ways what jordan and brett are trying to do and sam too when the three of them together are trying to say okay how can we assess this value okay value when where why and so it'll be in the details but now sticking in the middle of this and again this is relevance for and again it's so left over again if you read voltaire if you read russo if you read what's going on in the 18th century in france all throughout europe really if you read the philosophies read all them it's the same conversation they're having they're just saying okay well now we've got this new class of ideas that we are category categorizing as religious religious okay and what are we going to do with them like the religious version of things are basically like you know there's an individual truth and then there's a truth of your family and there's a truth of the population that you're living in and these things are all encoded in these these doctrines which is true and you would expect it to be because the doctrines are carried along in the population the problem is what i hear you and it's really interesting if you go back and these are true okay how are they true is this are they propositional true see right there already it's it's really hard to not let all of this language stuff just bleed all over the place they're true that's that's absolutely valid use of the word true are they literally true oh wow now we have the word literally well what do you mean well which one man plus woman and intercourse equal baby is that literally true what do you mean by that well well there's a biological layer that that's happening at there's a societal layer that that's happening again there's what layer the world is too big for us to really process easily are these doctrines which is true and you would expect it to be because the doctrines are carried along in the population the problem is what i hear you arguing and you tell me if i have it wrong is that we should therefore expect the encoded metaphorical truths in these religious traditions to be okay why did he slide in metaphorical truth there well because these religious traditions they're they're relating to this this character yaway or marduk or um they're relating to dead people ancestors they're relating to oh well that's not literally true okay what do you mean it's not literally true well there's no there are no super things that you can relate to okay do you know that you're asserting that you don't know you don't know and and when you're asking okay well what what kind of thing is this god of the hebraeus well what kind of thing is that god of the hebraeus what do they say kind of thing that god well it's it's something that you can you can relate to and and it will impact what goes on in your life well that seems to be the most obvious thing it's certainly impacting what goes no no no i mean like miracles will happen and stuff oh okay well what are those so i mean it's and what we're trying to do is shorthand this but again this is so totally a conversation of the 18th century morally metaphor is that we should therefore expect the encoded metaphorical truths in these religious traditions to be morally right okay what do you mean by moral okay the world is too big for us to process so we have all these little tricks and hacks and shorthands well morality well what is morality well it's usually whole groups of people watching each other and saying we're going to celebrate that and we're going to punish that and so we're going to celebrate that and punish that so there's morality okay these are morally right so what are you saying what's saying well these documents have they have a lot of moral assertions in them some of which we continue to buy have been preaching a sermon series on the 10 commandments and especially as the protestant reformer said the second table of the law it's not terribly controversial honor your father and mother or should you do you have a responsibility to take care of aged parents well yeah kind of and if you if you ignore and neglect your parents and they're you know they're out there begging on the street and your neighbors come by say hey isn't that your dad dad there at the corner panhandling at the light yeah didn't you you know don't you live in that beautiful home and drive those nice cars and make all that money yeah shouldn't you take your father in and care for him it's not terribly controversial you shall not murder well that's about one of the most universal ones you shall not steal you shall not commit adultery you shall not lie in court against your neighbor you shall not covet your neighbor's wife you shall not covet your neighbor's house like well that's not so bad well how far are you going to take the coveting are you gonna are you gonna are you gonna let that ruin your own marriage because you know every day your wife sees you oogling at the neighbor's wife and you know or every day your husband sees you hears you pining for your neighbor's house why can't you give me a house like that it's not bad advice but morally and and so what brett is saying well you cannot you cannot take moral assertions from there well where are you getting your moral assertions from is is there a is there a new book or are those books actually in a long history of conversations with each other where we're tinkering with these things for example in the ten commandments you're not allowed to covet your neighbor's manservant or maidservant so what does that mean your neighbor's slaves are you allowed to covet your neighbor's slaves well my neighbor doesn't have any slaves well why not because these things have been in a long history all the way through but brett is saying well you can't take morality from it really which morality well it's a no you can take some morality from it okay well how do we know which morality to take from it to say this is good and this is bad no we don't think a lot about that do we because again christian smith sociologist massive study of american youth in the 90s how do you know right and wrong i get it from my parents how do you know it is right and wrong i just know that's american culture is brett weinstein american yes is he american culture yes uh he's about my age so grew up more in the 80s did we kind of think that way in the 80s yes so but now oh there's this religion in the bible and well now he's gonna have a reason why don't take it at face value but again i keep arguing that and and actually gets pointed out in the conversations with sam harris the bible i i assert that there's a critique of slavery in the bible there's a critique of a lot of things in the book of genesis is a critique of pre-magenator of double of giving the oldest a double inheritance at the expense of the other children but we don't do that today i'm going to split my estate up equally amongst my children unless someone pisses me off and then i'm giving it all when i'm going to spite them all not that there'll be any grand estate from paul vanderclay left for the children um i had five of them so uh not expecting much from my mom um it's mom just have enough to live the way you want to in your retirement years okay by me but where do we get our ideas about right and wrong this is right and this is wrong well you don't find christians continuing to own slaves in north america today you can find other slave holding societies in the world and then you can twiddle with the definition of slavery so this this this idea this argument isn't really very good but let's let's hear it out because it's coming to an important point but there's nothing that actually says it will be morally right moral did metaphorical truths in these religious traditions to be morally right but there's nothing that actually says it will be morally right because actually says it will be morally right well tell me how you figure out if something is morally right or not isn't that the entire conversation that peterson is trying to have with respect to all of this well morally right and brett's doing a lot of podcasts on it now morally right is that which perpetuates his idea of what humanity of how human beings should live and their little time in the world and they'd be more happy than sad and sometimes every now and then on twitter i'll someone will come out with something and i'll ask him i said well well the maximum amount of happiness for most people okay well how about so happy is okay put them in give them lots of video games and cheetos and porn and um you know maybe they're deliriously happy for 30 years and you know they won't live very long but you know really what's the difference between living 30 years and living 80 years or living 100 years and then of course jordan peterson says yeah with respect to time just give them cocaine bang maximum happiness done put them on drugs you know peterson's digging at deeper issues and oh well morally well all these assumptions about morality and there's nothing that says it's right is there a book out there that you're comparing the bible to or do you have a fair amount of ideas of various magnitude and certainty that you are comparing the bible to ideas from today compared to what you can read in that bible then even though you look around at say a christian like myself and you know in probably 99.9 if we were to sit down for if you asked brett weinstein and i to sit down for two hours and write down as many moral beliefs as we could think of you know we might have 85 87 88 agreement on the list that we write down or if you were to ask us yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep high amount of agreeability i say there is a god he says there is no god all right well does that really make any difference if so how well you should go to church on sunday that's moral to do i would say and he'd say no that's so okay there's there's one that we don't agree on um you should not you should not want your neighbor's wife to the degree that it makes your wife want to stick a knife in your chest when you're dead yep yep yep he loves his wife i love my wife i love watching him with his wife on the show they're just a delightful couple to watch and so i don't think he i think he actually i think he actually like a christian who says you shall not covet your neighbor's wife he mentally i'm sure that there's been plenty of other women that he's met in his life that were attractive and he could have pursued conversations experiences trips events yada yada yada that would have put him on a path towards pursuing a romantic relationship with them instead of his wife and he has some place that no i'm not going to do that well why not i'm not going to covet that other person i'm going to stay true to my wife yep and we say good brett that's moral where's the book you read that in well it came to me through my parents yeah it came to you through your parents your parents are reading the same book now if you've watched podcast 50 you know where some of this is going because there are metaphorical truths that might in fact be reprehensible but nonetheless effective oh metaphorical truths that are reprehensible but nevertheless effective and see it's really cool because he's been watching jordan and now he puts an eye over to joe rogan and this is my big point this is the gotcha that there are metaphorical truths that are effective for what but nevertheless reprehensible with whom effective for what because well like i don't know fire bombing dresden effective reprehensible well this is always where we have our most interesting moral conversations isn't it should we have fire bombed dresden effective reprehensible but what's really interesting is that when you listen to these conversations especially with sam harris sam keeps wanting to argue well-being is somehow well-being is is most of the time somehow self-evident oh and well i should really buy a copy of um dominion so i can hold it up because this whole morality thing isn't this all about effective but then also sometimes reprehensible and what happens when there's there's conflict over that and that might but there's nothing that actually says it will be morally right because as if there's this book of morality that said oh it's the bible oh it's not the bible because there are metaphorical truths that might in fact be reprehensible but nonetheless effective and so what i would argue the overarching point here would be that you're right that the documents that contain these descriptions of things are full of things that are true in some sense that is not ah we've got senses of truth we're making progress literal scientific truth nor was scientific truth who we're making we've got more adjectives we're making more progress that they're their purpose their purpose oh truths can have purposes attached to them we're making a lot of progress here what isn't true is that which way did you use the word there those things their purpose what isn't true is that those things are inherently up to date um well yeah that's why your neighbors who are christians that's why paul vanderkley doesn't own any slaves so what's the value of that book well you can't just read the book as such i don't know any christians who do now some of the christians are a little naive about that but there's lots of naivete around the world um and see i would okay i mean first of all the first thing about that is that a discussion like that and this is also what happened with sam harris takes me to the very limits of my intellectual ability and so even in discussing it i'm going to make all sorts of mistakes because as will we because because it's treacherous territory but i would say my understanding of the great myths has that observation built into it and he's right because well why would i say that way back when i was a young pup in seminary i don't remember what was it for an assignment or something i started a close reading of i started a close reading of the laws and exodus and the laws and deuteronomy and you know what they changed and they're right there in the bible well why would they change well that's the kind of stuff scholars debate but peterson is right this is built into the systems so one of the archetypes is that of the of the tyrannical father okay archetypes what are archetypes well they're these little dramas that's why and sometimes in in the voice chat in the discord they discuss symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary i'm getting imaginary from charles taylor okay imaginary is kind of this this this non-physical world that is so determinative over what we're doing out there in the world it's symbolic i get that from jonathan peugeot because the symbolic world that jonathan peugeot lives in is not just static two-dimensional symbols or even static three-dimensional statuary symbols or reliefs it's behaviors and actions and that's why i add dramatic symbolic dramatic well what's the drama well these archetypes it's the it's the demanding father or the overbearing mother or you know the hero archetype or all of these things they're all acted out they're forms for actions they're going on but they go on repeatedly liturgical why do i add liturgical because very quickly not they're not only things that we do they're things that we do with intentionality and and we're pursuing a better world or we're pursuing a preferred world or pursuing something else and again this is in the imaginary so symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary and we're pursuing all of these things and these are happening which is the archetype by the way that possesses the minds of people who accuse western society of being patriarchal they're possessed by a singular archetype and okay what do you mean by possessed it means that well these ideas they're code and we start running them and we don't realize we're running them and again when i talked in my previous videos about the fact that we all inherit a first draft okay so we inherit a first draft of what it means to be in a married couple from our parent when we're very young we're not married we're watching them we inherit a first draft about how to be a parent when we're very young by watching our parents parent us we inherit first drafts of all sorts of things and we don't even recognize we're inheriting them we don't even recognize where we're taking them in we're being programmed we're being coded we're mimetic in that way we're inheriting all of these first drafts and these aren't so now when i say first drafts you're thinking about a college paper that you worked on what you wrote a first draft and then you wrote a better draft but our first drafts are symbolic dramatic liturgical and they're there in the imaginary because your parents first draft was you know they all read benjamin's spock or they all all of their parents had ideas that they did together and they were doing it communally and there were religious institutions there were educational institutions and there were cultural layers and there was all this stuff coming through them and all of this stuff gets built into these archetypes or what i mean by archetype these are these are sort of set patterns that happen again and again and part of jordan peterson's point is that this stuff is very deep in us and and we don't know it it's the programs that are running in us just like these first drafts we inherited from our parents and i i've used this illustration before and it's kind of a joke between my wife and myself actually this morning i was uh my wife got up early because she just woke up early and then i got up and we're sitting out on the living room sofa and she's reading news and email and text in anticipation of her day and i'm sitting and i'm working on the the powerpoint for this video and then i hear get up into the kitchen i hear some pans moving around she's going to make an egg i said can you make me one she said yeah then i sidled up behind her and i said women making eggs is so sexy and that's a big joke between us because the first morning we were married um my mother always got up in the morning and made eggs and fed eggs made breakfast to the family my wife didn't grow up in a household where that happened and so i was like where are the eggs and and i had never this is the first morning we were married i didn't live with my wife i didn't live together with her before we were married so i i didn't even know i had that first draft but there was in my head boom first married morning get up and why aren't you making eggs honey you patriarch um my wife looked at me like make your own damn eggs i'm not making the eggs i don't even eat breakfast well 32 years every now and then my wife wants to eat breakfast and so i had it honey can you make me an egg sure often i make the eggs for her and i would put them in a bag and then i stopped making it she's like you're not making eggs for me anymore yeah get used to it so you know this is the stuff that happens but we got all these first drafts there and here they are and they they get into these archetypes and they're far broader and again Jung and Peterson following them say that these are these are in fact nearly universal for human beings so where do they come from and this gets back to to what i first got interested in Peterson because i wanted to know how do we make the switch between the scientific and the manifest image how do we make the bridge and Peterson's got these ideas about these bridges he's getting some of them from Jung he's getting some of them from others that's the archetype of the tyrannical father they don't see that there's a tyrannical father and a wise king because there is that's that's you can't even point that out but anyways in the in the old in some of our oldest stories there's a representation of the dead past so let me give you an example that everyone knows about the story of Pinocchio is the story of the individualization of Pinocchio okay so and he explained this to Susan Blackmore as well there's not only what we're acting we start to represent it and well that's how it gets up into the imaginary partly and that's how it gets communicated because we're all watching these and let's say you know i'm a little kid and i've watched my parents relate to one another so there's the first draft of what a marriage is and i've watched my parents parent me so there's my first draft of what parenting is and then i go over to a friend's house and i watch their parents relate and then suddenly i decide do i like the way my parents relate or the way their parents relate or i watch how my friends parents are parenting them and then i decide do i like how my parents parent me or do i like how my friends parent parent them and now again these are not global they're just probably one little instance so in my house we didn't watch tv on sundays until after the evening service but i went over to sometimes after church we have other friends who were in our church with us we'd go over to our friend's house for sunday afternoon they watched tv after the morning service they had world's strongest man on abc and i thought that was wild and they even had a color tv we only had a black and white tv and and and it was like well maybe i'd like going to like well maybe i'd like growing up in a household and they got the sunday paper my parents didn't get the sunday paper my parents were pretty sabbatarian and it's like well i kind of like this other household because but in the other household my mother had often put in a roast and potatoes and so when we'd get home from church you'd walk into the house there are these two locked doors you had to go through because the house was always getting broken into because the bad neighborhood we lived in but so we'd come into one we'd get through one locked door then after wait until someone would unlock the next door to get into the house we'd go into the next door but in that little hallway that roast in the oven that my mother put in oh that roast would smell so good and then we'd get home from church and get out of our church it's our sunday clothes and get into laying around clothes and then mom would set the table and the roast would come out that roast just filled the house and so so my other my friend's house they they ate sort of like cold cuts and taylor's ham on sunday they didn't have a big sunday noon meal but they got to watch tv my house we had that beautiful roast and that but then we didn't have tv for the rest of the afternoon until after the evening service and then we had disney's um the you know the magical world of disney so we could watch tv then but only in black and white because we only had a black and white tv like parents didn't have much money so you know just all this stuff it all gets boiled in and we all have these ideas and so we have these representations and even the little stories i just told for for some of you you know got you into a bunch of different different ideas about it and so these and these archetypes are very big and they're very large and they're very enduring and they go through time he starts out as a puppet he's a marionette he's a wooden head he's a liar and he's pulled by forces that he does not understand right and what's so powerful about these stories is that they're they pack so much into them right okay so but he has a good father that's geppetto and so he's got a good and geppetto wishes that he becomes a real individual and so and he knows that that's an impossible wish he wishes on a star that his son could become an actual individual knowing full well that that's unlikely and impossible so geppetto is a good king so but the story is also about geppetto because what happens is that when geppetto loses pinocchio loses his son which what you could think about as the active dynamic attentive force of youth then he ends up stultified in the belly of a whale which is a symbol of chaos at the bottom of the ocean and then pinocchio has to rescue him so i would say there is an instantiation of evolutionarily accumulated wisdom in the great stories of the past but they're still dead and it requires the union this is why in christian theology the the godhead has a tripartite structure this now what he just said there now he's gonna say some other things that christian theologians would bicker with him over but what he said there is that that's in the past and it's got to be living today and as peterson says right well you think that you search the scriptures because you find life in them now what is jesus saying when he says that he's saying well it isn't just the scriptures you have to and jesus has all kinds of parables about this isn't just you can't just read them and know them sort of propositionally you have to act them out perspectively procedurally particip participatorially you have to act them out and and that's where the wisdom gets translated because brett fair enough the context keeps changing now can we call that truth so again here watch the language pay attention to the objects time and action and reprehensible is reprehensible a category of objects remember in the talks with sam harris where they kept talking about elvis's guitar where is the relationship why is elvis's guitar worth so much more money than any other guitar or you know jimmy hendrix guitar or you know someone famous is our elton john's glass why why in what realm is that is that in the glass yes no it's it's in this far bigger world it's in in many ways a metaphorical world so now let's get into this video sam harris lays out metaphorical truth quite nicely and notice where it goes i think we should touch this issue of of metaphorical truth because i think it still gets at the distance between us sure and it's and it's and happily this is your phrase that you have i mean you might want to do you want to prop up this phrase why not so the idea of metaphorical truth which i think actually is the reconciliation between at least the points that you guys each started out with is the idea that there are concepts which are literally false that we can falsify in a scientific rational sense but that if you behave as if they were true you come out ahead of where you now again look at all the little disclaimers in a in a rational sense um he's trying to fit this all into a world view sort of like me trying to fit into a suit that my mom bought me when i was 10 were that really started out with is the idea that there are concepts which are literally false that we can falsify in a scientific rational sense but that if you behave as if they were true you come out ahead of where you were if you behave according to the fact that they are false and and again come out ahead like morally i mean where is morality in this is is morality again this is this is is morality a thing that helps you achieve helps you as a community you as a group achieve that which you want to achieve or is it connected to a destination that is attached to a purpose i mean morality is deeply problematic in this world of objects because there's just no there's just no bandwidth for it there's no frame for it but we we can't get away from it because communally we need to act this way and so you know this is why things just keep going back to morality well you can't ground your morality well what do you mean well i i it's well-being well is is well-being where you want to ground things i mean it wasn't to the well-being of the cowl for the um for the roast that my mother made or was it so to call these things simply false is an error in effect the universe has left them true in some sense other than a purely literal one and so religions would then according to actually what you heard from both sam and jordan religions would fall into this class of things these are encapsulations of uh stories and again he's wearing he's wearing a suit designed for a 10 year old here if you if you have if you add the four p's now suddenly you can have room for this stuff because what you're getting constrained by is all of this object correspondence issues and and there isn't any room for that most of the kind of things you're talking about are are perspectival participatory procedural not propositional is and prescriptions that if you follow them irrespective of whether they literally describe the universe you end up with certain advantages that you may not know why they are there but nonetheless you you are ahead of your your your head of your position if you were to navigate just simply on your your perceptions so that's the concept yeah so i think there's a good analogy that you and i stumbled onto after we did a podcast together you had a an analogy about now watch he's going to use the gun analogy now pay attention to how much of this is um participatory and especially procedural now now you've got bullets and guns to think about and people that you don't want to have have shotguns go shot bullets go through so there are some objects here but that this example is so deeply procedural it just screams out but they don't have the category for it a porcupine that could shoot its quills which many people balked at but a listener gave us a better one which was the idea that anyone who's worked with guns at all must have heard this admonishment to treat every gun as if it is loaded right and you actually when i last night when i alleged that you believed in god you corrected me he said no you live as if god exists right it's procedural it's perspectival it's participatory okay and sam's all all hung up on the propositional is there the super thing up there that that i can participatorily and procedurally and perspectively relate to in order to get certain outcomes that's what sam is all hung up on as is brett but jordan's not as hung up on that right and so this seems like a there's a connection here so if you're if you know if i had a gun here that i wanted to show brett if i know anything about guns i'm going to make damn sure that it's unloaded right i'm going to pull back the slide i'm going to drop the magazine pull back unless you want to kill brett again there's a there's a telos here there's there's a whole range of things pointing here i mean if if sam sign of like i'd really love to murder brett but i'm afraid i really don't want to do the time so let's make it look like an accident it's all built into the agent arena relationship the slide check the chamber and do this in a redundant fashion that that really looks like i'm suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder it is truly redundant and then i'll hand it to brett and if brett knows anything about guns he will do the same thing having just seen me do it and if he hands it back to me again i will do the same thing even though there may be no ammunition around right so it really is crazy at the level of our explicit knowledge of the situation and yet absolutely necessary to do and this is i think again part of the reason why we wouldn't be talking about this metaphorical truth idea if it didn't have something going for it and i think this is a good analogy of well what it's got going for it and it looks crazy but within the 4p agent arena relationship perspectively what they do makes sense but not only just because of guns and bullets but because the value of people the friendship and again if if it were sam harris's desire to get away with murdering brett well he'd act like he's checking and then hand it to brett and i didn't know the gun was loaded and it's it's not merely it's it runs very deep i mean i would have been that whole time you you're careful not to point the barrel of the gun at anything you would be afraid to shoot and when people fail to live this way around guns they with some unnerving frequency actually shoot themselves or people close to them by accident so it is really the only proper hedge against just the the odds of being in proximity to loaded weapons and yet if someone in the middle of this operation came up to us and said you know actually there's a casino that just opened across the street that will take your bets about whether or not guns are loaded would you like to bet a million dollars as to whether or not this gun is loaded well of course i would bet those million dollars every time that it's not loaded because i know it's not loaded so there's there's a there's and how do you know it okay there's propositionally all this world of objects in terms of but again it's all in relationship to other thing it's perspectival it's procedural it's you know that's where this metaphorical truth is lying it's in these other categories that that brett doesn't have the words for there's a literal truth and a a metaphorical truth what you know otherwise known as a a very useful fiction which in this case is actually more useful but here's the funny thing about the useful fiction you're acting as if there might be a bulletin and you say it's a fiction but you don't know that it's a fiction and again this is where this is where this idea has some sticking but you're also when you call it a useful fiction acting like you know it's not true so okay take a step back and look at both of it not just from the inside of saying it's a useful fiction but from the outside saying oh you know that there's no bullet in there then why are you doing it well i don't really well it's because there's a there's not only a dramatical thing there's a liturgical element to this i am doing this to save brett's life and to save my own life there's purpose behind it full than the truth right but the only way i can understand its utility is utility towards an end and and even utter the phrase metaphorical truth in a way that's comprehensible is in the context of distinguishing it from literal truth and yep go ahead this is fascinating sam actually this is this is i think next phase i'm a little i'm worried by how excited you are but so i have a little story that might be helpful about that and so you could you could tell me what what you think about okay think about this okay so so one of the things that i've been reconsidering since we talked last night is is the nature of our dispute about the relationship between facts and values because i i think i can make a case that what i've been trying to do especially in my first book was to ground values in facts but i'm not doing it the same way that you are exactly so so i don't want to make that a point point of contention so and i'll get to that in a moment but with regards to this metaphorical truth let me tell you something you tell me what you think about this so one of the things that's been observed by anthropologists worldwide is that human beings tend to make sacrifices so i'm gonna okay why is jordan going here is you're trying to cross the two worlds okay you're trying to cross the two worlds and and that's that's what that's what these archetypes sort of try to do to cross the worlds what what are the two worlds again i started with the world of everybody's in church saying you know here we are and we're reading the bible and where we believe this is god's word and and we believe what do you mean by god's word well we believe that this is the key to life well what do you mean by life well this also teaches us what a good life is oh and but then you go out and you read the story and there's a in genesis one there's a there's the waters above and the waters below and there's a space in between and there's a firmament there's a big dome that holds the waters out and you separate the waters and you have these functionaries and all of this stuff going on but then you go outside and say no we're have to say is the world round yes it's a globe and the globe so you have all these representations okay so all of this is constructed in a way and so how do these things get crossed and for for peterson sacrifice is a way and now right away sacrifice well that's religion s okay well let's let's hear them out spend two minutes that human beings tend to make sacrifices and right away too in the word sacrifice there's an ambiguity because my parents made sacrifices for me they my parents put me through christian school where public school could have been free and instead they spent money to put their three children through christian school they made sacrifices and sam and brett would say no no no no no when you're saying sacrifices you're meaning like an altar and an animal and one of the videos my most popular video in my church channel is when before you know before i ever heard about jordan peterson was playing with this and was thinking about sacrifices that well how do sacrifices work in this world well what do i mean by in this world well on this ball with an animal and a fire and because i had been going through leviticus and i was thinking about there's an entire world built into the sacrificing of those animals how does that work and and you'd read in the new testament that the sacrifice and in the old testament that the sacrifice is a pleasing aroma does that mean that god is somewhere in the sky with a big nose going and that he has an i mean what what's what's going on in that world well why do we use the same word for my parents spending their money well it's not even used christian school because that gets into religion s my my parents just having me and spending money on my clothing and on my doctor's appointments and on christmas presents and and all those things that you don't necessarily describe as religious okay and those sacrifices versus an altar and an animal and some fire and and those things so why do we use the same word for both of those so humans like to do sacrifice and why is that coming into the metaphorical truth thing so i'm gonna spend two minutes three minutes laying out a sacrificial story and the reason i want to do it is because see what i think happened with regards to the origin of these profound stories is that people first started to behave in certain ways that had uh dramatically survival significance and and and survival significance well how did they well they just they began comparing and they were saying this is probably where morality came from too because do this don't do that and again read uval harari i mentioned this in a sermon recently how you know clans and families and and villages they were all in this stuff together and so you know act this way and not that way and so for example the story of the prodigal son the father gives the younger brother one third of his estate let's say if they only have two sons one third of his estate and and the entire village is going to be horrified at this because the father was probably the wealthiest man in the village and it could be that the entire village was sustaining its living off the father's estate there were shepherds and artisans and and people doing other things sort of surrounding the great man and all of his wealth and so then the younger son says comes and says liquidate a third of the economy of the village and give it to me and of course everybody in the village would say beat that son that's moral beat him in fact beat him publicly so that every other kid this infectious idea this this little dramatic liturgical thing that that kid that kid is starting that dies here fast so beat that kid Luke 15 the father doesn't the father gives the kid what he asks for everybody in the town thinks we're all in deep trouble because the old man is rounding the bend and then the kid takes all that money and not only doesn't just keep it all here but goes to the far off country and squanders it and so the whole economy of the village takes this huge hit and everyone's ticked at him and again read Kenneth Bailey's interpretation of this Kenneth Bailey was a scholar American scholar in Lebanon for years wrote a variety of books about the cultural interpretations of many of the stories and the gospels and and Kenneth Bailey notes that what would be expected to happen why the old man will run why he keeps looking out for his son is because he knows his son's an idiot and yet he gave his son the money and it's a parable because well this is how parables work this is how parables work and he gave the son the money he knows his son's an idiot and he's keeping watching for the son because he knows what's gonna happen that kid's gonna come back because the kid's not that dumb because the kid's gonna go out into the harsh world and he's gonna blow all the money he's not gonna have anything to eat and he's gonna come back and he knows that the village elders are gonna get out there on the road and this is what Kenneth Bailey goes into with a with a clay pot and he'll have corn in it it's like what does that have to do with anything oh it's it's symbolic it's a symbolic dramatic liturgical they're gonna go out with this clay pot with corn in it when they see the son come they're gonna bar the road and they're gonna smash it in front of them and say this is you we're never gonna see you again if you come around here again we're probably gonna kill you and the father doesn't want that so what does the father do he runs like a girl you know robes you know exposing himself he's an old man but he's gonna beat the elders why because he loves his son this of course is nested in luke 15 so read the whole chapter you can see what the point jesus is making into whom because it's nested in a context but he's gonna go out there and he knows that the village elders are coming and he knows that he's got influence they've got influence they've got tradition on their side but he's gonna and so what does he do he throws his robe around him what does that mean that means i'm cladding him in my reputation and my influence and so don't touch him because i'm the big monkey in this in this jungle put shoes on his feet put a robe on him put my ring on him kill the fattened calf and of course the older brother who's out in the field is ticked off because he's he's with the village elders he wanted to see he wanted to see his worthless brother dead well that's the story that's morality that's that's that's how we work okay back to sacrifice and that was selected for as a consequence is that people first started to behave in certain ways that had survival significance and that was selected for as a consequence of of of of the standard selection practices and so that was instantiated in behavior and then because we could observe ourselves because we're self-conscious creatures that we started to make representations of those patterns and dramatize them and then encapsulate them in stories so it's a bottom up from from so it would be sort of like chimpanzees or wolves become aware of their dominance hierarchy structures and the strategies that they use so a wolf for example if two wolves are having a dominance dispute one the wolf that gives up first lays down and puts his neck open so the other wolf can tear it out and then the other wolf doesn't and you could say well it's as if a wolf is following a rule about not killing a weaker member of the pack of course wolves don't have rules they have behavioral patterns ah wolves don't write things down they have patterns and and these patterns have gotten into wolves doll and also little baby wolf grows up suckling okay little wolf let me tell you now we have stories about mama wolf telling little wolf and so on and so forth but they act it out and they imprint it on the others just like oh not that different from the first draft of my parents marriage and my parents parenting they act it out and they don't they don't have you know the the left brain doesn't suss out little articulated rules from the right brain but they they map it out and they act it out weaker and you could say well it's as if a wolf is following a rule about not killing a weaker member of the pack of course wolves don't have rules they have behavioral patterns but a self-conscious wolf would watch what the wolves were doing and then say well it's as if we're acting out the idea that each wolf in the pack has intrinsic value and then that starts to be and maybe the wolves would have a little story about the the heroic forbearing wolf that doesn't tear out the neck of its opponents and that that's good wolf well that's good wolf ethics and and so but it's grounded but it's grounded in the actual behavior okay so let's we'll put that aside for a second now here here's the sacrificial story so human beings have made sacrifices it seems to be a standard practice all around the world and in the biblical narratives they would often sacrifice something of value like a like a valuable animal like a child start the story and this is why you can't have conversations with sam harris well well no no no look look i'm not i'm not making light of this i know that human sacrifice was a part of this yeah but that's again so just to just to give you a crib on where my mind goes here's yep as if we didn't know human sacrifice is as old a religious precept now this is a complete distraction from jordan's argument but we'll bring it around as we know about yes it's a cultural universal the the other sacrifices are derivations from it circumcision is a surrogate for the far more but barbaric act of human sacrifice and why is it barbaric sam where is that knowledge from this moral knowledge it's well there's things there that are actually productive things there that actually work but they're reprehensible okay that's what brett just said in the video with joe rogan and now well here we have an example right and you know it answers every test you would put to it with respect to its archetypal significance it's it's it's compelling presence in stories across all cultures but the horror is that it actually has taken place in all these cultures based on explicit beliefs in the presence of just just right well arthur kesler scientific ignorance arthur kesler used that as an argument for the essential insanity of humanity but it's not just the insanity of humanity it's the the misapprehension of the causal structure of the cosmos you don't know what controls the weather you don't know why people get sick you think your neighbor's capable this is why you don't talk to sam harris full of casting magic spells on not a good conversation partner on you you're ignorant of everything and you're trying to force some order on things and so when you don't in the absence of engineers and you don't know why build certain buildings fall down you ask well what makes you think child sacrifice is reprehensible where did that idea come from it was a nearly universal idea we already established that where what how did the idea suddenly come out of our culture that child sacrifice in fact my pat my parents sacrificed for their child actually can agree with your neighbor that maybe you should bury your firstborn child into every post hole of this new building which in fact has took how many firstborn children do you have sam plays and it's the consequence of ignorance and so that the problem is if the consequence of ignorance okay so what exactly is sam's complaint there's a super thing there isn't a super thing you can relate to the super thing well it's not there so you can't relate to it we have all these bad ideas about about it now here's the problem where did those bad ideas come from they certainly must have had utility in the past and and that's what brett argues and i think sam would probably they certainly must have a utility in the past why would why would sacrificing a child get you somewhere and why although it was reprehensible it got you someplace why was that what's going on in this world sam if you're only going to talk about this purified notion of sacrifice it's a very strange consequence of ignorance sam like well you it's the notion that we're in relationship to invisible others that can ah the super things that they can mistreat us based on or not having offered enough we're we are we're in but not we're in relation to to invisible others and jordan says we are why well in what way in what way where are these invisible others well where are the parents that wrote your first draft maybe they're in the cemetery but are your parents really in the cemetery or in their head well what are my parents and jordan would probably say your parents are patterns what your parents are patterns that's what they are to you they're patterns that were instantiated in flesh and blood but you keep seeing them as objects what they really were were parents were were patterns not precisely those others well but we're in relationship to the invisible others who will judge us in the future the imaginary and the right side of history isn't that what we hear all the time the right side of history and when he says this to sam he this is a huge point because sam keeps wanting to leverage our reputation in the future but it's like well wait a minute sam you might say that your parents your parents weren't patterns and that they're in the they're buried in the ground or your grandparents or great grandparents i don't want to you know wish anything ill on sam's parents but that they're no longer here well it's a world of objects they're no longer here but no your parents are still very much with you and the ancestors are still very much with you and all of this stuff is still very much with you it's built into us and it continues to live in the symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary and it's still up there and they're up there but it's like well in what sense are they up there okay well that's a valid conversation that we can have but we should have it with a little bit of humility because we're not entirely sure but we know in some ways they really are with us to quite a strong degree my father although he died in 2013 is still with me in fact the more i do these videos the more i feel him with me all the time said oh paul that sounds really wooish and i don't mean in a wooish way at all i find all of the ways that that first draft that my father gave me is built into me and you might say well i don't i don't think not all that first draft is correct i'd say well that's true and i learned in my marriage not all of my parents for parenting first draft or my by my parents uh partnering first draft was correct and i learned in having children that not all their parenting first drafts are correct and we're continuing the process of updating that but to say that they're not here well what do we mean by them and what do we mean by our parents and and what really is a human being okay but that again you're changing you're changing the noun in important way but i'm also trying to understand and i'm not trying to argue against the horror of child sacrifice no i i would never imagine i know i know why not doesn't he at least act as if there is a god and isn't that what you expect isn't that the charge that people who people who believe in the super thing and read the iron age book somehow continue to hold slaves and practice child sacrifice they don't why not answer the questions but i'm also but i'm also trying to but my work would be much easier if you did that yeah yes well you'd have to visit him in prison yes yes and the work of journalists as well although they've tried that pretty much anyway so right that would be that would even be worse than enforced monogamy hypothetically so okay so see i'm let's say that i'm trying to give the devil his due and i'm trying to understand from an evolutionary perspective like a cognitive behavioral evolutionary perspective let's say why that particular set of ideas would emerge and in many many places perhaps autonomously or once having emerged would spread like wildfire it's like because i'm not willing to only attribute it to ignorance now we could attribute it to ignorance no problem man but but there's more going on there because it is a human universal and like there's all sorts of things that happen in nature as a consequence of biological and evolutionary processes that don't work out well for our current state of moral intuition let's say yes okay so one of the things because i've been thinking about this sacrificial motif for a very long time trying to figure out what that what what the hell's the idea here exactly and so so here's one and not just idea the what is going on with the why do we keep repeating it why is the word still lingering why do we instead of my parents placing me on an altar to offer me up to a god why did my parents deny themselves better cars and better clothing and better food and better vacations just so they could have little paul lorian ruth running around one way of thinking about it um if you give up something of value now you can gain something of more value in the future ah time form for action we're traveling through time we're patterns traveling through time okay so let's think about that idea for a minute so the first thing is that's a that's a hell of an idea yeah that's delay of gratification that's right that's the discovery of the future as well and so you might say well the notion of sacrifice is exactly the same thing as the discovery of the future if we give up something we really value now we can make a pact with the structure of existence itself such that better things will happen to us in the future now okay now what's weird about this and it's hard to understand is that it works so when i talk to my students for example and i say what did your parents sacrifice to send you to university many of them are children of first generation immigrants and so like man they're on that story in a second right they know all sorts of things that their parents sacrificed and they're delaying gratification in the present for a radically delayed return in the future now you think animals generally speaking they might act out the idea of delayed gratification as a consequence of running out their instincts but they don't conceptualize it it's not obvious that animals give up something they value right now in order and they don't represent it in dramatically liturgical ways to thrive in the future there's an old story about how to catch a monkey right so you put a jar up with rocks and candies in front of the jar grabs i don't know i don't know either and then i've heard i've heard i've heard various claims but but but the point is you can go pick up the monkey he won't let go of the can and that's sort of well what's that little story well that story's sort of a is it a literal truth is it a metaphorical truth oh but it it communicates the heart of what we're trying to communicate it's now perhaps he would but the the issue is is that it's not obvious that animals will forego an immediate gratification for a future gratification i don't think i don't think that's right actually and i actually want to hold well the question is can well they do it consciously they might act it out they act it out that's not the issue it's very hard to know if it's conscious because they won't respond to the questionnaires but i know i know and and obviously the line between acting it out and becoming starting to consciously represent it is is a tenuous one but and not only consciously represent it but represent it in all of the ways that human beings represent things in writing in art in in stories and in all of these things that's that's how we represent it oops gotta move my window over so notice here again this is why i complain about sam as a conversation partner because i've watched him now with brett and with jordan and it's sam sam is like an evangelical how is he like an evangelical he keeps going for the kill too fast because oh human sacrifice immoral well where did it get started where i mean you're not giving ontology and you're not giving even the reality of what you're complaining about you're assuming it's reality you're not giving it its due because why i mean didn't those people love their children isn't that biologically built into us we talk about that all the time where where the mother has the child and looks down at the child and the hormones are flooding and they love that child and i mean you have to overcome all of that for this other thing that that people would actually sacrifice of course now i can memnon sacrifices and i can memnon's wife didn't take it very kindly but but but there's so much going on here and and you're just simply not taking you're not looking at it fairly in terms of everything but also notice how immediately we go to the moral immediately we go to the moral and sam says that's not that's why did the moral course you know maybe okay let's pick a date maybe 3000 years ago in moab the history the arc of history bent towards child sacrifice why did it bend the other way now well because you're you're thinking about and then peterson nails him on that well you're thinking about your reputation among your among your descendants how they will regard you in history to be on the right side of history think about all of this and this is all operating with us today now what's really interesting about this is we don't do child sacrifice we do child sacrifice all the time just right now in the news scott scott peterson is going to scott peterson who killed his pregnant wife lacy this is a huge this is a huge um this was a huge story in california a number of years ago and how could he kill his pregnant wife and he killed his unborn child we have to continue to have these political discussions about how to regard our unborn children in fact not too long ago and on twitter before we had covid and we're fighting about abortion you know hashtag you know me everybody saying well i had an abortion it was the right decision for me and it wasn't a hard one my husband and i were working more than full time and had three kids already i was fortunate that at the time accessing abortion in texas was not the nightmare it is now that's not child sacrifice well what is a child why on one case in california a very blue state could was was scott peterson's crime so the the reprehensibility of scott peterson's crime was because his wife was pregnant with his child for all we know why was that so represent what reprehensible i mean and for cecile richards and i just plucked her out of the air i have no idea who she is for cecile richards it's just a choice to well to kill that well it's got distinct genetics it's not like cutting off your foot doctor assisted foot cutting no it's doctor assisted abortion and and you're plucking out a you're plucking out cells that have a distinct dna from you mom and you're deciding to end its trajectory you're deciding to stop its pattern peterson likes talking about russo i picked this up because i've been reading again russo and revolution will and ariel durrance the story of civilization volume 10 when she became so so russo figured he wasn't making enough money to actually have a wife so he just have a mistress and he he decided that his relationship with this woman she wasn't a very well educated woman she wasn't that beautiful but he had needs he had like sexual needs and so she would be there for his sexual needs and he would feed her and he would clothe her and you know sometimes give money to her mother and yada yada and she was very dutiful mistress and that's how she lived but he didn't take a wife because like a wife would be well that's well then you're having heirs then you need money for children and all those things and so russo and and at that point you know mistresses were very common and people understood what a mistress was and what a wife was and i'm not promoting this idea but that's you know read durant it'll tell you all about it when his mistress became pregnant he was thrown into the greatest embarrassment what jacques russo didn't understand where babies come from what could he do with children fair point some friends assured him it was quite customary to send unwanted offspring to a foundling asylum put it on the doorstep and run away ding dong that's that's the respectable thing to do oh child sacrifice went away there are many ways to sacrifice a child when the infant came this was done after teresa's protest but with the cooperation of her mother in 1747 in the eight years and in the next eight years four other children came five children he did this too and they were disposed of disposed of in the same way some skeptics have suggested well would have been better to kill them or what are the children are they objects in the world well sort of they have bodies and skin and all these or are they patterns or are they stories and and how in fact do you represent them some skeptics have suggested that russo never had any children and that he invented the story to hide his impotence he and voltaire had issues but his many apologies for the shrinking of responsibility make this theory improbable he privately confessed his behavior in this matter to dita roe grim and mademoiselle d'epine he implicitly acknowledged it in emile he raged against voltaire for making it public if there wasn't anything wrong with it why are you ashamed of it well if there wasn't anything wrong with it why are you ashamed of it what is morality well it's it's it's publicly you're right you're wrong you're going to have higher status you're going to have lower status we're going to elevate you and reward you we're going to punish you and maybe put your life at risk it's morality right and we do it together and and we do it along the side along the lines of a whole bunch of ideas symbolic dramatical liturgical imaginary in that realm and and we say good bad right or wrong so in you know the one moral rule that seems to be holding in america today is don't cheat well in 18th century france it was well you can have a mistress and you can have a wife don't rub her face in it that would be that's not you don't want to do that but you can have a wife and a mistress and the wife is for heirs and a mistress is for pleasure and you can find ancient materials that say basically the same thing with respect to female slaves or male slaves or boys he implicitly acknowledged it in emil in the confessions he admitted it explicitly and expressed remorse not remorse to go and find the kids he was not made for family life but that didn't stop him from doing other things being a skinless mass of nerves and a wanderer in body and soul he missed the sobering care of children and never quite became a man that's why i love durant's writing you know a little just bang missed the sobering care of children well what is what do children do well children children raise you and when you sacrifice for children you sacrifice for children you discover the future and you say okay this is going to cost me a lot of money now now now for me parenting so much of the stuff is the first draft so what do you do with your children again some of this came up in my sermon about honor your father and mother that your days may be long in the land which the lord your god gives you oh that sounds like you're engaging the super thing well you can read it in another way and say well you know what if your children watch you caring for your parents guess what in their first draft they will probably begin by caring for you unless you muck it up by being a real idiot to them so there's patterns that go on here and the patterns get represented and they get represented and they get instantiated into these texts and these texts take on authority because large numbers of community begin to revolve around these texts and they uphold these texts but there's there's an epigenetic layer to this and they don't all you know and again if you read the history of biblical interpretation you find some texts are relevant now and some texts are relevance later and so the community is all processing this but they they actually have a lot to work with with respect to these things and so it's part of the reason christianity says abortion is a really bad thing and it was very interesting listening to Kanye West with Joe Rogan and Kanye West making the point a thousand children a thousand children did he say a day could that be a thousand children a day a thousand black children a day a thousand children of more children of color a thousand black children a day or i don't i don't know what the statistic is i'm sure someone will provide it and oh this is a black genocide Kanye says and what was so interesting about that conversation is Joe Rogan just sat through it it's fascinating well so what are we and what is metaphorical truth and how does it work so one of the interesting sub conversations within these conversations between Jordan and Sam revolved around stories and well what's the relationship between story and metaphorical truth well stories are knowledge containers that are far more powerful memorable relatable their representations they're far more personable than facts as knowledge containers and they far better represent four p's of knowledge propositional participatory procedural and perspectival just look at the common complaint of high school students in history class all we learn about is wars and dates oh but you get a good teacher good history teacher and he'll tell you stories and your history teacher will say well dates are hooks they help you to organize the stories but if we read something like will Durant it's just all stories and they weave together nicely into stories and and now notice the metaphorical nature of this here comes the video you you can tell stories by way of communicating certain ideas i mean that's obviously i'm not saying stories aren't incredibly powerful and useful and inevitable right it's like we we use wait i think you are you know i'm not saying you might not be saying that they're that they're they're not they're not inevitable but you are debating their utility and power because you know you said that you don't need the story and again utility and power for what for living as an intermediary so now we have a few doors open here which i think we should okay we should extract the most out of these areas that we've touched and not run on to something else so okay i think there's to talk about the utility of story right which is obviously a fact about the world and about human psychology that you're reading a lot into and more into than i'm reading right and and the people we just heard from love that you well maybe i'm reading more into it than you are i'm not sure about that but you talk a lot about the primacy of stories and you are trying to get me to admit that they are that i even i helplessly resort to well why would stories be so primal because stories can embody way more truth than these ideas about your facts out there storytelling to make my points right well you did there i think this is a good place and he keeps doing it is for us to and i don't want us to get bogged down but i think it's a good place for us to touch this topic of the distinction between literal and metaphorical truth which you i mean you might want to introduce it but i think because that in my mind that covers this this different emphasis on stories okay briefly but we are we are at our q a so argument that we're true you come right they're so useful right so but you also call look this is what happens in the moral landscape i think tell me tell me why i'm wrong because i'm really trying to understand it see i think you dealt with g.e moore's problem of infinite regress by by staking a moral proposition and your moral proposition was look here's a way things can be horrible and here's the way things can be good can we accept that this is horrible and this is good and that we should move towards good and if the answer is yes we can accept that then we can proceed and maybe we can even proceed with extracting values from facts but we have to accept that a priori presupposition first and you insist that we have to accept it because it's objectively true and i don't think that's correct because you can't just find it and in fact heaven and hell it's all going to be stories let me just get the proposition clear so my argument is that the worst possible misery for everyone is bad that's hell okay that's so so hell is is the religious version of that but i'm just you can forget about religion or whether there's a god religion s or anything else the super thing we live in a universe that admits of the possibility of experience i'm asking you to imagine a universe where every conscious mind every mind that can have an experience is tuned to the worst possible experience for that mind for as long as possible so there's no silver lining there's no there are no lessons learned there's no purpose there's no meaning that's really what he's saying right here learned everything that can suffer suffers as much as it possibly can for as long as it can and you might say well if there's no meaning well maybe fortunately we don't suffer that way but there's no meaning now that includes human beings includes animals and includes future ai that we might build that can suffer it includes beings that we'll never know about right so my argument is that's bad if anything of course that's bad is bad that's bad okay okay we don't disagree that hell is bad if the word bad is going to mean anything that's bad you can't say but what's so interesting is how he takes meaning out of it right from the start and peterson's whole point is well happiness isn't people's people exchange happiness for meaning all the time and sam basically just simply admitted it there that's fine but it's not a factual claim no it's not a fact that's right it's it's within this other realm of and that's why he said well maybe this is where metaphorical comes in why because it's a story it's a metaphor it's all live being played out what is is a fact it's a claim about so i would argue to you and again if this it's it's hard to impart this intuition if someone doesn't share it but but isn't that the true of every intuition if someone doesn't share this intuition i have no way of interpreting any other other word that comes out of their mouth after they admit they don't share this that's one heck of a presuppositionalism so i mean so just imagine someone saying even that doesn't make it a factual claim no well every so again so this is that you guys are going to get stuck here and i think i think you're gonna yeah no there's a certain stuckness with uh with sam harris so i think better than the idea of all these truths plus metaphorical truth trying to get at the four p's i think peugeot's perspective is actually more useful we live in a world of patterns one of the problems with with scientists in general is that they they're standing and they look at the world and they try to see patterns in the world okay now the problem one of the difficulties and i think it's it's actually kind of some some physicists right now are seeing the problem but not a lot of them aren't so the question is is there a pattern to the way you look at the world so it's not just the world that has a pattern you also are patterned now the volume is a little low here so you are patterned you look at the world with a pattern and you are a pattern and your mechanisms of understanding are patterned your mechanisms of understanding are patterned so it's not like you're in a you're a weird objective like completely neutral thing so it's not like you have monarchical vision you're some weird objective completely look neutral thing looking at a world of objects you are a pattern and what you're looking at are fundamentally patterns looking at a patterned world you are also patterned and your perception is patterned and so then that's when symbolism comes into comes into into comes into the sphere so it's like does do your thoughts have a pattern that you can that are similar to the patterns that you view in the cosmos do your does your family have a pattern similar to the patterns you view in the cosmos so when we have these morally reprehensible things like child sacrifice well Sam Harris is a pattern and Sam Harris is a pattern that's been replicated and reproduced out into the 20th century and so when he hears about child sacrifice and thinks about Agamemnon or maybe Abraham and Isaac or how many things in the ancient world or the Aztecs or are all of this he says it's morally reprehensible and well the patterns that were back in the other day said no that's just what you got to do but then if you say well abortion is a is child sacrifice he said no because it's not it's not religion s it's not you're not sacrificing to a god but you can interrupt the pattern of a pregnancy if it's an inconvenient time if the mother agrees whether or not the father agrees but when Scott Peterson interrupts the pattern of the pregnancy there are additional consequences for not only killing his wife but killing the unborn baby and the same society says both say well what's going on with these patterns I'm gonna fix my little square again so we are pattern seeing patterns and I just wanted to play that because I've used it again and again and again and I wanted to note that it was in this you can find this video of of Jonathan Bejeaux talking with Andrea with the bangs and Mercury you can find it on all three of their channels and so John Buck who you know John I've spoken with John Buck John Buck found my channel early on John Buck actually has a quite a good video out there on what is metaphorical truth with a lot of um and he did it two years ago or yeah almost almost two years ago now it's really quite a good video and so Brett Weinstein's main argument is that well what if the what if the surrounding patterns are different now metaphorical truth is using the word metaphor and metaphors are basically mimetic patterns and one of the things that John Buck notes on his video is that let's say you look at inherit the wind where it looks at the Scopes trial and the Scopes trial if you watch the movie or look at the play inherit the wind it's looking actually doesn't make this comment in the I'm making this analogy but inherit the wind about the Scopes trial is actually around about the McCarthy hearings and they're basically making an argument that well it's these it's these religious fundamentalists that are causing the problem but what's interesting about using the word metaphor here is that well what is a metaphor well you're saying that something is like the other thing that's and in fact all language is metaphorical in that way and and and one thing is like the other so it's a metaphorical truth well even your even your propositional truth which is a correspondence thing are looking at essences and saying well those essences match up and the language we're using oxygen is oxygen but what does oxygen mean oxygening means one thing if you're scuba diving and it means another thing if you're worrying about your iron or your copper oxidizing okay it means different things in different forums and so Brett Weinstein's point is that well these moral truths well they're reprehensible and he always just talks as if that's static as if no they're reprehensible to you but where are you well you're in this long history of patterns and you're looking at the representations from past histories of patterns but as Jordan said you know but it's got to actually be living and that's built into the whole idea of the whole enterprise so past past experience action a action b one gets a check one gets an x present experience action a i'm not sure what the little line means action b gets a check but then Jordan Peterson makes the point that well what do we do with stories is we abstract out of all of the things around us something and well it's sort of metaphorical but but we don't quite know what that thing is it's in the symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary it's sort of up there and we abstract that out of all of it and we say okay abortion good or bad well was abortion okay in the roman period when they brought the baby to term because it was safer probably to give birth to the child and then abandon it on the city dump was it was it better in rousseau's to have teresa give birth to the child and to leave it at a at the foundling asylum that's grim or is it better to interrupt the pattern earlier on well this gets into all kinds of things but but pay attention to what we're doing here one pattern is like the other there are differences in the patterns that involve the objects and those differences so if you look at inherit the wind which is about the scopes trial and you look at the mccarthy hearings well we're looking at the patterns and we're looking at essences and part of the art and inherit the wind is to make a statement about well all of us really believe this thing about evolution and this mccarthyism is again a religious thing oh well what's the relevance relevance realization is key in all of this so your merit metaphorical truth look at all the metaphors gun safety patterns the boxing day tsunami porcupine and its quill now i want to get to the boxing day tsunami pattern because it's very clearly a pattern now the pattern is encoded in a story and there are actors and agents in the story and and that's that element that brett sort of objects to so the metaphorical truth story of the boxing day tsunami goes like this there is a tsunami and the a certain group of people had a religious story that talked about that there are spirits that govern the waters and when the waters recede well you'd better head for high ground and that story saved the life of everyone in that tribe but many other people were killed because the waters received their fish out there flapping people went out to get the fish it was strange it was novel so they went out and then the tsunami came in huge loss of life okay what are the patterns if we look at this with respect to patterns we're going to learn a lot more now they get hung up on are there spirits out there or not that's a really rather stupid thing to get hung up on why well think about the story is there a bullet in there or not okay well that's that's kind of relevant is there a spirit a super thing that moves the water now you might say well there's they're kind of our super things is a tectonic plate a super thing yeah but it's not conscious okay that doesn't fill out forms either is a you know volcano or an earthquake a super thing well yeah the earthquake's a super thing is it conscious doesn't fill out forms does the earthquake coincide in terms of patterns with whether or not you're sacrificing brenton i would probably share doubts there but it's a pattern and spirit isn't a dumb thing when you think about what spirit is to reflect down with respect to these patterns you really want to look more at patterns and in some ways part of what let's say a a modern seismic scientist would have is far more information at hand of a certain kind provided by the scientific revolution and again the point is that you know this was a really smart thing to do let's let's let's act as if it's not a conscious being that we're relating to that is causing the tsunami and let's find some of some of the other causes and we know that there are many causes potentially let's find some of the other causes that are relevant to the pattern of tsunamis okay so you really want to look more at the pattern which the tribe did than the objects because the water's there the ground under the water's there and the waves are there and the tides are there and the tribe really knows all of those patterns so well and then there's this anomaly in the pattern and the tribe says oh there's a spirit now of course brent can't tell us whether or not there is a spirit because by definition the spirit he might be skeptical and he and i both might be skeptical in some ways about this but it's not something that you can decide scientifically and i think bret would acknowledge that but now spirits or persons are far more pattern than objects to us relevantly what do i mean by that bret has been married to his wife for a long time the pattern of heather is probably more important to him in terms of a hierarchy than the body of heather let's say heaven forbid they would have an accident and they would have to amputate one of her legs they would have to amputate one of her legs probably everyone would say it's better to have the leg amputated than to lose your life why because then the pattern of heather can continue now the pattern would be disrupted because they would miss her leg but the pattern of heather would continue because most of the pattern of heather heather is not necessarily involved in that leg and there can be other accommodations to keep the general pattern going people are more patterns that unborn baby is a pattern your neighbor is a pattern now that the body stuff that's changing all of that is changing as we go but what you really care about is the pattern now what that tribe has done is taken that pattern and instantiated in a story and that story is more powerful in a lot of ways than all of the data out there because you go to people and say tectonic plates what's huh no the story the story is more powerful and in jordan peterson's darwinian truth the story is more true oh why how would you say that because the story actually arrives at its conclusion the story actually achieves its telos the story actually fulfills the pattern because the story saved the lives of the people of the village who had that particular religious belief and not so much the others who had little bits and shreds of the scientific idea but they didn't have they were sort of plugged into a bigger network that potentially had more information to it but it was in many ways more deficient than the religious story that the little group of people had that's the power of this metaphorical truth now you might say well they believed in a spirit that was wrong well you don't know that well what please explain to me what a spirit is well let's try that because i don't think it's that hard and and i did this as i was teaching one of my sunday school lessons and because one of the things that i've noticed for years is that we use this word i'm spiritual but not religious what does that mean well where do we use the word spirit that that that brett weinstein wouldn't have a problem with well let's use the example of school spirit now modernity is really hung up on spirit again because of a lot of the issues in the 18th century it looked um um you know it it looks for tiny discrete processes by which tracking objects and if we would say the spirit of electricity releases the oxygen and hydrogen from the water they probably they wouldn't balk at that but they'd be a little nervous about that word well the question is what moves the world what moved the water and the tsunami well the tectonic plates what moved the tectonic plates well volcanism what moved volcanism well in one eye you can kind of go with sam harris all the way back to the beginning so everything started at the everything started at the the big bang well what got the big bang well don't ask that question anything anyway everything started at the big bang and whoosh the whole show c.s lucas book of miracles okay right there it's the whole show and and and all my thoughts and all my ideas and everything we're doing it's all one pattern that one initiation point that it's just playing itself out and there's no meaning and there's no purpose and again it's so ironic when sam harris is laying out hell there's all this suffering and it has no purpose and it's like have you been listening to what jordan peterson has been saying i don't think so anyway school spirit what is school spirit but if i say school spirit you say i totally understand what school spirit is well what do you totally understand about school spirit well some schools have a lot of spirit to them well what do you mean by that well you go there and well there's physical manifestations of that school spirit all over the hallways there's posters they're having a pep rally people are friendly they're wearing their school mascot on their on their shirts they're showing up to the basketball game to cheer their team they have a good attitude they learn well now is any individual person in charge of school spirit well kind of the pep rally and the cheerleaders and the teachers and the principal and what else what all goes into school spirit oh gosh what things cause school spirit nearly innumerable the culture that the school is in the community that the school is in the history of the community that the school is in not only geographically but if those people have moved there thing after thing after thing what what kinds of people the the high status students were the jocks and the and the and the nerds and and were they kind did they have good parents was there what kinds of religions were around it's all this stuff goes into school spirit now school spirit is created why do we call it spirit well because it moves the school and it shapes the school and it gets instantiated in the school and it gets there are representatives that there are representatives of it that come and there are and i mean school spirits almost become archetypes but they're too small really for archetypes and so spirit is the right word okay how do you relate to the school spirit yeah you can you can participate in school spirit you can you can initiate school spirit you can make it better you can make it worse and then someone will say well does school spirit have consciousness that's a lot harder but again we can't really answer that question now i i had quite a bit of back and forth on this in the last um discord q a that maybe i'll post so i'm recording this on monday and i'm going to release this on tuesday so maybe i'll post that q a on monday afternoon quite a bit of of of conversation on that because because of the christians were a little bit nervous because well paul are you selling out too much are you saying how does this how does this revolve around the traditional way that christians talk about the spiritual realm and my argument is going to be i'm probably not going to make it here but people have actually been sending me emails about this because you sort of anticipate where i'm going with a bunch of these things because well how much do we know about what's on the other side and that's exactly where jordan peterson keeps winding up again and again that's let's use mcclatchy high because it's a historic uh one of the historic high schools here in sacramento that some of my children went to where is the spirit of mcclatchy high well it's in the walls it's in the people it's actually beyond the people because it's built into all of the patterns that are people that have been alumni of mcclatchy high is it in the heavenlies i don't think so but i can't really say are there other spirits that are far older and actually if you watch the matrix movies they have some of those ideas built into like the the mayor of engine and the key maker and and so you have all these other you have all these other spirits as it were that are operating in the movie and and so then people were would say things like well well how about see part of what happens if you read let's say frank paredes books is that there's this divorce between the spiritual and the material but if you read c.s lewis and if you if you think about the bible carefully basically the assertion is that human beings are sort of amphibious we create spirits we create school spirit we create the spirit of a town the spirit of a household the spirit of a family and and these these are patterns and we don't know we know that these patterns get instantiated into into buildings and they get they get built into people's lives if you have if your school spirit in one way or another incentivized smoking in the 1960s and 70s that school spirit brought lung cancer into people's lives so what is the spirit of the automobile and and what these archetypes are in some ways are very ancient spirits well why are you using the word spirit are they conscious well what is consciousness you see what's so interesting is that you know we're knocking on all these doors even with people like sam harrison brett weinstein but but they have these these certain dismissals that are just as dogmatic as religious dogmas and some of these dismissals are well-founded but they're just assertions because we don't know and so we understand with school spirit that we create things that that actually reverberates in patterns on and on and on and on and on and on and we don't know where they go and basically the assertion of the new testament is that well there are principalities and powers are very ancient spirits well do they have consciousness apart from us might be bible would seem to assume they do and basically the wisdom of the bible is act as if they do why well because the ancients have learned that that's a pretty important thing but now you know we give our ancients a seat at the table but our ancients had slaves and you know a lot of other things that we don't do anymore and i think it's a good thing that we don't do them anymore but the spirit of slavery see if i say it that way well where's the spirit of slavery is it in the sweatshop we'd say yeah we still use that word that's slavery is it in that employer who who doesn't listen to you and mistreats the employee is it in the me too movement is the spirit of slavery there yeah it's still there that pattern is still there but now we're patterns and we're perpetuating patterns you go to my last video with my little picture of my son ben we take in these patterns we take in these spirits and we perpetuate the spirits and the spirits live on and they live above us above us in the symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary and and let's give peterson as due peterson keeps wanting to say okay i'm talking scientifically i'm just talking down here that's a pretty smart way to do it as a pastor i say well i'm part of a tradition that says we continue to talk up here and all of those ways that we that we have acted with respect to those spirits that we believe are very old and very ancient and continue to impact us today well we relate to them in in liturgical ways now in my last video i talked about it's time to stop the outbreak what do i mean by that well we got this idea and it was a very smart idea where if we closed one eye we could see the world in a different way and jordan peterson talks about this in his trans liminal videos if you take out consciousness or agents or or those things if you close your eye if you close one eye you can see the world as as jonathan peugeot says and kind of this this imaginary thing up here that sees the world objects objectively and isn't a pattern and and that's a very powerful tool that we used and we used it in the lab but it broke out of the lab sort of like a virus and infected the rest of humanity because we sort of forgot that newton and and many like him were trying to learn about god well what did they mean by god well god was the pattern of patterns and god was the the system of systems that's god number one and and they're trying to love god and god was also conscious and personal and all of those things too and eventually we sort of leave those things behind and we say well let's drop the word god and just say that's the universe because sort of like eric weinstein well the problem with god is that once you imagine he's conscious and looks and listens then you have to worry about what he thinks yeah but what if you stop worrying about what he thinks and you're wrong on that well that's pascal's wager so so the outbreak was a really powerful tool but it sort of infected everyone and and it itself is a pattern this way of thinking to to do this well that's a pattern so now we're going to use this pattern writ large and well how big can you actually have it go well that's the question because it could be that it's a pattern that is useful for some things but not for other things but it itself is a pattern and that's the key thing here it itself is a pattern secularism is not blue sky secularism is another pattern and it's a pattern that's waning and it's waning all around the world it's a very useful pattern and and as it wanes probably like just about all these other patterns that are built into the system it won't all go away completely its spirit will remain and its spirit will have aspects that we that we don't know does it spirit have consciousness can you relate to it can you participate in it you can't wield it though you can't really wield school spirit you can participate in it you can you can be that little repeater of the spirit you can add your agency to the spirit and tweak and do other things but the outbreak which says well we can reduce the world by taking out consciousness no Peugeot is right we're patterns looking at patterns and it's time to remember that and we're spirits watching spirits and it's time to remember that too I actually recorded this and missed a bunch of it didn't hit record anyway spirits are pattern initiators as well as patterns themselves as well as patterns themselves school spirit is sort of an initiator but a very weak one the school spirit live on beyond the school oh yes what is school spirit dependent upon we're not sure this this really interesting video about quantum fields we used to that well my table is made up of atoms okay it's made up of particles okay and now what happens is that physics is getting weirder and weirder and my my table is made up of fields what do you mean fields well there's it's these fields and and the fields the the fields make the the fields make the particles but but you know this is this is all indistinguishable to us we don't know and and so we discover that physics is weirder than we thought and then we're beginning to discover that we've got patterns inside of us and i've got the rough draft of partnering from my parents and i've got the rough draft of parenting from my parents and i've got the rough draft of citizenship from my country and i've got all of these rough drafts in there and and some of them are really simple but some of them are you know peterson keeps using like personalities and they're like little sub-persons and so i've got these sub-persons within me i've got my consciousness congress and i've got all of these patterns i have to move my mic a little bit i'm starting to peek i've got all these patterns that are going on inside of me and and so and so is there is there someone under there that's really acting and sam harris says no and brett weinstein says yes and i say yes and well if if that's true inside of me then how about these other spirits these other patterns that are up there and where are they and and again you you have to say you don't know and how about very old patterns and very during patterns and these are sort of like archetypes but archetypes aren't really spirits but but they're they're shaping us and they possess us and they inhabit us and we play them out and they get perpetuated and and on and on and on and on and and now some of you again i i did this conversation on i don't remember how far are we here okay objects are patterns in time space fields and waves create particles patterns are more fundamental than objects this is nest these are nested patterns and now now you might say now this object this object is very important to me again in its arena and it's here on my desk but there are many many of these objects via mass production and they're all over the world and actually the pattern in other respects is far more consequential the pattern of plastic water bottle just one object is nothing but the pattern of plastic water bottle in terms of how it replicates and goes out into the world well that's really that's really fundamental i have to lower my mic a little bit that's really fundamental why because that pattern as it perpetuates and and clings in with other patterns and goes out well that gums up the ocean and maybe doesn't get recycled and and and now instead of getting water from a tap i'm getting water from you know that's that's using energy to truck it and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on it's the patterns it's the objects and and patterns can both take objects into account but also manage diversity within objects while maintaining metaphor between patterns and and so the metaphorical truth yeah but you're just scratching the surface here and in fact you're going to really discover that these metaphorical truths are actually colonizing your little other truths because the metaphorical truths well really we're talking spirits here well now we're sounding weird but you know the spirit of my father lives on in me well how in all the other patterns the spirit of my mother the spirit of my ancestors the spirit and and and not only the biological patterns that are me because what is that what is that unborn child but that's that's the beginning of a pattern that if if allowed to kind of and what is life but a pattern that's able to colonize other patterns and change and i mean we have terrible time defining life but it's a it's fundamentally a pattern much more than a thing and that's the point here that's the transition we're making that this this this world of objects where we started out is is increasingly a less reliable way to talk about the world form for action is better but spirits what do you mean by spirits well they're patterns well well where do they reside well where isn't probably the first question you should ask when is bigger than where and what the patterns are really that's really the fundamental thing what are the patterns not when not where but the patterns because the spirits get perpetuated and that's the point that jordan peterson was making again and again and again these archetypes because archetypes are patterns but they're just certain patterns and but i can embody a whole variety of archetypes i embody an archetype in multiple archetypes well you may say well isn't that the object that is you no no no i'm far more pattern than object because i've been making this for three years and i've lost hair and you know my body has aged and in those years and changed and jordan peterson is much more pattern than object you are much more pattern than object and spirit well spirit is what happens collectively and spirit is how the collective gets into us and what we manifest and out and so yeah you know it's time to get beyond the objects so then what is truth well correspondence of objects especially in history is too is way too low resolution it's because the objects are subservient to the the particles which are subservient to the fields and and it's the and it's the patterns and the spirits that are actually moving form for action is more powerful than a world of objects but the spirits well that's the spirits well that's really what we're talking about oh pastor you're you're scaring me now oh yeah maybe you should be scared because but you know even from below which is where jordan peterson was trying to point to that was his point what is sacrifice what is that pattern what is the pattern of sacrifice we use it for you know an altar and a fire and a child or an animal and and so the representation and actually brett in in those conversations will say sam well you should have kind of finished it off by saying yeah well what happens in christianity is that we have the representation of the child sacrifice and now you're just right into renais gerard you have the representation of the sacrifice so you no longer sacrifice your children in fact the the tribe that is exhibiting or in some ways manifesting the spirit or pattern of that whole tradition is against the sacrifice of other children why well it's built into their system well what you didn't really literally mean sacrifice well please tell me what literal means because the pattern is a far more consequence than the literal stand if this is what you mean by literal the pattern of water bottle is far more consequential than a literal water bottle we should know that by now because patterns spirits inhabit people and they manifest them because remember spirits are patterns spirits are pattern initiators as well as patterns themselves and they they go viral they're mimetic right i mean it's all these words you start putting these things together and the bible doesn't read so strange anymore and so metaphorical truth well the problem is your other truth is more problematic than the metaphorical kind the metaphorical kind is that which is colonizing the other kind of truth and so religion and wisdom are much more about patterns and and and that's exactly right religion is about the relational patterns more than the static options we seek and look to participate in enduring patterns and so then what patterns do we what pattern should we look to the most well the lindy effect again this isn't the same to leap the oldest patterns why the oldest the oldest patterns this again is from john buck's little video it's a good little video you should watch it that which has survived a long time already resistant to changing environments and shall outlive newer competitors what is what is what is brett weinstein and all of his videos in the hopes of doing he sees a competing pattern that he sees as basically colonizing he sees a competing spirit and he wants to stop it so how is he trying to stop it by making videos and and and talking and doing podcasts that's how he's trying to stop the spirit well maybe where should you look probably to older spirits well so if older spirits are more enduring then you would probably want the oldest spirit you would probably want not just little spirits in the midst who are sort of running around but you would probably want the spirit that is both arenic and agentic well where do we find that spirit where do we find that spirit because well the hebra's were onto something if your gods like zeus and thor are running around in the meta divine realm and are subject to the rules of the meta divine realm in some ways the meta divine realm the spirit and patterns of the meta divine realm that are sub that to which thor and zeus are subject to well they're more powerful so what if we in him we live and move and have our being what if at the creation of the world what if what if the patterns are so very old and what if the patterns are so very old and actually you find life in the patterns and what if the patterns have well already again if you go back to this you find the patterns well it's the abstraction from the patterns well what is the abstraction from the patterns well there are more patterns and what if in fact those more patterns they live far longer than we do well isn't that sort of well isn't that sort of immortality and what if they colonize other people well isn't that sort of power and what if in fact so the boxing day tsunami they have their little story based on their little the spirit there and say the spirit moved the waters okay and now you say well we have tectonic plates and sensors and all of things we are we are more broad we are we have more information than them well good well what are you going to do with that information well your god didn't do so well as compared to the little loco god with respect to that tsunami did they that spirit didn't do as well well what you want is the greater spirit you want the greatest of all spirits you want well now we're knocking on the door of the ontological argument aren't we you say well i i don't know that there's not a super thing there i don't know i know that there's not a super thing there oh do you you don't know that you're just skeptical well let's talk about your skepticism let's talk about let's talk about really why you're skeptical about it because you've been watching the patterns and you think well i can't discern i can't discern a governing pattern beyond it okay but if you're just on that beach and you're not hooked into that one little tribe and their little story of the spirit and then the tide goes out well you march out to get the fish you're just working an old pattern you're not hooked into a bigger pattern well you want to be hooked into the biggest of all patterns well good join the party the biggest the oldest the abstraction where do you start you're probably going to start by looking at very old things and you're not just going to want to think about it because that's just sort of the propositional you're going to want to participate in it you're going to want to learn its procedures you're going to want to relate to it perspectively well how would you do that well you might find yourself relating to it personally why it's one spirit to another you might find yourself finding other people to find a pattern and relate to it in that pattern and well okay so among some people you might lose status if you talk to it so maybe you'll just kind of do it at home quietly in your room so when you pray don't go into the temple to pray but go and do it behind closed doors and ask your father in heaven in secret oh gosh who said those things it's just reasonable people it's just reasonable if you understand what's going on so thanks for watching i did this whole closing a minute ago and wasn't recording um if you're new to the channel there is an audio only version of the channel that's on pod bean and also um apple itunes you can find the podcast version of it there if you want to support the channel subscribe there's subscribe there's um there's a link to donations to my local church you can support me that way there's um patreon there's you know however you want but um yeah i think again i think um bit by bit i'm slowly starting to make sense of this so thanks for thinking along with me
