 you you you you you you you you you you you alright so thank you for coming and if you're watching the video stream on YouTube thanks for joining us now I am taking questions from the bridges of meaning discord server and I don't really have the chat up from the screen from the YouTube stream Rick has the chat up from the YouTube stream and he sort of keeps an eye on it and I was teasing Rick this morning but he's become Jamie it's like look that up Rick look that up and he's he's over in the other room and I have a little window of him I wondered people are starting to congregate in here part of what I'd really like to continue to explore with this tool is to not have question and answer be just well here's a question and then Paul answers it here's a question Paul answers it I'd like to be able to have a little bit more back and forth I think that's the that's the the promise of a platform like this as opposed to just reading questions off of patreon or something like that so there's there's a lot going on right now in the IDW space where Sam Harris released a video a couple of days ago where he basically says he's turning in his IDW card Eric and Brett sort of went after Sam on Twitter over you know all of this stuff over Trump Gad Saad just released a small video where you know is it is it was it satire what what what he was doing so and I just had a conversation with David Fuller that that David put out on his channel I don't know if there's any feedback or input into this question of of sense making of boredom of narrative collapse and you know it's sort of weird watching the IDW fall apart like the the click of Mean Girls in a bad high school movie so before we dive into anything I'm just curious if anybody in the room has anything to say about this I believe that post Trump derangement syndrome is going to be far worse than Trump derangement syndrome because people like Sam Harris are eventually going to have to realize that Trump is not the source of their derangement he's just the focus of it oh that's interesting that's very interesting and the Huber says IDW yawn why why auntie hubris let me let me hear your thoughts maybe he can't talk that's the thing about this a lot of people are at work and so they listen and they might be able to video chat but or text chat I just assumed that IDW got sued by the comic book company and had to disband for that reason Luke says he can talk well what do you think Luke did you hear the question or do you just want to talk the latter okay and anyone else on the IDW spat or maybe that's old news for you and you want me to get the questions I'm surprised that the IDW was I don't know coming apart I thought they were maybe holding together a bit more than they did I don't know if anyone else saw this coming a mile away but well there's a real question as to as to whether they were anything in the first place you know Eric comes up with this name and suddenly I mean it's it's sort of you know how in in in the Bible or in certain traditions you know you have to get the in St. Pentecostals will know this you have to get the name of the spirit before you can exercise it well in some ways you have to name a thing before it it it it Voltron's into a principality and so when when Eric Weinstein names it you know off it goes so I don't know I saw anti-hubris you would unlike your un go ahead anybody so you're saying he's like the Ron Popeil of ideas or something he created the principality when he gave it a name Paul in response I I'm on my phone side I have difficulty unmuting myself the answer to the yawn or their response to the yawn is I'm not convinced as a group or as individuals that there was ever a an alliance if you will that was was a focus I looked at the IDW as sort of a cast of characters and I've had I've had some sort of behind-the-scenes contact with some of the members and and you know it goes towards your decadence comments to it to a degree is although I can disagree with some of your assertions on who is decadent or how that plays out but my my general comment was that I'm not surprised and I I didn't ever sense that that that it ever sort of pulled together enough kind of similar to what is going on with you and and the folks that you know you're having conversations with that that that is not a you know IDW 2.0 or something right and it's cool that you guys are getting together I really enjoy the conversations that you have with with all the gentlemen but my sense is it's not like there's a kind of like a church kind of concept where you're all sort of gathering under under one roof and under one banner so to speak and that's why and particularly like I said when I when I when I saw the the sort of move to decadence if you will the lack of a better word I wasn't surprised okay well would you would you think of something you know obviously a church now churches get interesting for lots of other reasons denominations are sort of distributed but you know daily wire is a I mean daily wire is you know as an organization they have some structure and leadership and cohesion and and and more room for ongoing conversations I really like your distinctions in here I think that's really helpful yeah I would agree at least if nothing else from a monetary standpoint they're sort of under or were under it's kind of unclear as to where they're going but they were under a single umbrella and I never got the the feeling that that was true and that it was almost sort of a miraculous connection with all these guys you know starting with with Peterson and then just sort of branching out and sort of nebulously connecting yeah so yeah yeah and you know in in let's say I can't think of a timeline or probably 2018 you had you know some appearances on Dave Rubin and some of those conversations I thought were you know there was some there was some light to them there was some energy to it but no I really I really appreciate your your comments there anti-hoopers that was really helpful and anyone else on that want to get in before I do anything with any questions I don't know think it was funny how Eric Weinstein was sort of at first pulling people a little unwillingly into the IDW because I don't get the sense Joe Rogan wanted to be there at first huh yeah yeah yeah yeah no that's true sort of a name and a meal go ahead Rogan's an individualist he doesn't like to be put into groups and especially when he's just put into groups without permission hmm hmm yeah yeah oh that's interesting oh Rick you're not muted Rick of all people Rick you're not muted do we want to blow our cover we want to talk about it we want to talk about that your shots fired on universalism article before we start recording oh we are already are already recording my shots fired on universalism well we can maybe get to that later there there are some interesting questions in here so anything else on any of the more recent videos before we um before I launch into some questions all right I will go back over and I think as in terms of going back I'm going to start with the anti-hubris question from 11.6 question for pvk and because you're in the room if you want to um clarify or articulate or something question something has been rolling around in my head relative to the rabbinic system coming to a halt in Christian history despite christ's exhortation to continue it this includes what would become the new testament thought to be scripture so what about modern progressive revelation or lack of it I don't know what you mean by the rabbinical system in your question um the binding and loosening concept okay can you flesh that out for me um so from my understanding and of course we have a resident expert here but my understanding is that if a if a disciple could basically make an argument um to the rabbi uh that would you know diverge from the rabbi's teaching uh that was sufficient that he could be loosed from the binding of the rabbi's teaching on that subject um uh jacob if you if you're available to talk i'd love to hear your initial thoughts on this question because i i just don't really i i don't have a sense of the rabbinical system as such here and because you know what i see and i've said before is that in the first century there's sort of a fork in the road and you know that that especially happens with the destruction of the second temple that some of the processes that started with the destruction of the first temple then continue on but but it continues one of the branches through the jesus disciples and the church and the other branch through the the pharisaic rabbinic tradition i don't know jacob if you have any thoughts on that well i mean there's a lot i could say here i'm i'm not sure i agree with how you're characterizing the the idea of binding and loosing uh personally i mean when you when i heard your question my first thing was you know jesus says um says the the Pharisees seat sit in the seat of of moses i may not be quoting quoting exactly um and uh while they may not live up to the standard they don't you know you still have to listen to them um and i i do believe that christianity personally i believe christianity walked away from at least what jesus was saying there but that has a lot to do with the fact that i mean this is something paul pvk taught me um that jesus seems to be have been much closer to the Pharisees than to the Sadducees and other sects in this in second temple judaism and um for a lot of things you know i've been trying to discover where ideas and many of them come from the other sects uh from Sadducees you know it seems the lots um so yeah there there definitely is a break with the pharisee tradition i would say um there seems to be less of a break in eastern orthodoxy than there was with other forms of christianity especially with roman christianity i would say but um i'm not sure i would agree with your characterization of what the binding and loosening means is your question anti-hubris is your question essentially how can disciples change update refresh deviate from the tradition of their master is that what's beneath your question no it's it's more um i guess put in in raw language are we stuck with with uh the you know the writings of the old test i mean the new testament in other words or can can there be progressive revelation you know through the holy spirit or whatever there are traditions you know the the lds church is a tradition that very much believes in continuing revelation and so you have these prophets and you've got the book of mormon you've got other books that come online so there there definitely are traditions that do that and in terms of christianity i think what they try to do is on one hand the canon is closed but on the other hand when you look at how christians actually live and how churches develop there's a um there's a practice whereby you you continue to modulate and change but you always try to do so in conversation with the canon and what's particularly interesting is if you look at say the orthodox or the roman catholic traditions they do that differently from the protestant traditions the protestant traditions in a sense sort of nailed down the canon and try to put that at the top of the hierarchy but in terms of the epigenetics they kind of turn things on and turn things off whereas the roman catholics and the um and the orthodox with greater attention to church fathers you see sort of a a little bit more openness but they probably wouldn't say it as such and so there there are models that there are there are models that churches adopt to to try to deal with the the reality that we all have to face which is that we live in a world of of change and if you want your religious tradition to continue how do you maintain both the narrative thread and are able to adapt to new situations and conditions that's that's simply a continual human challenge and and so different traditions modulate this in different ways i don't know if that gets at your question at all i i think so but i i guess this really springs out of you know my mulling over uh matthew 18 18 um and so maybe maybe you can unpack your interpretation of of that i'm just pulling up my bible software now uh matthew 18 i know what's roughly in it but verse 18 do you have it do you have it by heart or um okay okay no truly i tell you oh whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna dive into that right now that's um i think that would that would take a while that that that whole that whole thing would be this a good subject for an entire video so um fair enough thanks for your question all right let's let's move on to iron turtle and i see iron turtle is in the room so hey paul i apologize if this question seems a bit basic it doesn't look basic at all to me but i was wondering what your thoughts are were on the accuracy of the following idea stories articulated dramatized or embodied are the patterns of agents or anything personified and the natural sciences are the patterns of the material arena that that's i you know again this is just an off-the-cuff uh hot take but that sounds like a really cool idea um it's sort of god number one and god number two and uh yeah i i like it's i like the formulation so accurate i don't know but just off the top of my head it's interesting and stimulating so i don't know iron turtle if you want to voice in or follow up or anything like that if you can oh can you hear me yep i hear you cool um so i actually have a related question to that um based on a comment that an interesting comment that defuscia made in your last video which was that um he was a rationalist because he was a fundamentalist no it's the other way around well he was a fundamentalist because he was a rationalist well is fundamentalism is rationalism at least it's kind of fundamentalism we have now but go on is rational yeah exactly um and that made me think uh would you say that a big part of peterson's influence was the sort of materialistic or material focused bible interpretation of fundamentalism over and against uh the more spiritual psychological focus i know listening to someone like adam friended who's another youtuber you know adam you know in the conversations i've had with him kept saying paul i really like your stuff but every time you go supernatural you lose me and a lot of the rest of us and so i think a big i think a big part of peterson's traction was that he as he would say again and again and again in the biblical series i'm speaking psychologically so he kept working to do things from below now part of what happened in the modernist fundamentalist split is that the the entire culture or most of the culture was impacted by the change and the fundamentalist rejected the biblical application and interpretation of modernism but implicitly embraced a lot of its assumptions and if that becomes most clear when you look at something like dispensationalism so dispensationalism as a theological tradition grows out of the modernist fundamentalist split and they say something like well all the prophecies in the old testament must be fulfilled but what they didn't see about their assumptions about what fulfillment looks like is very much a world of objects correlation assumption of truth and that then bleeds into this entire tradition of interpreting the bible what people love to say literalistically what it really is is a sort of concordism with a certain approach to how we view the world and that's why that's part of the reason fundamentalism and it's part of the reason people are continuing to deconstruct because that's a continual working through of it and it's part of so when peterson just basically goes whole hog mythological and says you know and it was really i thought quite balanced he said on one hand i'm not going to talk about the you know how this maps on to modernistic conceptions of history i'm just going to leave that to the side i'm not going to say yes or no when we see tom holland saying i'm leaning into the story and i'm leaving the modernistic conception of history over to the side they're basically making the same move and it's because you know lewis and miracles really helped me with this that a fork happened in our philosophical assumptions after the text was written and so when we try to sort of backtrack and you hit that fork you you can't sort of go back into i mean it's really hard for us and barfield is so helpful here it's really hard for us to think about wind and spirit as the same thing in the same way that the biblical authors did and and for example if if you read to knock which is this i'd be curious to know what jacob thinks of to knock but is this this jewish translation of the hebrew scriptures into english that's a really fun translation of the bible to keep at hand because you will if you put that next to let's say an ivy or an esv or even a king james what will become clear are how the christians read back onto the hebrew scriptures many of their conceptions in the new testament now and people complain about that but that's exactly what a that's exactly how a a basically a new testament or in a sense a confessional document works what jesus does in the sermon on the mount in many places and jacob is is particularly sensitive to this because he unlike many of us who have had so many layers of christian theology built onto our reading of the text jesus is reinterpreting the the text he's in conversation with the text and that's there's a lot of nuance and sensitivity in there now the entire new testament and the apostle paul which of course annoys jacob and the apostle paul does this too every preacher does this every reader of the bible does this but when we're trying to read back and we get to a change in the culture that has so fundamentally shaped us generations ago that we're not aware of and only someone like owen barfield pops up and says well you know when you read genesis 1 and the wind is blowing over the waters yes that's that's the text but you read a christian bible and it says the spirit and then you have a capital s on spirit by the editors of the of the of the english text well we're we're framing that conversation in a certain frame now the beginning of the prologue of the gospel john does exactly that you know the logos in the beginning was the logos and and and so all of these ideas are coming together and that's part of the project but this is this is the struggle we have when we read a text that i cannot read that i cannot read that text like a sixth century hebru scribe nor a first century jewish christian nor even a 12th century french scholar and that that you know in a sense that then makes people extremely nervous because they quite rightly have some questions about well how well can i engage in the text and with the text and this is sort of where i think john calvin john calvin steps in and says you can only engage with the text via the help of the holy spirit well what does that mean well that's there's a there's a lot that's poured into that and but but i really like your i really like your comment there you know stories articulated dramatized embodied are the patterns of agents yeah yeah and and and and there you know as as peugeot says we're patterns seeing patterns and so story is a very deep pattern with us and and that's why even though i see some people saying well we want to get beyond you know telic readings and understandings good luck i don't think yeah most of us just simply aren't going to do it story is our language so and the natural sciences are patterns of the material arena but here's the thing how it just gets enormously complex very quickly because as louis makes quite clear in miracles this whole conception of material versus theoretical or material versus spiritual that's after the fork and that's exactly what barfield points to so can you really rethink it well we probably can't well where does that leave us so that's but and i would say it doesn't leave us divorced and fatherless paul what do you think of of the idea that part of fundamentalism necessarily resulting in rationalism is its encyclopedic understanding of revelation well again fundamentalism is a product of rationalism what do you mean by its encyclopedic understanding of revelation i mean the idea that it views revelation as primarily metaphysical and ethical in character with implications for god as opposed to a revelation of god which has implications for how you see metaphysics and that i'd have to think more about that duality there so i don't know it's it's it's interesting but i don't know i can yeah i mean i'm not gonna lie that i kind of see you as in danger of drifting towards the biblisist fundamentalist side of that or that ditch on that side of the road i guess yeah well yeah that's an interesting comment i'll have to think about that because a lot of people see me as in danger of drifting the other way so you know we we are we are we are all you know let's give the post-modernists their due we are all in danger of being prisoners to our contexts but yeah um we are also to a degree open you know there's potential in future so these are hard things all right grim grizz oh i i had a great conversation with grim grizz i i usually prioritize my monologue videos over the conversation videos in terms of when i post them a lot depends on on how time critical the the conversation videos are but boy grim grizz and i we had fun that was a fun guy i i really enjoyed that so um he is a he is a and it's so much nicer seeing someone on video and and again even better than video is in person but um i really enjoyed my conversation with grim so so considering your school spirit answer to last week's question and see this is where this is where community you know um leslie new begin had this statement the you know the the church is the hermeneutic basically the church is the hermeneutic of scripture what does that mean it's it's in it's an embodied real life local community that becomes the interpretive framework for this text and so even just after my conversation with um grim grizz i i now read this question differently than i would have read it last week because we've had you know a little over an hour of conversation and my vision of him is just richer probably you know more accurate and in some ways less because i've had to project my own biases on him but um again for me this is why this is this is why you form communities this is why you spend time together this is why you you know this is why you you share memes and you watch videos and you laugh and you you you try to you try to and we're all limited in this because we're limited in time and space but you try to much more get a much broader picture of each other and okay considering your school spirit answer to last week question does the cremation of care at bohemian grove work a follow-up question about the ocd blast blaspheme becomes what are some things your denomination would consider as blasphemy against the holy spirit versus what they would not now to get to get to cw and see this is yeah this is a big kid this is growing into a big community and that makes this hard because i'd really love more if i knew cw better i'd know what his question was basically and that would get into this because the christian reform church is a the christian reform church was born these issues in the modernist fundamentalist split that really came to the fore at the end of the 19th century were very much in play all the way back to the 18th and 17th centuries okay and they've continued to roll and develop and so the christian reform church has a literalistic element in it a fundamentalistic element in it and a less so but the majority of the christian reform church tends towards conservatism and as the crc continues to be in the cultural waters in north america and it is slowly assimilating into the broader church environment it is continuing to be more aligned with evangelicalism and some fundamentalisms than the main line much to the consternation of some in the crc hierarchy that really want to see the crc sort of follow the main line but there it's in in my opinion those in the crc hierarchy that want to see the crc follow let's say the pc usa it's it's just not going to happen because the pc usa and the main line are just evaporating and disintegrating so quickly that you know there's there's much more vitality in the evangelical side of the church than in the main line side of the church so blasphemy about the holy spirit in that light would tend to be oh who was who oh yeah that was grim that that conversation um blasphemy about the holy against the holy spirit would be seen by many people in fairly literalistic terms to have said bad things about the holy spirit that um literalistically i think for many people whereas you know from my father who you know people would come to him some people with ocd because he also ministered in a place of a lot of mental illness you know oh pastor i did this and my father would say well the truth is i think if you're actually anxious about it you probably haven't done it because my understanding of that my interpretation of that passage is much more along the lines of a continued resistant to the to the work of god to to woo you now we're playing on that word in two ways so i think that's how the the denomination probably similarly to many baptists and other other evangelicals in the united states is your personal take in line with the denomination i well i think most pastors even evangelical pastors would not evangelicalism is sort of a moderation between fundamentalism and the main line at least neo-evangelicalism in terms of the the the school that got started with christianity today and billy graham and fuller theological seminary and wheaton and you know some of these some of these evangelical stakeholders i wouldn't be surprised if most pastors evangelical pastors would answer similarly i was baptized in an apostolic truth church and never received the holy spirit which i had been caught which had been which i had been calling the juice because i hadn't got to the unforg the unforgivable sin part of the bible yet yeah and actually on sunday rick and i usually do a little post mortem on the recording of the sunday service and then sometimes we'll we'll flip through youtube and look at other preachers that are on youtube and of course the algorithm is dishing us up bigger you know bigger guys and so rick and i have a lot of fun watching other preachers on sunday after church and uh one one of the one of the guys was just going on about if you haven't received the holy spirit you're not a christian and just hitting that thing hard and uh i i don't think it's biblical and um i think the the holy spirit the holy spirit works and and the the sign of tongues that pentecostalism in some traditions really nailed to this is the external manifestation of it many traditions have had similar ideas again i grew up in paterson new jersey which has always been an immigrant town and next door to me in paterson there was most of the houses on my street were like these two-story row houses one apartment upstairs and apartment downstairs there are these this huddle of dutch sisters whose father had been a sea captain and only one of the daughters had been married and three of the other daughters never married and they lived there with their elderly mother and they were part of a dutch reformed church that believed that you you can have no you can have no confidence in your salvation unless you have had some kind of definitive experience of the work of the holy spirit in your life that experience was never and not anything next to glossalelia as you'd see in a pentecostal church and so you had you know these women going to this frozen chosen congregation and just waiting for not taking communion not you know never really fully members of the church but waiting for god to somehow break into their world with probably something like what some of you might consider a psychedelic experience or at least a an experience along the lines of one of the great awakenings and yeah so whether it's speaking in tongues or whether it's you know a bolt out of the blue or what it is there's a lot of traditions that have that have worked that angle and i i i don't think i don't think it's the case so my concerns were brushed aside as blasphemy against the holy spirit is when you when it moves in you and you reject it see that's a very phenomenological you know every every time i sin and my conscience um pokes me and i decide to shut my conscience up i would have then in that moment committed the unforgivable sin well i think uh i i i think if you're going to think in literal and in legalistic terms like that then um there's no point in talking about christianity because none of us would measure up and there would also be no point of unforgiveness i mean because let's face it did peter commit the unforgivable sin he who denies me you know you look at what jesus says about denying him and then peter goes and does it not once not twice but three times and that wasn't the end of peters um you know peters issues so i think my father's interpretation of basically a determined resistance to the holy spirit not necessarily but not excluding phenomenological aspects or experiential aspects is a better interpretation i don't know grim you want to say anything about that maybe you can't talk right now well said that's all i got good okay all right all right good well maybe monday i'll i'll release our video unless i do an extra video today that i really want to get out because thank you for the conversation because it was it was awesome and yeah i'm going to release some more i'm going to release some more um some more slots soon the slots always look closed like there's no slots and then i basically look ahead in my calendar and i release them depending on how my week looks in terms of time that i have so all right prophet zacharias and i've had a chance to get to know some of y'all in the discord interesting conversation about this about masons and lodges the other day that was fascinating now that sam harris's trump derangement syndrome has converted him to the church of thank goodness is it safe to say that he see this is the thing about people you know even if you disagree with someone you all are are just the most amazing creatures and your creativity your takes your you know it just it just brings me joy and i might you know like i i got somebody somebody blocked me on twitter for the first time this week which which you know it was just it was just just amazing uh just fun people are people are amazing so anyway now that sam harris's trump derangement syndrome has converted him to the church of thank goodness is it safe to say that he definitely lost the peterson harris debates and how long before he rewrites the calendar and takes a and makes a festival devoted to the supreme goodness well see and this is this is you know this is tom holland's point that christianity has gotten in so deep to the culture it's gotten in so deep to the language that you know in terms of the video today when um you know it was paul anleitner who made the comment on that letter between daniel denett and uh alex rosenberg you know it's we're this is the point earlier we're not going to get rid of storytelling and and conceptualizing in story you know you can you can try to you can write analytical philosophy but nobody's going to read it i mean even if you read some of neil planninga's stuff it's awfully hard sledding and part of the reason or alvin plant to get part of the reason alvin plant ago was so um powerful in conversation was he could also um bring out illustrations and that's what that's what helps us um sam harris it's just so interesting i listened i listened to him and i just think i'm just i don't know it just seems really obtuse about some of his points but i'm sure i'm obtuse about other points too so um oh someone's dropping something we got an open mic there all right so um let's see if the prophet is in the uh is in the room i don't see him so all right the prophet zacharias kind of looks like um joe it's kind of looks like a different prophet of a different tradition but we'll go on uh t for tech paul what do you think about psalm 75 verse 1 specifically the phrase your name is near the difficulty i know peugeot tends to do these things and he does them symbolically if you ask me a question about a specific bible verse i i would really want to start digging into it more than i can really do as just sort of a hot take so i'm gonna psalm 75 1 we praise you god we praise you for your name is near people tell of your wonderful deeds the difficulty is that there's as jacob will tell you there's hebru beneath that text and there's a history of interpretation in that text and there's the way that that text plays off the english around us and so you know this is hopefully post covid i can go back to an adult sunday school class where i get in the room with regular people and just start walking through the bible because i i find that just so much fun because there's just all these layers going on so i'm going to pass on the on the um hot takes on on bible passages okay what is the connection between the garden of eden and mount zionse there's a little bit more of a symbolic question and well think about how they function in the story genesis one i think um i think uh walton is right genesis one is a temple text and in a sense genesis two the garden is if you have a what is a temple a temple is a royal palace and royous royal palace tend to have gardeners and gardens and so it's in a sense the whole world is the lorence footstool and again pidgeot was really good with this kind of stuff mount zion is well what is what is the temple on earth the temple on earth is is a it's a consulate it's a replication of the entire cosmos it's a local manifestation of the temple in the heavens but what is the temple i mean this is why pidgeot's work is so helpful because a modernist sort of one-to-one correspondence idea doesn't really work with these images and how they function okay so the why is the you know why you know people decide i'm going to read the bible they read through genesis oh wow such great stories they start reading exodus wow such amazing stories they get to the they get to sinai and oh here's the law and then very quickly they run into detailed detailed prescriptions about the tabernacle and its furnishings what's with that well obviously it was important why was it important because what you're doing is in a sense constructing it's so hard to put this stuff in our terms constructing the center of the world constructing the control room constructing the the substation you know i remember the you know the the original star trek you know they had the bridge and then they had this other little room down in engineering where you could sort of control the ship by it's kind of the second bridge in some ways that's the temple but so what happens what happens in that and if you look at the way the temple is set up it's extremely deliberate you have the altar you have you know the different courts you have the holy place you have the holy of holies what goes on in each of those places symbolically plays out all over the place and that's how the world works and this is what is so this is what is so hard for us to embody because in some ways it's sort of like the barfieldian spirit and wind being one in the same because we don't think in these terms and and what happens with religious communities is we still continue to sort of operate in these terms but we don't know what we're doing we're in some ways like you know when my when i was small my father was about the same size i am he had size 12 shoes mine are a little bigger but i would as a little boy if he'd leave his shoes under a chair in the dining room i would sit in that chair i would put my little feet in his shoes and i would walk around the house what was i doing oh that's something of what we do in church and and and so when we get into when we get into these issues they're really hard for us to embody but so you have the garden you have mount sinai you have the temple in the book of revelation all these things connect and you have jesus relating to the temple jesus goes to the temple and curses the fig tree and again ma you know people will read the bible and say i thought jesus would be a tree hugger why would that that poor that poor fig tree and they're sitting on a wooden chair themselves that some tree had given its all for so that would be a good topic for a video and it's a big topic but my encouragement would be to think some think symbolically in terms of how these things function in the symbolic world of the community the garden of yidn is the royal garden why does the king come for a walk in the cool of the day and and what is the role of the man and the woman in the garden why is it called a garden so and and then mount zion is you know this is where that's why when the temple is destroyed twice when the temple is destroyed it's so cataclysmic for the people and you know why does cyrus want the temple rebuilt and how did the jewish community transition and in a sense transfer the temple into the torah and when you start to dig into this stuff it's powerful i probably haven't helped you at all h bomba so for that i'm sorry but i guess i would like to put you on a path of discovery to look into these things because you're asking the right questions so any follow-up on that from anyone in the room all right good prophet zecharias again why why would paul who knew the scripture so well and defended them infamously and violently decide to switch up if in fact he did not see christ i agree something happened that changed him dramatically and it was experiential and it was catastrophic why would he throw away a cushy well educated pious helenized life to be chased in prison tortured and executed what do you make of saint paul and his reinterpretation of the dearest scriptures in the light of the resurrection you that's exactly what that's exactly what his project is now again it's so interesting listening to jacob's reaction to to paul of tarsus given the response to paul of tarsus by many people in the synagogues that he went to i mean you read the book of axi you know the the pattern is he goes to a town he starts in the synagogue they look at him and they say oh well you know let's hear what you have to say and he starts talking about the resurrection and some people are like uh uh this guy is trouble let's get him out of here um not only let's get him out of here let's kill him um other people are like this is interesting let me hear more and almost the same thing happens when he goes to the areopagus in athens so no your points are well made and i've made those exact same points again and again and again in sermons so all right um post-soviet fear and trembling describes abraham's faith in the context of sacrificing isaac what do you think of soren kirkegaard's act of sacrificing his one true love regina are christians called to sacrifice their highest most noble loves if yes how do we develop strength to do so that's a good question kirkegaard was a weird dude i i read a biography of him a number of years ago and yeah his boy what a weird dude and if you think you meet some weird people in the world or on the discord server weirdness and genius sometimes go together a lot of times it's just weirdness but every now and then you'll meet a genius who's also weird uh the the subset of genius and weird that's sort of what genius does to people um i don't i wouldn't say that christian so dark rider 9876 your your mic is open you might want to mute that um i don't so this is who would be married to a dude like kirkegaard really i i pity the woman that falls in love with that man you're talking to my wife paul well you know she has her cross to bear um this idea though that christian sacrifice their jesus says pick up your cross and follow me okay what's on that cross will it be a romantic love all in almost in almost everyone's life and let me say it this way when i look around at people if i'm going to use the word saint as sort of a uh an advanced level of christianity that's more of a roman catholic way of using it than a protestant way but i think the i think the roman catholics are onto something when i look at the saints among us people who people who to the degree that i know them and see them exhibit remarkable unusual christ-like character and god seems to work around them they're almost always people of suffering they my one my uh my my wife sometimes talks about golden people and these are people for whom everything just works out for them they they're smart they're good looking the jobs open the doors open their marriages go great their children do fine now that that long run of good luck comes to an end in just about everybody's life at some point but as much as i want that for the people that i love and my children i also know that we all must be tested and you know so i look at the apostle paul and you know the the famous thorn in the flesh was it his eyesight was he gay i mean people we all project whatever you know the current angsty bitter spot in our culture is onto people in the bible but i i god refines us with fire and you will not know christianity without knowing the cross and he develops strength in us to do so by bringing hard things into our lives that there is no solution to and usually it's you know it can be a physical disability it can be mental illness it can be someone that you are bound to so i look at i'll use c.s lewis because he's dead in public but you know again my take on lewis via alan jacobs and other biographies that i've read is that you know his mother dies when he's six and he doesn't know why he can't go and be with mom and c.s lewis's father seemed to be a good guy but not terribly emotional and c.s lewis's mother was warm and delightful and brilliant and everything you would want in a mother and young clive staples loved young jacksy loved her and then she's taken from him and his father is just destroyed and doesn't know how to raise these boys and so does what everybody says you're supposed to do sends them to these boarding schools that are that are hellish and jack is a weird egghead nerd who has no aptitude for sports all he wants to do is be left alone and read books and then he gets drafted has to go fight in the first world war and then he's injured and he seems to have a sexual appetite for rough play and those kinds of things and kinky stuff and then he winds up meeting his war buddies mom and stuff happens and well eventually he she moves in with with lewis and warney now lewis's older brother warney is an alcoholic so here's c.s lewis and you know probably had a multi-year relationship with his dead war buddies mom and he becomes a christian what's he supposed to do with her well he kind of takes care of her as if she's her mom in fact tells everyone that she is his mother now again a freudian would have a hey day with this and so he's got an old he's living with an older brother who's an alcoholic and this woman is slowly going you know losing her marbles and he's caring for these people while he becomes an international celebrity christian i mean you just you just look at this guy's life and when i read something like screw tape letters and i look at his insight into human psychology i think he know he he did not learn this through the academic discipline of psychology he learned this the hard way that's how we really learn isn't it if your parent was an alcoholic if you have a sibling who's mentally ill if your if your if your father was abusive just all the all the all the lightweight easy answers of this world go out the window and you learn just how hard the world is and that makes you strong or it can make you bitter and evil and that's where the the antithesis that's part of christianity gets exhibited when you come into the time of testing will it make you a saint or will it make you a devil and the people who live golden lives they're usually kind of in between they can sometimes rise to generosity but but not in the way a saint can so yeah fear and trembling and kirkagard one one suffering weird dude and his weirdness with regina is just all weird it's just really weird but he's he was he was able to turn that into something profound so good for him any any comments or follow-up questions on my answer all right i'll keep going satori pilgrim are we doing for time okay we're doing all right is there a necessity for placeness within religion i think there's i think that's a function of our of how we're made no so my my camera might poop out here rick because it's um i see the overheating sign so just to let you know just to warn you rick and i are perpetual fights against technology where was i okay um as a poet i started to see that meaning was integrally related to language oh wow or is language the reflection of meaning tolkien expanded this with mytho with myth with mytho poea if i'm saying it right so often you read these words you know what they are but you never say them so i began my journey to christianity simply because it is fundamental to english i shouldn't be afraid to say god because it's english anymore that i should feel more comfortable saying ohm because it's sanskrit but if there are origins um but if if there are origins based on place and not based on place what are your thoughts on the perspectival sense of tradition with location or do i confuse myself well that questions i'm not quite sure i fully understand the question and you're not in the room christianity is very interesting on this because if you look at the major world religions in many ways they continue to be placey so jerusalem will will always have a particular importance to judaism i i don't see how that's going to be avoided christianity if you look at sort of the center of mass of its people travels around the world and it's it's right now in africa that's a strange thing but we as individuals are deeply tied to place and i think it's part of the resurrection so and protestants are particularly bad with this because protestants so so peugeot is exactly right about you know christianity is this meeting of heaven and earth that's the incarnation and if we get on to the ascendant enlightened ascendant master question we'll have to go there but protestantism in terms of the spectrum is a little bit less placey than let's say catholicism or orthodoxy the more sacramentalish traditions and so i don't know i don't know it's a good question and uh would be fruit for more conversation but that's what i got prophet zacharias in for a third question an interesting theological question has been brewing in the orthodox channel of late if you were if you were to take the entire bible and make it say a netflix series would it not be most accurately portrayed as an american western also would you cast also who would you cast were you um the director in various roles the the the anthology um will contain all the books in the um the bibles see i have i i gotta be careful with this because you know there's the jesus movie out there and i don't want to i don't want to rain on that parade too much but i have a real it's a it's a very modernish thing to try and make a jesus movie as such to put everybody in bathrobes and you know i in some ways i have more respect for the christmas pageant with the bathrobes and i remember one year we had this in my church and maybe i'll pull out a picture of that they made these crowns which were these construction paper and then they used elmer's glue and pasted like candies on the crown and in the middle of the pageant the candies were dropping off um you know some of you who grew up in church know these these kinds of things when we try to make a movie of jesus in this literalistic way we're sort of missing a point and i'm not saying it's wrong to make the attempt and i'm not saying there isn't something that could be learned from the attempt but it just triggers in us all sorts of some of the stumbling blocks that modernity has on nbc someone once started a a series what was it called it was called kings and the actor who played like the real baddie i really like that actor was sol he was so good as sol and you know there was a young good looking dude as david and it was set in sort of a contemporary period boy i was loving that show and they cancelled that sucker didn't even get out of first season because i i think in many ways if you want to portray and represent the bible just admit that you're rewriting it and own own the decisions you're making in a sense if you try to make it into a literalistic netflix series you're going to be smuggling in all sorts of our stuff that you're sort of covering up with the bath robes and the bible storybook picture tropes and etc etc so my preferred take would be do something much more imaginative with the stories and in that way really own the decision the interpretive decisions you're making because as as we've seen in how many movie interpretations of books including the lord of the rings which is a movie series the hobbit the hobbit got very decadent but you know there are some there are some good things in the lord of the rings i'm really curious what amazon is going to do with that i'm really nervous about it but so yeah i you you can't the biblical text is not it just can't be reduced into a movie like that and when you do and especially if you try and make it you know so then these movie theaters well because then they make a movie and then people are like well they added stuff that wasn't in the bible so then to make matters worse than the movie people are like we're only going to do what's in the bible no you're not no you're not no we're going to study the archaeology really well well now you're into all kinds of the modern conundrums that led jonathan peugeot to basically curse all modern biblical commentaries and and peugeot has a point in that and because the text is the text and now again what i said earlier we have difficulty sort of going back through the text but um yeah yeah yeah i haven't looked i know that some of you guys have been watching uh this this this thing on youtube that i haven't had a chance to watch um and but and again i'm not going to say it's always a bad thing that people shouldn't do it but when you make a when you make a jesus movie and you're pretending like oh if i were there this is what i'd see it's almost as if you've never traveled to another country or learned another culture because when you travel to another country what you very quick really realize is that you have brought yourself and you are not a part of that landscape and if you actually want to engage productively with those people and that realm you are going to need to learn their way of thinking and seeing and talking and moving at least to a degree and that's why go ahead paul is this hypothetical film analogous to what fundamentalists are trying to do in their theology except they confuse it with the documentary yes that's exactly the issue i want to make sure we're on the same page yeah that's exactly the issue and it and it has to go with fundamental biblistic readings of the bible it's it's and it and and pete this makes and see i want to be very careful with this because i would rather someone read the bible literalistically and fundamentalist ically than not read it at all because at least they're learning it and and some of the other stuff is actually going to seep in you know they're actually they may actually try to be obedient unlike people who just say well it's all symbolic and then what they do is they their symbolism is just simply a projection of what they want to do so at least the fundamentalist has in their camp they are taking jesus seriously now that that isn't to say that those who aren't fundamentalists aren't also trying to take jesus seriously i can't say that either but this sort of elitist dismiss you know part of what makes jordan peterson so refreshing was he understood that this elitist dismissal of fundamentalism is a function of their elitism and that's simply a function of certain fundamentalists not understanding some of the issues at play to be an elitist is in a sense to be a sort of a fundamentalist because you're laughing at the fundamentalists for not seeing their issues well if you're an elitist laughing at a fundamentalist you're not seeing your own contextual issues too which is your your place on the hierarchy if if someone at the bottom of the hierarchy is hemmed in by their place in it your place at the top is hemming you in too and that's why we are all prisoners of some context or another maybe we should be generous and patient and forgiving of others bondages as well so i think that's just fairness althais althaus paul you need to learn to be more concise yes in this spirit why won't sargon of a cod go to church because he doesn't see the point part of that is the fault of the church because many in church don't see the point even if they're there part of the problem is the church because the church doesn't know why it's doing what it's doing and sargon is looking at the church and saying i see no value there part of that is sargon part of that is the church the holy spirit changes our hearts well how does the holy spirit change the church the holy spirit changes our hearts well how does the holy spirit do that with just about anything and everything there's concise i can do concise not very well sometimes what are your thoughts on the apocryphal deuterocanonical books of the bible i will just say what the belgian confession says these books are profitable to read and to understand but we hold them at a different level and i think that's a great answer see now everybody's going to curse because i took altice's admonition to heart or maybe you'll be happy all right maybe well any any follow-up on any of these two i'm going to take a drink it's a drinking game rick's drinking too in there diet dr pepper yeah paul i was thinking on how um um you know the korean drama mr sunshine um yes yeah i was thinking on how that was um um of the environment there was it was was really similar to the biblical environment and when i was watching that kind of on your recommendation i was like oh man maybe it's not such a surprise that you know christianity takes off in in korea because you have um you know i mean you have like you have this really intense occupation you have you know the higher higher korean class are just kind of collaborating with whoever they can there's prostitutes and harlots as heroes and and um you know i don't remember the mr sunshine's name but just call him mr sunshine you know he performs this act of self-sacrifice at the end and um yeah and yeah and it was just like oh man it's all there like jesus could have been a korean carpenter in that in that same setting and it and it and it would have it would have transferred right like like the story just transfers right over yeah so yeah yeah so that's some yeah that's something that just that just popped into mind when you were when you were talking about the westerns you know the koreans gosh the koreans make some good stuff so you know my my daughter you know watches these k dramas and some of them but compared to a lot of the american stuff especially if you want to watch something that's romantic and i'm up yeah the camera just turned off i'll just let it cool down here um gosh some of those some of that korean stuff is beautiful so i i yeah mr sunshine you can find that on netflix uh my one of my favorite korean dramas um but the thing about the korean dramas are they're you know that they're they're they're very archetypal they're rather repetitive you know it's always the wealthy powerful good looking man and the woman who's coming from you know from a lower socioeconomic place often and they they mix it up and they play it off but they they've got some other my what my we were watching this this one show about a goblin now goblin in korea is a very different thing when a goblin here and you know they've got themes of reincarnation they're working through stuff in those shows and um i find them i i would much that they're holding my interest a lot more than a lot of especially a lot of the crap that's coming out in american studios so they're just delightful yeah so yeah yeah yeah i could talk about mr sunshine and what i learned about that in korea for a while but that it probably yeah maybe maybe we'll have to have some k dramas in the and watch parties yeah that'd be fun i like to watch parties they're fun i wish i you know i wish i i wish i had more time to get to know all of you that's and again i i believe in the life of the age to come and okay luke i don't want to talk about universalism but um i i you know i will i will ask god um to include um to include you all because we are we are limited by time and space and i have just so many um things to get to but when we are um yeah very that's a very orthodox request paul yeah yeah yeah i know i've got to have some orthodox in me to keep this crowd going but uh it's one you know i'm a mere christian okay i'll i'll punt to louis all right andrew um andrew wizard 15 maybe people have asked this question before or maybe not but do we influence god yeah that really got when i when i said that that got i think yes we influence god isn't that what prayer is isn't that you know when abraham talks to i mean hezekiah it's all over the bible or does god dumb himself down when talking to humans okay yes he does that too um to give us the illusion of free choice and influence of the future i i i think that's i think that's trying to be too smart why would god fool us i think i think we bring plenty of illusion but see that that whole conceptualization you know god bless aristotle and plato and socrates but there's this christianity is sort of a mixture of the greek and the hebrew but i'll i'll lean towards the hebrew and say you know here here's the problem we can if we would look if my dog if i could think if i could see the world through my dog's eyes how would i look you know i was just talking i'm gonna tell a rick story this morning is brick is it okay if i talk about your dog okay um so i was talking to rick today and rick has a dog and um rick has a good relationship with his dog and his dog rick has a big thing of tennis balls because it gives dog needs a ball so he gives this dog his tennis balls and the dog always chews through the tennis balls but the dog has this weird thing he likes to take the tennis ball he likes to put the tennis ball in a box and then he'll put the tennis ball in a box and then the dog will chew up the box and that's how rick recycles his boxes well the dog put the tennis ball in rick's shoe and then you can guess what happened he starts chewing up the shoe and rick's like oh you dumb dog you know what and and probably from the dog's perspective what does rick look like well first of all rick smells a certain way because the dog relates to rick through that we we are limited to how we can relate to god and so when we kind of put a veneer over and say well god doesn't change and and so we don't influence him all of that when we when we make this move we we sort of try to imagine we're not seeing god through the story the story operating system that we were talking before we think we can kind of do an end around it and how does god reveal himself god god comes to us again and again and again as a relational partner why does he do that well god is certainly and again god is you know god is arenic and agentic god comes to us as a relational partner and says relate to me in this way don't try to i think it's i think there's a degree of of idolatry when we try to outsmart god in the way that sometimes i'm sure rick's dog will try to outsmart rick or if you've ever had a toddler every now and then you'll watch a toddler think they are outsmarting you and you just look at the toddler sometimes you laugh because it's cute sometimes it's no you really can't outsmart me and so i you know what in some ways we're asking the question how can we think about god beyond ourselves well how can you think about anything beyond yourself no matter how much you try to level up you will always be you so i think relate to god as he reveals himself to be related to when abraham prayed to god did god change his mind i see i can't we can't answer these what is it what is the mind of god well we're going to project up the mind of us that's what we're going to do and so whether it's whether it's a a stone walling or a and again what we find in the bible is i mean look at look at how jesus people people get very annoyed with jesus and the syrophoenician woman because the syrophoenician woman comes to jesus and is like you know her daughter's ill come and heal my daughter well it would be wrong to give to dogs what is you know meant for the children what you know jesus didn't understand what he was doing when he was talking to her all of us can do that with each other and well jesus was making a point and you see jesus do this all the time with people and and he invites people to pursue him you know you know jesus come and heal well everything's possible for those who believe i believe help my unbelief you know we're not going to outsmart god just like rick's dog is not going to outsmart rick it's just not going to happen so don't worry about these questions just just just relate to him pursue him argue with him wrestle with him if there's anything we can learn from the scripture is god wants to be related to and he is open to us he is waiting for us he is the the father of the prodigal son looking down the road waiting for that idiot to come home even for bad reasons that's who jesus portrays but he's you know and sometimes when we play games with him he will be like a parent saying okay you're playing games i know but i don't care because i want you at the feast other times he'll look at us and say you're playing games and you better stop it because it's pretty disrespectful so how do we understand god's sovereignty it just is and free will we we have will i mean it's sort of like it's sort of like sam harris and his dilemma over free will sam harris is just a just an out and out compatibilist and denying that there's a problem well don't worry about the problem just relate to him rick is sovereign over his dog and you know rick rolls his eyes like sometimes i'm not i had a i had a i had a debate with my brother recently about free will after listening to an overconfident preacher preach about his salvation model and catholic's wrong salvation model salvation is of the lord and and god is going to save how who when and where he chooses and it is it is both true that this this is all on god's part and it's true that you know he is waiting for us to come home both of those things are true and we said well how can both of those things be true well we can see those how both of those things can be true in our own human relationships at smaller scale and i think that's the reason that they're always phrased in those kinds of terms for us we're invited to live into that and so i would say if we're if we're sitting there just like we're worrying about having committed the unforgivable sin we're sitting here worrying about whether or not god has elected us before the foundations of the world we're trying to be too smart just listen to him and go to him and pray to him and and and start in the relational journey with him i don't know cw's am i becoming a biblisist you were there the whole time okay any any comments at andrew i don't want to be dismissive of your questions because these are important pastoral questions that we deal with often and my answer to them is don't worry let god be god and approach him as a son approaches a father or a wife approaches her husband notice what i did there approach him as jesus invites us to and with all sorts of fear and trembling approach him as with the specific the specific pleasures of the inferior as lewis calls it and and and let god worry about all that other stuff paul i have a kind of a follow-up on this okay it seems to me that it's kind of a question about the sort of maybe god's will in a way and one of the things that i think i found in the bible is that we're to pray for god's will to happen here on earth as it is in heaven but that sort of implies that his will is not happening all the time and so in that case how is it that god could know the whole future know everything that was going to happen before creation even occurred and yet have a will contrary to the way everything was ordained to happen and and that question of that that's really the big question i think i can turn my camera on again rick um that that's really the big question why why is the world why is the world the way it is that's that's the big question that's the great puzzle and in some ways we don't get beyond the book of job which the answer is are you going to figure it out and i do think it kind of comes up with some dangerous philosophies though for some people who have this idea that if everything is the will of god or like all things you're going to work out for my good and all this kind of other i feel like new age kind of got into that a little bit and so people think you know people can get trapped into this everything has been written and therefore it's god's will and therefore it's good and i think that can be kind of dangerous and for me i i felt like my belief on this um which is more of an open theist god doesn't know the whole future in its entirety but rather has ordained certain things to happen in the future that he will make happen but for me it's kind of this goes back to the influencing of god with prayer it's like my prayer life took off a lot more when i felt like i was partaking in the story and that it was having an influence and like you say maybe we just don't care it could be a compatibilist he knows the future but at the same time we're part of it and so that was kind of the whole influence connection with influence there's a lot of questions like this that we long to know the answer but then when i think about i look at the options because the these options have been around for a long time and i ask how will this option will this option lead you closer to the model of discipleship that jesus seems to show us and you know i'll critique my own i'll critique my own tradition in this because yeah certain forms of calvinists calvinism have been tremendously deterministic and and some calvinist confessions that i sign on to seem to point that way too but you have to read the canons of dord and the heideberg catechism together and what's so funny i've often found about some of these statements is on one hand they say you know these some of these very deterministic things and then they tell you to repent and believe and pursue and long and trust and all those and it's like well i'm not sure what you meant by determinism but it certainly didn't mean to exclude that and so i i think again i i don't think i don't think god is going to have a sit down and do an essay about what's on the mind of god i think you would just laugh and um just like sometimes you know my my children are now all in their 20s and it's funny because they're old enough to to now sometimes tell me what they think's on my mind and sometimes they're right and that's scary because like oh yeah you're right sometimes i should listen to them because they know an aspect of me better than i know myself but sometimes i listen to them and i just laugh because now you got that totally wrong and and if that's the case amongst each other how on earth will it be with the god that is revealed by the bible so yeah and i i i see people you know it's same way with the universalist question i mean let let let let why don't you like god why don't you why don't you trust god to do what's right and these are important questions so we can wrestle with them but they come after the relationship so hey pvk hey shane i would love to hear some discussion among devout christians about how to properly respect and obey worldly authorities in hard times such as war persecution and holocaust yeah you know it's so funny to me where people were so full of ourselves and then we read paul and peter say the most obedient and submissive things to roman emperors that made donald trump look like a puritan and that often it's the same group it's it's it's sort of you know the one side of the church of i can't i don't like what paul and peter say about submitting to the government and well look at what roman emperors did to paul and peter look at what the roman empire did to jesus and again this is this is a secularism that has infiltrated the church so what would you suggest for basic church culture teaching strategy in these times for people who fear their leaders command to get on the train stay indoors take the medicine do or don't do business and so on what would the criteria be for knowingly doing other than your own leaders want disobedience and deception are common acts of righteousness and daniel continues to pray jesus healing on the sabbath but jesus also said slaves obey your masters and uh peter and paul said that and he accepts the cross that's right what do what criteria do these differences hinge on it's a great question the bible has both romans 14 13 and acts three which is john and peter's disobedience of the religious authorities they're both there well when should you submit and when should you obey you're gonna have to figure that out i can't give one answer to that because the world is complex like that so then okay so how can we as a community let's not say get it right because that's too perfectionistic do better at it well what we're doing right now is part of that process and and what we have within christianity are some some deep traditions of this so the anabaptists are around and i we didn't record the conversation but i had a wonderful conversation with julian a couple of weeks ago and you know julian was one of my first conversations and and i told you and i said one of these days you and i are going to have to have a much bigger talk about his experience with the hutterites the anabaptists embody a certain aspect of of of church-state relationships and that's embedded in a deep some deep some deep commitments about reality in the bible the roman catholics have traditions in this the reformed have traditions in this these are long conversations and i see um here here's a here's a little rule of thumb your approach to this should not diminish your agency what does that mean that means that submission is just as agentic as rebellion and they both should be so what we're doing right now is we're working through these issues and so let's you know let's pay attention and let's learn and let's talk and let's pray and let's do our theology you know was it right for detrick bonhoeffer to plot the killing of adolf hitler that's good question and i think we have to was the was the american revolution against god's will they're good questions the the the american colonists in terms of people in the world did not have it as bad as many other people who wanted to mount revolutions but they did was it a good thing these are such hard questions so um i shane i think the answer to your question is better conversations and you can find better conversations out there and and part of part of i think what each of us should do as christians are both look for sources and people who are doing the conversation right with respect to these things and you know even even in terms of my own church we have tried to balance the needs of the congregation the realities on the ground in terms of um in terms of the physical space the age of our people practices to the degree that we know how the virus is spread and we're all over the map sometimes we'll cancel things and some people like i shouldn't cancel that and sometimes we'll have some things open and people like why you shouldn't have it you shouldn't have that open but we're we're feeling our way through it and we'll probably get some things wrong but this is the process and so christians wrestle with these issues all the time when should we disobey the state and when should when should we comply so it's a great question and i think the answer is better conversations and more prayer more theology more study more of more of what the church is always called to do all right joey hey my question is i wonder if pvk could steel man the position of oh it's from leaf whiz of richard roar and universalism with the pros and cons of that position i haven't i've tried a few times to read a richard roar book there are friends of mine who are real fans of richard roar i have seen other friends of mine become huge richard roar fans and then sort of drop him like a fad i don't know how to answer all that and another for you know john vandonck is is always wanting me to read richard roar because john richard roar was a big part of john vandonck's story i'm going to steel man universalism a little bit i can completely understand why we very much want to believe that god doesn't finally lose because the real setting aside i was thinking about current eternal conscious torment the other day and how why that phrase ology of hell would come up now it has everything to do with where we're at so in other words hell might not be exactly what modernists think it is the real the real the real question i have about let me say eternal perdition is that is it possible for god to not figure out a solution to that which stands against him and if you you look at the question that way annihilationism or some kind of final reconciliation seems more satisfying to a robust imagination of the power of god it's a powerful powerful image is it true part of me wants it to be true but always present in my mind is how dumb i am how little i can know having been kicking around this world some little less than 60 years i can't even keep up with reading someone who should be fairly in my range and my purview like richard rohr how am i going to express my judgment over the management of billions of human lives it's just preposterous let god be god my dog is going to be my dog and i'm at the dog level so yeah universalism i totally understand it i don't know how it necessary i can understand where it can give people some consolation with respect to their loved ones who at least with another frame of reference might not make the cut and that someone's eternal alienation from god would mean my eternal alienation from a loved one yeah i can understand its value there but on one hand i have to take jesus seriously in imbuing this dispensation with a lot of meaning and a lot of importance jesus on one hand expresses a generosity that we think is irresponsible on the other hand expresses an urgency and i have to take both the generosity and the urgency very seriously and so i try to do that that's that's within my purview that's on my plate but the eternal management of billions of human lives i i'm i'm struggling just to manage this this one that i'm living right now so okay tldr how is jesus christ essentially not just another enlightened master like much in new age eastern rhetoric would imply and now i'll read the the longer form because i think it's helpful for understanding i'm having trouble finding arguments for jesus being an exclusive realm being in an exclusive realm of his own everything that makes him fundamentally different than any other enlightened guru like say the buddha and thus makes me unable to see why in particular i should follow jesus specifically i could see how jesus i could see how jesus could have or had the highest potency in terms of his connection to god consciousness of any master ever and i could see how in somewhat eastern karmic rhetoric that he was that he was set in the world to have the perfect context what would allow him to make the choices that would give him his constant potency i can see how jesus could be the superman the spiritual master above them all it is hypothetically true that the enlightened master is both man and god and is acting as a human and of god's will but does that mean that when christ comes back and that it's not jesus christ but could be any person that found themselves with the same spiritual mastery making his will the will of god i've had a hard time finding any explanations on this topic to explain what makes jesus more exclusive and unbeatable versus any other spiritual master that aligns himself hypothetically perfectly with god's will okay there's a lot here the thing that is always difficult for us to see is the frame we are using to see deep assumptions and commitments about the structure of reality when i read this note i it is embedded in a structure about what human beings are and the kind of context in which we work it is highly democratic it is highly meritocratic now someone coming from another time and place who might note the meritocracy and the democracy would say oh it's meritocratic and democratic because you are embedded in a meritocratic democratic context and that is the value that everyone around you is reinforcing i would again recommend c.s lewis's work on this because c.s lewis before he became a christian became a theist and he as he was working through the various options on the menu he really wrestled with should he be hindu or should he be christian and there's a quote from there's a quote about this in sheldon vinochans a severe mercy which is a good book to read just on its own and and lewis had to sort of work through these things and the answer to lewis is that the structure of the universe is different than the one asserted here the to to to sort of cut to the chase because we don't have a lot of time this this is this when i read this it's basically assuming let's let's call it the the common pantheist pagan frame of a meta divine realm in which there are there are beings who can level up and in that context jesus then is simply a being who has leveled up and for us to be jesus we can level up like jesus now there is a lot in the new testament that talks about us in a sense leveling up via the spirit of god and so i can very much understand why people read these two things and see patterns and find commonalities but the framing is different and i would i would point to c.s lewis as you can find it in the c.s lewis doodles channel on youtube the grand miracle because jesus doesn't give us tools to save ourselves jesus saves us that's fundamental in the story this we find offensive and but now having said that jesus saving us doesn't remove our agency and i think this is where we get into the active passive and middle voice so the the answer the answer to your question is we're looking at two different framings of the universe and how the universe is constructed and what the universe is and that's why jesus plays a different role in the one framing and why i completely understand why for example once and actually jesus probably got into india you know perhaps by thomas the apostle that's the tradition jesus was seen in that light because if you see the frame if you're looking through the frame and you see jesus he makes most sense in that light but the question is which frame is true so i don't know if that's a helpful answer or not it's a big question but that's part of the reason and and and similar similar frames were available in you know throughout especially in the east in the orthodox areas where orthodoxy was was going those frames were available in a sense gnosticism presented a similar frame and and christianity might seem to fudge at this because we become like him greater things you know you'll do greater things but jesus is sort of this and this gets into you know is is our salvation a divinization of us depends what you mean so that's in terms of if you want to continue to work on this question i'll frame it that way if you want to continue to work on this question look at the frame and it's within that frame that jesus acts to to understand why it has taken the shape that it has it's about the best i could do if i can jump in there so if it's if there's an implicit question of framing as you said in this question and then the question becomes which frame is true is how does one approach answering that question or or litigating between truth claims the same way we work through all of this i mean we keep working at it we listen to people we evaluate and and it's not just don't just look at the theoretical look at the embodied and the actual because in a sense what we see in religious traditions are these massive experiments of frame because the the deep commitments of the frame will manifest themselves in the actual lives of the and civilizations of the followers so so so how do you escape the trap of choosing your frame based on what is most perhaps aesthetically pleasing or even functionally effective as you look at those results right the same way we the same way we work on all the traps because we're always facing traps and so we um you know we we we just keep doing this work that we always keep doing we keep thinking and we keep looking and keep watching and we keep trying to to understand that we're situated and not yet imagine that we have to desituate ourselves too radically i mean it's it's it's it's what we're always doing and and we just have to keep doing it and and for me again as a as a Calvinist that that tends to accentuate God's sovereignty my my Calvinism in some ways sort of affords me what it seems the universalism of some of you affords which is that um i leave things to God because i can't go that's that you can be a happy warrior yeah yeah exactly so you know hammer keep working at the issues keep at you're asking great questions keep asking them pursue them drive after them um test them so ah we're establishing seeing a pattern of um only getting to the questions of not even getting to the questions of today any advice for walking the fine line between getting sucked in the bullshit and being open to others and that's the same answer you just we just keep we just keep doing the work and there are you know how can you how can you tell so so part of what we do is we look for models and we say who is modeling openness well well sometimes openness leads you astray because you need to be open at just the right ways and just the right things you need to be close to other things and so this is this is the project of living that we're all doing and and this is why you know it's fundamentally religious at least for me because it's um we're at we're grappling with the big questions but we're doing it in real time with each other you're still adding questions i can't even finish the ones we have uh let me just any any thoughts on the thinking i'll try to be concise any thoughts on the thinking behind god calling the jews to plant gardens in babalon i don't know much about that talk to talk to talk to jacob um hi paul if you're not already covered this how do you see the application of ian mcgillchrist theories in the modern church yeah um in terms of the mapped territory and unmapped territory this is this is so often you know doctrine we we need both and this is why we have two sides of the brain you need to map territory in order to continue to process the unmapped territory and it's always going back and forth and that's exactly what we're doing with a lot of these conversations i believe his theories are desperately important and were a revelation when i read his book but i have difficulty communicating his ideas to fellow christians sure churches are set up in order to remember things and again i i really have to dig up peterson said it so well in one of the sam harris conversations you you need to be you need to be open to all the right things and not open to the wrong things well what are the right things are the wrong things you have to figure that out and the same way in all this is techne a bridge of meaning oh that's good yes that's concise it is because look at when we techne is revelation and and when you can do something suddenly the the whole world all kinds of other things are revealed by that hi paul i came here to follow um came here following your video response to peugeot and sargon because well i could pretty much copy and paste his religious trajectory as my own here's a lot of you out there harris buddhism jordan peterson rebel wisdom verveke you trying to see if i can get involved in a church community but it um but it like many others seems difficult for me to find a footing yeah and lots who have um it's not so much a question i guess just wanted to give you feedback onto something that's really helpful thanks thanks las laswell for your comment churches churches have been playing around with these things for a very long time some other communities and that's why you know it was it was so much fun it was so i was appreciative when david welcomed me into his little process there and it felt very church like and very not church like um and this is sort of where the estuary conversation comes in church church insularity is both necessary and a problem just almost everything in the world is so figuring out how to get those mixes right so welcome welcome and i'm glad you're here hi paul it was under the impression that that you had read persig um or pistig of sophia nope what are the mysteries he taught his disciples after he resurrected onto the mount of olives i don't know i have read the book many times and i've yet to find the center of it all i i pistig of sophia i don't i don't know the book at all i've never heard of it so fascinating um knowledge of wisdom so interesting so thank you all um there's some sorry for the lightning round of the last questions but i appreciate you all gathering here and what we do now is when i tell rick he's going to end the stream and that ends that he's he's getting his hands warm ready to go and then we sort of have the afterparty where we hang out and uh i shut up and i get to listen to you all and then usually i'll go over and rick and i will do our our our post mortem on the recording of this thing too and we usually have it on and we listen together and um then rick sometimes voices me in the in the chat so um so thank you all for coming and okay rick are ready to cease transmission there it is
