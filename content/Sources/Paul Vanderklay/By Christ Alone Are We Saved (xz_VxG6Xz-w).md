 Hi, this is Paul and this is part of my rough draft for Sunday series where I'm working on my sermon before Sunday obviously, that's part of what I do during the week and I walk through it and I sometimes will pause the video in the middle and change slides and Sermon will probably change a little bit between now and Sunday, but this YouTube thing is a chance for me to Kind of work work out some kinks and get some feedback. And so that's how I'm using it Right now I'm in a series on the on the five solas and as I mentioned before here's a nice graphic provided by the Calvin Theological Seminary Forum that did an article on this last spring in anticipation of the October anniversary of the Protestant Reformation and these these solas are these solas are Five observations looking back on the Reformation and in some ways from the perspective of the beginning of the 20th century and then some of them a bit earlier before that and it's important to To remember the context and and in this case in some ways So we did sola scriptura. We did sola fide. We did sola grazia and now we're doing solo Cristo And in some ways this this exercise is Demonstrating some of the significant changes that have happened in the church and the culture since the beginning of the 20th century and basically solo Cristo means by Christ alone are we saved and As I mentioned in in last week's sermon and something that I think a lot about as a preacher I like to bring in the question What do you mean by saved because saved becomes this this code word that's used in certain circles for a specific thing usually hell avoidance or going to heaven and not hell when you die and but the but the word saved in in the Bible and obviously and Regular life for all of us is used a lot more broadly So then natural questions arise saved from what saved how saved when and I think I would probably add to that Saved for what now now Martin Luther this gets particularly germane. I've mentioned this in a number of the sermons Martin Luther's Transformation begins when he's traveling through the woods and a thunderstorm and as the lightning is striking close and he's imagining he's about ready to die and he's fearing for his immortal his Everlasting soul he cries out help me Saint and I will become a monk and the reason he does this is because within that Within that culture within that context Becoming a monk was was one of the surest ways you could ensure That your your soul would go to heaven to be with Christ if and when you died So he he calls out to a saint now this is this is very interesting and important given the Changes that the work of Martin Luther would do in You know creating the Protestant Church, but but also in the Catholic Church and in the and in the culture Stemming from Western European history overall and I did a little bit of research on patron saints because I mean Martin Luther calls to st. Anne and There are you know, there are patron saints for all kinds of stuff I first just listed them on the page here and then realized I have to I have to blow it up because even just beginning at the beginning Adrian of Nicomedia is the patron saint of arms dealers butchers guards and soldiers Agatha is the patron saint of bakers bell makers and nurses Albertus Magnus patron saint of natural scientists Alexander of comana Kate patron saint of charcoal burners And you know on and on Ambrose of Milan beekeepers beggars candle makers on and on I Anastasius the fuller of fullers. Well that makes sense And and on and on we go and now on one hand This is this we can imagine this is kind of a nice system everybody everybody likes to have a hero And so yeah, why not have why not have a hero? But John Calvin says of our minds that that our minds are natural idle Manufacturers and and so very very subtly a a favorite hero can become someone that we trust in instead of or in place of or in addition to or you know in addition to God it can become idolatrous and and so this is part of what the Martin Luther and the reformers were objecting to that that in some ways the the system of patron saints for for many for many in in in terms of their common religion in the medieval medieval Christianity became an overlay and And you can see this in a number of other cultures when Christianity would come in especially polytheistic cultures people wanted lots of gods because they found the one high God kind of distant and hard to relate to so then you add some more gods and Actually Augustine in the city of God really takes this apart when he he starts mocking the Romans for you know You have the god of the door and the god of the door The god of the door hinges and the god of the door locks He's like well how many gods do you need for your door? And that is isn't even the gods of the mantle and and on and on and on and so in many ways the reformers Looking back on Augustine were saying this we've let this creep into our faith and these patron saints Which you know could be you know it might might be a harmless thing now now becomes a stumbling block for the church and and in some ways the same thing held true for the sacraments as as many of you know the the Roman Catholic system had seven sacraments and the and the medieval sacramental system You know basically encompassed all of life you have baptism Reconciliation Eucharist confirmation marriage holy orders ordaining the second and and The reformers looked at this and one of the criteria They had is we only want sacraments that we can find in scripture So they they took the seven down to two, but they also said you know in what ways are these sacraments? Replacing the work of Christ it's one thing for a sacrament to be a sign and a seal But you know it's kind of like saying well Jesus yeah, you're okay you be over there But what I really need is this sacrament and and and the sacrament is what I really need and so in other words the Reformers looked at this and they said well that the the thing and this is so common for us the thing that we can put Our hands on is more real than the thing that it's trying to connect us to or the thing that it's the sign and the seal of Those are those are Protestant Reformation terms reform terms in terms of trying to understand what sacraments are and And so well and so verses like this become the verses like this become the The the proof texts for this idea of only Christ we're not we're not saved by sacraments We're saved by Christ and sacraments are signs and seals We're not we're not saved by Patron saints, you know the saints among us and the saints in history might point us to Christ But but they cannot replace Christ or they don't offer something in addition to Christ in terms of in terms of the saving work Christ does now again when we when I say it that way we have to keep in mind and we have to ask the question Well, what do you mean by saving work saving work from and that very much gets into this passage from John 14 Thomas said to him Lord we do not know where you're going How can we know the way and Jesus answered I am the way the truth and the life No one comes to the Father except through me If you really know me you will know my father as well from now on you do know him and have seen him and this this emphasizes the You know what the book of Colossians says that Jesus is the icon He is the image of the invisible God and this is a point that the gospel of John makes Over and over and over again and this then motivates the Protestant reformers to say we are saved Through Christ alone or we are saved by Christ alone But we still have this word saved haunting us and even when we read this passage Embedded within this text is the assumption that well what saved means is you know Union with God and and this in terms of the history of philosophy will take some incredible turns because the Greeks had been you know having a lot of ideas about this in Platonism and then middle Platonism and and Neoplatonism and and Platinus and and you know this long tradition that that said things like well We are we are emanations from the divine source. And so according to Platonist There's a part in us that is still divine. And so what we must do is get Reconnected with the divine and what's interesting is that if you listen to you know certain Spiritual gurus around the culture you'll hear ideas very much like this these these ideas don't go away They tend to be recycled over and over again and and they're very old ideas and and so what happens in theology in the Christian Church is that the church looks at these ideas and and Sniffs them out and says well, we kind of like some of this idea We don't like that idea and and so even even a text like this, which is from the Bible You might say well, I am the way the truth in the life No one comes to the father except through me So so implicit in this is the goal that we want to get to the father now now this this goal is is very old and and you know, it could simply be assumed by the Audience and the writers of the Gospel of John and it's built in fact on the entire story of the Bible and now those of you who are around living stones and especially those who go to my Sunday school class will know what I'm going about to do here because this is a Genesis 1 representation of creation and and those of you who are Jordan Peterson fans listening to this this is a Phenomenological representation of creation where you have the vault you have the firmament and you have heaven above and you have earth beneath and In fact this this representation continues to be present in our language and in our culture In fact, it's so it's so deeply rooted that if you act ask a child Where is heaven the child will say up and if you ask a child where is hell the child will say down and and these are these are ideas that that continue to be carried along in our culture and You know in many different ways and and this is the the representation that the Bible begins with you have heaven above and you Have earth beneath and then part of what the story is in Genesis 3 is that we are cut off from heaven that Heaven is the source of all good It's the source of all light the Sun is in the heavens the lights are in the heavens and a little bit later we're gonna be talking about the lampstand and the tabernacle but But what has happened in our rebellion is that we are cut off from heaven and so here and earth below We have violence. We have injustice. We have decay We have Chaos we have corruption We have all of these things and the reason we have these things is that we have been cut off from the king and we have cut ourselves off from the king and when you read for example Romans chapter 1 and some of Paul's descriptions of You know life apart from God This is what he's saying we give ourselves over to these things and we are cut off from heaven and this is the sword of our misery now implicit in this is the assumption that that life and well-being and Justice come from heaven down to earth and I like to make that I like to make the illustration that we in California when we look to our weather We always have these weather maps that are looking over the Pacific now notice I've turned this on its side So it's oriented with my with my other drawing because the weather comes from the Pacific into California and this time of year during the winter we're always asking will we get enough rain Will we get enough rain to fill the reservoirs? Will we get enough rain so that we can have water during the dry times? And we're coming out of a multi-year drought We had a wet season last year and so we wonder will we get enough rain this year and so far the years a little Short on rain and so we wonder and where do we look for the future? We look out over the Pacific because that's where the storm fronts come and very much that was the idea in the ancient world of the heavens and this is exactly why you had things like Astrology where folks would look up into the heavens and they would say oh the stars are moving things are coming down to earth And in fact as you well know astrology is by no means Absent from us today now now the Jews Didn't didn't practice this but but the ideas are Latent in the worldview in terms of that life flows from heaven down to earth and and for example when you get to the story of the Tower of Babel in the book of in the book of Genesis that you know the tower is a Technological instrument by which we can bring ourselves up to heaven because if we can get into heaven We are in the control room of planet earth and so therefore in a sense what the Tower of Babel is is the epitome of the rebellion From Genesis 3 where we're cut off and in a sense the Tower of Babel says ha you think you can cut us off So easily we'll get into heaven will get out the source of life will be in charge of the universe Not up We're not going to have you cut off and leave us here with the spoils of earth We want heaven too and and you know really you can find these these ideas replayed and in superhero movies today with with Asgard and Thor and I mean all of this stuff has been rumbling around and in You know in human stories for a very very long time and this of course Makes sense of the altar of sacrifice because you offer your sacrifice on the altar and a pleasant aroma Goes up to heaven and of course the smoke goes right up to heaven and God is pleased God sees the sacrifice or if we look To the prophets the Hebrew prophets sometimes God is displeased with the sacrifice and in fact the first murder in the Bible is Over a sacrifice because God was more pleased with one than he was with the other and that saint sent Cain into a jealous rage so Then when we understand the story of Jesus you have the the crucifixion which is in many ways a type of Sacrifice you have the empty tomb which is resurrection But then you have the ascension which which is often forgotten by us because you know We're not paying attention to these kinds of stories So when Jesus ascends into the clouds He goes into the control room of heaven and earth and that then sets up what he says at the end of the gospel of Matthew All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me and what he simply means by this is I am in heaven Controlling the destiny of the world. I am in heaven where all of this stuff flows down and You see this in the Apostles Creed He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father From there, you know the earth will be judged. This is this is the stock Characterization but for many of us and for people today you look at something like this and say well, what is the heavens? well, the earth is a globe and there's all these globes and we're the third rock from the Sun and And what's very interesting and I've made this point and in previous videos that that pay attention to the fact that all of these representations are designed to communicate a specific aspect of The system and and so they like Genesis 1 are also representations but but what what I think this communicates in to us deep down is is a sense of disbelief in the Genesis 1 representation and and Diskepticism with respect to you know, the ancient way of telling a story because it's like well here We are third rock from the Sun where we're going round and round and you know, there is no heaven in the sky There is no God above and Jesus ascending doesn't doesn't make much sense Unless he's the unless he's the man on the moon and then very much when we get back to this question of how are we saved? well You know, we're saved by you know, we're saved by the police or armed forces or by medical technology or The internet is down in the office and I was gonna put up a row of self-help books And and this is how we imagine we are we are saved. We are saved by human forces We are saved by human technology. We are saved by human effort. We are saved by ourselves But has this idea really left us the one of the most popular movies of all time is Titanic and and the climax of the movie has the has the has Rose looking back over her life Thinking about Jack and she she utters this line. He saved me in every way a person can be saved What did she mean was she was she insincere and you know if you watch the movie well They have this romantic relationship and Jack confronts her on some of her personality things and helps her stand up for herself And these are you know, these are all cultural elements that we value But but but notice the language that that this love that she had way back when saved her in every way a Person can be saved. Well, this is this is the kind of thing We're talking about when we're using this word saved and and you know actually for for many of us There are chains of salvation and people will will will come to me and they'll say, you know I was a you know I was a young kid in a bad neighborhood and you know My parents weren't real good and my home life wasn't real good and I went to school and this one teacher Opened my eyes and set me on a path or or maybe it's your mother and you know My father left home and wasn't very you know wasn't around much But boy my mother my mother raised me and worked hard with me and you know My mother saved me and the trajectory of my whole life is different because of my mother and and if you talk to that Person's mother you'll probably find out that perhaps her mother or perhaps a teacher She had or perhaps a boss she had early in life, you know set them on a path that changed them And now this this chain tends to go both ways though You you have these chains of salvation, but you also have these chains of misery and you see this with things like abuse Some you know, sometimes childhood sexual abuse Someone will be someone will abuse a child and and that the adults who grows up from that child will say that that Abuse set me in a direction that that is horrible and I'm continuing to struggle to overcome it You know human society is this way we live within this long chain and you know as we saw last week that You know that the kinds of things we need to be saved from I need to be you know You maybe you'll help me by helping me change a tire by the side of the road and I'll say yeah You saved me but that is today and and for a big enough savior a scalable enough savior It doesn't need to just save me right now or me today and tomorrow or even me for the trajectory of my life but but also me and my family and my parents and my community and my city and my nation and my world and not just now but all the way going into the future and all the way into the past and then suddenly you get the sense of the size of a savior that That we need and and whereas Rose might say well well Jack saved me well No good for you Rose. He didn't do much for me and and so when we talk about Christ in this way we're talking about him in this cosmic sense And and so for some people this this fills them with joy But for others this this fills them with doubt and skepticism and says well well really well well, I don't feel that And so I want to I want to bring in some some visions from the Bible Because the Bible is is full of these kinds of visions and one of the famous ones is in the book of Daniel chapter 7 in the first king of If you I have a video on the kind of looking at the whole book of Daniel I'm not sure if I put it on my pastor web page or if I put it on my church my personal web on my personal YouTube channel or on my church web channel I'll put it in the comments, but the book of Daniel shifts after chapter 6 and and so we You know you get into chapter 7 and suddenly the book is filled with these visions and boy these visions have caused a lot of a lot of thinking and and imagining and speculating You know throughout the history of the church But in the time of Jesus Daniel chapter 7 was a very important chapter and people saw it as very Integral for their life and the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions passed through his mind As he was lying in bed. He wrote down the substance of his dream. Daniel said in my vision at night I looked and there before me were four winds of heaven churning up the great sea Four great beasts each different from the other came out of the sea and and you Jordan Peterson watchers out there will already be in touch with You know that the cosmic sea the realm of chaos and what comes out of them are beasts And in fact, they're monsters and the book of Daniel they're they're composite beings They're they're not these these whole beings that we see in terms of natural creatures who are in order But they're these composite beings and they're and they're empires and they they ravage the earth and they destroy people and they're violent and they abuse In that sense they're most monsters and these monsters come up out of the sea After that in my vision at night. I looked and there before me was a fourth beast Terrifying and frightening and very powerful it had large iron teeth it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot Whatever it left and you have imagine of of smog the smog the magnificent from from Tolkien's from Tolkien's Hobbit It was different from all the other form of beasts that had 10 horns and it talks about that 10 horn bragging But as I looked thrones were set in place thrones what are thrones chairs chairs Do not belong on a battlefield. Chairs belong in a palace room and and thrones were set in place Thrones communicate authority and and power and competence and dominion and the ancient of days Tuk is sea this is the one older than any than any other than the ancient of days Who is the ancient of days of the days of thrones and thrones? And the Ancient of Days took his seat. This is the one older than any other and wiser and more powerful. His clothing was white as snow and the hair of his head was white like wool. His throne was like blazing fire. And again you connect up with the sun in the sky and the heavens being bright and all of these things. All of this stuff is communicated here in this vision. And its wheels were ablaze. You can connect this with God's throne charioted in the beginning of the book of Ezekiel. A river of fire was flowing coming out from before him. And so, book of Exodus, you know, God is a consuming fire. And who can stand in his presence? Thousands upon thousands attended him. Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was seated and the books were open. There's no battle scene where the Ancient of Days comes down with a sword. There are Psalms that have images like that. But here in this vision, you know, there's no challenging the authority of this one. Then I continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking. I kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire. This is an image of sacrifice, of altars, of purification. The other beasts had been stripped of their authority but were allowed to live a period of time. In other words, he took out the worst of the beasts. And there's no battle scene here. It's not said how he does it. In fact, in some ways that's not even necessary given where he is and who he is and what he is. In my vision at night I looked and there before me was one like a son of man, which is an interesting phrase in Hebrew. It's basically, you know, just a seeming like an ordinary person. But what happens after Daniel 7 is that this son of man phrase and term takes up resonance. And this is a term that Jesus uses of himself when it comes to the Gospels. What's coming with the clouds of heaven? And again, now we've got the connection of the representation of heaven and earth. And obviously clouds are in the firmament and he comes with the clouds. In other words, this regular person comes and he's coming with the clouds of heaven, which are the emblems of power and authority over the earth, the source of power and authority above the earth. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power. All nations and people of every language worshiped him. His dominion was everlasting dominion that will not pass away. And his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed. And this is the vision Daniel gets. And so when Jesus in his ministry appropriates the title son of man and not son of God, obviously his Jewish audience would be keyed into what he was saying. The Roman officials would probably not understand, you know, what was really going on underneath what Jesus was saying. And so then Jesus, I wouldn't say plays a game, but is very well, it's kind of a game in terms of saying, this is who I am, but I want to read, I want to define by my actions what kind of kingdom I actually have. And it will be a kingdom in opposition to the empires. It'll be a kingdom that is an opposition to the chaotic beasts that come out of the great sea that ravage the earth. It will not be an earth ravaging kingdom. It will in fact be a different kind of kingdom. And this is what Jesus plays with throughout the Gospels in using this term son of man, but continually editing and revising what all of the assumptions and expectations of all of his audience who are simply assuming that he will be in a sense a ruler like David. And Jesus comes and says, well, I am from David, but actually David is from me. And my kingdom will be distinct even from that of David, even though I am the fulfillment of David's vision. Now this gets picked up in the Book of Revelation, which is a book that I know scares a lot of people, but there's nothing scary about the book. I, John, your brother and companion in suffering. John is in prison on the island of Patmos. Christians have been suffering. This is part of the assumption of what it means to be a Christian. As a Christian, you will suffer. A companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus. Patient endurance is the ability to suffer for a long time and not lose hope and to continue to carry on and not give up was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. Talking about Jesus is what had landed him there. On the Lord's Day, that would be a Sunday, because that's the day that Jesus rose. On the Lord's Day, I was in the Spirit and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet. And I love the images here because the Book of Revelation loves to take two things and put them together, two things that can't be put together. A loud voice, well, I have a loud voice, but a loud voice that sounded like a trumpet. Well, what quality of trumpet might this loud voice have? Well, the loud voice will have the kind of sense that no one can not hear it. I have a son that plays the French horn, and so he practices at home and boy, when he practices, he's a good French horn player, but that instrument is loud and the dog howls and his other brother locks himself in his bedroom and covers his ears because this voice is like a trumpet. It's like a horn. You cannot close your ears to it. Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me, and again, the Book of Revelation does this all the time with the words. I turned around to, we would think, to see the person. No, I want to see the voice. And right away we're left to wonder, a voice? But is there a person to I do it? And then I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man. I forgot to turn off the phone. And these seven lampstands, now, those of you who saw my piece on John Walton and then the one after it on the temple in Genesis 1, you'll know that these lampstands in the Holy Place actually represent the seven lights. Well, what are the seven lights? This word that's used both of the lampstand and of the lights in Genesis 1, these are phenomenologically for the Hebrews, the five visible planets in the sun and the moon. In Genesis 1, these are called lights. And then the lampstand in the Holy Place, the Holy of Holies being kind of the holiest sanctuary of God, and the Holy Place representing the heavens, well, you have the seven lights in the heavens. And so here is Jesus, and he's with the seven golden lampstands. And among the lampstands was someone like a son of man. This is right from Daniel 7. Dressed in a robe, reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. Now, all of this, all of this communicates power and royalty. The hair on his head was white like snow, white like wool. Does this sound familiar? As white as snow and his eyes like blazing fire, his feet like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice like the sound of rushing waters. Well, I thought it was a trumpet. Yeah, it was a trumpet, but it's also like rushing waters. This is a vision and the, you know, like dreams, the elements of this vision can mean multiple things at the same time. It doesn't work literally, but this is what visions and dreams are like. In his right hand, he held seven stars. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means the same thing as Matthew. All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to him. He controls our destiny. He controls what happens in this world. He is supreme in all of it. In his right hand, he held seven stars and coming out of his mouth was a sharp double edged sword, which was the, you know, which was the weapon of the day. His, you know, we might even have nukes coming out of his mouth. Well, nukes are a little indiscriminate in their destruction, but the point is that, you know, he's, it's the power of life and death is connected with his what? His tongue, his mouth. And now, now we're connecting with the ancient of days who spoke, you know, creation into being, the one who had words and this is in contrast to the boastful horn from Daniel seven. His face was like the sun shining and it's in all of its brilliance. This is the source of light. It's the source of life and we can't even look at it. When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. And then he placed his right hand on me and said, Do not be afraid. And whenever I read these things, I laugh because it's like, well, how can he not be afraid? But this is exactly again, the way the book of Revelation speaks. On one hand, this being holds everything in his hand. He holds all of the events in the world. He holds life and death. He has everything and of course, anyone with that power and that much consequence in him, we are utterly and rightfully terrified of. And then he stops and says, Don't be afraid. What can that mean? It can only mean the one with all power is also all good and all for us. I am the first and the last. He's the ancient of days. I am the living one. I was dead and now look, I am alive forever and ever and I hold the keys of death and Hades. Write therefore what you have seen. What is now and what will take place later. The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this. The seven stars are angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. And all of these images like a voice that is trumpet and rushing water all comes together. By Christ alone, we are saved and it's a Christ that is this big. And so we have to look at ourselves, our little selves and we should probably ask each other, What is your plan? What is your plan for saving yourself? Well, I just saw an article this week that one sixth of all millennials, this generation that we keep hearing is hapless and can't get jobs and can't stay focused. Well, one sixth of all of them has $100,000 in the bank while they're young. And it's like, well, there's your plan. And the article went on to point out that many of them have a savings plan unlike their boomers and Xers that are older than them. And you think, well, there's your plan. You're going to save a lot of money. Well, what's that plan really going to do for you? Are you going to be able to live throughout all that money? Yeah, I understand how not having that money can make you miserable and become a problem. But will really having that money keep you safe? Can you imagine you can save yourself? Can science or the government or the military save you from everything? Half the time we don't even really know what it is we need to be saved from. And we spend our whole life worrying about this. You know, it's kind of like the person who they exercise and they eat right and they take all of the nutrients and all of the supplements and they eat all of the right foods and none of the wrong foods. And then they cross the street and get hit by a car. And this is what this world is like. And what I think the Bible would like to tell us here is that you need a savior larger than the cosmos. You need a savior larger than your life. And you need one who holds the keys of life and death. And notice he holds the keys of death and Hades, which means he holds the keys of this life and the next. You need a savior loving enough to care about insignificant you. And this is where we get the sense of Jesus shows up in all of his glory and John, like Daniel, you know, just basically hits the ground and just doesn't want to exist anymore in that moment. And the face of all that beauty and glory and brilliance. And then the word comes, don't be afraid. And you begin to have this sense of, well, what is the best kind of friend that you could have? Now, you might think that, well, you know, wouldn't it be great if one of my heroes, you know, bigger, you know, maybe someone who lives today, it might be a sports hero or it might be a brilliant person or it might be a terribly moral person who has done wonderful things for humanity by what they've done. Maybe a person like that could be my friend. Think bigger. Well, what about what about a person? See, that's why I do this. I get ideas when I when I talk and then I can put them into the sermon. The greatest friend that you can imagine. You might think a sports hero would be a great friend or, you know, the president of the United States or a movie actor or, you know, again, a moral hero in your community. And I would say, think bigger. And then you get this vision of Jesus where he's glorious and powerful and beautiful and terrible and all of that at once. And then he this this voice that was that was trumpets and rushing waters. And he comes down to you and whispers, don't be afraid. And you think, well, this is the it's kind of like the ontological argument of friendship. This is the greatest all friend, greatest of all friends that I could imagine. This is the kind of friend I want. This is the kind of friend that can save not just me right now, but but me going into the future and and me in the past. And this is the kind of friend that can make all the sad things of history come undone. And this man with the clouds has been given an eternal kingdom. And so then we have to ask the question, well, if this is the case, if this is true, or even if this is potentially true or possibly true, how should you best spend your life? What is most worthwhile doing? What should you fear? And what should you not fear? Well, Jesus says a number of times, you know, they don't don't don't don't fear too much. The authorities. Yeah, you know, there's always going to be authorities and there's always going to be corruption. And, you know, there's always going to be there's always always going to be stuff that threatens your life. Look bigger. You know, who should you fear? Don't don't just fear the ones that can, you know, muck up your life. Fear the ones that can muck up your eternity. And then you have to ask the question then when well, what is worth your time and what isn't now? Now, I'm not saying by that you don't have to take a bath and wash your clothes and go to work. But but what or rather who is large enough and big enough to change all of that so that even the mundane things that you do with the ordinary regular people of this world is transformed into something glorious and beautiful because such a being such a being transforms the ordinary into something amazing because of course we're talking about Jesus who becomes flesh who does not despise the Virgin's womb becomes one of us and walks with us and yet is the one who holds the seven stars and the one who stands among the candlesticks and the one whose voice is like a trumpet and like rushing waters and the one who bends down and says, do not be afraid. Do not be afraid. It is your father's joy to give you the kingdom.
