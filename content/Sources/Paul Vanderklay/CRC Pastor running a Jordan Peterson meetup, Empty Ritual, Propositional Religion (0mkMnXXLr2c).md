 Hi this is Paul and I want to introduce you to another friend of mine. Lately I've been having a few CRC pastors on the channel. I partly do that because people are like oh there's no other pastors like you and I think there's lots of other pastors like me. So this is my friend Pete and I've known Pete on a forum, a listserv for many many years and so I wanted Pete to, Pete's followed the Jordan Peterson thing and he's attended meetups and he's even started one and he lives in Edmonton Alberta and so I wanted to have Pete on the channel so I've been pestering him. He finally said okay and so today Pete and I are gonna talk. So Pete why don't you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about you. Sure can I first talk about my fears of doing this? Sure absolutely if you got to do that get them out of the way. I saw this project of you when you took it on, suck you into a vortex of is the word language that I've heard. I think you've used that language. I'm not gonna go there because I have a lot of interest and so yeah and so now I finally agreed to do a video and that's partly because a couple people from my meetup have said you know well I remember the first time it came up that somebody asked you, does anybody know, hear Paul VanderKlay and he was the only one except besides myself but since then another person has said why don't you do it, why don't you talk to Paul. So I thought okay and that's just all part of the progression of this just somewhat like it went for you. My trajectory is somewhat different but my interest is very much the same. Unfortunately you only have older friends who have long stories and I'm a storyteller so I'm gonna I'm just gonna say that I'm gonna point out some of the similarities I know between you and I. Okay. So both of us our dads were pastors in the Christian Reformed Church. Mine was a quite a different type than yours. Mine was one who answered the call as a single man to come to Canada to serve the fresh immigrants after World War II so they would advertise actually in the Netherlands for people to come and do that so he took that on as an adventure and then met my wife and my mom. Met my mom and got married and I'm the oldest of the family, the oldest child. I didn't know you were the oldest. How many siblings do you have? I have six siblings. Two are adopted at the end of the family basically when I moved out of the house after I moved out so I don't know them well but they that whole process has been a whole learning thing for me as well because they were native born and and my mom and dad sincerely believed they were doing a helpful thing and and yet it created difficulties for them in parenting kids who are not of your genes is the simplest way of saying it. So yeah I'm the oldest. I have a sister who's a pastor as well who's 11 months younger than I and whenever there were public events everybody would think she was the oldest so that's where people just don't know. I was introverted and she was outgoing so and cautious and shy so there's that so there's that similar history although your dad stayed put more than mine so we moved every three to five years and then we moved to Europe at one point and so that's where we have you and I have an overlap in the sense that I have cross-cultural experience although it was back in the homeland so to speak so it's very interesting now although there's fewer of them around but I can understand Dutch right and so sometimes these older people in the after church they'll be going whatever you know and if Job sees this he'll be laughing at that point and so so that's another similarity and then we have very similar curiosities like if we could do a book list because because that's you know on the forum that we've known each other through for a long time we always tend to end up in similar lines of thinking and reading similar people although there's been a few that you've read that I tried so I've read very little of CS Lewis actually really yeah wow and and although his like the four loves I remember reading that one but his his fiction like what what do we everybody see in this right I had the same thing with the movie oh can't think of the name of it but there was a movie where everybody was going nuts about it and I didn't I didn't understand but Renee Girard I just watched a video of you talking to a guy about Renee Girard I've read just about everything by him really and that's part of why I'm agreeing to do a video because any video that you do that I've watched I'm talking to the screen you know and so that's how I got started yeah exactly so I'm thinking I'm sitting there thinking man I should just put a camera on myself and then watch to the screen recorded put it out there so what happens so the two things that your own vortex I know I don't like vortex so the two things I would want to emphasize on top of what came up all in that video and he did summarize it well and I also a couple other observations first of all I'm ADD so this is what I'm exhibiting right now and and it's so interesting when I when I hear myself say how annoyed I get with Jordan Peterson for going off on tangents well minor narrative tangents and I you should be able to always stop me and say now how does this tie back to what we were talking about before and I should be able to track it trace it back so Renee Girard does a wonderful job with can enable just like Jordan Peterson does and and that's that's where I do see the memetic theory I have a harder time understanding that then Jordan then Renee Girard's scapegoat theory and where he ends up where I don't think that was in the video the other day was where where then he said he says Jesus was the ultimate blameless the only blameless scapegoat and so Girard's theology all circles around that now as a reformed theologian I've had to think hard about it because this doesn't come easily to me I'm not that much of a theologian but but I recognize that if you have embraced that approach where he where he kind of emptied the scapegoat pattern of its meaning right and he did that sacrificially so that we could see that there was a better way it still negates this thing about Jesus paying a price for my sins or it can easily go there so I I'm worked that part out yet but yeah it was exciting to hear that that guy explained but the side point I was gonna make is like I was enjoying that when you when you do interviews with people who tend to be in the preaching scale of things you can see them getting animated and going for it you know and preachers is what you do this yeah I got into it yeah I your community put you into it and and one of my favorites from you and I think I think I you know me well enough that I won't I'm not really mocking you in this but is when you go into what I call rabbi mode and you're sitting in front of the computer and you're going that's just fun that's part of the vortex I'm even afraid of creating my own memes like that maybe job will make a meme Joe's Joe knows how to make me job wound up is wound up on voices which is you know that was that was delightful yeah that's amazing and and just an interesting journey to watch and to be on the sidelines up so we have those those things that come a lot of interest in common you're way more philosophical than I am so I'm a sociologist and I should just put that out right away to that I am the pastor and I preach but I'm a specialized transitional minister which is where the sociology comes in and so I tend to come into the dream job would probably be a congregation that doesn't have any trouble but just wants to revision but unfortunately there's more work in the other market of congregations that have been in trouble and generally it's along the lines of a pastor who overstayed or a pastor who got tossed we have our own in-house language for that so I just call those hard partings and and I come in I get contracted to come in and help sort that out and and one of the I get to do that Colombo style I'm gonna give away some of my secrets here but so a key to doing that well is a curiosity and it's a kind of a feigned curiosity Colombo style like I just have a question like why did everybody just shake hands well that's what we've always done it's like I mean it has no meaning for you talk about meaning crisis right and so that's the one of the approaches I bring to that work is that every ritual that we have must have meaning known meaning or we got to start thinking again and but what I get experienced like is he wants to do away with all tradition hmm all ritual and tradition that's not what I'm saying so I'm a specialized transitional minister and there's been a journey getting into that as well so working in that capacity here I have five adult kids three of them are married and seven grandkids and the anyway Jordan Peterson came up on that forum that we were part of early 2016 I think and my interests in him are similar to yours in the sense that that I like it I like a guy who I like anyone who will stand up on principle in fact the principle doesn't matter necessarily to me is like just now that's gutsy right so like even the guy that stood in front of the tank in China at Tiananmen Square right somebody who does that kind of thing and and so when Jordan Peterson did that was when he first came into my awareness and then and then some of the videos of the protests and I was amazed at how calm he could stay I think this is overlaps with you as well yeah yeah I couldn't do that and I was thinking of all these smart things that he could have said in that moment in those moments and he just sat there looked at them and beginning beginning to see that the the wisdom in him and the stability in him that allowed them to just let themselves look foolish without adding to it his own his own foolishness to it that was that was something then I need to check my list because you know what because otherwise when we're done I'm going to be sending you email saying I should have said this that's why I make notes in fact so his ability to stay calm in the face of protest and then then he starts doing the lectures and and the thought of people paying to hear him talk about the Bible from a psychological perspective when churches nearby offered something very similar for free yeah and and they're all they're all smelling armpits about what are we doing wrong right so I knew I knew right away there was something there to learn as the church as the institution and then I started finding his content not objectionable and I'll get this out of his voice if you ever hear Rene Girard if you ever hear like they did interview them on ideas on CBC he has this wonderful friendship and and his and his need although I understand the need I think get on with it man his need to explain if he uses a hard word then he has to give the whole history of that word and the context in which to admit this and this and that and this and that and by then I've lost where he started going on that tangent so that that bothered me so I and to this day I still I'm up to about a half an hour at a time of actually his videos and yours so that I must be a real good product of my time where my attention span like 15 to a half an hour and then I got to take a break go do something else and then come back to it even this one that I'm going to be in myself I might so and then and then I became aware that his content was being consumed voraciously at first it was just his lectures online and I watched a few of those but like I said I had trouble with that then I started hearing reports and stories of lives positively changed by what he said so that got interesting then I started hearing this was now mainly through you stories of people seeking connection with some kind of Bible associated group and then and then you put me in contact with one of them and I checked with him and I'm allowed to use his first name so with Jason okay so one day I get this email trying to stay out of the vortex and by that point I had attended a previous iteration of the Jordan Peterson meetup here in Edmonton I did just attended as a person and there were some hard hard experiences you mean you mean you didn't wait in as a pastor right okay you just attended as a person as opposed to a pastor yeah I didn't know how to say that but not wearing my collar I don't know how to because partly because I just wanted to engage people that lived outside of my bubbles and I wanted to engage in a way that still remains for me although that's less easy now but I want to engage in a way also so that so that my bubble thinking would be challenged and I'd have to stretch my bubble maybe to fit something else and another piece it was that I don't know if you've heard about the Colossian Forum group but yeah but a number of people are starting to recognize that we need to learn how to have hard conversations together we need to learn a different way of talking whether it's within the church or outside the church there's something falling apart yeah and so I have a huge interest in okay am I capable of doing that or am I gonna slug somebody and get arrested and you know and so that's those were part of my motives but when I went playing clothes as I call it to the meetups then had some very interesting experiences another video another time but then you put me in touch with Jason and so he was curious about church he tried a few I recommended a couple to him and each time I would have coffee with him to talk about what his experience was like and I don't know if I've told him this in person yet but he's gonna be watching the video the moment it comes out I know that so but he said the way I remember what he said was whenever I visit a church I feel like I'm being treated like a prospect for conversion and I just waited and then he said and that's not what I want I'm looking for a community to grow in and for me that was just another piece of the wind of the vortex calling me that rings that rings true in you over a lot of years a lot of conversations that we've had yeah that that that that tapped into something in me that somebody would say that where I've had a suspicion even a conviction that that was the case I've always been astonished at how well I can connect with people outside of the institutional church sometimes it's very annoying my kids I don't think any of them will see this but but my kids laugh at me because I'll be going to pay for the fare to get on the ferry or something like that and next thing you know the person on you know that's taken my money is is telling me their life story I don't necessarily want that but it just has been happening regular to me and so they just stand there and wait they just laugh you know because they kind of know I don't I'm not really I don't think I'm inviting it but maybe it's the beard you know that just or maybe I just smile too much I should look more serious but so no you'll you'll say something you'll at people don't just do it you give them a little indication that that you're you're a willing ear and they'll go and that's a that's a beautiful gift right right inconvenient at times but a beautiful gift it's inconvenient yes yeah yeah because you're bringing to mind now an experience that I had about while having coffee with Jason and and this homeless guy started interrupting us you know and it was pretty clear well I don't know he could have been high this guy sitting next to us I shouldn't put labels like that but this guy who the evidence showed was not in touch with reality properly tried to just kind of barge into our conversation I could tell that he was trying to match the sort of conversation we were having at the time but again this is my human nature then he's a human being right and he sure he's being annoying and and and yeah because I'm a nice guy too I engaged right away and I tried to make it a conversation and then I realized that that wasn't he wasn't capable of that and so so then I just said to him and again that comes out of a lot of experiences with my version of your Daniel I so I just said to him listen my my friend and I here we have a conversation we need to finish so is it okay if we just go back to that now and the guy just turned and started on the people on the other side of and yeah anyway Jason revealed he found that striking and because I when we finished the conversation in parted ways then I went back to the guy and I said thank you for letting us finish our conversation it was I guess unnecessary but that's for me it was necessary right and you're a pastor Pete you care about people you do and that's that's always only care about about people's perception of me so I'm a liar and I'm only self-concerned anyway so attended so so when Jason said that I'm looking for a community to grow in and I realized that it probably wasn't the institutional church that I that I knew then I thought okay then the other meetup had fallen apart by then I thought okay then I'm gonna start a meetup where I can meet some of the things that I want to do but then also a community where we can talk about Jordan Peterson stuff and grow and learn together so yeah yeah so yeah that's so how how has that been going your own meetup it's way harder than I thought really even a pastor you're saying that oh yeah where are you meeting we meet at a coffee shop just a few blocks from my house actually okay so what I always book a room that has seats for 12 people okay in case of inclement weather most of this summer we've been able to be outside they have picnic tables outside and so there's just some interesting stuff there I probably probably not gonna on the video give you some of the personal challenges to it but hurting cats comes to mind and and I've fallen into a role and and I don't know how to pull out of that of managing the conversation when I've heard you describe your meetup there seem to be a couple people that have that have taken over to help that but but we've had some edgy conversations some conflictual conversations we've had we've had people make flat-out racist statements and that were you know jaws drop jaws drop and then I have to figure out how we're gonna work our way through that as a group well you know that's a that's an I mean I get frustrated sometimes because people are racist they are yeah and we want people to be honest and so people are gonna make racist statements and then then you have to figure out okay well are we gonna talk about this and I mean it's that's part of you know that's part of the other you know part of the other goal where you group where people can be transparent and you know the other another idea which is let's say someone is racist maybe they shouldn't be racist what's part of the process for them working through their racism it's gonna be talking about it as well as meeting different people and so on and so forth the challenge there though Paul is that so I mean this is what I'm thinking about a lot because I encountered this right and and even though I'm gonna name that they came from a Christian perspective right and so this was more along the lines of the Muslims are trying to take over the world and then so then anytime oh they are so are the Christians yeah we have it so so but with it in a context where you try and show curiosity and they double down then it's not a conversation and so that's the where I get stuck I don't know what so but I mean that's just that's just one more recent incident we've had a cup I've had a couple people that have been quite consistent although one just dropped out I saw who had some kept talking about something that I just didn't understand where he had he had this whole theory about how all spiritual activity and I'm not I don't think I'm not even suspecting mental illness I think he I think this was this was sharp thinking right yeah but it can easily be mocked but we're all spiritual activity happens in the lining of the brain and and he had all biological and explanations for all these processes and that if you learn to manage that you can achieve a state called flash over or the flash and and he believes it's the core of most some of the religions the Buddha achieved it Jesus achieved it right and like I do I want to present this seriously and I was grappling with trying to follow what he was saying and I would say that every once in a while is like your responsibility is to put this into language that I can follow because and because he was frustrated that nobody understood yeah yeah so so you get that but I also have yeah there's some really really interesting people that come but there's a lot of turnover too I don't know have you experienced that well there's there are almost 200 people on our meetup list to get notifications right and pretty much every meeting we'll get between 12 and 30 people so there are now that we've been doing it for almost two years now you know well not unlike church for some people they won't be around for a few months and then they'll hop back if they've got nothing to do on a particular night or something happened today so there are way more people who are sort of members of the group but again sort of like church is sort of a core and and I was I mean I look back and of course we Calvinists can talk about Providence but I was I was very fortunate in the timing of everything for me because I made my video at the right time I started the group at the right time and so when the group started we seem we just the first couple of meetings attracted the right people to sort of become the core of the group and that core set the culture and so a lot of things that in talking to you and talking to others who are struggling with their groups yeah we haven't had a problem with just because we hit a certain size and a certain culture and so when some of these things come in the culture just kind of takes care of it yeah and so that that I see that as a matter of timing because what's also interesting to me is the demographic that I have compared to what was at the earlier iteration and compared to what it sounds like you and others have because you seem to have a lot of 30 to 40 year old roughly 20 to 30 year old okay yeah so that was part of the earlier iteration that I that I went to playing clothes and there was a lot of evidence there if a reporter was there playing clothes they could write articles about the scum of the earth that are attracted to Jordan Peters so I mean that's how the how the report would go but what I saw was wounded young men confused young men who did not who are completely lost as to how to have relationship and particularly relationship with women but I mean I can I could tell that comically but but but it was kind of a sad representation and that earlier iteration to of course maybe I qualify as well but social misfits around the table were were were strong right and I remember one time particularly there were about 14 people that came and there was one guy at the end of the table and and by the end of the meetup nobody was at his end of the table anymore because of that that you know that that so so a lot of wounded people came there but the demographic that I have now is more my age in general I mean there and and I've had I had one lady come and she has the book and she's there for her nephew yeah yeah yeah yeah and and that sort of thing so that that tends to be more and there's some curiosity and and that kind of thing we did you know really I want to pause for a second because I have someone pacing in front of my door and I'm a little curious what's going on so I'm just gonna pause this stand the line I'm just gonna pause this take me with you what then I'd have to edit probably so so I have a another homeless guy who's sort of been seeing if he can take over Daniel's old spot okay hasn't you know he doesn't have the same he's not Daniel so he's a little bit package no no he's a little shy or so when I pulled right now it's like oh I'm leaving so anyway so I figured that I figured that was him he's been around lately and so anyway but that's it's really interesting to me because of course I mean we know this with churches too I mean you'll every every group is different but and but then also the idea that I mean you would attract people your own age and I think part of this is sort of the the Jordan Peterson visibility curve since his never-ending book tour his wife's illness his own now his own issues you know he's kind of sunken off the radar and so yeah my group I didn't have you know I didn't I wouldn't describe the group that I had really as misfits a lot of really capable young men but the issue and one thing I very much want to do more videos on the issue of of of the what I call the generational handoff that you know young men and young women looking you know trying to you know meet match may carry on the human you know human society and it's it's I don't know about Edmonton but here on the West Coast there's there's some real breakdown going on on both sides and it's not good it's a lot of unhappiness pretty much the very first one I went to the first conversation I was privy to was a young man explaining how a feminist friend of his a lady friend had lamented to him about how she couldn't keep a boyfriend and so he made a big scene about how he had pointed out to her that it was her feminism that was the problem and so oh I'm sure that went over well this is not a romantic relationship so you know whatever and then like within minutes another young man at the table starts talking so he's almost in the role of this feminist woman that had just been described and saying I can't you know I can't I can't keep a relationship with a woman like if I had a million dollars I couldn't do it and oh I bet you he could if he had a billion dollars well yeah maybe a million dollars would do it maybe that's what he yeah so I mean I'm kind of fictionalizing this a little bit too specific about what I experienced and and basically it's it's it's their feminism that makes me unable to have relationship and so then I like this is my curiosity thing so what do you think the solution is well he outlined what I call mananism as a so let's all become mananists and we'll set those women straight you know like help them to have a conversation where like how's that gonna work for you that's right that's right all by themselves being mananists you know I don't know like so so but there was a lot of a lot of that yeah and and it's a different group now and and for the most part we have some very interesting conversations and I sure assume you experienced this too like I should back up on the first meetup that I had we had about 15 people there that was the biggest one and I have I just looked at 129 on my list right now but we have to limit it to 12 and Saturday afternoon is because part of my challenge is organizing to like arranging the meetings and stuff like that I'm that's not my thing you know but I took this on so I'm working on it and a lot of people early on indicated that Saturday didn't work for them so but I tried one Monday night one a lot I did a poll and they said Monday night would work and and only four people showed up I booked a whole church room actually for it because I asked would you mind if it was at a church because I can get a space there free that was really fun when we had a bus driver guy when we were talking about the idea and he said well why don't somebody talk to their does anybody here have a church they can talk to that was before they knew I was a pastor because my group now I've come out no longer in the closet on that but but I needed to wait until I had enough relationship with enough people that because I know either you probably experienced that to the percept how the the way they interact with you immediately flips as soon as they know you're a pastor it can so yeah we have good conversations but the very first meetup I put it out to the group and then somebody suggested that we'd go chapter by chapter through the book okay so that's that's the plan that we're on so we every every week we have a chapter that we're officially discussing but we can go any anywhere after a few questions about that and engage his material okay okay I usually have in my in my hand written on my hand a few prime the pump questions you know so so how does it feel to be compared to a lobster so according to Jordan I remember doing this the first the second first chapter we did according to Jordan Peterson all we're here for is to gain status and and and territory you know how does that make you feel so so you've you've gone the the book the book study route that's interesting yeah we we haven't gone that at all we in fact we have we do introductions and then almost no format and off we go but again part of that is simply due to the composition of the group and and after the the round of introductions we there's only been one meeting in 30 that we haven't had a brand new people person in the room okay and yeah yeah we've had a brand new person or multiple people yeah I mean there are some meetings where we have almost half the group is brand new okay okay and and so then the introductions then lend themselves to right you know what are you because after you hear what they've questions arise I'm always I always have lots of questions so then start asking people questions and off the conversation goes and some of our regulars aiming for but the group overruled me which I thought was delightful really and so I said okay I'm not really favorite when that came up I said that's not really what I was hoping to do I was hoping to at that point a lot of the women that came I'm theorizing I don't know but several of them knew each other from about four or five other meetups so maybe it's sort of a let's you know it's better than bar dating or something like that kind of a thing and so there's nothing wrong with that and they had good input but I noticed that they've they trailed away after after a while and so so I'm honoring what the group decided that meeting even though nobody from that particular group comes anymore right so in other words we've had we get we get not only new people but we get turnover and but so it's good to have that structure I do the introductions as well but what I've also started doing is part of the introduction has to be whether you've been there before or not because I saw a couple people we started already doing inside jokes and stuff like that yeah because I have a sociology prof that and this is this is a lot of fun but I teach some of the techniques sometimes that I've learned right you know well it's just a technique of couching your words rather than saying things bluntly right or or prefacing by saying what I hear you saying is not not that and not putting words in people's mouths right right well so now they kind of playfully mock me when they catch themselves and go oh what I hear you saying is right yeah but but so there's that kind of inside joke stuff that can can make newcomers feel like well I don't know what's going on here so that's why I have them make as part of the introduction say if they've been before or how many times they've been before and and I'll use them to make a joke about what were really nice to you the first time you come and then look out and or stuff like that what I also often do is throw in a nice I have a whole stack of icebreaker questions you know if you could have lunch with any author who would it be throughout time that those kinds of things my next one this will be a heads up for anybody coming to the next one who would you who would you like to see Jordan Peterson have a conversation my answer is Bernie Brown ah Bernie Brown yeah I see a lot of overlap huh and I and I see a lot of difference and I think it would be a fascinating conversation and it would be a conversation it wouldn't be a battle it would be a yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I've seen I saw I think I saw her Netflix like she's a Netflix thing I think my wife was watching it yeah and that was that was interesting that could be that could be interesting she's a vulnerability researcher well Peterson's just such a Peterson's I was I was working on a video before I was talking to you video that probably won't see the light of day because towards the end is like yeah this isn't working I don't I don't throw many away but what's that you have a few of those I see them on the shelf behind you those videos that never make it no yeah there are a few of them that's a lens interest people like well what's he throwing away what did he say that he's throwing away it's like that's sometimes when it just doesn't gel you have that with sermons all the time too you're working on a sermon it's like this isn't going anywhere right away start over and I hate doing that because I it's like an hour and a half gone it's like I can't I can't afford to lose that but anyway so I'm 280 HD too but now Peterson's just such an interesting fish that yeah that would be a very interesting conversation although he's he's tough I mean people always want to pair him with people but Jordan has to be in the right mood to actually have a conversation with someone otherwise you know he's just such a such an inveterate rabbit trail or he can just you know right off he goes it's more comfortable on his own than yeah yeah I can relate to that I like to be the one asking the questions you know and just giving the answers are to some that's answers that are directed at me is not as comfortable so if if you had to if if I'll just ask you what would where would you like your meetup to go what would you like to have it turn into what do you want to see happen there for people because you're you're an idealist and so yeah um so it's interesting that what comes to mind is what I don't want it to have happen which is important to state okay well the people at that table are not prospects for conversion for me yeah even though you're a Christian minister yeah and that's what that's what keeps confusing people about me because the the image of a minister has gotten so mercenary that they're like well you can talk to people well yeah right so so that's actually a pretty big piece I mean it's not like I put it out of the possibility but it's not my objective and so my objectives are somewhat selfish I just learning like I said just to speak outside the bubble and and to and to just practice engaging people that are different than myself and see what kind of conversations that that can develop if we and and what are the keys to making that a conversation right that's where I was telling me earlier that the people that come with a certain rigidity it becomes it's when it's no longer a dialogue when everything I say is a launching place I told a story at our last meetup of buying a car from a Muslim fellow in Grand Rapids pyramid auto sales I love the name of that place and I knew nothing I was almost finished seminary and I knew nothing about Islam and I saw a plaque with some writing on it in in some squiggles right and so I asked the guy you know what is that and he said oh that's a quote from the Quran and so and it was Christmas time and so I asked him oh you know hey I'm curious what do you guys do for do you observe Christmas so he gave me an answer blah blah blah and I ended up buying the vehicle on a handshake which I also really like it's sort of like people that stand up for principle is like for three months anything goes wrong I will fix it for so I even invented a squeak to test him by then I knew there was some curiosity developing so there was a I don't know off the top my head I don't get the timeline exactly right but there was another time when I came there and he offered me a coffee and he didn't take one himself and so I said are coming out taking a coffee and he said well it's Ramadan what's that you know so ignorant and and anyway that one of the times when I brought the vehicle in because there was something with the brakes he had it put into the shop and we're sitting in his office he does not know that I'm a pastor right I'm just a guy buying a car and and he says to me I'm really disappointed with my religion now at that point is seminary and a lifelong Christian you're supposed to know exactly what to say oh I'm here just to buy a car Lord you know what's going on so so I heard him out on that what do you mean by that and he said I do everything my religion calls for and it's it doesn't it's not giving me anything back I don't know what's wrong right Wow it was what I laugh about at myself is that all I could think of was the word was two words works righteousness that's probably not gonna be easy to explain to again in terms of the bubble that we're trained in yeah like how to speak about that so so I tried to explore with him what he thought the problem was and I said it sounds like you know you you're God your religion demands a lot of you and there's not a whole lot of grace in it you know and that would be frustrating if you had to keep working to earn this possible mercy of God so what was interesting about that was that after that I was I was never left alone with him again there was always somebody else from the shop that would come and be very close by so that I couldn't follow up because I went home and got a little bit equipped right in fact we had a missionary from Africa visiting the seminary anyway and like her prayer letter was like the book of Acts in Africa and so she happened to be visiting so I told her about this and she didn't help at all she said oh you probably had a vision the day before you came that a guy with a big beard was gonna come and he had something important for you so I thought oh no he had let me off the hook so what I did get I wrote a paper comparative religion and I also got it got he went with him to the mosque one time I sat there for three hours getting grilled with in a form of evangelism and apologetics that I know evangelicals use as well and it was the most absurd thing going right ridiculing what they thought I believed like straw man arguments and all this kind of stuff and they wouldn't let me talk to my buddy there was a guy in front of me who I later learned was one of the thousand people that's memorized the Quran and he's sort of their expert right and so we sat on the floor after the service was done and he just came at me right and and and when they when when you're in a situation where your belief your beliefs are falsely framed to start with so God came down at sex with a woman and gave you your Jesus right it's like no Zeus did came as a came as a goose I later told my my professors because we have some pretty tough examinations there I said nothing's as tough as sitting three hours in a mosque and they brag to me that there'd been a Calvin College student there the week before that went home crying and they were pretty sure he'd lost his Christianity Wow so so I but I only told the story about the coffee part yeah and I said I gave up taking a coffee out of respect for his I was willing to get up taking our coffee if that would have been an offense to his religion and so one of our participants said that's ridiculous you never give any leeway to Islam right so and and then doesn't make it a conversation and so then you just end up stuck so anyway that's some of the interesting interesting stuff that happens it's it's very engaging and and I'm learning a lot and it's actually very helpful for me but it's also tiring yeah how often do you meet it's about every three weeks it's kind of like once we've done one then I look at my calendar and see when the next one's gonna work I started supporting our local soccer team and they often play on Saturday so I have to schedule around soccer soccer games although that season's almost done but yeah so did you answer my question what's that you know you know what you don't want the group to be and and I should frame I mean I have this weird thing where if someone asked me do you want everyone to become a Christian I'll say yes I'm just like a Muslim I want everyone to become a Christian well how are you going to treat people and I think the answer to that is with love because I think that's actually the Christian prescription of how to treat people with love like it's complicated but then that's why no one wants to be a project and because that you've just dehumanized the person but but but so okay so you don't want you don't want your group to become some kind of proselytization scheme what do you want the group to be? If a Christian evangelist shows up and tries that they've got me to deal with even even oh careful words even a healthy Christian who tries it is gonna have and the absurd Christians they're definitely gonna hear from me so we got to tell you about another interesting moment where the sociology prof because of the way the dialogue went Calvinism came up and and the sociology prof asked a very good question she said is there some kind of connection between Jordan Peterson and Calvinism and my buddy Jason who's an explorer right bam bam bam three three overlaps between Jordan Peterson and Calvinism right interesting Jordan Peterson nails total depravity nails what we call total depravity yeah yeah you know I think the second one was personal responsibility we need to take personal responsibility I tend to forget the third one but it was I remember it would being three right and I'm going Jason so I mean that even that he'd given that thought was kind of interesting yeah yeah so you still haven't answered my question I'm gonna hold you to this question I want to hear it what I want it to become yeah well if you okay you're doing this every three weeks and you know you're spending time and it takes effort and all this stuff there's a dream you're chasing what's the dream oh fame and fortune you already said you didn't want to go down the vortex impact a connection relationship growing together okay so so my little thing about like a couple of them have learned to use the phrase preaching to the choir in the locker room as well right they know what I mean by that there's a couple of phrases like that that I was the choir doing in the locker room well see that's when you get the in group in the in the in the inner place where nobody else can hear them and then they then they really tell you what they think that's quite a mixed metaphor but but I'm layering two metaphors to give it I want you to flesh out this vision though because I mean I'm and I'm not doing it just to troll you or anything because I mean because one of the things so it was about the second or the third meeting that I realized that what had happened at the meetup was something that I had longed for for church but never experienced which was that church would be a place where people could come with their questions and explore them meaningfully and seriously that's what I wanted and and I wanted that from church for myself right and I wanted that from church for others and and obviously in a group I mean that requires a fair amount of people from a group where in order to actually explore things meaningfully and purposefully and productively that does require social skills you know it requires a lot of people and it requires a lot of the group but and you know then one of one of our members actually goes to one of our church plants up the road and and he said same thing you know I've always he'd grown up in an evangelical church and he'd always wanted church to be a place where you know people can come and express their express what's truly on their heart even if it is something that many churches would find offensive or ignorant or whatever category of dismissal yeah so I long for that but I don't see that in my in my as part of the Jordan Peterson meetup because we're not consistent enough to establish that trust as the group that I have now where I've encountered that and I've had to deal with my own anger and resentment against the church is in 12 step groups for that I walked with a recovering addict and he took me to some 12 step meetings and I was bowled over by the transparency the honest struggle and I'm thinking of my upper middle class church that I was a pastor of at the time this was in the downtown East Side in Vancouver and I was thinking man this is if the church could accomplish this there'd be no stopping us right and so so I think you've helped me I narrow something down I'm hoping to learn some things at the meetup that I can take back to the church things do you mean propositional things no see no okay examples of the barriers that they put up to people accomplishing exactly what you described and there and there's zillions of them I'm like the more I look into it the more I see right so on Sunday at the church that I'm at I preached a sermon on cultural captivity and and I started listening listening some things they decide it starts out of the u-turn church book which is to reform pastors that helped churches turn around and the chapter was on biblical absolutes and personal preferences as as a polarity there's a stage in between but I don't need to explain that and so much of what most Christians define the church as are actually based on personal preference cultural preferences sitting in rows hearing a lecture delivered shaking hands as you come in right and then I one older person with with a certain look on her face I won't try and replay in case their grandchildren see it something like that they trace it by bringing coffee into church like that's a cultural change that she's having a hard time adjusting to right and and and but those are all personal preference cultural issues they're not the core of what the Bible teaches in Christianity and so and you and I have offline you know in on the forum had had all kinds of discussions about the organic and institutional and so then the I firmly believe that the institution gets held captive to the rituals and traditions that have become empty and the cultural definition of the church and so by doing a meetup I'm able to see those better which makes me less popular in the church when I try and point them out but my part of my title is you know specialized transitional minister who's doomed to perpetual in popularity well you know and Pete now that you know and you and I have talked about this before you know and voices I mean we can both understand I think you far better than I because your roots are so much closer to the immigration and and the Canadian Church is more closer to that than the American churches even though my grandfather did a stint in Owen Sound Ontario with those immigrants but you know thinking about you know this woman's horror that coffee would be permitted in the sanctuary you know that's that's so much of the strength but also the form of you know obviously CRC churches with these with the Dutch especially the the Canadian post-world war two Dutch immigrants and then you know I've talked about this I just finished listening to hardcore history's treatment of the First World War which is just a you know is just a book on trauma and then of course the Dutch in the Second World War now knowing what we know about trauma you know these immigrants come from the Netherlands and the stories that I heard out of you know coming out of my aunt and my grandmother who very much didn't like what a lot of what they saw happening in amongst the Dutch immigrants leaving how they treated how the Dutch immigrants treated one another not so much how they necessarily treated I mean my grandfather was a saint you could treat him poorly and he would bless you and although he had his yet his add boundaries but he would not he was a he was a very he was he was not known for being a very exciting preacher but he was a very shrewd pastoral pastoral pastor and you know now listening to those stories these these immigrants come out of the Netherlands just bearing wounds of trauma but we didn't recognize trauma as a wound and then and then they come and form churches and you know so much if we you know if we had to write churches in in Canada from that generation leaving after the war so much today we look back and say oh these you know these these people are just trying to figure out how to survive and and churches vital for this this is a really good one although it's not in print anymore but it really helped me uprooted Dutch immigrant children in Canada 1947 to 59 so so absolutely and so that I got to be careful here because this has been a huge part of my own personal work as a son of immigrants who whereas a family we had our own dysfunctions and so I I began to try and dig into what what created that right and so and I should really start digging now into how it shaped my generation because we because Holocaust studies and residential school studies all show that the next generation is actually more screwed up that that with some help the people that actually had the trauma experience can can do better but but the problem is that is many of those that were traumatized so the generation before myself here in Canada first of all they were part of a cerebral religion right if other Christian traditions tell us we do anything well we do reasoning reasoning things out well right feelings not so much so there's that perfect sense for traumatic people I mean these propositional truths are safer they're safe places and and and you and in a sense you you sort of proxy your feelings by managing the propositions right and you know these are interesting passionately you don't know why where the passion comes from but you defend them passionately right yes I remember my first council meeting 24 to 27 men around the table I was like 23 years old and in that particular council room effectiveness was measured in decibels so if you're if you were more passionate than the next guy you spoke a little bit louder about on the issue and and then like and never became a fisticuffs you know but it but the decibel level indicated your level of passion and that was like somebody had done a reading and then okay the decibel level on the on the nays was higher so that's it's not gonna happen right so oh so this is an area that I have many many things so so up here we are a denomination that has been shaped by unresolved trauma and it's still having an effect right and and those people would who I used to be get very upset with and want to kick them out of the church right I've learned to see them as traumatized and unable to be healed they can understand when I challenge their favorite rituals I had a I forgot an important ritual to somebody one time I'm gonna make this really short just to get to the punch line hopefully it makes sense I forgot I missed a ritual in a church I was new to as a specialized transitional minister and I and as a pastor you know that feeling you know you know something's wrong you can't quite tell what it is during the offering you quickly check over the order of service see what you missed miss an announcement if it's possible to hide you check your fly if you're a guy you know like something's wrong you don't know what it is and anyway I walked out of my house out of the church I didn't I never found out what it was then and I come into this lady who's 70 years old of the immigrant generation having a hissy fit like a tantrum in the parking lot there's 20 people in a circle watching her and the first thing I heard her say when she didn't see me yet was I can't even die in my own church yeah I did the same what did she mean by that took me a year and a half to come to a theory on it but but given what we just said right so me missing a ritual like this was a church in which ritual was important and me missing up an important ritual to her was as uncomfortable spiritually as if I'd gone to her house while she was at church and ransacked it can't even it's not home anymore it's not my spiritual okay yeah it took a year and a half and there's a whole lot more to the story right so so but that's there's an example of the thing that was the ritual well now we're gonna have to do in-house talk but the preparation form for the Lord's Supper okay okay yeah which I theologically will not do for theological reasons anymore and which I hadn't done for years nobody asked you know we didn't the churches I was in didn't do it and and so the but the council at that church thought well he's been the seminary he must know what we all expect so that's another huge thing I run into is this unnamed expectation stuff and how appear more so although you know what I always in trouble free either when I was down there so but but there's this layer of trauma that's unresolved and it was a luxury for those people when they came here and lived in chicken coops in minus 40 Celsius right and they had a hard scrabble existence they didn't have the luxury of finding a counselor in fact that still had a negative connotation to it right so then you double down on your principles and you double down on your traditions and you double down on church being done the way it was back home because you miss it so terribly that's right that's right and that created an extra layer and I've learned it does that I was in a peer group with a Ukrainian Orthodox priest and I laid this out one time when we were meeting and he goes your people do that too he was actually at Plaza Lutheran we discovered but so it's common in immigrant communities which is where it was interesting the last second last church I helped out had a huge refugee community where the same things are taking first are starting right and to go to my Dutch immigrant usually my generation mostly other older ones weren't around anymore and say we have something that we can we can help them with this because our parents went through it we know what it's like for their kids to have to translate for mom and dad and all that kind of stuff so yeah we're off of Jordan Peterson and we're off of meetups yeah that's okay that's okay we're both ADHD and you know it's my channel we'll go where I want but but but no but I don't know how you know because you know where I get there from Peterson and Verveki is the irony you know the irony of churches theological systems how these how these helped people who suffered significantly and and I mean the reason they're so attached to it well those rituals are meaningful oh they are meaningful in all caps for them and because that is exactly what they've used to you know to deal with suffering and you know sort of what you know what okay so it's what everyone has done is say okay we're gonna we're gonna take away this is why people don't like being poked in their axioms to pull up another Jordan Peterson phrase they don't like being poked in their axioms because these these things these things are what their world hinges on and you take that away and and I think what what Peterson has helped demonstrate is that so so someone listening to this conversation might say okay well well we haven't suffered the trauma that those who suffered in the Second World War the First World War have suffered so we no longer need that religion or they might say yeah Jesse Benchura was right religion is a crutch for weak people now that's not at all what I'm saying in either case it's that we are far more complex and mysterious creatures and if we would pause and be able to see beyond our own arrogance we might look into the past and say huh there's a reason the world is shaped the way it is there are the reason these people did what they did and you know whereas you know whereas in a case of something like that most of the context I've been in that part has been lost right really yeah we like to believe that it's all everybody knows it but no not really so again in-house example but used a lot up here still a lot of the council rooms if you come to preach you go around shake everybody's hand as you come into the council yeah so my favorite thing to do actually is then finish that and say so does anybody know why we did that see and it has no meaning anymore here's the thing Pete I've known other pastors that have the same spiritual gift of you as you and it's the spiritual gift of annoyance and it's truly a prophetic gift and here's the thing when all these people run around and talk about how prophetic they are it's like now if you're being prophetic in order to please people you don't understand what being prophetic is so it's not prophetic means they all want to kill you after the service that's prophetic and and not just because you're annoying but the more pitchforks the better so so the other thing is and what points to it because I'm working on accepting that part of my character now right I mean I've struggled with it most of my life that that I'm I'm a disruptor I'm not a I'm not a peacemaker in the regular sense because I'm always questioning and I'm always examining and I expect everybody else to be willing to do the same and so kind of shocked when they go hey you got a little you know so but but I you know me well you maybe now you know me that well enough to that I do it fairly playfully as well right so I'm not which annoys people even more because you're making light of their foundations when they appreciate it and they go really you know another story a church I served in a fairly traditionalistic one that I can't give you too many details I'll give the location away but they had on Lord Supper Sunday the the elements are at the front of the table all covered up in a cloth right and the I noticed already that the elders dressed up more than they usually did we were they were Friday casual most of the time but the elders wore a suit and tie on Lord Supper Sunday we come to the part of the service where we're about to do communion and really a holy hush falls over the whole place it was just amazing I thought wow you know this the anticipation in the air or whatever was great and then two elders get up and they they they do a flag folding ceremony with that cloth right and then from then on it was like just let's eat some bread and drink some wine so of course I'm going to get curious right so so next elders meeting I go what was that all about like because I'm imagining as the idealist that some pastor has given them some significance about the the revealing of God's gifts for mankind or something like that and so that's their sacred moment right I said I felt this holy hush just as we went into all that what's it all about what does it mean to you I don't know that's what we've always done people don't know why they have their rituals they just develop them and they use spiritually escaping into the ritual and there and there and there in a way that was demoting the actual valuable ritual so it's like the the mascot from from the from the game so so that's just me I have to I have to challenge that so when they told me that because I was sort of prepared I was hoping for some meaning but I was sort of prepared so and I and they all know their history really well for various reasons the history of their congregation so I said when the first church building was built because that building is actually in a museum outdoor museum somewhere nearby which is one of the actual accusations or one of the no theories that I put to them one time that what you've created here is a wonderful living museum of Christianity the way it used to be so it was it was presented as a theory it was presented carefully so so I said to them okay the first church building that you had what was the were the windows air tight oh no and then in rural rural settings especially you start getting stories oh yeah we used to take bulletins and stuff from in the crack you know like no just answer my question that first church building what was the next built first the next building over from it and there it's interesting too because they'll name the next farm up the road I said no there was another building I've seen pictures right on the property oh the horse stable oh what's a byproduct couple byproducts that come from having a horse stable a short distance from a church that has poor that is leaky flies and smells finally they come up with right and then one of the young elders starts getting it right like wow you mean that she is on there to keep the flies off I said yep how many how long has it been since you saw a fly in church they had a brand new facility right so that's can you see why I'm suited for my work because I see why it well because by the time you leave they've long forgotten the lot the guy that you're cleansing them from and they're ready to fall in love with the new guy somebody woman even take a woman but get this guy out of here that's right so anyway those stories give you a snapshot in the into what I do and the style in which I do it because I do it differently than others others are transitional ministers who restructure the entire administration and and leave a better church right but I'm a deconstructor I'm a deconstruct their rituals of idols of idols I haven't told any of those stories so they might not be the same as the ones I just told and a deconstructor of distraction and I'm pointing out this goes back to your question that I that I've struggled to answer I'm pointing out the barriers within the church that keep people like that come to my meetups from finding a place where they can feel at home where they can understand what's going on and where they can risk in Bernadette Brown language being vulnerable because the church in my experience is the last place that's willing to risk vulnerability some of them accomplish it most of them you know you're sharing announcements and you're crying like okay well we'll add a couple minutes of prayer to that one then but we'll do that again you know so so so there's a bridge somewhere in that with it with the meetups where I want to learn about engaging that world and there might be more rude lessons I could bring back to the church and of course you have no rituals yet that have developed in the meetup we have a couple what the introduction is a me is a ritual yeah it's true right and and even now the acknowledgement of some of the little quirks that I've that I've taught our ritual things right so no they're there every group has its rituals every group has its own way of declaring who's in and who's out that's my that's my phone anyway so that's that's part of my purpose too but it's it feels selfish to answer because it's mostly about my learning and what I could take back to to the church make myself even less popular okay it's hard I was just about to say something really serious yeah that's better much better because I firmly believe that this this vortex that we're getting sucked into could spin off something different I mean not too long ago we had the emerging church attempts and stuff like that but that this could spin off when I try and imagine it I think of it as a pre a pre-body of Christ Church or something like that where you can create communities of a certain kind of conversation and growth and and vulnerability when the people know each other well and and and then you know after after six months you can graduate people say okay you're ready to deal with the crap in a church now yeah well absolutely and I think that was that right this is where you and I are are very much throw thing yeah this is where you and I I think are very much on the same page and I'm I'm far less annoying than you with people because I'll often let them keep their senseless rituals but I but I also believe just a reading of church history in my opinion demonstrates that part of the genius of Christianity is that it's been able to infiltrate and colonize with various levels of success tremendous range of human culture and one of the things that one of the things that we're facing is that the the tremendous the tremendous change the tremendous disruption in humanity that has happened over the last few hundred years often fueled by science and technology science always gets the blame but technology is what really convinces us because that's what we get our hands on science is just theory technology is what we do the cell phone teaches us that God is dead you know things like this so we've seen this dramatic dislocation and disruption of churches in many many different ways and what I believe has to happen and what has happened time and time again is that the church you know you just don't keep this stuff down the church works through this stuff slowly and new forms of church come out the other end but just like with those rituals that you point to you know someone would come to Living Stones and we have all these church plants in the city they've all got weekly communion and they've all you know they've been tinkering with all of their rituals and kind of Living Stones is very behind the times in terms of everything we do because I out of deference to the Saints that in many ways are this church I will not force them from their rituals but the church has also shown a capacity to extend generosity and afford this you know a support a meetup and because I think what we're actually doing with the meetups is I think I like the way you said it this is we as we as church leaders are learning how this next mutation in church will happen and I know that a whole bunch of people over you know Howard's you know Bishop's Spong you know the church has to change or die I think that book's garbage and a whole bunch of other people smart missiologists that oh it'll be now the secret church had its day I think we are of a deep transition where I think what comes out the other end is both will be will look new but also be refreshingly historical because one of the things that I watch in the church plants are how they are reappropriating you know traditions in the church and they're coming out in different ways but these transitions are very disturbing for all of the reasons that all of your stories highlight and and you know we certainly want this dear saint to to be able to die in her church I mean we we want that but you know you as a pastor are saying the church you're gonna have to be a little flexible with some forms so that the function can continue to be given to new generations because I know that's at heart you know what you what you want to see and so I don't fully agree with I don't think I agree with what you just said so but anyway we'll do that another time so no I'm not satisfied with her dying in her church with with empty rituals being followed exactly but it isn't empty for her but it's not tying her to God either it's not growing her spiritually so that's what I'm that's where I had to you and I could have an interesting conversation about this I think I don't see it that way and maybe there's work I have to do on that right I mean I've had to learn to have compassion for people in that because I used to just get right pissed off really I was oh yeah I was part of a whole group of us at seminary who who would have been very happy if while we were at seminary all the CRC churches that existed would have would have fallen down in some specific location earthquakes with nobody dying of course or being hurt and that we could come back and build something new oh my that was us oh my anymore so you're revolutionaries well but again that's the shaping of being the next generation of the immigrant yeah yeah yeah I can see that and then when I came to a point where I recognized within my own family that my that my father particularly could not understand and and I realized okay there's no way of changing that and out of out of some of that and reading these books that I showed you I became to see the trauma in the people and that so now I can accept them as wounded people and I'll leave it up to God how where she ends up spiritually dying in her church that she's comfortable in yeah I as a as a as a as the kind of person and pastor that I am I'm not satisfied with her being comfortable it with the comfortable pew as Pierre Burton Burton put it right Wow Wow that's false comfort Paul I like challenging you I'm not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I agree with you I think wouldn't be where you are it's true and if I agreed with you I wouldn't be where I am that's exactly right well that's no I love I love talking to I don't know why I love talking to people I disagree with that's I don't know if that's weird or not but I I just love it well you have anything else on your list Peter you want to wrap it up here or quickly ask a few questions about oh sure like if you had it to do over again did I had what the whole my last two years yeah so but I just want to see I'm checking my list here on my screen so ritual without meaning look at that we went into that without even getting to my list Gerard and can the culture gap between the church and we sort of touched on that and then how the church is culturally captive to a particular sets of worldviews that's that's actually making it less effective so that's done but if you if you were to start your channel today for instance would you do anything different like would you still use YouTube is one of my questions yeah would you get more professional equipment before you started no okay what do you use the camera on your you have a surface pro right no I I have I have more computers than you can imagine well I can imagine because I because I know whenever you start shopping for one you share with and I also build my own too so I don't build notebooks I build desktops but anyway so I use I use the Logitech 940 which a lot of people use and I use the blue Blue Yeti mic I I learned early on that sound was important and so I don't mind didn't mind spending a few hundred dollars and that's not you know those aren't those aren't pricey items no the you know one of the things I do think about in terms of so I I know some people look at my channel say oh you've got what 12,000 subs I don't see myself as having been particularly successful as a youtuber and I don't regret that I I got into this because I I wanted more conversation partners specifically about Jordan Peterson and I was already playing around with YouTube it's like let's see what happens and what has been most what has been most gratifying to me has been the community that I've seen in my wake that to me and I don't mean the size of the community in terms of number of people watching my video but the conversation between the people who have watched my videos that to me is of more value than gold yeah because and this shows my heart as a pastor because I know that it's in that interaction that God does all sorts of wonderful things and so that I think you know I actually think back and I think about you know videos I've made in the past and I think gosh I I got a whole bunch of stuff wrong and I think well maybe I should take down my old videos it's like you know I want this is the record my monologue videos and really my conversation videos too are the record of my discovery and I'm happy leaving it out there because this whole thing for me has been just a big learning experience and this has been one of the most fertile and fruitful learning experiences of my life if I compare what I've learned now to say spending two or years doing a daemon I'll take this so I really have no regrets I need something anyway yeah so I don't need anything like that I this brings up a joke so a daemon for Paul's viewers is a doctor of ministry degree or something right right you do that while you're working yeah so in a circumstance where I was with a bunch of pastors and I was at that point thinking of doing a daemon on this whole trauma question yeah immigrant unresolved trauma and immigrants and so I said to the group you know I'm thinking of thinking of getting a daemon around a group of pastors you know so you have to pronounce it carefully so so you wouldn't do anything different and I love how you just pointed out because this is a trajectory of learning and and our culture has forgotten that too like we're in a political thing here now too and then and there seems to be no space in the political sphere for for someone to have grown up a little bit from from immature ideas they used to hold yeah instead and this is something I've always refused to do instead what we learn is to say the right thing in public but then we preach to the choir in the in the locker room and then we do this divide right and and so so that's partly also my character where I won't say well I got a like most of the time the words are three miles away from me three kilometers away from me before I realized okay maybe that wasn't the best thing to say very honest you know so because I don't do I'm learning some diplomacy yeah have you ever heard of polarity management you know you know see so the neon high school right yeah yeah so he did a workshop with us one time and he's looking directly at me and he and he introduces in as the part starting concept for polarity management he says there's two polarities out there there's diplomacy and candor which one do you lean towards he's looking right at me right I'm learning some diplomacy like the Colombo style is sort of a diplomacy kind of the thing is where you just ask questions right yeah yeah it happened it all happens differently if I if I just stood there and said you're all stuck in your rituals you know no you sneak up on him and then tear away there there there there warm blankie that they've been going to bed with every night for 30 years so that was the questions I had for you because I'm I'm still hesitant to start anything like this of my own and but I was curious what you had learned at least in the technological part and how you approach it yeah I tell people if they want to start something like this they should do it for their own reasons in other words if they have five or 15 subs but they they are learning as they're doing it right and because part of the key of this and I figured this out with blogging you know 15 years ago 20 years ago that if I was going to do it I was going to have to do it in a way that I could do it for a long time and the only way that would be possible is if I knew that there was enough there I would get enough out of just the act of doing it to justify the time and so I always figured out people like how can you put out so much material well I'm integrating all of this into my own continuing learning program Bill Hybels who you know unfortunately his name will have different soundings now than it would five years ago but Bill Hybels wrote a book on self leadership which again that's a different sound now that it would but but one of the things he said in that book which caught my attention way back when was he said pastors should be spending maybe 75% of their energy on self leadership and I remember hearing that and thinking that sounds nuts because I was thinking maybe 10% the time but what I've you know and I've been fortunate I've been fortunate I've been a fortunate enough pastor to be dramatically unsuccessful with a tiny little dying congregation that afforded me a lot of self-learning time to to realize that you know so I so I preached a sermon I preached last week there's there's a couple visiting the church and and they've been before their parents of a family who goes here and she said oh pastor I just the way that you preach and the ideas that you have you must spend hours doing it and it's kind of like well yes and no I spend hours on my ideas so that the sermon doesn't really need a whole lot of time and now at this stage in my career too I've been preaching for so long that you know I've got all my bad habits well entrenched but but that's and so in many ways what what Bill Hybels was pointing to was that you know all of us are the product and and if we want to be a better witness for Christ if we want to be a better whatever we have to invest in that product and so you know finding Jordan Peterson was just another stop in the long of my lines of being a lifelong learner and my you know my salience he came across my salience field and I didn't even appreciate when I first started listening to him why I was interested in him because I you know but as the further I got into it I could again begin to draw connections and say okay this is why this is why he's important this is why this moment this thing that he's launching is important and this is worth some time and then of course once I had a lot of people wanting to talk to me you know to the people coming and sharing their stories with me that's an unbelievable gift to me and we know that as pastors because in a sense their story enriches me and I learned not only about them but about humanity and about God and about I mean so I I encourage people start your own channel doesn't matter if nobody else is watching and so I look at these I look at Mary and I look at it's been interesting a lot of the women started their own YouTube channels it was and YouTube is a lot it's older women YouTube's a little dicey of course with women because of the whole male looking thing but I look at what these people are doing with their own channels and I think this is good this is good and they might and you know a bunch of them have you know over a hundred subs already which is which is awesome I again my timing was just you know providential and I could I was never smart enough to do any of that I just listened to outliers by Malcolm Gladwell and he and he talks about these people that we think are famous successes like like Bill Gates had access to a computer early in his life that was exactly that and so in the book Gladwell points out that there was a constellation of things that came together to create whatever whatever degree of success it was you you brought to mind a thing I love because I love trick answers to tricky questions too and so like you must have had it now and then where you get asked so how long does it take you to write a sermon yeah yeah yeah and my answer now always is my entire lifetime yeah yeah and you just said that right yeah yeah in your story and so it's taken my entire life to write the sermon that I just presented and why should we try and quantify it into something else yeah you know what we shouldn't start anything else okay well well P in a Gerardian sense what I was thinking was thinking of mimetic theory if I were to start a channel I have to first work through in terms of this self-leadering self-leading my need to have 14,000 subs so to outdo Paul van der Klay because that's mimetic theory in action so I would have like you said I have to find my own reasons if I'm going to I'm going to do my own channel well I would be happy if you did have 14,000 I I I think yeah and it's I but again my rule still holds and actually but one of my you know I tell my kids too because they're young I say you probably don't want to do this because you know I remember Tim Keller saying anything I'd write in my 20s I'd want to burn you know anything in my 30s or 40s wasn't right now that I'm in my 50s it's okay to start writing and I think there's there's a lot of wisdom in that and so and so yeah I can I can go ahead and make mistakes on YouTube and I can live with it yeah all right Pete so I permission to post this right okay so we'll see if we'll see if you get any vortex action yeah or or I could be the next guy living on your on the Lord's Landing there this foundation of the Lord we got a space for you here Pete okay good okay it's quite a bit warmer here in Sacramento than it is in Edmonton Alberta well most of the time yes take care buddy all right Pete take care bye bye
