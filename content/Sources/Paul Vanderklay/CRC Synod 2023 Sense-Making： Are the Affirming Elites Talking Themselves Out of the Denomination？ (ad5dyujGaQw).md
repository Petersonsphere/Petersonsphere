 Hi, this is Paul. I promised in my video I released Wednesday that I would try to do some more synod content and there's as I mentioned in that video there's a lot of Sense making that's going on in the denomination and that sense making comes out now in YouTube form It comes out in more traditional forms Such as blogs blogs are now traditional Magazines take so long they they barely come out. I haven't I I Know many people have tried messaging me on Facebook and I never answer because I hate Facebook and I never look at it Including the messages every now and then I have to go there because my mom messages me and I have to read my mom's messages I gotta read my mom's message. It's all I can say but everybody else is I kind of ignore but my mom will then find things on Facebook and send them to me via email or Another messaging platform that she knows I check regularly that we keep for the family. So she sent me this article and And I thought it's something I want to chew on for those of you who haven't seen it my friend Pete Vanderbeek who was on the first day conversation live stream He Pete Pete's played around with YouTube a little bit He's got 46 subscribers, but this video that he made about Senate has a has 1400 views So good for you Pete Pete's also very active on CRC voices and has been for years and Pete's another one of these CRC ministers That I know from voices and and we became friends through voices I thought it was a really good video and I'm actually gonna respond to his response video back and forth Because that's kind of the way we do things now but Say so you haven't seen it check it out and But I really wanted to talk about this piece because this piece by David hook Emma I think really gives you a sense of Well, this is sort of how the Christian Reformed Church would communicate with each other After blogging was there now the Reformed Journal is a very important moniker in the Christian Reformed Church. I Have a book here in my office the best of the Reformed Journal I grew up with my father reading the Reformed Journal and some of the videos that I made about burning the wooden shoes You know Henry Henry Staab and this cadre of Christian Reformed Intellectuals that came out of the Second World War ready to sort of take on the their particular posture of the Kyperian vision really In many days for for many of the boomer generation sort of this is this this is the golden age of Calvin College This is the golden age of the Christian Reformed Church and really what sin had 2023 does in their minds is the end of a dream it is it is absolutely catastrophic they in 2022 they imagined that well, maybe this was a blip But as I had been writing and saying on my youtube channel, no, this is no blip this is in fact their rain is over and It is and it is about to come crashing down and so many of the people who are just a minority But they've tended to be the establishment they've tended to be the ruling elite in the Christian Reformed Church are basically in The last year they were in shock now they are in Despair and and you can see you can see some of that here in this blog David Hookama retired in 2018 from Calvin College Where he had served for 26 years as academic administrator and philosophy professor Susan B Hookama who contributed extensively to this reflection retired in 2016 from a career in law in Group practice in federal and county courts David and Susan worship at at Sunside Sunside Presbyterian in Tucson in winter and in summer they have been worshiping at second CRC in Grand Haven Second Grand Haven is where my friend Tim Blackman is Pastoring and I as I mentioned in the previous minute video I had lunch with him on Monday because he was up in man mount Herman for high camp Which he has done regularly and I told him I want to get him on the channel to do a randos interview And he said he's ready so that'll come at some point, but he's got to finish up high camp But I've I've known Tim for many years and he's a he's a dear friend And so I really look forward to having him on the channel This David Hookama as we get into what he wrote on the reform journal again this for a lot of outsiders really is Well how to describe the reform journal Is it the Atlantic? Magazine of the Christian Reformed Church it is it is the it is the it has been the epicenter of the of a particular Of a particular establishment and regime that again for many people in the Christian Reformed Church was The golden age of the denomination and the golden age of Calvin College It was that was where all of this flourishing in this Christian Reformed Renaissance took place I've obviously done a lot of writing on voices over the last few days because again We're doing all this sense-making route right now and they in the wake of synod 2023 and and one of the things that comes up regularly that I bring up regularly is class and Because this this particular aspect of the Christian Reformed Church where it where it where it flourished tended to be in the academy in the Intelligencia in a particular sort of middle class upper middle class well educated and and Grand Rapids in many ways was sort of the epicenter of that and while Grand Rapids and those churches that sort of participated in that flourishing churches like Nealand and Church of the Servant and Eastern Avenue and Sherman Street to a degree Madison Square where I worshiped when I was in college one of the things that's true is because Calvin College and Calvin Seminary Calvin University and Calvin Seminary are such a that almost anyone who is in leadership in the Christian Reformed Church has at one point or another been a member of basically a handful of churches in classes Grand Rapids East that will give you a sense of just how Foundational that classes has been for the history of the Christian Reformed Church Especially after the Second World War and in terms of this Renaissance While this was going on other aspects of the Christian Reformed Church have been withering Wyoming Michigan Maybe I'll pull up a map Even though Nealand Avenue. I think I heard it's Senate. They were founded basically like something like 1917 so they would have been sort of a second wave Christian Reformed Church because The the Christian Reformed history really gets marked by these waves of immigration So they would have been sort of an expansion church, but but they're located in the in the old neighborhood where generation after generation of Christian Reformed people would have would have been there and you'd have a number of churches in this area Now if you if you swing out to a place like Wyoming, Michigan Wyoming Michigan is a place where Christian Reformed churches have been in freefall for a while Wyoming Michigan was sort of a blue class Blue-collar suburb you had a General Motors plant there That was the that was the community that my my wife's there. They tended to be Baptist my well My wife's father was Lutheran and her mother was Baptist. So that became an interesting duality in for her growing up, but Wyoming Granville the these sort of Southwestern suburbs tended to be much more blue-collar Calvin College, of course on the Nulcrest campus would Would be down here and then the Christian Form Church would sort of Expand into this area and continue to grow out There were Christian Reformed churches on the northeast side But again that the southeast Grand Rapids tended to be again that sort of the the Intelligentsia of the Christian Reformed Church the Wyoming churches have have been in freefall for a very long time the Northeast churches sort of got sucked into Into Sunshine which became a mega church for a while under Pastor John And then there were issues arose and that sort of collapsed sunshine So there's just just a ton of history that that's there. That's important for the Christian Reformed Church but the again classes Grand Rapids East has sort of been the elite and David hook Emma his story bears that out because this this elite cadre Tends to be intergenerational the planting a family that had Alvin planting and I didn't get a chance to have Alvin planting when I was at Calvin He was he was gone to Notre Dame by the time I got there, but I had Richard Mao. I Had Nick Nick Waltersdorf. He was there for a brief spell And then I had Neil planting at the seminary Neil was the youngest of that planting a family their father was a psychologist At Calvin and my mother had their father as a psychology professor at Calvin So this is the article that David hook Emma wrote and it really gives a sense of the history that's going on here Last week's discussion of inclusiveness and church order at the Christian Reformed Church's Annual synod evoked memories of an earlier debate that dragged on for decades And many times as I've talked about this debate I've talked about the women in church office fight in the ways that that this is similar yet different Could women be ordained to church office in the 1970s? The CRC and a synod formed several study committees on in succession in succession that In the 1970s, the Church of Christ was ordained to the church office In the 1970s CRC and a synod formed several study committees in succession Dealing with that question. This is a blog so it isn't edited. So there'll be those kinds of things in it Yes said the first committee in 1973. There are no biblical grounds against it. Yes said the second committee in 1975 so did more committees reported 1978 and 1982 with some qualifications deacon only for now rather than move forward with church order changes However Senate assigned yet another study committee to explain the principle of headship in church and family And so I was growing up through this whole debate I was I was born in the early 60s and so I I listened Senate synodical and Christian reformed politics were table talk at the table that I grew up in and People had sides and this went back and forth my church was progressive on these issues and This debate went on and on and on and again because the church Christian from church is so familiar These things get these things get personal now It's it's helpful to note that This way of having synodical study committees has been the general method by which the Christian reform Church Tries to manage its affairs with respect to these things the part of Harry Boors book about his journey through the grava through the gravamen process The most interesting parts of this book for me were very much How the Christian reform Church tries to manage these things and the kinds of things he wrote were Basically he told some really uncomfortable truths that While sort of the intelligentsia of the Christian reform Church fights over these things For the most part he Harry Boor imagined or wanted to believe that that this would be That these debates at least back a generation before when he was debating Reprobation that these debates would sort of be big communal issues Well, this wasn't but women in church order women in church office, of course was Because of course, you've got passages in the Bible Your women should be silenced. You've got a passage in 1st Corinthians. You've got a passage in 1st Timothy. And so This became this became sort of the war within the Christian reform Church now This class element in the Christian reform Church is really critical for understanding For understanding the way that these debates go intergenerationally because synod will represent not just sort of the establishment intelligentsia of people with advanced degrees, but they'll represent also the elders and local pastors and people that are just distributed throughout the US and Canada and The opinions that they have and the ways that they themselves continue to soak up and sort of assimilate into the broader religious environment of North America as does the elite intelligentsia My father retired seminary professor Anthony hook Emma now I I know mentioning this some of you will right away You'll perk up your ears because Anthony Anthony hook Emma held What was one of the key prestigious chairs in the denomination? Which was the chair of systematic theology? Here's a book by Anthony hook Emma. My favorite of his books is is on eschatology I I that's the book that I've pulled off the shelf probably most often you can see the spine has faded But the original yellow is on the cover and and this is just basic reformed soteri ology and And Anthony hook Emma he was by the time I got to seminary. He was already retired He was already retired you'd see him popping in and out of the of the seminary The Calvin seminary section of the library and you'd see him, you know in the in the coffee You'd see him having coffee with professors and and he was known he had a reputation for being a very gentle man a very kind man and Yeah, and so in his you know, basically what he did in his retirement was he he basically wrote down his class notes and they became books sort of following the My libraries on a little bit of disarray because I started reorganizing books and never finished Following burkoff who was there before him and I couldn't find my big fat blue burkoff systematic theology and and that was sort of the tradition and so Anthony hook Emma held one of the most important posts in the middle of the 20th century at Calvin seminary in the Christian Reformed Church and was a lovely man and a diligent servant and and wrote books that if you read something like this you'd have a real sense of the Christian Reformed Church as it was sort of emerging out of the counterculture not really out of the counterculture in the midst of the counterculture and The battles that were going on there and this was sort of a mature steady User accessible reform theology that that you could read and it's again, it's um Nobody growing up in the Christian Form Church and God having gone through catechism Would be surprised by anything you'd find in this book and it would be warm and welcoming and he also wrote a book about about different cults and sex sex SECTS such as Seventh-day Adventist Jehovah's Witnesses LDS etc, etc My father retired seminary professor Anthony hook Emma was asked to advise that committee in our family We knew of his misgivings about women's ordination He had welcomed and encouraged female students as long as they aspired to be teachers not pastors Now the committee was preparing to argue that scripture not only assigns husbands headship over their wives and families But also requires women teaching Sunday school to serve under male supervision This is one of the ways in which these issues tend to Again thinking about renee garrard Mimetic rivals begin to look like each other one of the ironies of the women in church office fight was that women Were able to do a number of things that were taken away from them when this fight started To occur which which brought out in a way a sort of a neo-conservatism as the progressives were trying to continue Their work in the church, of course In 1984 synod my father surprised everyone his family even his committee when he announced that on further reflection and study He could no longer endorse a general principle of gender hierarchy Headship in biblical teachings. He concluded is relevant to christian marriage, but not to other contexts Synod passed the report despite my father's recantation ordaining women was therefore out of the question Susan and I managed Maintained our membership in and very close personal ties to a christian reformed congregation that we had helped organize church of the servant I've mentioned church of the servant a little bit I've mentioned church of the servant a little bit I don't really know their pastors. They went outside the crc to get their pastors. And so uh This is another This is this is something else that has been happening over the last 20 years. Whereas before then Christian from churches pretty much just got ministers that were trained mostly Within the christian from church there are odd exceptions, but those exceptions are more and more And I think this again is part of the assimilation process of the denomination into the larger christian communities in north america church of the servant was sort of a counter-culture christian reformed church that experimented with liturgy and so in fact was Much more high church with respect to their liturgy than many christian reformed churches were but but also Very let's i'll call them experimental they met in a school gym in one of the christian school gyms Which they did for a long time eventually as I mentioned in my previous video Purchasing ground near the new calvin campus and building a building a church there and as you might have seen in In the video that I did with a group of christian reformed ministers They also have had internships and again Many christian reformed ministers that go through grand rapids will have ties to these churches These churches are very influential in terms of shaping ministers Church of the servant even while living far from crc churches We could no longer remain in a denomination unwilling to recognize that its rule of for church office rose from patriarchal culture not scripture That's a that's a really interesting move there and it's sort of you know I I sort of want to ask who told you it was patriarchal Riffing a little bit on genesis 3 um What exactly and and so of course, okay scripture is not patriarchal and what do you mean by that word and So so right away you can sense the broader conversations coming into This conversation I should mention this this piece of writing which I think is is also To me, it's it's up there with the burning the wooden shoes article james scott was not in the grand rapids intelligentsia he instead was in the alternate group out there in Uh at dork college now dork university and in 2007 at the 50th celebration anniversary of the Split off that formed the christian reform church. He wrote I thought a really important article about Where the christian reform church was going to go? And he was I think reading the culture well and one of the things that he essentially wrote was that the christian reform church in many ways no longer Controls its own weather that the christian reform church in many ways is subject to all of the Influences that are out there in the broader culture and I don't mean just progressives. I mean progressives conservatives We're all swimming in it and those tensions that are pulling at the churches outside All have their proxies within our within the christian reform church as well Which is I think part of the reason that many of you have found The conversation going on within the christian reform church interesting because it mirrors some of your own experiences Participating in the life and ministry of episcopal lutheran and congregational churches in new jersey minnesota and delaware And and so here you can see Again the point that I made after the second world war The christian reform church in a sense begins taking down its walls And it becomes part of all of the other Conversations going on and so this this tension between the main line and the evangelical really begins to intensify in the christian reform church So participating in life and ministry of episcopal lutheran and congregational churches in new jersey minnesota and delaware Susan and I value the ways in which each proclaimed the gospel and advanced the kingdom When our daughter sought confirmation in our episcopal church We transferred our membership to for the first time since our baptism. We were former crc members For more of that look at christian reform fork in the road confessional identity or family ties This has just been ringing throughout many of my conversations with christian reform ministers Many who have come into the denomination said, you know, I don't you know With all due respect your family history is family history. It's not the church I came here for the confessions and basically what we've seen is that both progressives and conservatives in the christian reform church are Fighting over their what is in some ways their family thing They're they're there for the oldie bolin and the christian school and all of those things And the other people coming especially from other ethnic groups beyond the dutch are saying I came here for the doctrine And you act like this is your personal property We moved back to michigan in 1992 to pursue our careers in academic administration and in the legal practice To our dismay the christian reform church is still barring women from the pulpit now remember they've joined the episcopalians I rejoined the church where my parents were longtime members and where I spent my childhood neil and avenue crc Susan followed suit only in 1996 when women called to ministry were at last permitted to serve in crc churches 23 years after theological objections had been debunked at synod now Notice she joins only when this particular issue So she's there for the doctrine too, and i've had people on both sides of this tell me I'm not going to join a church that isn't affirming and when I say people on both sides, I mean people in sacramento They might participate here, but they won't take their formal membership It's sort of a little silent protest or other people that would participate here But wouldn't become formal members because we ordained women in office and so It's very interesting the way these issues sort of lurk with respect to people's practice and people's membership Remain there until after another move We joined susan's parents at their grand haven michigan church second crc where my friend tim blackman pastors as administrator and faculty member at calvin I was deeply grateful and happily surprised to see it becoming a welcoming Home for lgbtq students even after the community wrestled with difficult questions of gender sexuality and marriage In our ever more polarized society respectful dialogue on matters of sexuality and marriage Is a rare and precious achievement we discerned a similar spirit in the life of our congregation from time to time Now with respect to calvin calvin's been working very hard at this In many ways the christian foreign position has been Since 1973 and continues to be that People Are same-sex attracted through no fault of their own They have to figure out what to do with this aspect of their sexuality And how to proceed with it and so calvin has done a lot of work with this tried to be welcoming of people who are same-sex attracted and they have Conversations while maintaining the position of the christian reform church now. I know having said this others will point to tweets And papers written by members of the faculty that say well Can you really straddle this have you been clear and this kind of thing? this kind of discussion normally swirls around calvin with respect to the With respect to all sorts of issues in in the university But calvin sort of tried to work that divide within the christian reform church while on one hand Holding officially holding to the position and on the other hand understanding that students are going to come with A lot of different positions and it's their job to care for these students now There's some nuance here because In many respects the christian reform church hasn't changed its policy with respect to this um The policy that the posture that the christian form church has had since 1973 has really remained the same and a community wrestling with this Is at least for some for some people understood as code for Oh, we're going to get there imagining that there is a particular destination It's it's unusual for people to imagine that well, we're i'm going to wrestle with it But i'm going to eventually rest On a conservative position But this happens regularly I gotta think about whose names I want to mention because These names are known and these these things are known rather than digging out names of Which could get me in trouble. We'll just use this speech given on the floor of senate that I thought this was one of the Uh, one of the best speeches given at this synod reservations about the majority report I told this body early. He's talking about the gravamen report uh how to because the gravamen the crc's gravamen situation is kind of a mess and it clearly needs to be Uh straightened out and and it's it's actually a very complex thing to do And so this individual is talking about his journey with respect to Affirming or not affirming same-sex marriage at least in the church Earlier in this week that I hold to a traditional biblical and theological position on gender and sexuality I'd like to briefly tell you how I got there. I was 15 years old when I okay the sound was a little low So i'm i'm upping the sound he said he he now holds to a traditional position and he'd like to say how he got there realized, uh that I was a homophobe when a male Uh gay member of my family walked up to me in a family gathering and put his hand on my shoulder And said how you doing brain? And I visibly and demonstrably Shrunk away from him and removed his hand from my shoulder by moving my shoulder away And he knew what that meant and I knew what that meant which is that I did not want him to touch me I didn't want anything to do with him Over the next number of years I went to college this institution I made a number of lgbtq plus friends here and I came to the conclusion that the only way I could love and care for LGBTQ plus people was to become fully affirming. Okay now so we went to calvin and He he came to the conclusion that well, you should be fully affirming and he did that at calvin I know some people are going to be like, oh no, see that's that's the problem Nobody should who goes to calvin should be doing that and again This is what I talk about when I talk about the mind of the machine you're not going to sort of Control people by managing information that the walls are down. The internet is here You're going to have to let people go through the process of figuring things out and that process is going to mean Meeting people with different opinions meeting people with different ideas working these issues through and so this is brandon Um brandon, I didn't I didn't see what I can look it up later See who he is, but currently ministering the christian from church somewhere. I imagine And I continued to hold that position then all the way through my seminary education at calvin theological seminary My last year in seminary though I began to have reservations about holding a fully affirming position and during the first two years of minutes and I really like What he does here because he notes that People are very fluid inside our we don't choose our beliefs our our beliefs just sort of rise up And it doesn't mean they're unformed or mysterious they There are beliefs Ministry at brookfield crc in classes wisconsin. I shifted back to a traditional biblical understanding That whole process took about 10 years And specifically my move back from an affirming position to a traditional position took about two to three years And I have reservations that this majority report greatly Decreases the freedom for people to go through that sort of wrestling because it is not simple and it is not quick and putting Timelines and strictures on people like that. I think short circuits the process so I would actually move that we table the majority report, okay, so again People evolve people emerge and they don't just go one way and Actually, if they have gone through a process and they arrive at some place someplace They and if the process is good, they tend to be a little bit firmer in the place that they wind up so Okay, let's continue with the let's continue with this As an attorney susan assisted churches with some legal matters and later She was appointed to the board of trustees and then to the council of delegates of the christian reform church In her leadership role, she gained greater admiration for the prophetic witness and wide-ranging programs of the denomination Now part of what has Part of the problem of all of the external proxy wars coming into the christian reform church is that words now become Have a charge like prophetic. Okay, that's leftist Whereas actually It's quite a bit in many cases if you want to be counter See, it's not even majority minority counter the prevailing winds As that one comedian on joe rogan noted, you know all these kids in high school They they they want to be rebellious. So they they take on a traditional Sexual morality and now suddenly they're standing out from the crowd But after six years of service She was deeply troubled by the council of delegates members efforts to circumcise to circumscribe the work of mercy and justice office and to elevate Doctrinal purity over compassion Now you're seeing attention. Okay, there's doctrinal purity and compassion now, of course I think lurking behind this tends to be a countercultural Stereotype And and people have made these points before Let's say mercy and justice might All of these words take on certain valences and become proxies for certain other positions And I want to get into this question of relationality versus order when I get into pete's video a little bit Release of the human sexuality report and deepened our fears for the future of the christian reform church rather than continue to a process of inquiry and discernment and again that tends to be a process of Well Evolution along the lines of the rest of the country since the counterculture The report sought to close off debate and now that's a fair thing that he's saying and that part of what was unusual about the hsr committee in sin in 2016 was that they They dictated that the report that the committee all be basically subscribed to the 70 to the 73 report or at least the essence of the 73 report and and that bothered some people because sort of the The expectation you can see this back with the women in office thing sort of the expectation was that well the progressives would Who basically are the intelligentsia and the establishment would basically slowly win the fight? And maybe politically the church would draw up a local option and then evolution could continue the same way But no, so in fact they they decided who would be on the committee. They looked for ethnic diversity They looked for same-sex attracted individuals and and actually the I won't get into all the details So Rather than explore the the meaning of faithful Christian marriage and rapidly changing legal and social context the report condemned loving and covenantal same-sex partnerships as Irremediably sinful you can't remedy that After the report was adopted in 2022 churches across the continent submitted overtures asking that it's that it's harsh and Unqualified judgments be tempered by compassion and patience Just last week senate 2023 rejected all those appeals Now again even sort of the framing of this is well, this is this is kind of big bad order versus So I know some of you out there are saying okay boomer I'm not sure that's sort of the valence and so there's lots of different layers to the sensibilities around a piece like this Is this the beginning of another decades-long dispute that will cause deep pain to many faithful members Distract the church from every other aspect of its work in the world in silence respectful descent What can we say to parents whose children have forsaken the church even their faith because of the prejudice and hostility they have Experienced there. It's very careful with his language When we learned that yet another young adult disowned by his christian reform CRC family because he is gay has sunk into despair and taken his own life. How shall we comfort his friends? I know some of you reading this are really getting triggered just hold on to yourselves. Okay The hurt and pain that susan and I felt Listening to hateful and ignorant comments on the centered floor cannot be compared to the damage done to our lgbtq christian friends and their families and This this pretty much you heard many speeches that were along this line. This pretty much Has the template for one side of the debate? Can we remain in a denomination whose deliberations and pronouncements are so devoid of humility and compassion And and this is where I think Including this the jake tapper cnn comment and others Last year I made videos basically saying The left is going to leave It's really hard for the left to leave because it has been their house for 70 years It has been their house for 70 years And the shock of these two senates are that it is no longer their house. They no longer have the political power to Forstall this It's the the demographics of the denomination has changed I wrote in a recent article that Part of the reason for this and i've made this argument before on the channel is that many of the churches that were there in terms of the women in church office fight churches that would have been the places where this Establishment elite that could sort of easily go in and out of the main line Those churches are gone. Those churches in some ways were sort of mainline ish and they were in wealthy Suburban or urban communities around the country as the boomers aged they retired sold their significant Appreciation in their home values and retired to grand rapids where you could buy a much more Affordable home and then be around all the people that were part of your family or you went to college with and so the churches in northern new jersey and greater los angeles and In In the san francisco bay area that were some of the more progressive churches In the 70s and 80s simply are no more or are not what they were and whereas it's been a big debate and a big cause of concern in the christian reform church when during the 1960s 50s and 60s when the old immigrant communities Localities and zip codes like where the old calvins campus was like where neil and avenue is Those old neighbors the the dutchman began to rise in affluence and move out of those neighbors neighborhoods into other suburban communities You had then during the counterculture and the civil rights movement the question of white flight Many of those churches like neil and tried to stay in the neighborhood and tried to do ministry And they were very few very few had a lot of success with african-american communities but an interesting thing to look at would be to look at the 80s 90s and aughts as these boomer crc elite intelligentsia establishment churches in these world-class american cities Also were unable to reach out to people like themselves in those neighborhoods and for those reasons those churches died The churches in the christian forum church that have not died Have been Churches generally in rural areas and agricultural areas That have tended to skew more conservative more populist and That is i've used the number before that is that that is probably 70 of the christian reform church And while churches in places like the san francisco bay area greater los angeles and northern new jersey Have basically withered and in some cases gone away completely churches and many of the rural areas have Continued to hold their own if not grow now There are exceptions around there and some of you may note the exceptions and that's right There are exceptions, but for the most part This has been the dynamic and part of that circulatory system that I mentioned in in previous videos Tended to bring the retiring boomers back to grand rapids and that's part of the reason that grand rapids is so out of step With the rest of the denomination It is difficult to say susan had already found the exit door the human sexuality Report compounded her concerns about the church's direction and two years ago She transferred her membership to our winter church home south side presbyterian in tucson So a little bit internet stuff south side presbyterian is pc usa has an affirming statement and It's interesting if they if they really want to go to an interesting church in tucson They should check out the village, but the village won't be affirming You'll find incredible diversity at the village, but again, my guess is one of the one of the things that will separate Let's say this this pc usa church. Where did I lose? Did I lose it? This pc usa church from a church, let's say like the village was probably class um the village is a Is a very blue collar Um, even though you do have some college professors some of them are on voices It's a very it's a very It's sort of a different class. They're they're sort of They're they're much more exer and uh millennial Than I would imagine pc. I don't know i've never been to the pc. I don't want to mischaracterize them, but These kind of issues tend to be what we see happening in the denomination I've not yet followed her out. He is the son of anthony hookama. He is the son of One of those elite families in the christian reform church That sunday worship in conversations and in shared projects my pastors and fellow parishioners in grand haven challenged me to search the scriptures And seek the kingdom and again he himself is in a church I'm in my writing and teaching i'm motivated by the reformed ideals of inquiry reading god's word in nature and scripture and discerning its Meaning through collaborative study the human sexuality report instead brings a simplistic preconception rigid gender gender duality to its exposition of both science scripture and science To walk away from a church and attrition has shaped me since childhood will not be easy But two sentence have offered us doctrinaire pronouncements in place of dialogue There have been um, they have condemned as heretic heretical followers of jesus who come together Gay straight trans queer and praise and prayer. There's the great healer now inviting us to exit the door from a broken denomination So this is the sense making that's going on and I'll put in a bid for estuary But yeah, so this is a this is a good example 23 comments Um, and and I think I think this is this is what we're going to see I admire your thoughtfulness and journey in life. I'm married in 1972. I'm among my husband joined the rca congregation in holland, michigan So that's that's what's happening that's what's happening so Yeah more sense making and this is going to happen throughout the year So here the map when synod 2024 comes around will be interesting to see because there are layers to this of course individuals make Choices and again why let's say a split left in the crc would be so different Is that again generally speaking churches tend to split right and leak left and that left leaking? is part of the reason why The numbers are so it's the 70 30 split that's in the christian reform church right now, so anyway, um Yeah, that's that's his piece and uh, leave a comment let me know what you think Oh, I wanted to make one more point that I almost forgot to make. Let's see if I can I was talking to eric and he was having a conversation on twitter with cedric parcels Cedric parcels was the guy who wrote the article in abide about the gravamen and eric mentioned rita's question on the floor of senate that was the the video that I played in the wednesday the senate wednesday video and she was the one who Really senate sort of came to a head at that moment when when she asked, you know, can my children be a part of this church? Um cedric said what the reporter in the chair could have said is that senate 1964 ruled that the churches can allow disagreement With the confessions provided that the members remain teachable do not seek to undermine the confessions and were otherwise reformed Uh, they just can't be office bearers Uh eric writes back. Thanks for the reply cedric. That was my sense as well. It was my sense as well. There's That's why there's so much Nuance with respect to this in many ways. There's sort of different levels of subscription based on Reasonable expectations of people and their life and And teaching and and you saw that in the plea of that one pastor saying, you know, you make this gravamen You make this gravamen ruling too tight and That's actually going to do some damage. I'm going to make some videos about some of my ideas I might even write or at least collaborate with some people on an overture for senate 2024 With respect to the gravamen situation because i've definitely got some thoughts on it I suspect the floor of senate would have benefited from the clarity you just displayed here and again cedric speaking from Now that he's been on the abide videos and written on the website He will definitely be associated with the conservative wing of the christian reformed church Thank you cedric writes unfortunately the report in the chair of the committee weren't as knowledgeable as they probably ought to have been It was very frustrating to watch Uh ken deborah asked but can they make profession of faith cedric says I should clarify that senate 1964 was addressed Whether someone had to completely agree with the confessions or in order to become Confessing members in other words to make profession of faith and the answer is no people make professions of faith Um Appropriate to their ability and given some of the lord children at the lord's table Things that have happened in the christian reformed church some professions of faith have gotten younger than before Uh, there are professions of faith made by disabled adults who obviously are not going to comb through the doctrinal life or the standards of the christian reformed church and so So even though synod 2023 very much sought to tighten many of these things that tightening happens also within an understanding of the three levels of the church and One of the things that I keep trying to remind people is that each synod stands alone And each synod is a body that stands alone. So here again you're talking about synod 1964. You often heard synod in 1975 Synod 1976 synod 2022 synod 2023 The christian reformed church is actually governed by the conversations between these synodical bodies over time you'll see Things change and and even in david hookama's piece you see the transformations that have happened in the body so in that sense the church is very much a living thing and Things go in and out of the consciousness of the church I've been doing a lot more christian reformed church reading and I so I picked up this book by my old seminary professor henry zwanstra Which I think was his doctoral dissertation uh reformed thought and the experience in a new world a lot of the early the early Fights in the christian reformed church is a very small very immigrant denomination We would look at today and think History is like that so Yeah, we'll we'll see but part of what I think we see in in the sense making is that um a lot of people who Hope that the christian reformed church will track main line Um are beginning to see the handwriting Excuse me the handwriting on the wall and and especially when they sort of mischaracterize for the sake of Argument and rhetoric which there was a lot of on the synod floor a lot of sort of Argumentation that if you pass this then Well Then what then they won't feel welcome. Well, that was actually the case at calvin with respect to What he wrote about calvin I? knew many people that wouldn't go to calvin because Their posture was too non-affirming and they wouldn't go to calvin because of the posture of the christian reformed church before synod 2022 And now again the argument is with the trajectory with the direction of the conversations of Multiple synods and and that's again where we tend to see the trend line. So now i'm ending the video
