 Hi, this is Paul and I'm continuing on my commentary series on the Synod of the Christian Reformed Church. I know for some of our my regular viewers this is probably a frustration because first my regular stuff was interrupted by the quest for a spiritual life conference at the Crosspoint Church in Chino, California and over the last week I've been pumping out all of that material, haven't done a lot of my own material and now I'm doing all of this Christian Reformed Church Synod material so I'm sorry about that. This is stuff that I am watching for work as well and also I make these videos hopefully as a help to Christian Reformed people for whom Synod is a bit of a mystery. There are a lot of mysteries around this but this is where a lot of the decisions made that shapes the Christian Reformed Church and shapes its future are made and I know that even even CRC ministers who watch this thing sometimes to the degree that they watch it they're not they're not familiar with how Synod works they're not familiar with any of them some of them just don't really care about it. This year there are a number of issues that pertain to the denomination. I've always been interested in this stuff in my blog Leading Church before I got started on YouTube. I would comment on a lot of this stuff and it's something that interests me and hopefully I can help make the important aspects of it understandable to more people in the denomination so that more people can participate and and really basically join the Christian Reformed Church. Now one of the difficulties that a lot of people have it used to be back in the day that when the Christian Reformed Synod started live streaming they used a different website now they simply live stream on YouTube. What's difficult for a lot of people on YouTube is sort of knowing how to get around it. This is the Christian Reformed Church in North America's main page on the YouTube site and once people learn that they might subscribe there's about a thousand subscribers I think a lot of people in the Christian Reformed Church just don't watch it this way or get to it from the denominational website but if you go to YouTube and then you search CRCNA or Christian Reformed Church of North America and you click on the page you'll get this and suddenly you'll realize wait where where's all the Synod stuff. Now if you look on this line here you see home and then you see videos and you still won't see a lot of stuff well there's Saturday morning but then if you go to the live tab here oh these are all of the these are some of the live recordings and that's where you can more easily find some of the videos that are maybe a little bit a while ago but not quite there so that's where you can find them if it's not live if it is live you can look down in this subscription area and you can see other things that other channels that you might be subscribed to to subscribe to a page in YouTube you first have to if you have a Gmail account or any other account it works well with Gmail because YouTube and is owned by Google or Alphabet Corporation you log in and then it will keep your subscriptions and it will give you notifications and it'll give you notifications when different when different sites are live. Now the afternoon session just ended they have their breaking for dinner and for the Synod photo and then they will have an evening session tonight Synod was pretty busy today they got through a fair amount of stuff I want to highlight a few other things now for you. This is the site I used to do a lot of work with I still keep leadingchurch.com as a place where I can sort of grab links and put things that I want I don't put stuff that I I necessarily endorse on my site my site isn't really used to sort of popularize popularized videos but rather it's just a filing cabinet for me to grab stuff that I might be interested in and I might want to refer to back later. The Advisory Committee reports so one as I mentioned before what happens at Synod is that big agenda goes to these advisory committees that are that's basically a Synod portioned out. If you followed today's plenary sessions carefully you probably noted that there were some empty seats that's because of some of the advisory committees have already have not finished their work. Now you can see on this page Synod 2023 documents there are some things that are highlighted and some things that are have gone cross through and so if you click on something like Synodical Services 1A this is the Advisory Committee report so what happened was that massive agenda was proportion a portion to these different advisory committees and you can see something of the structure of these advisory committees. Some of these advisory committees like basically one through six are sort of standing advisory committees every year Synod has committee one, committee two, committee three, committee four, committee five, committee six and they usually have the same jobs each year those advisory committees even though they're not really standing committees in the Christian Reformed Church just in terms of the process of Synod it's just easy to keep those sort of as standing committees and then they add additional committees depending on what's on the agenda how many overtures are there to sort of divide all the work so committee seven is human sexuality and community and committee eight is church order two and they will be dealing with probably a lot of the issues again surrounding the 2022 Synod and some of the decisions made at that Synod so if you click on a committee report you'll see that oh look here's an advisory committee Derek Seil is the chair and Neil Jaspers is the reporter and they've already been on today and they've run through a number of these things and this is basically what comes before Synod and then Synod acts on the advisory committee report now things can get edited things can get changed but this is basically what Synod does and that then goes into the that then will go into the acts of Synod ACTS the acts of Synod which will be the record of all of the actions of what Synod has done you'll notice that there's a definite formatting to this and this formatting has sort of been standardized for a number of years that way if you're on a committee you sort of get a template and these are the decisions you have to make now the committee can change things but for the most part they keep the formatting the same so that if you read the agenda for Synod then when you read the acts of Synod it all sort of flows through nicely and it's it's fairly it's fairly well organized and the staff does a fair amount of work to try to keep all of this stuff organized okay so I'm at the CRCNA YouTube site and here's the home and I'm gonna go to live and there is the there is the Monday morning session that was this morning and if I click on that then we jump right in and there's a little bit of buffer at first I'm just gonna mute it here so you have opening worship you'll have various messages you'll have prayer and usually spend about a half hour or so and go through that and and then we'll well let's see so first off this morning was the report from the Council of Delegates the COD one of the things that you very quickly realize at Synod is that there is an alphabet soup of denominational acronyms and these shortcuts develop because everybody gets tired of saying Council of Delegates Council of Delegates Council of Delegates so then they start using shorthand COD CRCNA the Council of Delegates is the heir of the Board of Trustees years ago the Christian Reformed Church there were a number of agencies there are sort of five main agencies under Senate and all of those agencies had their own boards then there were also a number of denominational offices that were sort of alongside and Senate sort of looked after all of these things and then they had a thing called the Synodical Interim Committee this was sort of parallel to what was happening at the classes each classes had a classical interim committee and Senate had a synodical interim committee and the purpose of these committees was to carry on the business of classes or Senate in between sessions as the as the structure continued to grow and as things developed increasingly there there was a need for more continual oversight to happen between Senates to carry out the work of Senate in between sessions of Senate and so was it in the 80s or 90s I don't remember I haven't looked this up they developed what was called the Board of Trustees some people called it the Super Board and the job of the Super Board was to sort of look after all of these agencies now I was on the structure committee at last year's Senate and one of the things that is seldom realized is that from an ecclesiastical point of view from a church point of view you have these agencies and you have you have agencies you have offices you have assemblies the assemblies are the local church council the classes and the and the synod and they don't they sort of are all mixed together and they sort of overlap in different ways what there are also are corporations and these corporations are beneath some of the agencies and institutions because the corporations so ecclesiastically that means with respect to the church perspective the assemblies the agencies the boards are all living in the church land but these corporations are living in the legal government sphere for example Calvin College has its own corporation and that corporation interfaces with the legal and economic realities of the United States and the state of Michigan each of the different universities that are mentioned I said Calvin College is old habit each of the different universities all have their own legal incorporations that they use to relate to tax law that they used to relate to all of the sort of legal things there was a corporation that was the Christian Reformed Church okay that dealt with things in the United States and that was Michigan Corp for years and then there was a corporation in Canada because you needed a separate Canadian organization to talk to and deal with Canadian tax authorities Canadian government authorities so you had Michigan Corp and Canada Corp one of the things that happened last year was and Andy was the was the chair of the Council of Delegates was that the Christian Reformed Church added another corporation in Delaware because that's often or it's easy to add a corporation and so one of the things we did last year was clarify some of the corporations beneath the boards and agencies okay back to the story of the Council of Delegates so the Board of Trustees was dealing with the boards and agencies and also with the corporations and there were a lot of questions about well how do the US and Canadian things sort of line up and stack up and that's what Senate 2022 did and I think we did great work and I think we very much dealt with some of the tensions that were below that didn't get a lot of press last year because all of the press was on the Human Sexuality Report but a number of years ago not very many years ago people began to notice that this Board of Trustees seemed to have it seemed to have a lot of power and it didn't seem terribly well connected to the churches there were these regions and Board of Trustees delegates were were sent from the regions but the regions weren't terribly ecclesiastical and they weren't incredibly obvious to people in terms of why they had these regions so one of the things that they did was they transitioned the Board of Trustees into the Council of Delegates the Council of Delegates was much more ecclesiastical because each classes sends a delegate to that council there were concerns about representation in a variety of ways they had at large representation to try to fill out some of those things the the Board of Trustees had equal representation between American and Canadian membership but a lot of people pointed out but the American Church is so much larger than the Canadian Church so is that really fair but then there were questions of well what about by nationality is Canada getting short shrift and so last year Senate really sort of sorted all of that out and there's a tremendous amount of detail in there that I won't go into but last year sorted that out now this is the chair of the Council of Delegates and so he is reporting to use giving Senate his report from the Council of Delegates all of the decisions that the Council of Delegates makes are made in a sense in lieu of Senate so at the end of the year with respect to what's possible and this is where things get complex because the Council of Delegates also has a relationship with these legal corporations that the Christian Reformed Church interfaces with with the United States and Canada so there's Michigan Corp and Delaware Corp and Canada Corp the Board of Trustees also is sort of the legal representative and the legal board of these corporations but it's divided so the Canadian representation on the Council of Delegates are generally speaking the Canada Corp and then you've got the American representations on the Council of Delegates and there they tend to be Michigan Corp and then Delaware Corp is kind of a different thing but I'm not going to go into that and that is actually still continuing to evolve and develop and some of the issues that if you listen carefully you could sort of hear them teased every now and then in this conversation that tends to do a little bit more with Delaware Corp Delaware Corp tends to be more the office of the general secretary so if this stuff continues to evolve and that sort of the underworking of how to run this giant thing I can't sometimes call it the cyborg why do I call it the cyborg it's because it sounds a lot like cyborg and because the church is an organic thing and this is sort of an institutional this is sort of an institutional thing that's supposed to support the organic church but it also has kind of a corporate life to it because it relates it sort of interfaces between all those I call it cyborg because size and Senate and board is in board it's not really a cyborg but it kind of has resonance with that so I listened to Andy's report we can listen to some of it now one church responsible for overseeing coordinating the In this work we enjoy the support and energy of denominational staff we rely on them to carry out the work of our denominations ministries and we depend on our synodical office to ensure that the church enjoys ecclesiastical functions that exist in harmony with our confessions and doctoral standards they work tirelessly obediently and faithfully and we owe them a debt of gratitude they are committed personal personalities and many of them have made them made their lives mission goals beliefs and positions of our beloved denomination in their life's work we have thanked them and encouraged them often on your behalf over the past 12 months the COD and the churches have lived under the shadow of sin in 2022 it was arguably an historic meeting defined by the human sexuality and salt reports you're okay when he says salt reports these are the reports where basically during the pandemic there was a bit of a crisis about Canada has some different laws with respect to donations and international bodies Canada wants to make sure that Canadian dollars are supervised by Canadian individuals and so there were questions about well what is this what is the structure of the corporation of Canada underneath is this fair and the salt reports tried to deal with a bunch of this that all went into to Senate 2022 and Senate 2022 I think set everything up and then the board took over from what Senate 2022 had done part of what has happened over the last number of years really over ever since the Board of Trustees as as we play more Senate sort of in operation you very quickly see that there are a lot of issues that come up and so it's very tempting for Senate to basically say oh Board of Trustees now oh Council of Delegates this is what we want you do the details okay but once you delegate that away you delegate the details and as again we let some we let some Senate discussion around you'll notice synodical candidates are our synodical delegates are in fact sometimes very interested in the details they care about the details the details matter and so on one hand Senate sometimes throws things over to the Council of Delegates and on the other hand looks at the Council of Delegates suspiciously and like you have you seem to have all this power well the Council of Delegates doesn't have any power that Senate hasn't given them and this is part of the tension of how this whole thing goes so again I wanted he says salt reports and I'm sure people hear that and say why are they talking about salt is it because there's so much snow in Michigan and Canada and they salt the roads as is is that the salt they're talking about no they're talking about binational structure and the attempt during the pandemic because actually a number of issues rose during the pandemic because suddenly Senate wasn't meeting and the Council of Delegates which usually sort of has to manage things during the one year period between Senates now had to manage things for three years and this was while there was all this anxiety about you know are our corporations exactly in the right place do we have things that it set up correctly yada yada yada so there is a lot of drama about that Council of Delegates has expended a lot of energy and thought to ensure that our actions were always in keeping with the decisions of Senate and that they did not exceed our role or interfere with the ecclesiastical functions of the local church or assemblies hence that line he's reassuring Senate that we are your servant we're doing what you say and we're not getting out ahead of you and we have worked resolutely to implement each of the recommendations of the salt report as approved by an act of Senate and that work as a result is now complete our denominational ministry of course is much larger and endures beyond any one synodical event we remind ourselves as COD that when Senate ends on the final session of the day our work continues therefore the Council delegates is tasked as part of its work as an interim of Senate now it's important to remember that the Council of Delegates are all volunteers nobody is paid to be on that council or that board now some of those people on the board are ministers and so they they sort of get paid for going to denominational meetings many others are laypeople I believe Andy is a layperson and if I'm incorrect please correct me but I believe that if I recall correctly and so these people are giving their time and if you're on the Council of Delegates it's not an insignificant amount of time they will have two three meetings if you have subcommittees there'll be more meetings so it's a significant amount of work that they're doing and again they're not paid for this work and to provide analysis and other feedback to Senate at every meeting but before I do so quite specifically let me comment on some administrative and ministry matters I do trust that you as leaders read the Council of Delegate minutes highlights which are available online the Office of the General Secretary does a good job of summarizing our deliberations and decisions it's not my intention to use this time to repeat was already made available the salt report spoke of culture and the need for cultural change in our denominational offices agencies and institutions to that end the COD and the denominational administrators have changed our in-house vocabulary we've abandoned corporate speech and eliminated legal terminology when describing each other or the work of our denomination one of the do I still have this thing on fast I was listening fast yeah I do so well maybe it's good maybe I'll keep a little fast tip pro tip Senate is a really good thing to listen to at speed you get 1.5 or 2 if you're really savvy and you know some YouTube tricks and go faster than that because again there's a fair amount of TD me you can kind of go through things now a lot of the things that he's addressing or what our committee did last year and this is kind of hard for a lot of people to to listen to and understand because it's like well what's he talking about he's talking about issues that a group of people over here are very concerned about but that's probably only a small little group of people and he's making the point that well we've done our work we listen to you one of the big points that our committee made last year is you need a thoroughgoing review of all of your labels and so that there are a number of documents here let me show you another one not only does Senate give you this massive agenda then right before Senate they give you another massive supplement to the agenda and then you get all this nomenclature like okay CRC and a leadership framework governance types and article governments governance authority Council of Delegates leadership office office of the general secretary executive leaders general secretary chief administrator chief administrative officer so you go through all of that language and a little while yeah here it is I noticed this this morning now the Canadian Ministry office US when it one of the issues last year was there were sort of the CRC offices and then there was Canada office and a number of Canadians felt well why is there sort of CRC and then we're the exception and they kept saying well it's that's nothing because the CRC is just the US stuff and the can but the Canadian is like no then it should be US and so last year we did a lot of sorting of those labels so you have they wanted sort of parity on both sides and so that people didn't say oh Canadian ministry is an extension of Christian before ministry because then they felt like just a little subgroup they didn't feel like they were a partner and so we changed a lot of the language then you have bylaw changes these things happen and again you can if you're really interested you could drill down and you can get all nerdy on all of the all of the stuff going on here oh yeah here it is governance and organizational vocabulary because part of what was difficult was that we're talking about office and we talked about office in the Christian Reformed Church you might mean minister of the word elder deacon commissioned pastor there's four office maybe you know theological professor but there are these offices in the Christian Reformed Church but then you have the Christian Reformed Church such as pastor church relations or safe church or social justice all these other different offices and so they've done some reworking of that now all of these church services are in an agency called thrive and so one of the things that you know well you're gonna have to clean up what you mean by this word office there's office and organization and there's institutional boards so then you have you have all of this nomenclature that you have joint agreements and then you have GMA JMA's which are joint ministry agreements and that that is a specific understanding you have ministry agencies you have ministry boards ministry organization ministry offices so all of that stuff and now mind you this is a relatively small denomination that is relatively young poor pastor Eric from Fargo is going to Washington DC and he's going to spend months there learning canon law so for the Roman Catholic Church a far larger larger organization a far longer lived organization that in fact had lawyers and such that you know when sort of the Roman Empire falls apart the the Roman Catholic Church just sort of picks up and adds infrastructure to the world to sort of hold it up while the civil authorities are doing what they do with barbarians and Germanic tribes and who all knows what's but even just a small denomination like the Christian firm church has to sort of know what it's talking about when it's using certain words we've chosen to instead use words that will strengthen our ecclesiastical identity and support our focus in our ministry we have an office of the general secretary the Canadian corporation is now replaced with a term Canadian ministry organization or board we no longer speak about the Michigan or US corporations rather the US ministry organization or board we have two administrative and ministry offices the Canadian ministry office in Burlington and the US ministry office in Grand Rapids we have consciously moved away from a focus on legalities to emphasize service and leadership and our roles as ministers the priestly and prophetic dimensions of our calling so so that's part of okay we're going to clean up the language because a big part of the the fight last year the second tier controversy which was about by nationality a lot of that was because of nomenclature because people who are working with this stuff were always thinking corporations but nobody in the church was thinking corporations they were thinking ecclesiastical structures and so they've done a lot of work to sort of clean that up our leadership council structure now includes a senior shepherding team as well as management administrative and advancement councils we work in groups we work together we take decisions together and after listening to each other in settings where all are represented gone are the days of sole executive decisions where power was not shared but tightly held in the hands of one or two instead we work as partners as groups in a way that most more closely resembles what we experience in our local congregations over the course of one of the things that tends to happen at this level of the church is that there are sort of organizational fads and fashions for a while in the denomination in the 90s there was sort of a you know accountability requires directors were specific I was gonna say offices specific individuals in a particular administrative office what might have a desk in the Bach buck stops there and if you know there were all it was always accountability and then they had that for a while and some of the agencies and then it was always broad stuff and then it was groups of people are going to and you tend to have these these fads and fashions blow through the culture and they also then sort of blow through the church because people's expectations from the broader world then color their expectations of the church and we're seeing that now with a whole bunch of new things that the power and privilege stuff the code of conduct stuff there's a dignity committee as I mentioned these things that the ecclesiastical stuff tends to endure much longer and these other things in the cyborg usually kind of rise and fall depending on what's going on in the broader culture now it's easy to get ecclesiastical tribes types sort of get triggered by some of that stuff and it's easy to get triggered by some of that stuff but a lot of that other stuff just tends to come and go and by even saying it this way some people are offended because they're all excited about this stuff and well fair enough because these kinds of things are dealing with important matters such as accountability and fairness and all of those types of things the difficulty with a lot of this is that when we talk about power it's always a very nebulous thing there are many different kinds of power and and usually what people do when they want to let's say address abuses of power is they invest other groups with power in order to invest in order to address the abuses in other groups and so sometimes that's a swing towards a lot of individual authority and sometimes it's a swing towards more oligarchical authority and sometimes it's a swing towards group authority it's also helpful to know that the Christian from church does pays a lot of attention to not having basically the ministers run the place this is a reformational value part of the problem is that for the most part ministers go to every classes meeting they go to Senate more than lay people they're always working in and on the institutions and so they have a knowledge advantage of the institutions which puts lay leaders at a disadvantage so there's a lot of different ways that on these boards and agencies the Christian Form Church tries to sort of balance ministerial positions and lay position so it's not just a bunch of ministers running the show what that means though is that a lot of lay people bring their skills and expertise into these sideboards and their expectations and demands and practices get reflected in these sideboards and so again when there's sort of a a new administrative fashion or concern running through the culture that gets brought into these institutions and because again this is a Protestant church there's a there's always a demand to not let the ministers run away with things then there's tension that comes in and for the most part ministers salaries are paid by all of the lay people so ministers who don't listen to the lay people and in one way or another accommodate a lot of their concerns wind up as ex-ministers I was watching all this this morning and so I wrote a little thing for voices that nobody decided to respond to it was entitled people who are resistant to abuse of power efforts fear abuse of power this is one of the ironies of this situation that what happens is that the ecclesiastical structure sets up new structures in order to try to keep the old structures in check but the old structures were often set up themselves responding to past abuses of power of one form or another it's sort of like the government that wrestles with corruption naming a corruption czar to battle corruption and everyone fearing that the new corruption czar is himself or herself corrupt it continues to baffle me why we reach for a word like czar because nothing communicates autocrat more than the word czar now fortunately in the Christian Reformed Church we have not reached into that I've seen that often in the United States government it's always funny like why are we why are we in this democracy all excited about czars well because a camel is a horse built by committee as the saying often goes so then we look for anti czarist language for the new powerful individuals or committees that employ with extraordinary power in order to address abuse of power all of this of course is to address the real or imagined abuses of power done by structures and systems of power we have given power to in an order to affect change in this world when we want to affect change we give people or institutions or bodies power all of this reshuffling is of course about trust hurt comes into this world but trust can be endured if someone says that the hurt will be fruitful listening is helpful too if you listen to John Van Dock's excellent Chino talk you'll notice he emphasized listening in estuary meetings listening is the sneaky skill of estuary it's a highly democratic process and community and again one of the things that you'll hear throughout Senate is listening listening listening listening we want to listen we want to listen but listening is always in in my video land talking to John Vervecky who's a Canadian cognitive scientist we talk about opponent processing and now doing a lot of thinking that I've done about opponent processing there's a ton of opponent processing going on within the body of synod and within the church and within just about any structure or extended body that we have in the world we need to listen we also need to act because you can spend forever listening and never acting and then suddenly well there's nobody listening and we're just acting but then all sorts of people get hurt and so it's always an opponent processing back and forth to try to keep these things in balance part of the irony of the new attempts to address power is that most is that most often the methods are rather anti-democratic this is a byproduct of the new systems critical mindset of the new ways of addressing past wrongs the answer to abuses of monarchical or papal was democracy divided power distributed power have councils make decisions for church rather than individuals make sure there's plenty of lay people that are working on the structure and not just clergy finding failure abuse and corruption and systems have ironically led back to oligarchical or monarchical leadership mechanisms again and so you'll see this tension this opponent processing tension again and again and again through history and so it's people then what happens often is people react to sort of the new system of control to wring out corruption well of course they must be corrupt because they're against our corrupt in this correct this they're against our new system and this sets up all these Kafka traps that bureaucracies and institutions tend to tend to develop structures are important but there's no substitute for trust trust is the key past year we have noted that we're in a far better place as a culture there's less tension less anger less offense and instead there's an increased desire to work through problems together salt in my humble opinion has turned out to be a synodical home run okay so his opinion they've implemented a lot of the stuff from last year and they were feeling the tensions in the culture before but the the culture of the Council of delegates it's it's a happier group now it seems to be seems to be humming better well that's good for I end this portion of my remarks I feel a strong need to call attention to the tireless service of two members of our denomination who are largely responsible for the salt model of partnership in the joint ministry agreement process we're enjoying harmony and administrative efficiency today largely because of the thoughtful work of Reverend Frederick coning our unpaid consultant and dr. Lloyd van der Quark our interim COD CAO they showed us a way forward and overcame our early skepticism Frederick late us led us to Lloyd and the Council of delegates is so appreciative of Lloyd and all that he did to cement the implementation of the salt model and the joint ministry agreements both men are sought after and yet they interrupted their professional pursuits donated their time generously and in Lloyd's case came out of retirement to serve us in our US Ministry office so there you see and these aren't even individuals that I know but they're gifted individuals they stepped forward and they were able to do a lot of implementing for the Council of delegates and the chair of the council says this has been really good they both have national reputations and have helped several Christian charities and institutions change or administrative structures for the better they have spent more than a thousand hours in professional service to our denomination they'll probably be upset or embarrassed for my having called them out today but I believe they deserve at least some special recognition and public thanks for truly they are servant leaders for several decades Senate has worked to promote diversity and inclusion the more I'm in this work the more I realize how necessary it is for church members and leaders to appreciate and understand one another Christian reform sentence have taken steps to combat racism discrimination and all forms of abuse we have a strong desire it seems to address and static racism discrimination and all forms of abuse spiritual and otherwise our churches and members remind us that all people are to be welcomed and valued and that desire shows up in the ways we choose to spend our resources and energy as a wider part of the difficulty with a lot of this language is that people can get reactive about it I remember some of the first language then gets get sort of a valence and then and then regardless of say what the Webster definition of a word is people get reactive to it but if you listen to carefully what he just said is that you know on one hand we want to be sensitive we want to be sensitive to people and this is an expectation that churches have and people come in all there's a there people come in a lot of people come with a variety of attributes and concerns and you want to be sensitive to this attributes and concerns but there's opponent processing with respect to this that says all right we want to be sensitive but also the show must go on and things must happen which means we make decisions and decisions are always about a selection and selection is always about exclusion we decide to do this and not that we decide to hire this person and not that person we decide to invest our money here and not there every decision is about is every decision is about exclusion I'm including this and I'm excluding that you can't include everything or you don't actually have any power you just have sort of a static nothing and so these are all the issues that that you have with this kind of thing now those were those are some of the main things that I was thinking of during this we'll skip ahead so next up was Zachary King he's the new general secretary I was gonna say executive director because again part of part of what again so you have the cyborg or the cyborg and it's always changing and it's always changing partly because of that tendency of you have all of the lay involvement you have all this cultural change and the church again isn't unlike again a big point to the Protestant Reformation is the church isn't a group of clergy that are running it and everyone else is sort of around there doing what they say this is a big difference in the Christian Reformed Church and even when I was in the in the Dominican Republic the Haitian pastors that we worked with would often have a saying no I have face and la reformada which meant there aren't bosses in the Christian Reformed Church part of that was because in their Haitian culture they had often a series of bosses and the bosses were these little autocrats who would get things done now obviously autocracy works well for at least to a degree for the autocrat but these more distributed systems of governments try to be a little bit more sensitive to those who are in some ways outside of the system and in this little corner that's sort of what we talked about when we talk about this little internet community that's a different part from let's say how do I describe the relationship between myself and this little corner it's a little hard but these are some of the issues that are that are going on now this is this is that King's first state of the church attempt to do a state of the church address let's see if I can get the slide up here there we go now this is something that started a number of years ago when we had so when I talk about the church changing the church used to have a general secretary and the job of the general secretary was basically to keep all of the church order stuff and and the ecclesiastical stuff to keep all of those records tidy and that was the job of the secret general secretary and then we went to the board of trustees and this was at the time of okay I got to be fair I talked about the fashions in the business world we should talk about the fashions in the ecclesiastical world this was the time of the seeker church and I remember in fact at one point interviewing I think it was the same Chino church that we had our estuary meeting and it was caught it wasn't it wasn't cross point at that point it was before the URC split if I recall correctly and a lot of churches were playing with administrative models that were coming from the business world and you would have senior pastors who would make decisions and the elders the senior pastor basically every year could be fired by the elder board or something like that but you had a very different internal church structure than what was traditional in the Christian-informed church that was very much traditionally Christian-informed churches are very much elder led sort of similar to the Presbyterian or elders and deacons depending on the size of the church and the particular nature of the church and so when the Board of Trustees developed they very much said well if we want this cyborg now again this is different from the organic ecclesiastical all the churches synod classes local churches if we want these denominational agencies to really run well we should take clues from the business world because businesses look at large organizations and learn how to really run well so at that point in the denomination we had all of these directors it was the director of this the director of that the director of this director of that everybody knew who they had to report to that whole chain of command all these directors so at the top of the or at the top of the heap we had an executive director of the Christian-informed church now in the last round of restructuring they changed it again and they had again they they added a new corporation which was separate from the Michigan Corp which is sort of the the corporation beneath the cyborg I should draw a picture for this because it gets complicated of of the United States the part of the denomination that's the United States sometimes I talk about big D little D denomination the denomination are the family of Christian-reformed churches in the United States and Canada we'll have to talk about Venezuela at some point I've got thoughts about that and then okay so then you have these denominational agencies and the denominational agencies are under the Super Board and now they're under the Council of Delegates but they've also got these corporations underneath and so you're watching all of that so then they added a new corporation called in Delaware and and this is sort of an intermediary between the two so you have the United States you have Canada and then you have sort of this ecclesiastical organism that ties to it if you want to see a bunch of pretty pictures you can rummage through all the Council of Delegates stuff and you'll find all kinds of pictures trying to diagram this and again in our committee last year we were drawing all kinds of pictures how can we communicate this to Senate so that the Canadians will see their equal partners even if they're smaller than the United States and this is part of the you'll hear little intimations here and there that some of the people have ambitions for the Christian Reformed Church not being just a bi-national church but a multinational church yeah that'll be another conversation because on one hand if you're not necessarily flourishing in the United States and Canada it's really attractive to sort of easily pick up groups and other nations so your numbers can look impressive but the reason you keep numbers is because hopefully those numbers will tell you something about health and flourishing and performance so back when we had the executive director we began this practice of the state of the church address and I thought it was a perfectly fine address these speeches are difficult because on one hand they've got to be honest and to be honest about the state of the Christian Reformed Church right now means Christian Reformed Church has a lot of challenges and I've talked about those challenges in previous videos about the Christian Reformed Church on the other hand if you go there saying all is lost then you're Denethor in the Lord of the Rings the return of the King movie and you can't do that that's not leadership either so you've got to figure out how to strike a balance and it isn't really a balance you have to talk about the strengths and you have to talk about the weaknesses or the challenges and I thought he did a pretty good job with that the denomination has a ministry plan cultivate practices of prayer spiritual disciplines listening to the voice of every generation growing in unity and diversity sharing the gospel living it missionally planting new churches and then it uses these things to sort of say well how are we doing on all of these things and so he runs through that and he talks about some of the things that the denomination is doing and talks about certain events that happened and disruption challenges fewer adult baptisms or conversions low scores and my congregation is involved in the birth of the church again there are a lot of influences outside the church that impact inside the church and so during the seeker days there was whole missions which now has been sort of folded into combined with world missions and to resonate whole missions really had a big effort at church planting and that has really cooled in a lot of ways and so I it's it's of my opinion that churches if they want to have a future really need to keep planting churches and that needs to be a priority of the church because it's extraordinarily difficult and it's extraordinarily expensive but Tim Keller's opinion was part of the reason that the main line was in such sharp decline is that they stopped planting churches whereas evangelical churches and to some degree immigrant churches have continued planting churches one of that one of the things so he so many so one of the things that I think the Christian form church is going to there there's a significant portion where we'll deal with by vocational ministers virtual church part of the strategy that the Christian form church has been having is to try to unfold because the Dutch are neither sending new immigrants to the United States because their population numbers are not growing from Dutch reproduction and those populations in the United States are no longer having big families and so sort of as an organism you look for growth you look you look to immigrant groups and other groups to see well would you like to come in and be part of us if you look back at my wooden shoes video a significant part of Christian reformed identity has been this Dutch background and I read Andy Kuyvenhoven's time to burn the wooden shoes which was an article in November of 1980 which was kind of a watershed one of the things that you'll hear again and again and again and again at Senate is diversity diversity diversity but diversity only means something when there's unity so you have to figure out okay what's diversity and what's unity what are these diverse groups of people united by and one of the things you'll hear again and again and again and Senate and this is very common it's our theology our theology our theology well I'll tell you out there on the street we're not handing out I was just looking for my big blue book of burkhoff systematic theology oh you'd like to visit the Christian Reformed Church read this so these are a lot of the issues that the Christian Reformed Church really has to sort through what what are we what do we have anything distinct that we bring to the North American continent and again reading Andy Kuyvenhoven's article our reform distinctiveness okay what does that mean that doesn't mean Oli Bolin and and will it mean a peppermint's my Hasidic Jewish friend from this little corner brings me and gives me this and it's just sort of a joke well you can hand out these on the corner too but is this something you can really build a church around and so these have been the issues of the Christian Reformed Church for a for a very long time and because I'm always talking I just have a ton of these will amina mince I've got to start I've got to start giving them out after church I think or they're there they're just they're just not gonna they're not gonna be fresh so then a lot of the rest of this morning's stuff was about was about boards and and cleaning up some of that and again a lot of that when it comes to the advisory committees if their advisory committees can go through them pretty quickly they can get to the floor of Senate early some of the other advisory committees like advisory committee seven they're skipping a lot of these planetary sessions actually and working on their stuff because that's a lot harder and actually at the end of this session before dinner I noted that Paul de Vries announced that committee seven majority is in this room at and committee seven minority is in that room at this doesn't tell us much except that with an advisory committee again the goal is always to have one unified report well if they've already realized they can't have a unified report and they have a majority and minority report that says something about what's coming down the pike on the issue of human sexuality so we will see what comes maybe I'll end this video here because I dealt a lot of with the the synodical cyborg stuff and and then with some subsequent videos I'll deal with some other things so thanks for watching leave a comment let me know what you think
