 Hi, this is Paul. I'm sort of attending to some of these decisions piecemeal. It's fitting in better in my schedule. Sorry for some of you who really love the two hour long videos and cheers from some of you who like shorter, more directed videos because they're just certain issues at Senate you're more interested in than others. So it's just the way that I have my time and my availability to make these little things. Now in a previous video I showed how to find things from the live tab. Another good way to do it is to get it from the playlist and that's perhaps a better way. So if you go to on YouTube, you go to CRCNA and then it has created playlists and they have a Synod 2023 playlist and you'll find all the videos from Synod 2023 and you can see you have Inspire 2022. I haven't watched those actually. I probably want to take a look at those. You have Synod 2020, 2022, you have Inspire 2022 and so yeah, they have a lot of good playlists and I'm sure a lot of other material that you might be interested in all the way back to Synod 2013. So it's kind of, I think, even though it's a little makes people a little bit nervous having these recordings around for historical purposes, this is absolutely essential because you can really sort of dive in beyond just the paper level and see, get a sense of Synod even if you don't get the same feel for it. I want to address what was a study committee report that was another one of these that was laid over during the pandemic and this one was on ecclesiastical marriage and this one is kind of a sleeper. It's really a very important thing and I think a lot of people don't quite understand what this is and this actually does have links to the women in church, not the women in church office, but the same-sex marriage debate because of course before same-sex marriage became the law in the United States and Canada, the church could just basically ride the shirt tails of the government with respect to what was a legal marriage. In the United States and Canada, there was no bigamy, you could only be married to one person at a time and all marriage was between a man and a woman. When same-sex marriage came along, suddenly there was a difference between what was considered marriage subject to the word of God in the church and in public. That is the ruling. It's a long-term point in the Christian Form Church Order that ministers are not allowed to perform weddings that are outside of basically that are they can only do weddings with it that are I should just read the church order. This is article 69 in the church order. Consistories shall instruct and admonish those under their spiritual care to marry only in the Lord. Christian marriages should be solemnized with appropriate admonitions, promises and prayers as provided in the official form. Marriages may be solemnized either in a worship service or in a private gathering of relatives and friends. Ministers shall not solemnize marriages which would be in conflict with the word of God. So obviously part of the same-sex marriage pinches on that and so when the laws in Canada and the United States were pretty much just traditional marriage, the church just accepted marriages as they came to them. Now something began to happen over the last couple of decades with people living longer and with some with some benefits survivor benefits packages changing. We would have requests from longtime members who were divorced or perhaps widowed and the request would be could you marry us in the church but not file but we're not planning on filing anything with the state and ministers would hear that and often these would be members who were in the church for a very long time and members in good standing and members who would tie then the important supporters former office bearers of the church and they basically would say well you know if I get married legally some of the survivor benefits that I get would no longer come to me so this way if we're just married in the church and not in the state then we keep the survivor benefits and well and what well because they knew that if they started living together people in the church would say why are you living together without being married and this sort of especially given all of the stuff going on in terms of human sexuality in the culture getting married in the church basically was the church handing a license to have sex between the couple and so well the state doesn't seem particularly interested in terms of who you have sex with so if we just get married in the church then everybody will know we're sleeping together we're a couple yada yada yada but we keep getting our survivor benefits from our dead spouses so pastor why don't you just marry us here and some pastors were going along with it saying they're lovely members of the church what does this hurt but it also sets up a situation where you're married in one context to a person and not in another context when I was a missionary in the Dominican Republic one of the reliable ways to sort of assault a pastor's reputation would be to charge that they had a family in Haiti and a family in the Dominican Republic when the same-sex marriage thing came along a lot of the solution offered by a number of people was well you know in places like the Netherlands the church marriage and the state marriage are really two different things and a lot of different countries marriage in different ways another little tidbit even in a place like the United States marriages are governed by states not by the federal government and that's why Obergefell was sort of a landmark ruling because suddenly you had national marriage policy and if you delve into the same-sex marriage history you'll find that you know Clinton had signed a law and so on and so forth so there's a lot going on with this and so eventually a synodical study committee was mandated and that study committee was requested to well settle this should ministers marry people only in church and not in the state now this gets a little tricky because again part of what the same-sex marriage debate has brought to us is the assertion that churches shouldn't police sex and when people say that I always say do you want the sex of your minister policed like if the minister's wife is okay him having a girlfriend do you mind him dating around in the congregation how about the age of the people he's going to date in other words should churches police sexuality there are couples in the Christian Reformed Church who are in their senior years by virtue of how old they are unless you know you have an Abraham and Sarah situation no children are going to come to play and they are living together and churches are kind of like don't really want to say anything don't want to be confrontative so this is all part of this question of sort of how church discipline has kind of gone away so I knew this was coming to the Senate it wasn't treated in last year's Senate and I thought I wonder how much debate this is going to get as I said synods are funny because they kind of start and every Senate has its own character and I was just watching I had a family zoom meeting just talking to my mother and sister and brother-in-law which I do on Monday evenings and I was keeping an eye on Senate and I noted oh they said it did wake up and it woke up it woke it got woken up by Scott Vanderplug and so I haven't listened to that discussion yet and I'm super interested to listen to the discussion because it's gonna be it's really vital it's about the decline of the CRC but this one I was really curious about where's this one going to go because this one actually has some angles to it and those angles came up in the debate so let's start move that way I'll just start with a first recommendation a that synod instruct the general secretary to disseminate the report on ecclesiastical marriage to the churches of the CRC to serve as guidance regarding the issue of ecclesiastical marriage and as I move that I'll ask you a question do I have to make that as a motion or is that already happened because it's out just for clarity we make it a motion because that clarifies what Senate officially thinks of the report and this is if if Senate likes the report basically says we're going to and we're gonna send this out to the church and say this is Senate's guidance on this issue and so when clergy this has been around for a few years already the clergy initially were sort of blindsided by this and you'd have discussions with other clergy hey I got a strange request I was asked to this couple wants to be married they want to be married in the church and not not in the state what do you think and I think a number of clergy went along with it that's fine it's moved so we have recommendation a in front of us that Senate instruct the general secretary to disseminate the report in some ways that's already been done but we'll continue to make that available to the churches and it serves as guidance regarding the issue of ecclesiastical marriage that motion is on the floor in front of us any questions discussions go ahead are you in the queue well go ahead anyways we'll honor at this time but anyone else who wants to speak try to get into the queue thank you Bernie classes here and we were instructed in our committee of pre-advice to specify whether it's the general secretary or the office of the general secretary which is it remember when I talked about structure and language in the recommendation a Andy they listen to you it's office of general secretary know the and I know it sounds like a minor point but we'll correct that thank you for remembering that Bernie it's a notice no discussion on the substance yet office of general secretary any other questions or points for clarification all in favor of recommendation a say aye any opposed all right not a big deal motion carries so be that Senate strongly advised pastors of the CRC not to solemnize ecclesiastical marriages as defined in the report you can look that in there if you need to again as sanctioned and solemnized solely by the church to the exclusion of the state or civil government whereby a couple is considered married in the eyes of the church but not in the eyes of the state for the grounds the record the biblical record clearly teaches us to submit to the governing authorities in all matters that do not conflict with the Word of God historically reformed churches have acknowledged the role and right of civil authorities to regulate marriage in their jurisdictions in both the United States and Canada there could be negative legal consequences for the participants and or for pastors who solemnize a non-civil or ecclesiastical marriage all right that motion is on the floor in front of us questions observations comments please put your name in the queue if you're interested in speaking seeing none I judge we're ready to vote recommendation you know everything just folks are kind of asleep it's nothing to see here here comes one Patrick central California my question is from the from the Emmanuel Christian farm church in Ripon California one of our delegates from our fine classes why is it strongly advised rather than encouraged not to or something like that given the grounds well strongly advised it's stronger than encouraged not to I think encouraged not to is kind of it's just kind of too weak and we didn't go to the line of forbid because we didn't feel like we're and they didn't go to the line of forbid which was very interesting that is that what you're asking not so you're saying there's a chance instead of stronger I think we wanted just to stay away from the word forbid and quite honestly this is the exact wording you had in the report we didn't we didn't change this this and that's usually what the committees do is the wording the reporters gave us there's a there's there's there's a there's the fine delegates from classes central California as well from the from the study committee but it's it's it's a recognition that on the other side we also have to recognize we want to seriously stay away from encouraging anybody to do something that would be deemed illegal because that would be a bad idea well the funny thing is that if you forbid it then at least the minister the couple comes to the minister and the minister can't do it you know they forbid ministers from performing same-sex marriages so it's very interesting then the ministers are sorry I can't do it I just can't do it it's against the rules I'm strongly encouraged not to thank you I don't see anyone else are we ready to vote all right on recommendation B all in favor say aye any opposed all right that motion carry one person voted against he's like okay done deal the rest is just sort of cleanup okay ready for see that Senate encouraged the churches to respect and honor the marriages of immigrants who did not obtain a civil marriage prior to arriving in Canada or the United States and counsel them in the understanding of Christian marriage and its relationship to civil authority in our countries for grounds it's not the case that in every country where immigrants have come from that the civil authorities regulate marriage so it might not have been possible for a civil marriage to occur also in the interest of grace and acceptance we want to acknowledge the beautiful Christian marriage traditions that have developed in various cultures and third the law is permissive but not prescriptive in this regard and if I may in this respect when we talked about this one of the pieces of conversation that came out our Korean delegates were speaking to the different cultural issues that they have as well around this that this report doesn't really answer fully so there's some there is some wondering about if there needs to be some more work done culturally on this beyond just the the dominant culture in our midst here because to our dominant culture this probably speaks very well but to some other cultures it's not maybe as clear or the same for some places so that needs to be considered thank you okay so basically yeah these these things can get messy they can that clarification Dan so recommends nation C is before us questions comments I don't see anyone's name on the list Stanley did you want to speak to that there's a piece for me there's a piece missing and that is the marriage from the Native American perspective or indigenous peoples it only talks about the immigrants there is a long-standing in the Navajo culture or even in any indigenous cultures there are marriages that are outside the church and many of our people that are coming into the church have been married traditionally and then do we tell them to you need your traditional marriage is wrong now you have to be remarried in the church or how does that work and that I was trying to figure that out with this with this recommendation if I may you've got ceremonies we got traditional ceremonies that are not Christian ceremonies and by the way we're not immigrants you're the immigrant gonna give an answer and if the study committee wants to come up here Lauren might want to because as the lawyer but and first of all Stanley my apologies for not having also included that my prior comments because I understand the culture for you is also different and it probably should have had a different wording in the motion instead of just immigrants it should have been you're right it should have included you and that's that speaks right to that point that it is it is different I have to admit I don't I think you're absolutely right I don't think this has a full answer for you and your culture and that needs to have some we need to have the input into some of the writing of these reports like this one from from the Navajo culture the Zuni culture from the Koreans and many others to help us write these things better because we're and and and I'm not blaming you I'm blaming us we did not include your perspective and so that is a shortcoming that we have and we're recognizing that as we went through as this so I know some in my audience get real get real itchy and real reactive about the diversity stuff but here it is here it is the Navajo have a real point and a little bit of representation on that committee if there was someone in that room they'd say yeah you know wait a minute the language you have here we're not immigrants the study committee and I know that doesn't give you an answer what you need to do or should do but it's we do apologize that that's not that's not been clarified on our part and Thank you. Daniel. In number two where it says the beautiful Christian marriage traditions that developed in various cultures were we to strike the word Christian from that we would be able to, well Stanley to go back and say the marriages that you have experienced in your cultures are considered beautiful and therefore are acceptable in our eyes. So now we've started Synod because now we've got the advisory committee report and something came up and so the language isn't quite right and so we got to fix the language and how are we gonna do this on the floor and so well let's just take out that word marriage then and this is a beautiful tradition but what about someone coming from a culture and they've come to Christianity and they really feel like they have left darkness and come to light and they don't believe their marriage was beautiful I mean you have this with baptism you have this with a lot of things and an American sort of just like to say well let's just call it beautiful and that'll smooth everything out and everything will be nice well does and then again now now we're trying to fix the language on the floor uh-oh it doesn't really go too well. If that's what we want to say. I'm not sure I'm clear on what you're are you are you making a motion to amend? Yeah how about that I'll try and make a friendly motion and see if they agree it's friendly. Well first I want to know so let's talk about this whole business because this comes up a lot at Synod one of the things if it's a friendly amendment then you don't have to go through all the procedural things to really get the language this is a motion to amend and there's a whole structure in terms of rules of order synodical rules of order are not exactly Robert's rules of order they're a little bit simplified there's a structure and so most people just come up with a suggestion and then the chair of course has to be like well what am I supposed to do with your suggestion and would you like to make a motion to amend oh yeah let's do that and but if it's friendly amendment then we don't have to vote on it and everything so is it a friendly amendment? You're in under the sea you're on you're in the grounds in two correct? That's correct. Well on the one side I guess I don't see the problem with that but on the other side we're not voting on grounds we're voting on the motion. And so this guy behind the podium he's the reporter for the advisory committee and the guy sitting next to him he's the chair of the advisory committee but this is an advisory committee that has been working from a synodical report that they for the most part have just taken the language from and have put it in their report and then the question is oh is is that really good for everyone? I mean the grounds come with it. Well the grounds go with the motion. I know but so and that's fine I don't have any problem with that personally but can I ask? Your suggestion your suggestion is that we simply strike Christian in grounds number two. That's correct. Is that correct? Yes. Mr. Chairman I think it would be wise before we agree to that statement that we really do check with someone from the committee that wrote this because I think that's important because they did any means the synodical study committee that whose work has been sitting on ice for a few years a lot of work to put this together and I would serve I'm just taking my look around and they're not waving their hands at me just oh there we go thank you very much hand waving. Just let us know who you are and I assume you're from the committee and then speak to that please thank you. I wasn't my name is Gail Dornbos I'm from the committee so I think part of our recommendation in this is that it does deal more so with immigrant communities who come from other traditional cultures that are outside of a Western kind of dominant North American culture and so I take Stanley Jim's note that we probably should have included that into this recommendation because it is in the report we do deal with not just immigrant communities but also native communities in the US and Canada and so I think one of the things that we did talk about as a committee is that as we defined ecclesiastical marriage as a marriage that is solely solemnized by the church to the exclusion of the state that's the intent of an ecclesiastical marriage given the grounds from synod 2019 and our mandate from synod that we actually thought that recommending an ecclesiastical marriage in the context that we're talking about with immigrant communities or traditional communities actually demeans those communities quite significantly because it says we as a church don't actually accept your marriage you need to be married in the church and so we're gonna do that for you so that was one of the reasons why we had this whole now again back to the question about well obviously same-sex marriage is sort of lurks in the background of this question and it's also the fact that well when the laws in the United States and Canada were basically had you know female no bigamy marriage the church could just sort of ride along and didn't really matter who you were married by or when you were married by or what the seminar what the ceremony was or whose name now baptism in the Christian Reformed Church as long as you're baptized the name as the Father Son and Holy Spirit your baptism counts so it can be an Orthodox baptism or a Catholic baptism or as long as it's in a Trinitarian Church your baptism counts and for the most part people would show up at church and they'd be together and you just assume they were married now it's not a completely unusual thing to let's say welcome a family into membership baptize the children have a lovely ceremony only to discover months if not years later that oh by the way you two aren't married that happens too so yeah a lot of stuff happens in church that you might think when someone joins the church you don't say and you know they show up with kids and stuff can you show me the wedding that the marriage license you don't think to ask portion in our report to deal with those types of things but as you're right we also recognize that our mandate was to answer the question should a pastor solemnize an ecclesiastical marriage knowing that there is going to be no state involvement and that this is a often first time coming together of a couple and so in that light we said we don't recommend it but we also want in other words this was designed to address the scenario that I began the video with I wanted to recognize that that's not every scenario so we came up with this recommendation I hope that made sense so okay I'm getting some nods I teach so I'm trying to read the room specific Lauren has another thing I think on the committee the reason now Lauren I was I was in Lauren's home at one point I don't remember when that was or where I was I think it was in Iowa there's just a wonderful guy he is he's a wonderful guy we included this provision or recommended it is that so often those who have a cultural or a Native American or an immigrant marriage failed to qualify for programs entitlements and revenue streams from the government then a marriage certificate is required so for social security benefits Medicaid benefits Medicare benefits we want everybody to be qualified to receive them and not be shocked to find out at some point that they've been unable to collect can you okay so he makes the case that well if churches just start doing this later on down the line someone's going to show up and look for their social security benefits and the states can say well you're not married well I got married in the church well you're still not married because you got to get married oh so yeah and and as someone who does weddings it's not uncommon when I talked to couples beforehand I say now you're spending all this time looking at the ceremony and all of this stuff you'd better go down to that County clerk and get that marriage license because after the ceremony put someone in charge that we're gonna all fill this thing out and that thing's gonna get mailed because I'll tell you and then stuff can happen during the ceremony but getting that thing in the mail really important and you'd be amazed how often there's a stumble and it doesn't happen Lauren if you could what about the suggestion that has been made that we strike the word Christian in grounds number two do you have objection to that or do you think that changes the motion significantly we've been chatting about that on the sideline and we don't think that it changes the thrust of the point and I'm gonna rule that with your approval and the committee's approval that we can strike the word Christian oh good it looks like we've got out of our editing jam we'll consider that a friendly amendment that's in ground number two so ground number two now reads in the interest of grace and acceptance we want to acknowledge the beautiful marriage traditions that have developed in various cultures I have John from northern Illinois and then Todd from Grand Rapids North. So I read fully the full report and what didn't appear at all in the report or I mean the whole study was a practice that we've done is that we would have people on disability who wanted to inter promise relationships but did not want to be legally married because it changes their status as beneficiaries of benefits for Social Security. So in other words it's not just the senior couple that wants to live together as husband and wife but they don't want to mess with a benefit. Now it's a disabled couple. Oh and this happens with elderly people it also happens with disabled people it's rather common that their whole status changes so they don't want a legal marriage so the practice that we have is that they would hold a promise commitment. They'd get their sex license. This is exactly what this thing is about. Except that the last study person mentioned something in that area. This was approved and recommended this was approved 10 minutes ago so that that horse has already left the barn. This is the report that I read and I think it calls for us to respect and honor the marriages of immigrants so I realize you're asking a question about the report but this particular motion is the one that's in front of us. I was referring to ground one in which or let's see or maybe it's two but the whole matter of what a particular culture would have called marriage even though it's not recognized as necessarily a legal marriage would that be legit. Mr. Chairman I believe what he's asking about was covered under the second motion that we've already passed but if you'd like an answer to that I'll offer a little bit and Lauren will correct me but it falls into that same category as I hear it as the senior couple who are looking at the pension issues and the pension losses and how to deal with that and also the protections that go along with that. And I understand the situation you're speaking of a little bit too that it is different there's some differences in there because you're talking now about other benefits from the government that they're not going to be able to get. And the problem is Lauren am I correct in saying that that's still fraud? Because you're still doing a marriage even though you're not calling it such so we're committing we're still we're still possible. This is where fraud first comes into the conversation. We're committing fraud and that's the way I understood it from the report is that correct Lauren? That is correct and as a committee we studied that and determined that that status would probably constitute what might be colloquially called marriage light. It would lack the essential objects of matrimony and particularly if the civil regulation is being avoided so that one of the parties might maintain a sizable pension then it would constitute fraud. And we felt that we should not encourage people to go there. It would be better to do things decently in good order. Even our marriage formulary in the Salter says to love, to honor and to maintain and to devise a method whereby we can sidestep those responsibilities is something other than the traditional marriage that we've honored and we want to use as examples. To our young people. Thank you Lauren. So yeah because I mean think about this. So let's say an insurance company or some company that is providing the benefits they'd like to reduce their roles and then they start doing some investigating and then you know you visit the home and there's a beautiful couple on the mantle of these two in a wedding ceremony and someone looks and says what's this picture of? Well that was our wedding. I thought you weren't married. Who helped you do this? Just imagine some lawyers figuring out how to not only try to cease benefits but try to claw back and get the money back that they had paid out since the wedding date. Yeah this is not an easy issue. Just before we continue our speaker list I've allowed a lot of latitude but a couple of reminders. When you stand up to speak, speak to the motion. Let's not move backwards or to some broader question that you would like answered. Speak to the motion so it helps if you identify who you are, what classes you're from. Are you in favor of the motion? Are you against the motion or do you have a question about the motion in front of us? So now we're starting Senate. Now things are tightening up and it's like okay let's focus a little bit. So I have now quite a list that is growing. Todd and then Martín from Toronto and then Stanley, Jim again. Todd, could you scroll down a little bit? I had a friendly amendment to suggest. No, the other way. Sorry. Another friendly amendment. What if we simply switch that to say that Synod encouraged the churches to respect and honor the marriages of other cultures? That would cover a good deal. A lawyer would really love that. Deal of what has been discussed previously. As a reporter, I think that's an incredibly good suggestion. What's your chair think? Sounds very good to me. Cultures other than what? What is the main culture and what are the other cultures? That's instead of immigrant, right? So the suggestion is that it would read that Synod encouraged the churches to respect and honor the marriages of different cultures who did not obtain a civil marriage prior and I'm granting that you're okay with that? I am. If the committee doesn't argue it, we're good. We will make that amendment as well. And this is where the friendly amendment thing sort of always unwinds. Okay, okay, because what we want to do is we want to kind of get beyond this because we know we're just struggling with words and let's just get beyond this. That if you don't also change the wording of prior to arriving in Canada or the US, it might sound really terrible? It might have to be, yeah, you might have to make a different way of adding that in there. And this is hard. Now we're going to wordsmith on the floor. Synod, we don't do that. And I'll just make this observation. We try to avoid it, but it always happens. I know this is difficult on the floor, but there's a lot of people on the floor. Amendments are hard to do on the floor precisely because of that, right? So now we're in a bit of a quandary. We could remove immigrants and say different cultures, but then you have that whole prior to arriving in Canada and the United States. Can I suggest something? Respect and honor marriages of different cultures and immigrants, although that kind of gets into trouble at some points, who did not obtain a civil... Culture is different than... ...marriage prior to arriving. What about...sorry, now I'm just on the floor and doing this. But I actually had one other thing to address the question. Yes, what's your point of order? That we are doing the work of the committee on the floor of Synod. This ought to be sent back to the committee. The point of order is that we're doing the work of the committee now on the floor of Synod. And we've all got these looming deadlines coming up. I'm not going to send anything back to the committee, given that we still got committee reports out. I think we all know what we're intending to do here. So let's just give a little bit of patience. Let's just give a little bit of patience and get there. Sorry, I forgot. The other part you would change is then just get rid of who did not obtain through the work. And when you're sitting on the floor, you're one of the 190 people that are just sitting there. Some people are working thinking, maybe if we do this, and other people are just playing with their little hand toys. And so it would respect and honor the marriages of different cultures and counsel them in understanding of Christian marriage. If you get rid of that, you maintain, I think, the meaning of the original intent, but include more cultures like Native Americans. What I'd like to remind the group of, and I know announcements were made a while ago, we actually have a place for you to submit amendments in writing. So, Todd, why don't you submit an amendment in writing and then we can determine whether it's friendly or not. Otherwise, we're just going to continue to go around and around on words to drop and words to add. And this will be a good reminder to us going forward to think about it. And first, you should think about whether you really need to make an amendment. Remember how slick this was going just 10 minutes ago? And secondly, make sure you have the whole wording correct before you suggest a change of a word. So what I'm going to make a gentle suggestion of while we're waiting for that written amendment is that someone make a motion that we table C. We'll come right back to it. Can I ask a question yet, Mr. Chairman? Our helpful people to the side have already made a change on C if you take a look on the screen, which did what you asked for, or what was asked for I should say. And I'm not sure if it's acceptable, but if it's acceptable it would work, if that's an acceptable sentence. It seems to me that what works on the screen, it's acceptable to the committee, it's acceptable to Todd, that's what we'll go with then. And let's in the future remember if you want to make an amendment, enter it in writing that helps us be clear on what we're doing. We'll go right back to the list. Thank you for catching that. I have Stanley, then Blake, then Kurt, then Samantha, and then David. To the motion. It was also smooth just a few minutes ago. And on point. Stanley Jim from Red Mesa. I still have a bit of an issue with the whole, even the different cultures. The different cultures is made up of Dutch, French, and all that stuff in the U.S., but they're all immigrants. We are not immigrants, we are the host nations. And I believe that maybe including indigenous cultures, for me that would satisfy me. Because you're separating us just by saying that different cultures, and I think we have been very accommodating to you with your languages, but couldn't you at least accommodate us here? Thank you. I'm going to remind the group right now that we do not applaud, because this will get ugly as we go forward to even more contentious issues. If we start applauding then we're going to boo, and then we're going to, alright. So I realize the applause were well meant here. But let's just watch ourselves on that, or we'll quickly descend into trouble as we move forward. And as we try to have people in the gallery also follow those same rules, right? So let's just be mindful as we continue to discuss. Blake and then Kurt? Yep, Blake from Classes of Liana. Mr. Chairman, I'd recommend we table this motion and move on until a substantive friendly amendment can be written. Someone makes a motion! There we go! Blake is making a motion that we table this. It's moved and supported. His intention is that there be some different amendment than what we currently have would be made on this. If we table this motion, we leave it and we move forward and we come back, presumably when we have a better amendment. The motion is to table, it's not debatable. If you vote yes, we leave it, we come back to it when we think we have something better. Alright? All in favor of tabling the motion, say aye. Aye. Opposed? Aye. We have tabled the motion. The intrepid wordsmiths. No, no, no, we want to do it from the floor! We have tabled the motion. And so they table and they will get back to it. So we will leave that there. Coming ahead, there is a really, I don't know if I'll cover it directly, there's an important conversation on bivocational pastors cleaning up the church odor. Part of what's happening in the Christian-informed churches, the Christian-informed churches increasingly assimilating into the church environment in North America. It's becoming increasingly less exceptional. Part of what made the Christian-informed church exceptional is that the demand of educated clergy was held for a good long time. Clergy were reasonably compensated so that they could support a family. You wouldn't get rich, but you could live and you could eat and it would be alright. You wouldn't need a secondary job. Increasingly, there are more and more commissioned pastors, clergy who don't necessarily, some of them have more education, but who don't necessarily have an MDiv or an MDiv, Masters of Divinity from Calvin Seminary or another institution. And so in that movement, that is just sort of recommending a church order change. Church order changes require two years to go into effect. So they propose changes and then they'll come back in the next synod. And that pretty much sort of tries to clean up the church order to more closely fit what the circumstances are now. That's often the way the church order goes. Usually changes happen on the ground first. There's sort of tension. It's sort of like the history of scientific revolutions. Finally, there's sort of a, okay, this is going to be the new norm. And that new norm is very much along the lines of the Christian-informed church being less exceptional and more like the dominant church environment in North America. But I did want to include this one on ecclesial marriages. And it's actually an important conversation. And so we'll see if they get the language cleaned up and so on and so forth. So anyway, thanks for watching. Now I'm really excited to watch the, my wife's working late today because it's time for, she's working on her report cards for her students. But I'm really excited to listen to the debate about the overture regarding denominational membership decline. But I doubt I'll have that one tonight. I've got a busy day tomorrow and then I do head out and I will be someplace else. Hopefully the Wi-Fi is good so I can continue to do this. I won't have all of my nice setup with my buttons and everything. I'm not quite sure how I'll keep this up or if some stuff will have to wait until after synod. But again, I hope, I was talking to my family this evening and they've watched the reports. They've enjoyed them. So if you enjoy these, if they're worthwhile to you, let me know. Leave a comment or thumbs up. Thumbs up is helpful because if you put a thumbs up on a video that tells the YouTube algorithm that other people might also find it helpful. So again, leave a comment. Thanks for watching.
