 I'm going to continue with C.S. Lewis's book, Miracles, and actually in this one we're gonna mostly mostly listen to Lewis in terms of defining natural and supernatural because I think his his definitions here are tremendously helpful and I think they help us get off on the right foot. I use the word miracle to mean an interference with nature by supernatural power. Unless there exists in addition to nature something else which we may call the supernatural there can be no miracles. Some people believe that nothing exists except nature. I call these people naturalists. Others think that besides nature there exists something else. I call them Our first question therefore is whether the naturalists or the supernaturalists are right and here comes our first difficulty. Before the naturalist and the supernaturalist can begin to discuss their difference of opinion they must surely have an agreed definition both of nature and of supernature but unfortunately it is almost impossible to get such a definition. Just because the naturalist thinks that nothing but nature exists the word nature means to him merely everything or the whole show or whatever there is and if that is what we mean by nature then of course nothing else exists. The real question between him and the supernaturalist has evaded us. Some philosophers have defined nature as what we perceive with our five senses but this also is unsatisfactory for we do not perceive our own emotions in that way and yet they are presumably natural events. In order to avoid this deadlock and to discover what the naturalist and the supernaturalist are really differing about we must approach our problem in a more roundabout way. I begin by considering the following sentences. One are those his natural teeth or a set? Two, the dog in his natural state is covered with fleas. Three, I love to get away from tilled lands and metal roads and be alone with nature. Four, to be natural why you so affected? Five, it may have been wrong to kiss her but it was very natural. A common thread of meaning in all these usages can easily be discovered. The natural teeth are those which grow in the mouth. We do not have to design them, make them or fit them. The dog's natural state is the one he will be in if no one takes soap and water and prevents it. The countryside where nature reigns supreme is the one where soil, weather and vegetation produce their results unhelped and unimpeded by man. Natural behavior is the behavior which people would exhibit if they were not at pains to alter it. The natural kiss is the kiss which will be given if moral or prudential considerations do not intervene. In all the examples nature means what happens of itself or of its own accord. What you do not need to labor for. What you will get if you take no measures to stop it. The Greek word for nature, physis, is connected with the Greek verb for to grow. Latin natura with the verb to be born. The natural is what springs up or comes forth or arrives or goes on of its own accord. The given, what is there already. The spontaneous, the unintended, the unsolicited. What the naturalist believes is that the ultimate fact, the thing you can't go behind, is a vast process in space and time which is going on of its own accord. Inside that total system every particular event such as you're sitting reading this book happens because some other event has happened. In the long run because the total event is happening. Each particular thing such as this page is what it is because other things are what they are. And so eventually because the whole system is what it is. All the things and events are so completely interlocked that no one of them can claim the slightest independence from the whole show. None of them exists on its own or goes on of its own accord except in the sense that it exhibits at some particular place and time that general existence on its own or behavior of its own accord which belongs to nature. The great total interlocked event as a whole. Thus no thorough going naturalist believes in free will. For free will would mean that human beings have the power of independent action. The power of doing something more or other than what was involved by the total series of events. And any such separate power of originating events is what the naturalist denies. Spontaneity, originality, action on its own is a privilege reserved for the whole show which he calls nature. Now you can see right there the where where this is going and and you can see right there some of the dilemmas that have arisen in contemporary conversation that a lot of you listen to. I hear Sam Harris's name quite often in the comments and and the question of free will and then some of you might have known notice that I don't really like the term free will. I guess I'm I think there's enough conditioning going on and in fact part of the reason we listen to Jordan Peterson and we read history and we do all of this is we are we are trying to account for things but but accounting for things turns out to be a very difficult thing because on one hand I'm working on my sermon for this week and one of the things I always notice with people is that we always regard everyone else as everyone else's ideas as being conditioned. Well you're a Christian because you were raised by Christian parents. Muslim children were you know Muslims or were raised by Muslim parents or or I had a bad experience in church therefore I'm you know I left church so in other words we always look at we we often look at other people as if their products of whatever has happened before them and so I think it's in fair in fairness it's it's fair to recognize that all of us are products of of what has happened before us but that then leaves us with the question is there an us? I did a little bit of did a little bit of work researching or if you just go out you know YouTube's a pretty amazing thing if you just go out to YouTube and and check out this guy very interesting video on random numbers and you begin to realize how how difficult it is to to generate random numbers and you might say well my computer generates random numbers all the time well how can a computer generate random numbers and often what they'll they have a little formula here and then usually they'll just put in you know an extremely tiny computation of the time of whenever this thing starts and then you get you get a sufficiently large number to feel random but you know an equation like this will always produce something which in fact isn't random and he let's see if I got the click on this one and and he goes into this it's really a fascinating video and then my internet doesn't work here we go so I've kind of gone out of my way and I've gone to the safe and I've got something that's going to create a random number because here I've got a small radioactive source at strontium 90 and it is going to randomly give out electrons okay as a neutron turns into a proton and out comes a high-energy electron from the strontium and so coming into the Geiger counter here I'm getting just a steady stream of electrons and counting them and the number that I count surprise surprise is Gaussian right but it's round now again when he makes he makes a point earlier in the video and if you want to watch the whole video you'll understand the point that it's that the the electrons are going to come out in a Gaussian pattern just as predicted but well let him finish now now what does he mean by random there he means that at any given moment the the electron coming out is unpredictable we cannot predict it and that that in effect is our definition of random but that doesn't actually later in the book Lewis is going to deal a little bit with quantum physics as opposed to newtonian physics and and what a quantum is is this you know first the particles there and then it's there and and it isn't necessarily in a path between the two and you know I'm sure there's some really smart people out there that can define this and and please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on something like this or or or nuance this but the the point is that this is this is the lengths we go to to try and and find something sufficiently random for us so that we can do things like like encryption the computer let me just show you can I show you that's the happy sound of radiation so you can hear it but you can see it too here it is here are the individual pulses each one of these flashing on here that's an electron going into the guy you counter which is pretty cool so I've written you a small computer program hope it works the number you're going to get is the deviation from the mean value so I know what the mean value for the count is going to be and I'm giving you the difference between that value and the number we actually count here we go well and he comes out with zero which is fun the next time he'll come out with a different number which is cool but this gets to the point of just how difficult random is and and then he goes on to a little bit more about the Greeks which is and which is you have to click on a link really quick in the video to get it but but that gets into some very interesting stuff the ancient Greeks they knew that there was such a thing as chance they knew that when they rolled the dice there was different chances of throwing a particular number but it was against the gods to even consider that this might be something that we could predict by saying it's most likely to have this value right so they didn't they didn't think that they could do that plus the Greeks didn't do experiments the Greeks like to think they were very hmm theoretical people and so to see this kind of Gaussian plot you've got to do an experiment you've got to do it over and over again and if you don't you're never going to see this so so the Greeks were hopeless at probability the Romans they played a game called bones it was a lot like throwing dice it was like the artsy right except that the bones weren't fair they were they were I think would Astrid Gali I'm not a biologist Astrid Gali I think and and they were six sided but two of the sides were flat and two of the sides were really narrow so the probability was about four times less of throwing a narrow one but they find these things everywhere the Romans loved to play that and then sent Augustine comes along Christianity comes along sent Augustine says everything is God's will the fact that I have thrown a six with my three dice God's will for heaven's sakes literally don't question that because it's heretical to question that this is not God's will and so and I would nuance that that little representation but go on right up until the Renaissance nobody studies this stuff random numbers is is not a field of mathematics that's ever been studied and you might ask why not and why not what why does it why do we wait so long to try to get to this conception of random as opposed to then you look at the Greeks and Augustine that they're saying no this is this is determined by someone and then we get the idea of random but but once we have the idea of random we begin to discover just how just how hard it is to come by and and so then then what is random and and I think we in a sense get into the pragmatists and and and what we what we're able to develop whether we're we're measuring something from a you know from a from a radioactive bit we get we get random enough for us and but but that you know that then we get back into CS Lewis who is saying well you know what is nature now of course nature and supernature these two categories come along a lot later and and they are whoops come on stop prompting me they are well this is the whole show and Lewis you know this is nature is this one thing that begins at the singularity and of course you've got the problem of accounting for the singularity and then you go to the multiverse because this it seems that we keep wanting to hide behind big things and and so well we'll let we'll let Lewis keep going the supernaturalist agrees with the naturalist that there must be something which exists in its own right some basic fact whose existence it would be nonsensical to try to explain because this fact is itself the ground or starting point of all explanations but he does not identify this fact with the whole show he thinks that things fall into two classes in the first class we find either things or more probably one thing which is basic and original which exists on its own in the second we find things which are merely derivative from that one thing the one basic thing has caused all the other things to be it exists on its own they exist because it exists they will cease to exist if it ever ceases to maintain them in existence they will be altered if it ever alters them the difference between the two views might be expressed by saying that naturalism gives us a democratic supernaturalism a monarchical picture of reality now you can see here whoops now you well he's about to go into monotheism or or monarchy RK monarchy one the naturalist thinks that the privilege of being on its own resides in the total mass of things just as in a democracy sovereignty resides in the whole mass of the people the super naturalist thinks that this privilege belongs to some things or more probably one thing and not to others just as in a real monarchy the king has sovereignty and the people have not and just as in a democracy all citizens are equal so for the naturalist one thing or event is as good as another in the sense that they are all equally dependent on the total system of things indeed each of them is only the way in which the character of that total system exhibits itself at a particular point in space and time the super naturalist on the other hand believes that the one original or self-existent thing is on a different level from and more important than all other things and notice again at a particular point in space and time and that when you get into the question of random it's very interesting the way and the way consciousness the definition of random and the definition of consciousness have to be related we look for a random number well what do we mean by a random number is is it random outside of a perceiver or is is randomness itself a function of a perceiver at this point a suspicion may occur that supernaturalism first arose from reading into the universe the structure of monarchical societies but then of course it may with equal reason be suspected that naturalism has arisen from reading into it the structure of modern democracies the two suspicions thus cancel out and give us no help in deciding which theory is more likely to be true they do indeed remind us that supernaturalism is the characteristic philosophy of a monarchical age and naturalism of a democratic in the sense that supernaturalism even if false would have been believed by the great mass of unthinking people 400 years ago just as naturalism even if false will be believed by the great mass of unthinking people today everyone will have seen that the one self-existent thing or the small class of self-existent things in which supernaturalists believe is what we call God or the gods I propose for the rest of this book to treat only that form of supernaturalism which believes in one God partly because polytheism is not likely to be a live issue for most of my readers and partly because those who believed in many gods very seldom in fact regarded their gods as creators of the universe and as self-existent the gods of Greece were not really supernatural in the strict sense which I am giving to the word they were products of the total system of things and included within it this introduces an important distinction the difference between naturalism and supernaturalism is not exactly the same as the difference between belief in a god and disbelief naturalism without ceasing to be itself could admit a certain kind of God the great interlocking event called nature might be such as to produce at some stage a great cosmic consciousness an indwelling God arising from the whole process as human mind arises according to the naturalists from human organisms a naturalist would not object to that sort of God the reason is this such a God would not stand outside nature or the total system would not be existing on his own it would still be the whole show which was the basic fact and such a God would merely be one of the things even if he were the most interesting which the basic fact contained what naturalism cannot accept is the idea of a God who stands outside nature and made it now that last point of Lewis's is important and it's interesting to me a little look quite a bit later in the book Lewis is going to talk about going to talk about pantheism and and Lewis will go on to make the assertion that that pantheism is natural religion if unless you know and what I mean by naturalism is religion is according to his definition of nature that if you leave people alone they will tend to wander towards polytheism and and if you look at how Lewis constructs this argument you can begin to see you can begin to see why because it's very interesting how you know I've you know we because we're talking about Peterson we've done some talking about Jung and I don't know that much about Jung and I know I'll be corrected in the comment section which is fine but but to try to get a conception of Jung's God and in fact a good many people when they listen to Peterson think that in a sense Peterson's God if Peterson's God is in a sense created by our minds if Peterson's God is an idea and that idea is dependent upon our minds and even if you go to Jung's quote that Peterson loves to give that I you know we don't have ideas ideas have us well the ideas might be something you know how do you talk about greater the ideas might be something that are moving us and therefore greater than us that isn't that is that is consistent with naturalism according to Lewis's definition here so so in other words if if human beings create ideas and these ideas become so powerful that that other human beings now take them on and if you get this you get this this cloud of witnesses thing where the watchers inside our head are picking up things and causing us to remember things it's very in it's very easy to imagine God in scare quotes or or some some realm of ideas that are that are moving people along something akin to gravity moves matter along so ideas move people along because we have brains and we can listen and we have these stories that we're generating but but this again isn't supernatural according to Lewis this isn't God according to Lewis because according to Lewis here something gets the thing going and and this gets them back into into Darwin in terms of there's the the only thing that gets us going is this material progression we can't answer the question of where does the singularity come from before the Big Bang and so then we make up stories of the multiverse and so we're not satisfied with any of those questions so we're gonna leave those questions alone but in terms of how we deal with the universe this is what we'll say it is but then you get back to a thing that Peterson will say again and again and again is that why is it people don't like being treated this way people get very upset if if you simply if you tell them that they are simply the product of their education or the product of we there's something in us that wants to believe that we have free will or that we are agents or that we are actors and to and to take this away seems seems like a horrible injustice popping into one of the books I'm reading right now which is a Hobbit a wardrobe in a great war and and there he notes what was going on in the after World War one Clarence Darrow and you might remember him from the monkey trial and in Dayton Tennessee as early as 1924 for example attorney Clarence Darrow defended two Chicago men accused of murdering a boy in cold blood by making a novel claim he insisted that criminal acts were the result of faulty evolution not faulty conscience in his closing argument Darrow said the real question before the court was whether it would embrace the old theory that a person commits a criminal act because he willfully purposely maliciously and with malignant heart sees fit to do sue do so or the new scientific theory that every human being is the product of endless hereditary back of him and the infinite environment around him in other words and then he goes into Leninist Russia the denial of personal responsibility took a political turn as well the outburst of revolutionary violence rocked post-war Europe the purges and assassinations in Lenin's Russia for example were rationalized as a necessary phase towards a utopian vision an official of the Soviet secret police the checka explained thus we are not carrying out a war against individuals we are exterminating the bourgeoisie as class as Paul Johnson writes shortly after seizing power Lenin abandoned the notion of individual guilt and with it the whole Judeo-Christian ethic of personal responsibility and and this gets into this question of nature versus super nature what kinds of creatures are human beings do we act this gets into Dostoevsky are we keys on our piano are we simply the the sufficiency of what our brains are telling us and this is right at the right at the center of the Sam Harris's dispute now some of you have read Sam Harris and feel free to jump in in the comments section I'd love to hear what you have to say about this but this is this gets into this free will argument and again our wills aren't completely free I think our our wills are conditioned we're biased we've got all of these things going in but is there a chooser inside us and and Peterson keeps making the point we can't help but believe that there's a chooser inside us yet at the same time we keep talking about things that make us go a So in other words on one hand we are agents and we act and we are held responsible for our actions and and we cannot imagine a world in which we are not held responsible for our actions and and this is you know Jordan Peterson's pragmatism you express your real beliefs not your articulated beliefs if we really didn't believe that we were responsible for our actions and that we are just a product of the whole show why should we bother making videos well these videos are part of the whole show but why are we trying to convince one another why are we why do we act at all because so what it's all nature it's all unfolding and therefore even this thought is is a product of that we are now in a position to state the difference between the naturalist and the supernaturalist despite the fact that they do not mean the same by the word nature the naturalist believes that a great process of becoming exists on its own in space and time and that nothing else exists what we call particular things and events being only the parts into which we analyze the great process or the shapes which that process takes at given moments and given points in space this single total reality he calls nature the supernaturalist believes that one thing exists on its own and has produced the framework of space and time and the procession of systematically connected events which fill them now you might notice at this point so but I'm not that one thing now he's gonna get to that because this is going to have implications for what we are this framework and this filling he calls nature it may or may not be the only reality which the one primary thing has produced there might be other systems in addition to the one we call nature in that sense there might be several natures this conception must be kept quite distinct from what is commonly called plurality of worlds for instance different solar systems or different galaxies island universes existing in widely separated parts of a single space and time these however remote would be parts of the same nature as our own Sun it and they would be interlocked by being in relations to one another spatial and temporal relations and casual relations as well and it is just this reciprocal interlocking within a system which makes it what we call a nature other natures might not be spatio temporal at all or if any of them were their space and time would have no spatial or temporal relation to ours it is just this discontinuity this failure of interlocking which would justify us in calling them different natures this does not mean that there would be absolutely no relation between them they would be related by their common derivation from a single supernatural source they would in this respect be like different novels by a single author the events in one story have no relation to the events in another except that they are invented by the same author now he's gonna he's gonna go back to this authorship metaphor quite a bit to find the relation between them you must go right back to the author's mind there is no cutting across from anything mr. Pickwick says in Pickwick papers to anything mrs. Gamp here's in Martin Chusselwit similarly there would be no normal cutting across from an event in one nature to an event in any other by a normal relation I mean one which occurs in virtue of the character of the two systems we have to put in the qualification normal because we do not know in advance that God might not bring two natures into partial contact at some particular point that is he might allow selected events in the one to produce results in the other there would thus be at certain points a partial interlocking but this would not turn the two natures into one for the total reciprocity which makes a nature would still be lacking and the anomalous interlockings would arise not from what either system was in itself but from the divine act which was bringing them together if this occurred each of the two natures would be supernatural in relation to the other but the fact of their contact would be supernatural in a more absolute sense not as being beyond this or that nature but beyond any and every nature it would be one kind of miracle the other kind would be divine interference not by the bringing together of two natures but simply all this is at present purely speculative it by no means follows from supernaturalism that miracles of any sort do in fact occur God the primary thing may never in fact interfere with the natural system he has created if he has created more natural systems than one he may never cause them to impinge on one another and right there if you if you follow Charles Taylor for example and Charles Taylor secular age deism is is an important step in terms of Taylor giving an alternative story to the subtraction story that I talked about in my previous video that is a question for further consideration if we decide that nature is not the only thing there is then we cannot say in advance whether she is safe from miracles or not now now safe from miracles that that in many ways is is getting into Charles Taylor's question of the buffered self and and what he says in in a secular age is that you know in in our place in time we feel ourselves as buffered now what's interesting about Charles Taylor's buffer is that our buffer seems to include everyone else because we're not buffered from each other and we're not buffered from the biology of our mothers and we're not buffered from other things that happen we're simply buffered from that which is outside of nature which is why when I draw my little pictures I have this iron box of secularism that we are buffered from God and what that iron box fundamentally is is what CS Lewis calls nature there are things outside we do not yet know whether they can get in the gates may be barred or they may not but if naturalism is true then we do know in advance that miracles are impossible nothing can come into nature from the outside because there is nothing outside to come in nature being everything no doubt events which we in our ignorance should mistake for miracles might occur but they would in reality be just like the commonest events an inevitable result of the character of the whole system our first choice therefore must be between naturalism and supernaturalism and that's and that's the and that's the chapter and I wanted to kind of run this chapter through a couple places that it could have edited out but it's if we're gonna have a productive conversation it's good to it's good to have some it's good to have some terms so there's there's the chapter let me know what you think let me know any objections you might have or or yeah buts or if you like the definitions or not
