 Hi, this is Paul. I started a commentary series on this book and some of you have been teaching me how to say, Metsha Pajos, name properly, for which I am grateful. Sorry Metsha if I don't say it right or if I continue not to say it right. You can butcher Paul all you want and I won't be offended. You won't though because you speak both languages and I don't know how to speak French. But again, I think this is a very important book and even though I'm doing a commentary on it, I wouldn't be commenting on it if I didn't think it was an important book. Because I think what he's really working on addressing is absolutely vital and foundational. I did a conversation today with BookWave which is sort of a great book reading group that's on YouTube and I've had a conversation with one of their members before and I thought we had a really terrific conversation today which will come up on my channel. It'll be on their channel. And I did mention this book there because what the other Peugeot is trying to do is similar to what his brother is trying to do, just taking a different take on it and it's a really important thing. Now I think C.S. Lewis actually addressed this earlier and I had made a comment about the epilogue of Lewis's book and Byrne who told me it was his favorite book, gave me a little correction in the comment section which I took to heart and I thought maybe what I should do is actually read the entire epilogue and do a little bit of commenting on that. So this is the epilogue of the discarded image. Epilogue. The best in this kind are but shadows. Shakespeare. I have made no effort to hide the fact that the old model delights me as I believe it delighted our ancestors. Few constructions of the imagination seem to me to have combined splendor, sobriety, and coherence in the same degree. It is possible that some readers have long been itching to remind me that it had a serious defect. It was not true. I agree. It was not true. But I would like to end by saying that this charge can no longer have exactly the same sort of weight for us that it would have had in the 19th century. Sorry for the volume change. It won't happen again. Windows when I do zoom likes to readjust the volume at some settings beneath the settings that are on OBS and I always have to check them before I come on. Tricky windows. Okay back to the text. We then claimed as we still claim to which much more about the real universe than the media to know to know much more about the real universe than the medieval's did and hoped as we still hope to discover yet more truths about it in the future. But the meaning of the words know and truth in this context have begun to undergo a certain change. The 19th century still held the belief that by inferences from our sense experience improved by instruments we could know the ultimate physical reality more or less as by maps pictures and travel books a man can know a country he has not visited and that in both cases the truth would be a sort of mental replica of the thing itself. Now what Lewis points out there and I'm really glad that I came back to this book and reread the epilogue. I read this book about a year and a half ago for the first time and haven't reread it and I really should reread it because I've learned a lot in the last year and a half. But what Lewis points to is something that he pointed to in that important chapter in his book miracles on horrid red things where he basically makes the observation that in many ways we think in pictures. Now Lewis will sometimes charge people with picture thinking and it's not a compliment when he does but I think in many ways this exeptation that John Vervecki talks about and the parabolic knowledge that Mark and Manuel and Mary like to talk about has everything to do with these pictures and I think it's for this reason that you know when I would before I ever started on this YouTube thing I had a friend who taught at a couple of colleges around here and for his general education class he would he was enamored with a lot of new age type thinking and he liked Native American spirituality. He had been raised on Puerto Rican Roman Catholic but liked a lot of these things and would have me come in and talk about Christianity and I would regularly ask the class if they thought the world was round and they'd all raise their hand and then I'd ask if they how they knew the world was round and they almost always default to do things like globes and pictures from the moon then I asked them how they could test if the world was round in a way that anybody could see and none of them had the answer for that. Well I did have an answer for that that I could give them. I've given it in previous videos but it was interesting that it was something that none of them had ever thought of yet they simply based on authority believed that the world was round. Well that roundness of the world to answer the question that that has become just so much obviousness to all of us is sort of a picture that we have in our mind and this grasping which of course John Vervecki talks about an awakening from the meaning crisis this way of knowing is because it seems that our brains have basically leveled up from very elemental things and so images and pictures and models and constructs are the ways that we basically are able to apprehend the world and manipulate the world in our minds. That is for us simply a matter of thinking and now Lewis is pointing out that over time a lot of this thinking has continued to change so I'll reread this. The 19th century still held the belief that by inferences from our sense experience improved by instruments we could know the ultimate physical reality and again I think physical is the best word physics physical laws of physics all of that physical reality more or less by maps pictures and travel books a man can know a country he has not visited and that in both cases the truth would be a sort of mental replica of the thing itself philosophers might have disquieting comments to make on this conception but scientists and plain man did not much attend to them already to be sure and I think what we're we're coming up to here is the meaning crisis because as I've said before and and maybe I should have this conversation with John more directly I think in many ways the meaning crisis has two sources on one hand we discover that the universe is stranger than most of our mental pictures our mental pictures have mostly been of physical things that we can sort of grasp and know and apprehend like those little pictures of atoms and things like that those are that's part of the reason we have such atomic ways of thinking that that we learned that well we learned and took on authority from scientists that the world was stranger than this and that while there's all these waves and these waves sometimes cohere into matter and that there's there's something which is much more difficult for us to imagine and our imagination goes to say waves on a lake or waves on the sea or waves in water or waves in air even although that's harder for us because we can't see it we can't feel it like we can feel waves in water we can't have the experience of going into it and and so physics is increasingly telling us that the world is stranger than the sort of pictures that in previous centuries had sort of led us to believe so that's one half of the meaning crisis the other half of the meaning crisis is that well some of these things that we have sort of pictured dynamics processes to speak canadian all of this well i actually think processes processes processes all of this in fact impacts us and so the world is stranger and we are more constructed than we thought ourselves and again the previous era that the world was more atomic and we were sort of exceptions in the world and now we are less exceptional and the world is stranger okay and i think those two things really deeply contribute to the meaning crisis all righty to be sure mathematics were the idiom in which many of the sciences spoke but i do not think it has it was doubted that there was a concrete reality about which the mathematics held good again look at concrete reality there's a there's a very vibrant and of course lewis is a master of words there's a very vibrant picture of the world because when we hear concrete reality we think of concrete concrete is the sort of thing that you know if you've ever fallen down on it you know that your skin gave and your body did not like ouch concrete reality something we can't resist but i do not think it was doubted that there was a concrete reality about which mathematics held good distinguishable from the mathematics as a think about that again but i do not think it was doubted that there was a concrete reality about with about which mathematics held good distinguishable from the mathematics as a heap of apples is from the process of counting them we knew indeed that it was in some respects not adequately imaginable quantities and distances if either very small or very great could not be visualized even just the distance between here and the sun 23 million miles i know what a mile feels like to walk i know what a hundred miles feels like to drive i know what a few thousand miles feels like i know what a few thousand miles feels like to fly but i struggle with a million anythings but apart from that we hoped that ordinary imagination and conception could grasp it so we just think okay 93 million miles it's just kind of big and you know remember before i talked i talked about consciousness consciousness is one and then we sort of can manage dualities like one one one one one and then three things oh that's hard for us to manage with consciousness anything above three is just kind of okay and then we sort of default to well four four is a number we can manage but we manage four in different ways than we manage dualities okay we should then have thought mathematics a knowledge not merely mathematical we should be like the man coming to know about a foreign country without visiting it okay so again it's quite likely that many of you have had the experience of travel that you've had the experience of anticipated travel that you've had the experience of prepared for travel before for example i went to the dominican republic for the first time i had all sorts of ideas about it you know brushing up on spanish learning about the culture in fact before the dominican republic they were going to send me to brazil but that sort of fell through and i did all this preparation to go to brazil and i never got there but then i went to the dominican republic and i had all of these imaginations of what the country would be like and quite frankly after living there for more than six years i didn't know anything about the country before i went there i knew a bunch of things about the country i knew they spoke spanish i knew it was half the island of hispaniola i knew they had pretty beaches i knew that i would be working with haitians who cut sugarcane and pick coffee and i knew it would be different and i had traveled to nicaragua and honduras and costa rica and so i'd done a little bit of travel in latin america but when i got to the dominican republic it was very different and there's a sort of knowing and this is where we get into this this knowing that we keep talking about over in the verveki corner of the internet there's a certain sort of knowing that i just i just could not have had before i went there similar things when last year i visited hawaii and australia for the first time i had lived in the dominican republic so i had understood what it's like to live in a in a tropical country in a tropical island surrounded by the sea but hawaii was very different and australia was even more different so there's a lot going on with this knowing business and lewis is making the the connection to mathematics and knowing i can know that it's 93 million miles between here and the sun but what it would be like to travel between here and the sun in in what i don't even know what it's like to be in a spaceship well maybe it would be like being in a jet aircraft i've been in those but and and so right away there's a certain a knowledge of math that after a certain point it sort of becomes like the travel books he learns about the mountains from carefully studying the contour lines of a map but his knowledge is not a knowledge of contour lines the real knowledge is achieved when these enable him to say that would be an easy ascent or this is a dangerous precipice a would not be visible from b these woods and waters must have a pleasant valley and going beyond the contour lines to such conclusions he is if he knows how to read a map getting nearer to reality so you can see that he's as he's sort of imagining his way into it that he can sort of do with contour lines but again i would say he would not even understand these contour lines if he had never been to a mountain before and and perhaps had gone having gone to a mountain with a map with contour lines was able to sort of associate mountainness both the suchness and moreness of mountainness with the map that he has right there it would be very different if someone said to him and was believed but it is the contour lines themselves that are the fullest reality you can get and turning away from them to these other statements you are getting further from reality not nearer all those ideas about real rocks and slopes and views are merely a metaphor or a parable or getting to parabolic knowledge and a peace allure which of course i had to look up a course of action followed as a last resort in other words the contour lines themselves are not a fuller reality now this gets tricky because if you are in fact climbing up a trail by virtue of how the geography might be around you you might not be well aware of the fact that you are that this is in fact a steep rise now perhaps if you get to the end and you're huffing and puffing and you pull out a map you could say oh my i just ascended a thousand feet oh and we're at six thousand feet of elevation oh well seeing the math you might say okay now to a degree because i know something about climbing high and hiking in the mountains we have these beautiful mountains in california that i know something about contour lines and so in fact when my family and i go to yosemite and we're looking at hikes that we might like to take they have all these indications of easy moderate difficult and so they'll tell you this has 2 000 feet of of elevation change in it so uh get ready to do some huffing and puffing if you're in your 50s and watching your kids in your 20s just kind of walk up the thing so you know this is so the question is well what is real and and how is the real known but it would be very difficult if someone said to him and was believed but it is the contour lines themselves that are the fullest reality you can get in turning away from them to these other statements you are getting further from the reality not near what other statements the statements about that's a dangerous precipice a would be visible from b these woods and waters must make a pleasant valley that's getting further away from reality or closer and you begin to see some of the tension between well science which is all of this math and this lived experience all of those ideas about real rocks and slopes and views are merely a metaphor or a parable permissible as a concession to the weakness of those who can't understand contour lines but misleading if they are taken literally we're knocking on the door of brett weinstein's metaphorical truth in a way and this if i understand the situation is just what has now happened as regards the physical sciences now what's really interesting here is that the guidebooks and the maps with the contour lines people will say well that that exposes the truth about the mountains but here's a funny little situation what if they fudged what if they cheated what if what if the contour lines are inactive what if the contour lines are inaccurate where do you actually go to check the contour lines you have to go back to the mountain itself but if i'm in another country reading the travel book i can't check i've simply taken them on authority that's what i've done and and i would imagine oh i'm sure that there are checkers out there that make sure all of these maps are correct have you used your gps lately and this if i understand the situation is just what is now happening in regards to the physical sciences the mathematics are now the nearest to the reality we can get anything imaginable even anything that can be manipulated by ordinary that is non-mathematical conceptions far from being a further truth to which the mathematics were the avenue is merely analogy a concession to our weakness without a parable modern physics speaks not to the multitude right there parabolic knowledge without a parable modern physics speaks not to the multitudes in other words you might say to an expert well there's 10 000 feet of elevation there and myself who lives in northern california and loves to go up to the sierra and loves to go up to yosemite i have a pretty good idea about a bunch of places that are at about 10 000 feet and i know what 4 000 feet is like and i know what 7 000 feet is like and i know what 10 or 11 000 feet are like and i can i can in fact when i think about 10 000 feet i think of toalami meadows and i have many many pictures of toalami meadows in my mind and i've toalami meadows is one of my favorite places to be and then you keep driving now a lot of driving for me so there's another experience keep driving beyond toalami meadows over the pass and then down to mono lake and i just have lots of wonderful memories about this and all of this experience and i can since when i'm there i'm often paying attention what's the elevation here what's the elevation there what are the peaks that i can see i like that sort of thing so i pay attention but what is the parable and what is the science even among themselves when they attempt to verbalize their findings the scientists begin to speak of this as making models it is from them that i have borrowed the word for these models are not like model ships small scale replicas of the reality and whenever well you go to the museum of sciences the academy of sciences in golden gate park wonderful museum you will see all sorts of models there but they are not really like model ships now if you go to salcelito in the bay area and you look at the bay area model well that's a model in fact that's a working model and they have little pumps that put the water in and take the water out and they have it all set the scale at least the model is accurate to i don't know the 1950s when the thing was made because they couldn't do computer modeling but again when we use computer modeling a computer model is not like the salcelito bay model you can walk and say okay is there a computer model and you show me a computer you walk and see the salcelito bay model and you walk into a room and there's all there's the bay area all out before you like a a model ship but these models are not like model ships small-scale replicas of the reality sometimes they illustrate this or ask or this or that aspect of it by analogy and so again a model of the bay area tides and water systems that is a computer model is very different from that scale model the the model is only looking for specific aspect aspects there's sort of a relevance realization going on in that model of the whole thing and that model can be very accurate about some things none of us are denying that in fact we the the the meteorological models are telling us that there is a what are they calling it now oh yeah an atmospheric river many of you will have noticed that in the last few years meteorologists have taken to giving us more and more vivid language a polar vortex an atmospheric river now you would imagine that well i've got the sacramento and the american rivers here would imagine that it's like the sacramento river up in the sky well it's like the sacramento river oh you mean but but can i can i fish for salmon in it do do the do the sea lions make their way up from the delta through it no there's no salmon or sea lions in that atmospheric river well now why are you using the word river because i know what a river is like i swim in rivers i've been boating in rivers i'm quite accustomed to rivers i've grown up by i've lived by rivers most of my life no not that kind of river then why did you use the word well because we're trying to evoke and what they're trying to evoke is a lot of water fair enough it is from them that i've borrowed the word but these models are not like model ships small replicas small scale replicas of the reality something they sometimes they illustrate this or that aspect of it by analogy sometimes they do not illustrate but merely suggest like the sayings of the mystics an expression such as the curvature of space is strictly comparable to the old definition of god as a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere did you see what louis just did there i'll read that sentence again an expression such as the curvature of space is strictly comparable to the old definition of god as a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere now you might say now wait a minute i know how a circle works a circle center is here and its circumference is here and so but god whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere that's like the curvature of space both succeed in suggesting each does so by offering what is on the level of our ordinary thinking nonsense in other words we cannot imagine a circle whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere well what about the curvature of space well there's a model that uses that but it doesn't work in ordinary thinking sort of like the atmospheric river that is coming tonight by accepting the curvature of space we are not knowing or enjoying truth in the fashion that was once thought to be possible it would therefore be subtly misleading to say the medievals thought the universe to be like that but we now know it to be like this part of what we now know is that we cannot in the old sense know what the universe is like and that no model we can build will be in that old sense like it understand what louis is saying there he's saying that our models have changed and and the medieval models in a sense had a certain had a certain scalability to them that's why the earth was flat that's why the sun went around the earth you know someone christopher in the comments said you know phenomenological that's the word that jonathan peugeot uses so they're new models well they don't work like that and it's in that sense that well i'm holding in my hand all of those waves that have come together into particles yeah but my hand is also made up of waves well wait wait a minute wait a minute this this this stand outside of me is waves what do you mean i'm waves now i'm having a meaning crisis i'm waves i i i thought of me as as me as a story as as this as this being that that is conscious but is is beyond conscious because every night i sort of go out of consciousness but i'm still me and when i wake up in the morning i'm still me and now things are getting strange again such a statement would suggest that the old model gave way simply under the pressure of newly discovered phenomena as a detective's original theory of the crime might yield to the discovery that his first subject had an unassailable alibi and this certainly happens as regards to many details of the old model just as it happens daily in particular hypotheses in a modern laboratory exploration refuted the belief that the tropics were too hot for life the first nova refuted the belief that the transluminary realm is immutable but the change of the model as a whole was not so simple and a fair in other words well they began to see that certain that certain understandings of the old model could not anymore hold but this transition isn't quite as simple as throwing out one model and embracing another especially when the new models are so strange the most spectacular differences between the medieval model and our own concern astronomy and biology in both fields the new model is supported by a wealth of empirical evidence but we should misrepresent the historical process if we said that the eruption of new facts was the sole cause of the alteration in other words it wasn't just facts that we bumped into the old astronomy was not in any exact sense refuted by the telescope remember the math worked better the scarred surface of the moon and the satellites of jupiter can if one wants be fitted into a geocentric scheme as they were in some ways even the enormous and enormously different distances of the stars can be accommodated if you are prepared to make their sphere the stellatum of vast thickness if you look at my video about the firmament well you can still have your genesis one firmament with the sun the moon and the stars all in the firmament if you put the entire universe as seen and understood by physics within that firmament and say oh i get it the waters are outside the universe as we know it you know you can accommodate it and still have your waters above but in some ways then the genesis flood of genesis six through nine is having to travel all the way through space light years and light years and light years and light years all the way to drown the little world and then go way way way back out back to space in other words the moon had better be better be careful or it's going to have a flood too how far by endless tinkering it could have kept up with them till even now i do not know but the human mind will not long endure such ever-increasing complications if once it has seen that some of the simpler conceptions can save the appearances and louis puts that in quotation obviously with a nod to his friend owen owen barfield neither theological prejudice nor vested interests can permanently keep in favor a model capital m which which is seen to be grossly uneconomical the new astronomy triumphed not because the case of the old became desperate but because the new was a better tool the math was better once this was grasped our ingrained conviction that nature capital n herself is thrifty did the rest ockham's razor in some ways when our model is in its turn abandoned this conviction will no doubt be at work again what models we should build or whether we should build any if some great alterations in human psychology withdrew this conviction is an interesting question but the change of models did not involve astronomy alone it involved also in biology the change arguably more important from a devolutionary to an evolutionary scheme okay and you can read that in charles taylor and you can read that actually in gk chesterton chesterton raises that point exactly before the models were sort of devolutionary because there was an original pristine primeval prelapsarian world which devolved into the earth which was the lowest realm of the heavens of course there was the level below which would be hell but the realm above well you get to the moon and of course louis lays this out in the previous chapters of the book it involves also in biology the change arguably more important from a devolutionary to an evolutionary scheme now one of the interesting things about the the devolutionary and the evolutionaries how these things are really still at play with us why when i go to the grocery store do they charge for organic or natural foods rather than what's unnatural foods well what do we mean by unnatural well foods that we've tinkered with as if you can really find almost anything that hasn't been tinkered with and then i go to cosco and i can find granola from ancient grains what does that mean because well i don't know if you would find some grains that have been sitting in some clay jar for a few hundred years i don't think the food and drug administration would allow them to make granola out of that what do you mean ancient grains well we have this idea that before now notice what imaginaries were evoking that before all this industrialism things were purer and if we would only eat this purer food then we wouldn't have cancer and heart disease and all of those things we would hate lead healthier more meaningful more beautiful lives now lately all the rage is a certain youtube channel with a chinese woman very attractive chinese woman in her 20s who is tilling the soil and growing the food and making her furniture and i don't know if there's elves or fairies that are walking around with these high definition cameras and elves and fairies that are doing all that video editing because the channel is beautifully done but and then at the end of the at the end of the episode she always sits down with her grandmother and they eat this natural food now one might ask if this natural food which is grown by her own beautiful hands and lovingly worked into a gorgeous i imagine a delicious meal how grandma got so old and shriveled you would imagine that that food would keep us from getting old and shriveled but the age of decay does seem to go on but we do have devolutionary ideas that continue to rummage around in our imaginary and lead us to spend more money on organic foods rather than the inorganic foods no that's not the right word the factory food you think those ancient grain granola in that plastic bag came from somebody behind an ox no it came from a factory anyway it involves also in biology the change arguably more important from a devolutionary to an evolutionary scheme from a cosmology in which it was axiomatic that all perfect things precede all imperfect things see what his footnote is there just a regular footnote to one in which it is axiomatic that the starting point i remember looking up that german word but i don't remember what it is now is always lower than what is developed now when jonathan peugeot had his sit down before the big wave with jordan peterson and brett weinstein and brett kept talking about higher and jonathan peugeot kept saying excuse me what do you mean higher elevation is it at 6 000 feet instead of 200 feet what do you mean higher well jonathan had a real point um starting point which is always lower than what is developed the degree of change can be gauged by the fact that primitive in italics is now in most context a pejorative term now things have changed since the 1960s when lewis wrote this because well ancient grains and organic foods and ice drawn from glaciers and icebergs is now far more costly than regular food this revolution was certainly not brought about by the discovery of new facts by the discovery of new facts when i was a boy i believed that darwin discovered evolution and that the far more general radical and even cosmic developmentalism which till lately dominated all popular thought was a superstructure raised on the biological theorem this view has been sufficiently disproved the statement which i have just quoted about the antvic lungs scrund and there i did look it up reason for development was made by shelling in 1812 in him in keats in wagner's tetralogy and in girtha and herder the change to the very point of view has already taken place before darwin its growth can be traced far further back into leibniz ockenside kant some more frenchmen ma per teis i don't know who even that person is um dittaro already in 1786 robernet robinet i assume that's french believed in an active principle which overcomes brute matter and la progret progression nest pot finet which means thanks to google the progression is not over yet for him as for bergsson or deshardin the gates of the future are wide open for demand for a developing world a demand obviously in harmony both with the revolutionary and the romantic temper grows up first when it is full grown the scientists go to work and discover the evidence on which our belief in that sort of universe could now be held to rest in other words the master and his emissary the imagination first captured oh we must be progressing and then the scientists go and prove yes see the master and his emissary the intuitive brain says aha i see and the emissary says okay give me a little time and a little bit of math and i'll prove you're right there's no question here of the old models being shattered by the in rush of new phenomena the truth would seem to be the reverse that when changes in the human mind produce a sufficient dis relish of the old model and a sufficient hankering for some new one phenomena to support that new one will obediently turn up i do not at all mean that these new phenomena are illusory nature has all sorts of phenomena in stock and can suit many different tastes this is the way in which relevance realization gets very tricky and if you're going to look for something usually you can find it and we see that played out in the united states right now with our political debates do you imagine that the trump organization was plotting the overthrow of the constitutional constitutionally validated biden administration go look for that evidence you'll find it do you believe that the trump organization was trying to overturn the the constitutionally elected government to the united states go look for that evidence you'll find it well which is true well that's not the point of this video maybe youtube will do a little disclaimer beneath an interesting astra astronomical change in our model is going on at present 50 years ago if you asked an astronomer about life on other words worlds he was apt to be totally agnostic about it agnostic about it or even to stress its improbability we are now told that in so vast a universe stars that have planets and planets that have inhabitants must occur times without number and no compulsory evidence is to hand well and we've continued to look since the 40 60 years since lewis wrote this but it is irrelevant that in between the old opinion and the new we have had the vast proliferation of science fiction and the beginnings of space travel in real life pay attention to the imaginary this is what for veki they're finding zombies and zombies and vampires and monsters and surely we're heading for a disaster in the world aren't we i hope no one will think that i'm recommending a return to the medieval model i'm only suggesting considerations that may induce us to regard all models in the right way respecting each and idolizing none we are all very properly familiar with the idea that in every age the human mind is deeply influenced by the accepted model of the universe but there is a two-way traffic the model is also influenced by the prevailing temper of mind and again lewis in some ways is anticipating thomas thomas kewnes the history of scientific revolutions we must recognize that what has been called a taste in universes is not only pardonable but inevitable we can no longer dismiss the change in models as simple progress from error to truth no model is a catalog of ultimate realities and none is a mere fantasy in other words all models have a degree of relevance realization built into them because they're looking at the particular model the bay area model in salcelito california might in fact have a lot of reality to it that a computer model doesn't even if the computer model can more accurately predict let's say tidal flow in a particular storm because it's talking to other meteor all meteorological models and in fact the non-physical meteorological models that are probably informing the engineers that continue to run the bay area model or maybe they're hobbyists now because all of the engineers have discovered that the computer models work best even though the computer models are all just digital zeros and ones and the bay area models well that's physical each is serious attempt to get at all the phenomenon known at a given period now you're seeing the relevance realization come in there and each succeeds in getting in a great many but also no less surely each reflects the prevalent psychology of an age almost as much as it reflects the state of the age's knowledge in other words we made the models to look for something and i just recently watched a youtube video about statistics and you know we we share the statistic usually where we want to make the sociological or the rhetorical point hardly any battery of new facts could have persuaded a greek that the universe had an attribute so repugnant to him as infinity hardly any such battery could persuade a modern that it is hierarchical i tweeted that a couple of days ago such fun it is not impossible that our own model will die a violent death ruthlessly smashed by an unprovoked assault of new facts unprovoked as the nova of 1572 and in fact i think part of what we're seeing now in terms of this ongoing war between the liberal modernist of the idw that are saying science to those who are saying well i just saw youtube uh tiktok today saying that you thought christianity was colonistic and patriarchal secularism is too so someone who watches my video tweeted out we've been discovered they've discovered that secular is christian too and so down with it all but i think it more likely to change when and because far-reaching changes in the mental temper of our descendants demand that it should and i think this is exactly what we're seeing now am i seeing that which i believe is relevant to the models i have i'm sure i am the new model will not be set up without evidence but the evidence will turn up when the inner need for it becomes sufficiently great there's a room at hogwarts that seems to fit this description it will be true evidence but nature gives most of her evidence an answer to the questions we ask her here as in the courts the character of the evidence depends on the shape of the examination and a good cross examiner can do wonders he will not indeed elicit falsehoods from an honest witness but in relation to the total truth in the witness's mind the structure of the examination is like a stencil and we're all used to seeing this on how many court tv type things where the really crafty lawyer is able to draw from even a hostile witness the much needed evidence to release the innocent client from the grip of conviction that the hostile witness has along with the prosecuting attorney it determines how much of that total truth will appear and what pattern it will suggest and yeah so there's there's the epilogue of lewis and i think again he's basically making a point that well we wield science and as peugeot made a video about well we're following the science well yeah but you're sort of following the people who are doing the science because science doesn't do itself now i'm not as you know if you think this thing through you could come to the very disturbing reality that well maybe those postmodernists have a point yeah they do but they also have other things that they themselves have to face and so i think we can see here in this the fruits of the meaning crisis and where this is really taking us so there's the epilogue and i'll just kind of put this in as an addendum to my last commentary video so that when we get back to the next chapter and the chapters are short the next chapter in matcha peugeot's wonderful little book i can reference it thanks for watching
