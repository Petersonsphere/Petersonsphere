 I was going to open with the fact that, well, again, like, you know, I find myself as this kind of accidental progressive, and I've established now, you know, through many autobiographical details that I'm something of a contrary. And so I occupy these spaces, but I never really commit myself to any of them, which doesn't mean that I'd like to think, you know, can't participate. And that's the what appeals to me about the space that has emerged around you is that it is such a genuinely pluralistic space and I mean that in the, in the best possible sense of the word. And I don't mean pluralism mistaken for perennialism. But I mean a genuine pluralism which actually accommodates a genuine diversity of thought. At least that's what I value about this little corner of the internet, and it's what you know dismay's me about both the conservative OPC, where as far as I know I'm still listed in the bulletin as an apostate, and the mainline Presbyterian Church, where, you know, it's like incidentally Christian.
