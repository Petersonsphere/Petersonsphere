 All right, well thank you very much. Tonight we have Senator Dr. Richard Pan, current Assemblyman for this area, running for Senate District 6, and then the campaign manager for the Senate, Roger Dickinson, he could make tonight. Cool up, good night. Cool up, thank you very much. Mr. Lewis? We're going to begin with opening statements, and we'll have Assemblymember Dickinson walk us through the whole of this. Hi, I'm City Manager 1, my name is Kula Kone, and actually I, I guess that's not my job for your time, but I'm actually not doing anything. In my day job, I work as a district office. I apologize that he couldn't be here tonight, so I will do the best that I can to work with him. Assemblymember Dickinson has been elected official for about 20 years, and for some people that's better than that. I think it's a great thing that you have a record to look at. We work on supervisors, we're about 16 years as a supervisor, we work on a lot of issues that I think people in our community, staff, care about. So what it is, making sure that your kids are going to get school safe, making sure that there's money in city programs for development, making sure that, you know, children who are in the community, and so many different ways he's been there. He's someone that, he's the only one that I've ever worked with before, but that's because I really believe that, and I think a lot of people here have been attested that they know him, he's someone who, he will let you know what he thinks. And he shows up, he's there for the community, and in so many different ways he's been there. He's back around May, he was recently in door seven, and what they said was, and I thought it was very telling, it says, whether you agree with Dickinson's stance or not, he doesn't pretend to be someone who's not, and warrants voter support. And I think that's really important when you're thinking about your life for a definitive. And first, he also makes it accessible. So many people can call, as some of you heard, on his cell phone, he's there for, he has connections with people in the community, because they understand him, and he's fought for so many different interests, and my time is up right now, but I'll talk more about that. Thank you, and thank you so much for having me here, it's great to be back, I love you here. I'm Dr. Richard Pan, I'm your current Assemblymember. I actually, in many ways, as I mentioned, actually some of them, Dickinson actually had this area before I represented you, and I'm proud to be here to be representing you, I'm proud to have you over at the District Office, just down the street here, on a foreign road, so we can serve our community here. And as an Assemblymember, I haven't been around the political office as long as Mr. Dickinson, but I have worked hard, both before I got elected to office, and as an official deliverer for you. Before I worked for the children's health care coverage, 65,000 children's health care coverage, helps strengthen our community clinics, and the motor supervisor, who actually closed the county clinics. And since being elected, I've worked to make sure that we keep our fire stations open. When I was running, they were talking about closing fire stations, and we got six, right now our region has six million more dollars to keep fire stations open. I've worked to try to get more school nurses and health professionals into schools. I've worked to get health care coverage. We have reduced the number of uninsured in the state and our area by half. I did that working with community groups together, as well as offering legislation to regulate insurance companies, to make sure they can't deny them existing conditions, and also making sure that we had people in the community working together to get people involved during the enrollment period. And so, certainly here locally, the vision having district office here, I'm proud to have partner helping out the other week, give it to a renewable pool, trying to get that going, still sponsoring many community events as well. We've had in our district office, we've had health care, where we've given out free eyeglasses, free immunizations, dental screenings. We've worked with people in the community to make that happen, because that's what they call the city. So we've been very present here in this community. I'm proud of that work, and I'm looking forward to continuing to represent you and creating that kind of direct service and partnership at the Sears State Center. Thank you. So the first question will be for you. Who are some of the local leaders who are supporting you that you might like to highlight? Well, I'm proud, actually, of the many people who are supporting me. I'm proud to have Merrick, Evan Johnson, supporting me. I'm proud that we have public safety leaders like the DA, Ann Stully, and the Sheriff, Sacramento Sheriff Scott Jones, endorse me. I'm proud that I'm endorsed by the Sacramento Observer, who said that I'm a leader for these times. I'm proud that we have, but it's not just about politicians. It's also about community members who have been supporting me. And we've worked together with many community leaders to help get people health care providers, to help improve our schools and get better access to schools, to help out our neighborhood associations. And those are the types of people that I'm more proud or proud to support of, because that's really about the work that we've done in the community. So it's not just a long list of, you know, fellow elected officials. Some of them have been in politics for decades. It's more about people who are on the ground, who are actually doing the work in the front lines of the community. That's why I'm proud to have people like Betty Williams and Joe Depp supporting my campaign, because they've been out there in the front lines working to make things better. So same question for Elizabeth. To know some of the local leaders you like that have been. I have an over-the-court document that's labeled. And it says, I have a lot of big names in there that are people that support, you know, like this Einstein and Steinberg and the law leaders. But what I just want to point out is our support is so diverse in the community. So we don't have any page walkers. We have people who volunteer their time, and they go overboard, and they talk to people about why they support us and who we're doing this for. I think that's something really important to think about. So there's lots of names, people that you don't know that support us, but there's also many people that you don't know. I think that's probably the most important part we come to the campaign headquarters. You'll see students there from Grant High School, from Sac State, and those people who are walking, none of them are getting paid by the team I'm here to pay. But the people who are walking through the door are giving up their Saturday mornings, they believe that someone will dig us in, they know what is done, and they have faith that he will be there for them, work hard for them. So, you know, I can list all the names. There are Roberts, there's Roberts Family Development Center, there's Steinberg, there's Gretchen Dodd, there's the Sac State Partner Institution, we have them be part of it. But again, I would just say that it's lots of people from the community that are going to be a part of the Sac State Community Association that are leaders there, but it's just the community that hurts. And that's the way that we're going to have, you know, that's how we're going to be staying. But what has the Assembly member done in the Assembly to address public safety, and how would he continue to address the members in the Assembly? I think the Assembly member has used public safety and a more prevention arena. So he asked the chair of select committees around the Chair of Banking and Finance, he asked the chair of select committees on youth development and violence prevention. And through that committee, he really got to hear some of the issues that were going on with youth in school, and so that disproportionately the youth project was suspended for a very wide-ranging term of a local defined group, if you were in Longfellow at it and such, that it was male and minority students. And he thought to get, it took him about three years, finally, for the government to sign this bill, which is more disciplined than it was. To say that you cannot expel students, for both of them, from school, you do restorative justice. It was hard because actually, you know, some of the teachers, just as they do not so well about that, they say they're taking away power from the teachers. But he worked with them, so my publicist said, you know, they're taking away power, but he said, you know what, this is what keeps our kids from going to jail, because if they are out of school, if they're on the streets, that is what happens. And then he also thought for bill 8218, and that bill is about fair government taxes. We also call it a stamp box. So that is, if you are convicted of a crime, and you're in a private job, you know, with the county or government office, on that first initial screening, they cannot ask you if you've been convicted of a felony, of a crime, because what we all know is that as soon as you see that box checked, you're going to the tax bank. So then what happens, someone always says, you know, the master makes stuff, they just stuff a bill letter to people that are in the job, and it's like, get people jobs. So get them, let someone make fun of them, someone that tells their story. So that just because they have been convicted of a crime, they're not automatically accepted. So those are the ways that he really thinks about public safety, but you know, there's also people who work on a debt-resurance rotation as well. You know, on all those years that you work with the city attorney about, so you think of folks who are, who if they have, they're going to have, you know, drugs or guns, and that's going to make this work on as well. So what I would say is one of the things I've heard is that people don't really get a chance to prevent, you know, a prevention standpoint, but also we've got to focus on prevention. Dr. Pancey, what have you done with public safety? Assembly helped me do that. So let's talk about public safety and the route of my public safety record and what I've done in the community. So just this spring, last spring, around Mack Road, there were several shootings that spring, there were 15 shootings that spring. Everyone was worried about what happened with the sun, right? The duty was that after it gets hotter, the prime-merchant increase is the shootings increase. And so my office, we worked with pastors in the area, people like Bishop Lessons. We worked with the police department's cops and clergy program. This is Mack Road partnership. We worked together and we created a program called Summer Night Lights, bring people together in the community to get a place where families can come together, get to know each other, have a safe place to be. And there were no shootings the entire summer. There were no shootings the entire summer. So we were working on the ground, partnering with people in the community to try to keep people safe, bring people together, building trust between different parts of the community. That's what public safety is about. We talked about other things called the safety. So my first term, both Senator Nixon and I, both we voted for realigning, right? The state prisons were too crowded. The prisons were too crowded, and we were moving state prisons to our local jails, right? We were actually with the goal of using what's called the citizenry, having people return and actually being able to provide more services to help people after they're in jail to be able to be better set for success. Now, my colleague has been mentioned by the state's representative and county government for, that could be us, for like 16 years. 16 years, right. But so what happened after we vote for this now county has to deal with these prisoners coming to the county? So part of the law enforcement is creating a community partnership. I and one of my staff have been at every single meeting, that partnership, because we want to be sure we work with our county officials to be sure we protect public safety. And that kind of ongoing partnership is not just about voting for a bill, but it's about partnership and staying in that partnership and staying in keeping people safe. So, so to get a little bit into economic development, what have you done in terms of the assembly and how did you get to do that in the Senate? Sure. Well, my wife and I are small business owners, so I know it's like that to create jobs, and we created jobs. In the state assembly, it's hard to work with people in both the labor and business community to talk about how we bring the jobs on trial to be endorsed by, on the labor side, by people like SCIU, TASC, the School Employees Association, many people fighting for good jobs, also endorsed by the Sacramento Chamber of Commerce, the Elk Grove Chamber of Commerce, the Asian Chamber of Commerce, and others business groups. Because they know I'm the one who's going to work to try to create the economic environment to create jobs. So I'm being supported by both labor and business because they know I'm the one who's working on creating a concrete solution to try to build a good job. Some of the things that we're also working on is how do we diversify our economy? In fact, Sacramento Leagues reported that health care is actually becoming the largest employer. We usually think we're a government town, right? We have the state capital. Health care is one of the largest employers. In fact, with the Affordable Care Act, we extended Medicaid. We're bringing in an additional $2 to $4 billion in growth, $2 to $4 billion a year for Medicaid expansion. Now, it's not just because we need $2 to $4 million, that's just going to cover more people, which we are, so we're reducing the number of insurers I have. But we're also doing jobs. It's estimated to create over 100,000 jobs in the whole state, including probably about 17,000 jobs in this region. So we need to be sure we prepare our youth, people, and also for them to take those jobs. That's job creation. And I'm also working to, for example, there's a medical school, a new medical school in Elk Grove, and I'm working with them to think about why the economic engines UC Davis spends, et cetera. We're working on bringing another medical school right here, because those are good jobs in health care. And so those are just a couple of things. I can keep going through a lot of that, but we're going to do three more jobs here. So the next thing is sort of a ridiculous start-up of jobs in the company, and how do we continue those? Sure. I think just even first, kind of going back a little bit, he was a health supervisor representing the recovery here, and then the health care for the space sector closed down. If anybody's going to live in that area, a lot of people were in health jobs with a date. And he really worked with Larry's Care and Rehabilitation Center, and this is part to really bring in businesses that we have there now, partnering, using case influence as a professor would say great thing, and so a lot of the businesses that are in there right now to make sure that, just because this is a basis code, a lot of people are, some people before so would have had an option for an appointment. And you can go to the health business part right now, and you'll see there's a little pavilion there, because Roderick would be in the pavilion, because he really did help to make sure that that was something that would be, there are people, so many of the people in my town were in on that basis. You know, currently I would say, I think he just talked to a bill that will, it's kind of a tool for redevelopment that allows local cities to issue bonds actually for infrastructure refinancing districts. So that at least allows, this obviously is a development, but at least it still gives us some tools to be able to have some sort of development and drop creation within communities. I would also say, he does a lot of things that also maybe not, but actually I think it was a good example, for example, the arena, we have standard at the very end of the session, actually has a sort of sequel, that's environmental view, kind of fast track streamlines, so to speak, so that we could get the requirements and approval that we needed for the arena. He also pushed through a transportation bill that allowed for our teams to continue some of the construction they're doing, you know, which brought money in, we couldn't call them all exactly the areas that we were looking for, we're not developing the things for the areas, so that there could be, our teams could continue to grow, and again, we're still looking for a platform, but this is about real, practical, and possible, just needs that are going on. This is what we're talking about, we're not developing a combination of those things. So, last one. I can't get a lot, you can't provide any example of something, we talked a lot about that about strong voices for neighborhoods, it was a theme during the measure L, what happened to city council districts without a forum next, something that the Assembly has done on the ground level in a neighborhood that would show accessibility and is concerned for neighborhood issues. I guess the thing that comes to mind, I guess just recently we were reached out to, I don't know if we could say that, but those who were in the immigration forum speared those actors to have a meeting with the sheriff, because the sheriff was, the county sheriff was actually not adherent to the trust act, but the trust act basically said that it's protecting families, and they're not, the sheriff's department is not supposed to alert the immigration and customs enforcement if they arrest someone that is undocumented, and there have been cases, the ACLU has cited cases that the sheriff's department is actually alerting ICE as they pick up someone who is undocumented, and those people are being taken to ICE in Texas and in custody and ready for deportation, so that's something that came out, and I've had kids see how many shots were sent to them, we had a meeting this morning with the sheriff's department, they took out the card and they took that out, we were trying to figure out why is it the trust act, why they're not doing it here, what's the sort of thing that's happening there, and as someone is picked up, they're then subsequently deported or taken into ICE custody and subjected to deportation, this is something that is bringing up families, and it's something that is near and dear, that we talk with communities about how to reach out, so I'm very sick of that, but I'll also say when the school was closer, I actually understood that something that was going to be sent was president, and my parents today are now knowing why the schools are not faster, they've been very vocal about equity issues in terms of where schools are being closed. I think I've already mentioned the work we've done in our peer interview with Mr. Dapis, we're very proud of that, so let me just mention another example, I know people from other avenues to go entry, we work with that community, so one of the things that happened in that community was that a lot of kids on school lunch, there was a mix-up where basically a summer program was present, so you had children who were taking on food from schools, they were going to school here, something they could not have food over the summer, we worked with the people with the green and maybe other community organizers in there, as well as the school to get the kids school lunches over the summer, we worked it out, we got kids school lunches so they wouldn't be hungry, and what about the parents, what about the families? There was actually a problem with the food banks, they were not getting food deliveries there, we worked with the food association again to work with the food banks to bring in food so that people could get food, people who were hungry in that community, that community they wanted to try to get when the kids were in school, and when the school was starting up again, we partnered with them to help get the school uniforms they wanted to use, school uniforms, started school supplies to help out the kids there, and we did that because we heard from the community that that was something that we needed to do, and again we've been dealing out there partnering with communities, pushing back road, we've been working out and reaching out to people to do that, so that's something I want to continue to do, that's something I strongly believe in, that's what we are just adopting as some form of revenue, not in some office building somewhere. So we move on to closing statements, please. Did I open this? Yes, I said that was going to be it. So you'll start with the first closing and then I'll move on to the second. Well, thank you all for being here tonight. I would say, you know, someone I really didn't know is someone who, someone who really, if you listen to me, you really get, I mean, we have a lot of different vibrant communities, and I'm hoping to play folks with me and help with the nation. But one of the things that resonates is that he really is able to also bring in other sectors that he would involve. So for example, we did a backpack track, we did that on a health pre-elementary not too long ago, but it was reaching out to, you know, we don't have money for that, so we gave out $700 backpack to two students, or whether it's going on a blue scenario, we have them learning about nutrition, but we're making it fun as well so that the family can really figure out, this is how that we are healthy, or whether it's really going forward and saying, look, we're thinking big, we're going to drop right now. What is it that we can do? And he asked, this is where groundwater legislation that's talking about, how do we preserve our groundwater? Because this is where it has ground, and this is mysterious, and this thing is important, and what we do about it. And so it was hard to get that built to pass, but we're pushing it through. And I think, you know, you need a leader in the Senate who is successful, who has shown that he cares, and has the smart and also the hood spots, so he's saying, look, we're going to do this. And it's not great to also get down and bury someone. But Ken Ray Park, you know, broke down, he said he got a lot, he got like 30 people out there on the hottest day, all in, you know, and he's here ready to go, and we're digging and doing cool, and getting the park ready, and he's just someone that's buried, and people need there, and I just hope that he's someone that you support. Well, thank you so much for having me here. I am here, and I have been here. I've been at multiple events in this area. You've had a chance to be represented by both of us. So you can see, you can talk about yourselves about the difference that you may see between the biggest and the most important things that you may see, representing and excluding. I'm arriving to bring my real-world experience as a doctor, as an educator, small business owner, and a parent to the state Senate to try to work, keep myself safe. I think you may hear our questions and talk about many things I've done. And it's all very much based on my belief that it's very important that we partner with people in the community, that we work together to make real differences in people's lives. That's why it's positioned, people often ask me why they follow running. That's why I ran. That's why I'm in public service, and that's why I run for the state Senate. Talk about reducing the number of uninsured by half. We still have half to go. There's still work to do. Probably what we've done with the public is to try to keep people safe, but there's still work to do. We still are dealing with crime. We're working to keep the environment clean, proud to have led out of our environment, out of our water requirements, proud to make sure we keep people safe, and protect our children. That's why it's more as a pediatrician. That's why it's also been doing as a Senate member. That's why I'm going to continue to do this state Senate. I'm proud to represent you. I'll be honored if you give me the opportunity to continue to represent you by looking forward to partnering with you, whatever happens in November. That's why I did it in the House of Representatives, and I have great partners with people that's a pediatrician, and UC Davis, partners with many organizations in this area, getting doctors out in the communities. I'm going to continue to do that. I look forward to your support and your votes. Hopefully, I'll give you the opportunity to do that again. Thanks very much. Applause Okay, I'll take another brief break now. We'll get the candidates for the City Council and District data. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
