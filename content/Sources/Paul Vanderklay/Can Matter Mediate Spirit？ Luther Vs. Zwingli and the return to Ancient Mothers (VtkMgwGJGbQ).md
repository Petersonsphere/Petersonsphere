 Hi, this is Paul as is often the case the video I intend to do grows into something else I Started out this morning thinking about these three well people who have gone from Protestantism back to ancient mothers in the case of Gavin Ashen Ashenden to the Roman Catholic Church and in case of the Peugeot brothers to the Orthodox Church and This is a very interesting development Ashenden was just yesterday on Karen Wong's channel the meaning code Karen lives not too far from me Karen's been at my local meetup Karen's been on my channel. I've been on Karen's channel Karen does regular conversations with a number of the people in the bridges of meaning discord server Karen's an artist. She's on her own quest for truth early fan of Jordan Peterson if you look on my channel Karen has quite a story and and I love I really love what she's done with her channel and Unlike me when Karen, you know see somebody out there wants to have a conversation with she goes right after them And so she had a lovely conversation with with Gavin. Dr. Gavin Ashenden who had recently done a video on Jordan Peterson that I mentioned in a previous video and I really appreciated Karen's video because she did what I usually do she dug deep into his story which gave us quite a bit more background on the good doctor and his Desire well why he moved back to Roman Catholicism There's also a very interesting interview with him out on the deling pod podcast Deling pod had that very interesting interview with Tom Holland a couple of years ago anyway Dr. Ashenden, you know was well very interesting story listen to her video But you know was an Anglican saw Anglicanism I think as many do today is sort of a best of both worlds an ability to sort of incorporate the Roman Catholic or the the sacramental traditions and some of the elements of the Protestant Reformation and Yeah, it was it was it was very interesting but then he discovered and there's more details on this on the deling pod podcast than necessarily on Karen's but Actually really sort of different kinds of details Really couldn't really didn't imagine that the Church of England was going to be able to stand up to what I called in my last video the successor religion in the UK and so fled to the Roman Church and Has been happy there and then started a YouTube channel and I was again the whole this whole conversation He had with with Karen was was simply was simply a delight now I set out and might still do we'll see What I feel like at towards the end of this video because I've got a lot of reading to do during this video I was going to just continue on in my series of Matthew Peugeot's Language of creation, you know, it's interesting that the the sub subtitle is a commentary and The books behind me here are all commentaries and it's not really like any commentary. I have Very accustomed to using commentaries. I own hundreds of them and use them all the time I have a lot of comments on my channel, but I don't really like to use them to use them to using commentaries I own hundreds of them and use them all regularly Julian when that once asked me, you know, do you use those books behind you? Yes, I do. I just don't pull them off the shelf when I'm making videos the Peugeot brothers grew up in a deeply committed evangelical family and I've mentioned many times that None of us really escape our roots and The former evangelicals who are moving to orthodoxy Bring some of what they were to orthodoxy and I don't mean that as an insult or a put-down. I mean we all bring where we were to where we go and So well, I've been reading I'm always reading something The roots of evangelicalism I've been doing a lot of thinking in my recent videos if you've been watching my videos as you notice about politics and evangelicalism the roots of Evangelicalism really belong more in the Swiss Reformation than in Luther's Reformation and these strands have deeply influenced people far beyond even those who self-consciously consider themselves Christian these days and You know the more I read Matt Choupageau's book. I'm sure I'm just butchering his name The more I I see it as As really an evangelical reappropriate attempting to reappropriate a tradition and to And to work through a lot of the issues But you know so often when I read the language of the book it strikes me as so evangelical now again That's not a put-down. I'm not I'm not using that as a smear or anything like that And I hope that the the Peugeot brothers don't take it as such because I'm you know, I'm a very big fan but It's just hard and this again is part of Tom Holland's thesis It's just hard to get away from this stuff in the West because this history is so deep and It the more I read this stuff. It amazes me how this history forms us and and we're simply Unaware of it One of the things I saw immediately when I saw Gavin Ashenden's video of Jordan Peterson I might be wrong here, but it sure looks like the book that I've been reading which is Carlos Is it eerie? I don't know how he says his name Reformations the early modern world 1450 to 1650 and I I got tipped off to this book by Tom Holland mentioned it on a podcast and I I listened for book recommendations and the the cover is a famous a famous statue that was brutalized in an iconoclastic attack, let's say and You can you can look up the statue in the history of it. It's very very interesting, but The book I've been you know, I was reading the book for a while then I put it down because reading other things and now I picked it up again and Really got into the Swiss refer the chapter on the Swiss Reformation which really opened my eyes The point of the book which is not which is a point made by many other historians I mean because history keeps changing and what I mean by history keeps changing the writing of history keeps changing and I was very much schooled in I pretty much got the standard treatment that most Dutch reformed CRC people would get which is a fairly flat fairly low-resolution view of the Protestant Reformation a lot of hagiography you know Luther and Calvin can do no wrong and are the true heirs of Augustine and But the more I the more I think through these issues a lot of the issues that I'm going to be reading about in the book Today, you know, there's so many different threads woven over time through these events and how they've come to us through Church history and through politics and through culture Let's let's let's let's get into the let's get into the Swiss Reformation You know when I read When I started reading the book, I was pondering how poor my Preparation of the Swiss Reformation had been of course. I knew whose wingly was and I could distinguish between I thought I could at least and again our friend Brett Sackold has given us a Really lovely book on transubstantiation, but you could distinguish between Transubstantiation the Roman Catholic position consubstantiation the Lutheran position real presence the Calvinist position and this sort of in symbol only posture on the sacrament by the Zwing lians and just recently I should probably pull the book up Not too long ago, but I think it's been a while since I've read the book Not too long ago Peter I should say craved because the Dutchman always complain about how I butcher the Dutch language and I should know better but Peter craved We share we are both alumnus of Eastern Christian and Calvin College before he defected to the Roman Catholic Church Breaking the hearts of many Dutch Calvinist scholars at Calvin College but Peter craved just recently wrote a book symbol or substance and Peter craved has written a lot of dialogues he sort of likes to use that method and it's a conversation between Imaginary imaginary conversation between CS Lewis Billy Graham and JR are Tolkien Tolkien, of course a devout Roman Catholic Lewis, of course an Anglican and Billy Graham, of course Critical leader of the neo-evangelical movement in the mid 20th century in the United States and we've talked about Billy Graham a little bit in the past and You know part of what comes out of this book is the is the deep influences of Zwingli and the Zwinglian position throughout American evangelicalism Conversation with my friend Len van De Zee Again land van De Zee wrote a wonderful book Christ baptism and the Lord's Supper Quite right in the and by IVP press and This is one of the first books that I read that really made me start to think about sacraments and that was before the whole Jordan Peterson business, but Len very important leader in the Christian Reformed Church You know listen to a lot of what was going on and thinking is that what Calvin believed and so he did this study and And eventually wrote this book Lends a terrific writer and a terrific preacher and a terrific Christian So these issues have been around and and are really quite important now The Swiss had a rather unusual political situation and religious situation with respect to both the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church They were really quite buffered both by political both from political authority Papal authority and imperial power of the Emperor and it's the book lays this out quite nicely reformations does and and Zwingli's revolt is really parallel and maybe even a little before Luther and And there are many cases which the book talks about where Zwingli in some ways You know, he comes out very strongly against indulgences and he's backed by his bishop And so there's simply no blowback but that doesn't happen in Luther's case and so you have the blow-up that sort of Indicates that the imagined complete tyranny in Late medieval Catholicism was was consistently enforced. It certainly was not But Zwingli doesn't get the same response that Luther got or really the same attention or treatment But I think this book makes a case that in many ways Zwingli Zwingli's reformation is Is broader and more enduring Than Luther's and Luther gets all the attention but it probably should be the Swiss Reformation that gets most of the attention because most of the vital Christian Branches of the tree today Well, so you know your main branches you have the Orthodox the Roman Catholic and then the Protestants and within the Protestants you've got The Lutheran Church, but the Lutheran Church is relatively small compared to what will grow out of the Zwingli and the Swiss Reformation which will be both the Anabaptist tradition and The broader reformed tradition and you really have to separate and Distinguish between let's say Zwingli and Calvin between Zurich and Geneva as this grows especially with respect to Depending on whether or not Len is right with respect to the Lord's Supper For nearly five centuries now a question has lingered to what extent was Zwingli influenced by Luther in 1518 Zwingli denied that he ever followed Luther's lead in any way and never gave Luther any credit Saying that long before Luther was known in Switzerland He himself had already begun to preach the pure gospel and that he had learned about the fraud of indulgences from his mentor Wittenbach in Basel Whether or not Luther's Luther influenced Zwingli matters little in the long run for it is quite obvious that Zwingli did indeed Experience a significant conversion before Luther became well known and that the two men disagreed on several key points and came to distrust each other So, you know, they both in some ways share Sola Scriptura They both shares wingly I'm sure excuse me. They both share Erasmus But in many ways Zwingli is a more faithful disciple of Erasmus Then Luther was Luther's this is where personality and history really come together. I mean Luther is just such a Guy who is low and agreeableness I mean you push Luther he pushes back I mean early on in my channel you can find it at a conversation with Ron Dard about Jordan Peterson and my assertion was Peterson and Luther, you know temperamentally seem a lot alike because you push Jordan Peterson He pushes back you push Luther he pushes back Where Luther began was quite a bit more moderate than where Luther ended up But in comparison with Zwingli where Luther ended up was still quite a bit more moderate than Zwingli and especially The radical Reformation or Anabaptist tradition that eventually grows out of Zurich some of which this is a big discussion in terms of Historians because okay Carlsbad, you know might likely be owned by the Anabaptists and And Carlsbad sort of comes out of Luther's point in this, you know, I've you know listened to enough Dominic Sandbrook and Tom Holland now that you know some of these historian debates about well did the Was it was it these men who launched this movement or was it were the men sort of the the final popping off? Points for the the spiritual forces that were in at work in the imaginary You know many it's often said that Erasmus laid the egg that Luther hatched and and here Carlos Erie says that's totally mistaken Zwingli truly hatched Erasmus's reforming egg Zwingli truly hatched Erasmus's reforming egg Luther would merely scramble it While Luther's conversion began with the biblical text of the Psalms and Romans and focused solely on the issue of justification Zwingli's began with a poem of Erasmus with a focus on ritual and piety and on the question of proper witness These two different starting points would have made firmly fixed at the center of each reformers Hermeneutics and prevent them from ever agreeing with each other on the meaning of symbols and rituals and on the larger goals of the Reformation Zwingli gave no exact dates for his Erasmus conversion, but he admitted it took place sometime between 1514 and 1515 remember Luther's blow up in in Wittenberg is 1517 The brief life altering poem in question was titled The brief life altering poem in question was titled the complaint of Jesus Now again, I've you know Read a couple of years ago um a terrific book on on Erasmus on Erasmus and Luther and Again, Luther gets Luther just gets all the attention, you know fatal fatal this was a fatal discord The Complaint of Jesus which lampooned the cult of the saints and popular attitudes towards prayer now Erasmus Wished to consider himself a faithful servant of the Roman Church But Erasmus was a critic of many things that many who followed Erasmus would also be critical of and take it Take it further Speaking in the first person Jesus be moans that he was that he has nothing to do in heaven because no one ever prays to him Bored and restless. He complains that everyone prays prayers prays to the saints instead, especially to his mother the virgin mary Zwingli's own description of his response to this poem written several years later in 1523 Lays out an explicit detail the nature of his conversion and of the reforming vision that would guide all of his work from that point forward This is Zwingli I shall not keep from you most beloved brethren in christ How I arrived at the opinion and the firm belief that we need no mediator other than christ And also that no one other than christ alone can mediate between god and us Eight or nine years ago I read a consoling poem about the lord jesus by his most by the most learned Erasmus of rotterdam Which jesus complains in a most beautiful way that men did not seek all good in him In order that he might be a wellspring of goodness for them a redeemer comforter and treasurer of the soul And then and there I was convinced that this was true indeed. Why then should we seek help from any creature? Good Erasmian that he had become zwingli turned directly to the bible Which he had already accepted as the supreme authority and also to church fathers of the second through fifth centuries now That's important and that is something that Is often overlooked That was from you henry you're making a call during the video and you're once again going to brag How about how you henry and you know which henry i'm talking about? Became went from being a good protestant over now into cheering the roman catholic church So if you if you wonder why I dismissed your call there it was Anyway, oh and now he's trying again. I can't talk now henry. I'm making a video Back to the church fathers So when my friend eric who's been on my channel Came to sacramento and eric was part of this sort of these neo sacramentalist Neocatholic Christian reformed lads who are there are a few of them around the denomination You know telling me how much church how much how much john calvin wrote about the church fathers? That certainly wasn't emphasized in my christian reformed education in the 70s and 80s How interesting but here it is church fathers to the second and fifth century, uh, very instrumental in zwingly Whom he accepted as the best interpreters of scripture now remember i'm getting to this by thinking of the peugeot brothers And they would agree with zwingly on this point and remember they also come out of I see I don't recall I don't think I asked a lot of specifics, but I suspect they were part of they were baptists now baptists are interesting because some baptists have very strong Calvinist roots other baptists have more zwingly in roots But again as as peter craved is noting, you know Perhaps we're seeing some of this in terms of the and can follow track some of this in terms of the sacraments. Anyway Finding no mention of the cult of the saints in the bible and very little in the fathers Zwingly turned away from the medieval catholic piety and down the path toward a total break with the past And this point then zwingly was already convinced of the primacy of the bible something akin to luther sola scriptura And of the need to scrutinize all piety by scriptural guidelines and as As eerie describes in quite vivid detail The swiss reformation it's it's fascinating the zeal In the streets of the iconoclasts for the bible and against the roman church And against the things that stood for the roman church and that that zeal echoed throughout the centuries and seemed to be quite easy to pass on through through protestant ranks as years to come and I think also You know, there's always sort of this interesting relationship between the protestants and the christians And there's a very interesting relationship between the protestant reformation and the peasant revolts now, of course Luther was quite brutal in terms of putting down the peasant revolts zwingly of also was a magisterial Protestant what that means was he was sort of on the side of the magistrates But when you get into the radical reformation and the anabaptists, that's really where it becomes a deeply populist movement In this respect he had arrived at a very different conclusion at very similar conclusion regarding scriptural authority By means of a very different route But the differences are manifest in the similarities zwingly was more intensely focused on the issue of worship and intercession This is really interesting And on the need to restrict to a strictly the need to the need to return to a strict Christocentric piety Then on the soteriological questions that so consumed luther's attention Let me read that sentence again because that distinction is going to play out In in eerie's treatment of these two and comparing and contrast Zwingly was more intensely focused on the issue of worship and intercession And on the need to return to a strictly Christocentric piety than on the soteriological That's the salvation justification by faith issue questions that so consumed luther's attention His burning preoccupation became how to best approach god and relate to him Not how to find forgiveness and as we're going to see a little bit later that plays out and how the swiss reformation calvin included Approaches sort of world and life view issues Now i'm not taking this in sequence from the book I'm i'm just taking these snippets and there's a fair amount of material on zwingly and the swiss reformation before The section on the radical reformation. So i'm just taking snippets of it from different places I'm also moving them around. Uh, some of the earlier quotes actually come from later in the chapters and some later earlier The progress of the the progress of reformation in switzerland can be traced most efficiently and And revealingly by following the trail of iconoclastic ruin From zurek iconoclasm spread in waves to smaller communities under its jurisdiction And in turn to other major cities and their territories bern and st. And st. Gale Would follow suit in 1528 Constance basil and schaffhausen in 1529 Uh new chattel in 1530 and geneva in 1535. Geneva is geneva interestingly enough is relatively late Of course, john calvin is french uh He takes on a like many of the humanists it's helpful to understand what a What a youth wave renaissance humanism was that's what all the cool kids were studying In addition under the jurisdiction of these larger cities There were numerous smaller communities where the old religion was attacked and dismantled older histories of the swiss reformation Have a keen awareness of the significance of iconoclasm contemporary chronicers such as Uh, johannes stump and and jean jay For instance structured their narratives around the attack on traditional symbols and rituals It made no difference that pastor stump was protestant and sister gene a catholic Back then both parties knew that the reformation was all about hand-to-hand combat over symbols and rituals That's so different from Let's say the story that I was raised with Where the protestant reformation was all about theology? Well, it certainly was about theology But I would imagine that theology is probably a secondary manifestation and the much more aggressive attacks on symbols and rituals Is early theology the rider on the elephant probably comes later It made no difference though. Okay, three centuries later major historians of the reformation such as jh murrell I gotta learn french We're still aware of the significance of the pattern He depended on iconoclasm for his narrative structure and also wisely used it as an interpretive lens Observing that in times of the reformation the doctors attacked the pope and the people the images That's hugely important the doctors attacked the pope and the people the images The pattern of reform in switzerland is laid bare by iconoclasm for a very simple reason The war against the idols the statue the iconography Always brought the conflict with the old status quo two ahead Now what's really interesting is if you look at this pattern you can see it played out In all sorts of contemporary church fights and political fights So the war against the idols always brought the conflict with the old status quo to a head Since it questioned the legal status of the images and the mass now a lot of this religious art was quite valuable as he makes the point another place in the book and The value was was held in private hands and so, you know and we bumped into this with the the The iconoclasm that we've seen in the streets recently Wherever the the catholic church was still legally ensconced Iconoclasts always had to be tried for their crimes and the trials had the unique potential For bringing the religious conflict to some sort of resolution You see this in the civil rights movement. You see this for example in the supreme court overturning all the state Laws against same-sex marriage notice that interesting pattern Wherever the catholic church was still legally ensconced Iconoclasts always had to be tried for their crimes and the trials had a unique potential To bring the religious conflict to some sort of resolution whether by public debate popular vote or magisterial decision It's very interesting. For example the christian-informed church the current battle over same-sex marriage People who have wanted this was the same these were the same tactics tactics used in the battle over women's ordination Do it and then see if they prosecute you that's basically neil and avenue strategy today The pattern set in zurek was followed nearly everywhere else in switzerland First the old symbols and rituals would be challenged through iconoclastic acts Then the legality of these acts would be openly debated in a disputation Where the iconoclastic reformers hoped to prove that the bible was the sole authority and that it demanded the Absolution of the abolition of images and the mass isn't that interesting? As zurek would be as in zurek it would be the civil powers The lay oligarchy that ruled the city that would approve the reformation and this is a pattern you see in the protestant Reformation over and over and over again. It's deeply entwined with politics The entire movement again luther would not have lived if his elector had not squirreled him away in the In the um in the castle to to save his life It's the the strange patchwork of the holy roman empire that facilitates this um and again in a recent in the contra factual episode of Of the rest is history They asked the question what if england and france stayed united? What would have happened in terms of the protestant reformation? What if henry the eighth had had a son? Interesting interesting questions As in zurek it would be the civil powers the lay oligarchy that ruled the city that would approve the That would approve the reformation and with the abolition of the old religion a whole new church and a new society Would be established and a very different relationship between church and state now that is critical here because These foundations set in the swiss reformation are going to set up what comes over with the pilgrims and the puritans and even the And all the dissenters that will make their way to north america And so in that way the swiss reformation is likely more foundational for the establishment of the strange mixture of politics and religions that we have in the united states Than luther's reformation Zwingli's main objective as a theologian and a reformer was to discriminate between true and false religion very Antithetical and I you'll you'll you'll you'll i'll often mention abraham kiper who has this strange relationship between common grace and the antithesis And I often talk about this with respect to analog versus digital I'll talk about it with respect to bounded set versus center set Theories of of groups and structures So when was made that main objective as a theologian and reformer was to discriminate between true and false religion and to discern the ultimate object of christian belief and behavior Influenced as he was by humanism and especially get this By neoplatonism and erasmus. Well there that opened my eyes again how many of these conversations between peugeot and Verveky aren't we knocking on this door of neoplatonism again if you haven't watched sam adams conversation with john verveky on neoplatonism You should Zwingli conceived of religion as more than merely theology Religion was a way of life to him a total integration of the individual and the community with a higher Reality in the here and now and again this this will transmit it to the world Transmit itself very deeply Into the american express experiment through the english dissenters who will make their way to the new colonies in the new world Zwingli's religion was above all practical Practical problem-solving endeavor to align oneself and one's world as much as possible with the divine will And when we get a little bit later into the question of metaphysics and Ongoing question of this channel. How can we conceptualize what we mean by this word spiritual? That's right in there, okay Zwingli's god was a transcendent one Who dwelt in the realm of the spirit and demanded to be worshiped as such in other words all the statues and And even the sacrament itself its physicality was a problem and already you see this division between Matter and spirit and this is where Peugeot's book gets interesting because that book is all about what's the relationship between heaven and earth between matter and spirit and Where does humanity fit into that and so we're going to talk about that in a little bit And so you see all of these issues are very much at play and we see that to one degree between luther and zwingli Zwingli's god was a transcendent other capital o Who dwelt in the realm of spirit and demanded to be worshiped as such without material mediation and that will be key Largely because of the influence of florentine Neoplatonism now this is something i'm gonna have to dig up and Erasmus Zwingli was keenly focused on metaphysics and especially on the distinction between spirit and matter which he considered two distinct realms Very interesting Because I see this in the current debates god number one and god number two In terms of sam harris in terms of sacraments All of these these these deeply held assumptions that they're you know I don't that they're sort of the way people feel their way around their imaginary And this swingly differed greatly from luther For whom matter and spirit were not polar opposites you know again, maybe I should Should probably send this video or maybe this book. Where is my where's my brett sockled book? I gotta hold it up Maybe it's over there But this is the transubstantiation real presence all of these issues sort of get Concentrated into the question of the sacraments and a little bit later I'm not gonna read that part a little bit later with the attempt to sort of unify this these disparate Protestant elements will fall apart between luther and swingly precisely over this issue In this swingly differed greatly from luther for whom matter and spirit are not polar opposites swingly's matter spirit dialectic and his sense of god's utter Transcendence stand at the very center of his thought and also at the heart of his most pragmatic reforms distrust of mediation swingly insisted that the true object of Christian belief and Behavior is to have this trans and this transcendent god as the ultimate focus of faith and worship Now this is gonna get very interesting because swingly's own brand of Utopian city development which Calvin will get some of so some of this comes to me via Calvinism and we'll get to the puritans Who established New Haven Connecticut if you look at my channel very interesting Conversation with someone from New Haven The the city on the hill all of this stuff comes through swingly and and when you think about this Humanity this is where it gets interesting with Peugeot's book Humanity is the mediation in this view of It has to come through us and get put out into the world It isn't mediated through a sacrament. It's mediated through mind and so With this now as I continue to read Peugeot's book things are gonna get very interesting because in some ways in Luther's world who is much more Catholic much more of a medievalist humanity is sort of ensconced in the world and so Luther sees devils and you know, Swingly Quite a bit more deceptive is he more gnostic and and this and this gnostic element that we see coming about in In dispensationalism in various evangelical strains Here perhaps we see some of its roots here in Swingly Distrust of mediation swingly insisted that the true object of Christian belief and behavior is to have this Transcendent God as the ultimate focus of faith and worship right worship That is worship as commanded by God now some of you in the Presbyterian Church that's gonna set your bells off because Ten fifteen twenty years ago big fights in the Presbyterian and to a degree in the CRC The parts of the CRC that have been more and more influenced by some of these this puritan influence Where there's the well, this is where it comes through the Westminster Confession This is we're we are not allowed to worship God into the belt. It's in the Heideberg Catechism, too We are not to worship God in Anything that isn't specifically Prescribed in Scripture it's difficult because Well Calvin's Geneva, for example, they sang Psalms and the Christian Reformed Church Early on in its history in North America was only a psalm singing church Part of what got dismantled in the Swiss Reformation in many places were pipe organs Pipe organs are not prescribed in the Bible, obviously But you see the patterns there Sharp distinctions Sharp distinctions were the marrow of swingly's religion as Wingly sought anyone who failed to worship God alone was an error They are not believers who go to anyone else for help other than to the one true God for thus are the believers differentiated from the believers That Different from the unbelievers in that the believers are those who are trusting go to God alone But the unbelievers go to the created. Okay, so right there you see sort of the heart of Iconoclasm and the heart of their theology of the sacraments So wingly was adamant that true religion could not admit any mediation through matter They then who trust in any created thing whatsoever are not truly pious. What is uncreated? Well uncreated is my my experience of the divine Now we're gonna see this in contemporary non-christian spiritualities in the United States what is unmediated is my Epistemological standpoint of What of anything my secret sacred self? No one can tell me what I truly am because You know we begin to see Romanticism we begin to see elements of let's say New England transcendentalism all of this stuff is Not now swingly of course would have denied these things because it's us reading the Bible That's how we were connected to God and you can see that in deeply evangelical Evangelical places Swingly was adamant that true religion could not admit any mediation through matter Going even further swingly turned his principle into something resembling a mathematical equation Then they give the Latin which loosely translates as whatever binds the senses diminishes the spirit Boy, that's interesting So in Lee's activism Activism Which makes him so different from Luther derives precisely from this notion of faithfulness Serving God correctly is the goal of the Christian life both personally and communally whereas Luther's Principle dialectic is that between law and gospel? Swingly's is that between faithfulness and faithlessness or true religion and false religion or obedience and disobedience all three dialectical pairs are one and the same for swingly unlike Luther who could only conceive of a paradoxical synthesis between law and gospel and that of an ethic in which the constant breaking of the divine law is Inevitable summed up in this simile Eustace at Peketor formula Swingly believes that the law is a gospel for the man who honors God and right now that we're gonna see Calvin in some ways between swingly and Luther because Calvin's gonna bring these things together And I've gotten to the point of the book where we deal with Calvin, but I'm really anticipating that The commands therefore were the constant will of God working through the world Unlike Luther for whom works righteousness was an offensively wrong concept swingly devoutly believed in the regenerative power of faith and In the measure of reward for effort Faithfulness in fact is the same effort for swingly for whom life was a constant battle that could be one Not just in the hereafter but also in the here and now Such interesting contrasts The life of a Christian He said was a battle so sharp and full of danger that effort can nowhere be relaxed without loss It is also a lasting victory for he who fights it wins if only he remains loyal to Christ His head a lot of this will come through with Calvinism and and this is where You know people who the only thing they know of Calvinism is divine election Don't know anything about Calvinism because if that was all that Calvinism is Why would Calvinists throughout time be so? Activistic same with swingly. Okay all this through the Swiss Reformation Remaining loyal of course entails both right worship and right behavior If swingly retains any sense of paradox in his theology It is his conception of divine providence Convinced as he was that human effort played a role in redemption Swingly also believed that God ultimately controlled everything Including who would be the faithful? Although he never dwelt on predestination or elaborated it elaborated on the concept systematically Swingly spoke of election and sometimes even used the term Swingly spoke of election and sometimes even used the term Predestination as one he said predestination is born of of providence nay is providence Far from a fatalist swingly believed in predestination that turns the elect into energetic agents of the divine will but now again There's no mediation of God through matter only through the mind and through human beings Out into the material world and the flow of that is critically important in terms of the difference Doing a John Verveke thing here this way or this way That's probably not at all what John does, but it just can't talk with my hands without thinking about John In fact it was precisely because the divine act of choosing Was a mystery that one was commanded to be active for predestination was not Was not about one's merit But about God's displaying his power and mercy through whom human agency and you're sort of setting up the Weber thesis They are that why were Calvinists such activists because by their actions they were demonstrating their election Godly cities Turning all citizens into good Christians now notice here You're gonna have a often when we talk about one speed versus two speed what Charles Taylor picked up in a secular age I think is exactly this and and you can see it in Jonathan Peugeot's Conversations about the margin you have to maintain the margin you still have Fat Tuesday before Ash Wednesday and and Charles Taylor Picks up a lot of this stuff in a secular age about well the The way the world lays out you still have places for monsters But swingly and all of this stuff that gets picked up this and and you'll see this carrying through and Even woke that well, okay, so now we have colleges where? Gay students can date each other, but we cannot abide by Places where you know Christian colleges, let's say that hold out and don't want to permit that we you know We talk about diversity, but that's not a diversity we can tolerate And so this is where Peugeot sort of sets up his his his ideas about the margins and the center But here was swingly you have this much more utopian pervasive attempt to Instantiate the will of God in the city Turning all citizens into good Christians was the principal aim of the Swiss reformers and another key difference between them and the Lutherans up north Whereas Luther depended deepened his paradoxical Simile Eustace at Pecator approach to good works and to his equally paradoxical two kingdoms political theology After after 1525 and that two kingdoms theology with respect to politics continues to be a conversation piece in Conservative reformed and a variety of conservative Protestant circles today Zwingly and his associates in Switzerland and southern Germany became wholly committed to building communities in which good works And obedience to the Ten Commandments were expected Any Christian reformed church you would visit before the 1970s you would be used to hearing the recitation of the Ten Commandments When I visited Old first reformed in Brooklyn Very interesting very interesting church I'm just gonna think about how much I want to say about it Right there in the middle of the church Think about how much I want to say about it right there up on the wall the Ten Commandments Zwingly and his associates in Switzerland and southern Germany came wholly committed to building communities in which good works and obedience to the Ten Commandments were expected and in which church and state worked hand in hand to ensure faithfulness pure worship and good behavior now notice in The successor ideology or the successor religion How much these? Swiss reformed ideas are playing through now, but the bible is now sort of set aside, but this impulse remains the same Which sort of leads you to say well, maybe it's an impulse far beyond just these persistent particular circumstances. Maybe there's a temperamental biological Psychological dynamic at play at least as well here, you know, not just a theological one Consequently, although the Swiss and the Lutheran shared the same Soteriology believing in salvation by faith alone the Swiss took a less paradoxical approach to the pervasiveness of sin in the individual and society While Lutheran stressed the inevitability of sin in the individual and the community you can get that through Peugeot, too and The dissonance between faith and behavior The Swiss emphasized the transforming power of faith, especially of faith under the aegis of the state in other words Whereas Luther stressed the forgiveness of sins and the enduring corruption of the world the Swiss Insisted on the avoidance of sin and the perfect ability of community Whereas Luther taught that everyone was a constant sinner that a Christian prince was a rare bird and that the kingdom of Christ Was simply a promise for some post apocalyptic future The Swiss insisted that sin could be controlled and that the state itself had a duty to suppress it and to build a kingdom of Christ on Earth here and now To put it in practical terms a Swiss reformed community had no place at all for anyone who sinned boldly as Luther advised his followers to do it also had no place for rulers who were not good Christians in Some sin could be tolerated no more than idolatry because both were avoidable Immensely displeasing to God and dangerous for the collective welfare of the community these threads go into interesting places Another innovation that could be called an institution Even though it had no name was the centralization of all the city's charities under the supervision of the civil authorities Now this gets very interesting because again in a lot of conservative Christian communities, there's a lot of complaint about the government Social Security welfare What's that this gonna come from well, I'm not gonna read about the radical Reformation, but that becomes another focus so Mennonites for example might but you see the radical Reformation. There's a whole spectrum in those ranks, too, but Zwing Lee very much believed well, well, I'll keep reading Care for the poor and needy had always been a high priority for Zwing Lee and an essential component of his iconoclastic theology like Carlstad who linked the destruction of images with the abolition of begging isn't that interesting Zwing Lee argued that a Christian community had a duty to manage its collective wealth carefully and effectively now later on with Mennonites and Hutter rights, you'd have much more of a Common goods practice that you know talk to Julian about that Like Carlstad who linked the destruction of images with the abolition of begging is wingly argued that a Christian community had a duty to manage Its collective wealth carefully and effectively high taxation rates to alleviate or eliminate poverty and sloth Christian Charities wingly argued was too important and too complex a task to leave in the hands of individuals or guilds or confraternities Consequently as the monasteries and convents were confiscated by city officials The endowments for masses and chapels seized and the church plates melted down The revenue was funneled into the town treasury and much of it earmarked for charitable purposes This is really interesting because later again in the radical Reformation with the Hutter rights and other other more radical communities which could also go utopian They They looked at They also managed it collectively, but they were much more antithetical to governing authority They were anti-magisterial. Let's say Laws were passed against begging that distinguished between the deserving poor That is those who had genuine need and the undeserving poor those who were too lazy to work Begging was outlawed and a badge created a badge system created whereby only those who had been designated as deserving of charity could receive receive alms in other words you had the government basically saying You're allowed to panhandle on the street. You're not can I see your panhandling license? Fascinating The system of identifying and funding the deserving poor was handled at the parish level But its uniformity was ostensibly guaranteed by the city's laws And so Zurich was turned into a Christian city where faithfulness Godly behavior and efficient charity were to be the norm rather than the exception The idea of establishing such a sacred community wholly dedicated to Christian principles was not new in Theory at least this had been the goal of all medieval communities But now however that theory had been put into practice in such a way that the civil authorities were granted Much more of the power that the clergy formally reserved for themselves a big piece of this too is taking away political power from the clergy There's something Sam Harris could get behind In the medieval world in many ways clergy were above the law in The Zwingli and reformed clergy were below the law and in fact in many ways clergy were supervised By the civil magistrates now in that I look at Christian reformed practices, and it's interesting There's some as a tinge of anabaptist re in it. There's there's there's some Lutheranism in it. There's some there's obviously a lot of Calvinism, but and there's some Zwingli too. It's interesting how this works And a lot of these ideas will get played out in different ways than in the radical Reformation and in the various different things and he goes into all of that in the book really enjoying the book Where was I Now however that the theory had been put into practice in such a way that the civil authorities were granted much of the power That the clergy formally reserved for themselves this Puritanical reforming impulse would become the ethos of the Swiss Reformation Evident in all the cities and cantons that abolished images and the mass it would also reach beyond the Swiss Confederation to cities such as Strausburg own and Geneva and take root in France the Netherlands Scotland England and in North American colonies This distinctive collusion of church and state and this sense of building a purified faithful Christian Republic which were in it which were Inseparable from a theology of election would become the most recognizable features of the reformed Protestant tradition When John Winthrop admonished the New England-bound Mayflower Puritans, we must consider that we shall be a city upon a hill Quote Ronald Reagan used The eyes of all people are upon us Zwingli Zurich was his paradigm whether or not they knew it and Here he takes a chart from George Hunston Williams About how the radical Reformation can be split up you have the Anabaptists, which are sort of the mainstream Evangelical New Testament model you had pacifists Swiss Brethren, Hutterites, Mennonites contemplative mystical individualistic influenced by mystics hans-denk revolutionaries violent apocalyptic Munster what's interesting is that you see the menu of impulses just played out on the contemporary Political American stage as well. Does it come from it? Are these psychological? Very are these are these are these part and parcel of political engagement you have the spiritualists mainstream evangelical spiritual perfection manifest later in pietism contemplative mystical individualistic influenced by medieval mystics and the revolutionaries violent apocalyptic You know Thomas Munster Munster is one of the great most popular examples Then you had the evangelical rationalists and anti-trinitarians Erasmians libertines and Nicodemonites I look forward to reading about these people haven't gotten through that chapter skeptics and rationalists and anti-trinitarians fascinating stuff Andreas Boden van Karlstad Thomas Munster and the and the Zwickau prophets and the revolution of the common man proved beyond a shadow of the doubt that Martin Luther's leadership was questionable More than 40 years ago the German historians Franz Lau tried to put this insight into perspective by speaking of the wild growth of refer of reformation ideas that took place in the early 1520s as Lau said focusing too much on Luther could be a mistake for if one looked beyond Wittenberg and Even if one looked at Wittenberg itself it was easy to see that there were more ideas at play than those of Luther and that reform was not necessarily driven by theological concerns or even by historical dynamics imagined by Luther's followers Lau's contention was perceptive but hardly novel even in Luther's own day There were those who saw him as only one of many characters on a crowded stage to some Catholics for instance Luther was among was one among a horde of heretics merely a single branch of an old tree that suddenly sprouted exuberant new growth in 1517 an evil tree with roots as deep and ancient as those of the church itself and Branches as numerous as all the devils in hell For those who did not follow Luther's lead But also sought to break with the past the image of wild growth was definitely perceptible But with a different twist for them Luther's role in the wild growth was ambiguous or negative Luther perceived the wild growth too But he saw it but he saw all others who challenged him in any way as branches that need to be cut off Luther's personality The images of furiously branching trees or invasive brambles that are evoked by the concept of the wild growth of the early Reformation are apt for it was indeed an abrupt burst of religious energy that expanded very rapidly And in many directions and in diverse places all at once and not to everyone's delight and again when you hear this Might there have been a technological Advance at that same time that allowed ideas which probably were sort of Living down below the surface now suddenly with a few people who can write and some printing presses whoosh these ideas are Manifest and popularized and people can gather around them and so people within Europe will start going to places and let's go find Erasmus, let's go find Luther. Let's go find Zwingli. Let's go to Calvin's Geneva The internet is that on steroids Much like fractals those complex repeating patterns in nature such as trees leaves river systems and blood vessels That mathematicians can turn into equations the history of the Protestant Reformation can be systematically Comprehended only through multiple narratives that parallel each other in time and even mirror each other But sometimes interlace and branch out and when it comes to the earliest branching none was more significant than what took place in the Swiss Reformation And then I read Peugeot In the context of creation and the Garden of Eden the word Adam simultaneously refers to an individual and Humanity at large that's true. Posse and Paul does the same thing Such interpretations are possible because Adam is the principle of the entire human race Which is multiplied by male female dichotomy as a result humanity or Adam can increase the size of his body To populate the entire world and in many ways we see that these ideas have people Do the people have ideas? So I don't think I'm going to dive into I Think don't think I'm going to dive into the language of creation right now But it was interesting because I was reading ahead a few chapters thinking about this when I was also reading about the Swiss Reformation and thinking the this distinction in terms of material mediation versus Much more of a divided universe where there's immaterial mediation It's going to be interesting to think about that as we take a look at well sons of the radical reformation who returned back to orthodoxy, so Let me know what you think
