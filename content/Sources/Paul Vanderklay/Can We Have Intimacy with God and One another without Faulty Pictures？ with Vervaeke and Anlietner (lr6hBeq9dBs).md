 There we go. Well I'll just jump right in here. John and Paul I, you know, I don't know if this is fair for me to say and you can be like now we're not on those terms but I consider both of these men to be friends at least internet friends of mine that I've become good good good and I would enjoy meeting you both in real life at some point as well but both of these men have those who've they listen to the program I'm starting to do a little bit more on YouTube as well and exploring that medium but those who've been listening for the last three years Paul has been a voice that was on my channel very and podcast on was on very early probably in year one he's been on for multiple conversations many of you are also familiar with John Brevaki and his work John's been on for a couple conversations and then most of you have been following for a while I've also followed taking up quite an interest in John's work and trying to explore points of intersection between what I see is like historic Christian theology and John's work points of intersection points of harmony points of dissonance as well so some of you that have gone through that Jesus and John Brevaki series are probably very familiar with John's work as well so but both of you together have been having tremendous dialogues I mean I feel like the quality of them has they've always been good but these last few that you guys have entered into have been really really special I see an increasing sense of trust there's that agape love that's happening I think and you know as John maybe you remember as I was sharing in one of the talks I gave on your work and the points of connection between NT Wright it's epistemology of love and agape I really sense like this epistemology of love that's happening in the dialogue between you two is that is that something that you both have noticed as well over the last couple of conversations you've had I feel is yeah something's in the air that's increasingly my feeling and I mean I for quite some time now I've had a tremendous amount of affection for Paul I mean there's there's no other way of putting it so I that's been a concept for me for quite quite a while now I also want to acknowledge that I think something is happening for me it's the logos is becoming more and more part of the deal logos a more more more proper part a more more recognized part the sensed part a sensed presence and I definitely I definitely feel that there's I'm getting increasingly enthusiastic I almost want to use the ancient meaning of that word when I'm in these conversations that I'm having and it also feels almost like a synchronicity although I don't I'm very critical of that part of young but nevertheless the people that have been coming to me if that's the right way to put it that makes it egocentric but I'm encountering like like like Rick Rapetti and like there's just just right it's just like I've been taken aback by it and also the conversations I see Paul having with other people Jonathan having with other people yeah I feel like it's at a different we're at a different octave than we were before and and about love the epistemology and the ontology of love is I'm going very deep in it I read a Morello's book on the movement that's going on amongst a bunch of scholars to make the argument that Aquinas should be properly understood as a neo-platinist who makes use of Aristotle the way Plotinus did and that the closest analog of Aquinas is Plotinus not Aristotle and they're making a very good case for this Morello Clark really a powerful case and then that is intersecting with the my ongoing reading reading of DC Schindler I recommended his book is the best book I've ever read on Plato and this book and this goes towards your point Love and the Postmodern Predicament by DC Schindler Paul I think you well sorry Paul VanderKlay I think you well both of you both of you I think you would love this book the relationship between love and the three transcendentals the relationship with the love and being I've been scribbling notes in this about and I'd like to talk about that at some point if it's okay yes about a deepening of the understanding of participatory knowing and its relationship to to a love but this this book is I've been lucky I'm reading these really thin books that are profound all of that is by way of saying that all of this is like this right now for me and yeah the epistemology and the ontology and where they come together in participation of love is central to my thinking right now I'm reading sorry that was not a laugh of contempt that was a laugh of like what I'm reading more theology now than anything right with anything else right now because the work of Clark and DC well it's it's on this border between philosophy and theology and so it's I'm finding it where the deepest thinking I can see right now that's the response to the meeting crisis is taking place and that seems to be not not anything I foresaw or anything I imposed it just seems to be emerging out of where you know I'm like Socrates I'm following the logos where it goes and this is where it seems to be leading me so that's sort of a long-winded answer to your question but that's how it is beautiful I'm sure nobody that's listening to this or have listened to any dialogues between you guys in the past have any problems with long-winded so we don't need to worry about that all what sorts of effects that maybe the recent dialogues you've been having with John and and others there was a great one I also listened to there seems to be some sort of you have a discord sort of community to around your work right John and there was a couple gentlemen facilitating a great conversation between you two maybe a month ago yes well Paul what what sorts of effects have you are you experiencing over this long multi-year discourse with John well I I agree with uh with everything that you know with with what John said in terms of affection and love I mean John has given us but part of what's amazing to me is that when so Strawn who is in South Africa he first started listening to John says oh you have to listen to him and Strawn's pretty persistent I mean he sends me a lot of emails as John well knows and and and so I the I listened to John and when I first started bringing John into my videos um you know there was a lot of pushback from Christians especially um you know we don't you know we want it we don't want anything that has a Buddhist tag on it is you know going to get reactive Christian communities have been and and this Christian communities have been quite reactive probably for the last thousand years or longer um it's it's deep in Christianity's DNA in some ways partly because of you know how it began you can see that in the New Testament period um you know it's dealing with the larger Hellenistic culture it's a sort of a breakout sect of Judaism initially and you know there's a lot of there's always fears of assimilation that's right there's fears of assimilation there's fears of persecution there's and then even after Christianity becomes ascendant in the west um all these all these intramural fights there's there tends to be a lot of defensiveness in Christianity and when there isn't defensiveness there's fear of syncretism assimilation etc etc and so that um that has led in many ways to churches sort of always doubling down on their tribalism appealing to the base you don't you don't lose your job appealing to your own narrow tradition and sticking to it so um part of what I've I've seen happening both in my relationship with John and in the communities that have developed I mean the awakening from the meaning crisis discord server that began and and in both our cases John and I didn't start these discord servers um the the bridges of meaning discord server was begun by some of the members of my local meetup who were enjoying the meetup so much they and I would talk about it on my channel and people would express disappointment that there was nothing available to them locally so we started this sort of as a way that even we knew even though we knew it wouldn't be local it's something they could participate in and also for the purpose of pursuing what has now become estuary of planting local groups where people could not just meet online but be able to have local conversations but what's been amazing has been the um the embrace of Christians for John's work and seeing John as a good faith partner it's it's one thing for me to see him as such partly just because of how I'm wired temperamentally I am very open and I am very trusting and very quickly I got a sense that John was very much a trustworthy partner and and someone that we could have some real relationship and interchange with and some honesty with and give and take on both sides but also the um embrace of John's work by many of the Christians in my circles that initially you know you know sent me emails you know you should not be talking to John Vervecky and yada yada yada this is dangerous he's going to lead you astray etc etc but many many people have now you know the awakening from the meaning crisis as a 50 video series is is not a is a challenging undertaking for many people yes but um I think many many people have now seen him as a good faith conversation partner that seriously is looking for the truth he will be honest about his beliefs he will be clear he will be gentle and he'll be generous and so I agree with John that what we're seeing in this space it's bigger than just John and I or the three of us or throwing Peugeot um I'm seeing a lot of really productive conversations between especially between Christians and those who either don't go to church or are not theists in one form or another but also who are entering into this space with a posture of not defensiveness but appreciative inquiry and I know all these things are buzzwords in Christian communities so I really have to be careful because I'm not trying to trigger people but people both have a sense of it's not necessarily a threat to my Christian profession I can be secure in myself and engage in this conversation and come away quite likely with a sense that um God is using this to to to deepen my faith and even in many respects strengthen my convictions I don't see myself in these last four years as necessarily believing less or being less reformed or less a faithful minister in the Christian Reformed Church I think actually I'm I've developed capacity for being a better evangelist so that's that's what I've seen happening. Yeah I think the big difference is when you are so accustomed to I think I think about the sorts of debates public debates that happened especially around the time of like the the origins of the new atheist movement and you would see let's take a Sam Harris versus a William Lane Craig is one example. What characterized those sorts of conversations to me was primarily a Phyla and Ikea versus a Phyla Sophia yes and they were beneficial in some sense to me I think back to my college days I suppose in a sense like then this isn't to be disparaging of Dr. Craig's work which I do see as beneficial in any regard but that's sort of classic Christian apologetic stuff is really preaching to the choir it's addressing insecurities that Christians primarily face but it's not the same thing that I see happening between the two of you thankfully and even in the conversation that happened between John yourself Jordan Peterson Bishop Barron Jonathan Peugeot if anything John one of my one of my feedbacks coming out and listening to that conversation was like I really wish John would have given more pushback to to Bishop Barron and Jonathan Peugeot in particular to go hey you know like there's a reason why we entered into the secular age there's a reason why they like and you certainly voiced those things as well but when people get that sense that someone is not in it to win it when they've actually like unplugged from this culture war matrix that we all find ourselves within that that sort of mutually accelerating disclosure that you talk about John is really possible and it starts with building trust and I see that happening between you two one of the things I wanted to do in today's conversation is kind of be like you know the fly on the wall as I've listened to some of the dialogues and there are things that I wanted to pull out and go all right let's I want to pick at these a little bit and I do like I invite both of you this is difficult John when you're in these sorts of conversations and you're sort of outnumbered but I do really want to encourage you to like give both Paul and I the pushback I like see it go ahead yeah no I will but but but you know the the overriding characteristic I get from the the kind of Harris Lane Lane kind of debates and those is the futility of them yes and so as somebody who is trying to address and alleviate the meeting crisis exercises of futility are something that are almost anathema to me human beings are suffering you know with with they're on the precipice of despair and feeling their lives are futile is one of the dimensions of meaninglessness and then having these so-called intellectual elites exemplify this where the only thing that comes out of it is just an enhancement of tribalism that's something I want to I want to resist so I do want to do what you're asking you know I do feel John and the two Pauls it feels very Christian even in the naming right all right I do I do but I've always tried to be very honest with both of you and I will do that but I hope you understand that I always want to temper the relationship of the dialogos is more important to me than any particular proposition so any pushback will always be tempered with you know a willingness on my part and I try to exemplify it of giving ground of moving right if I know so every pushback if I can use the metaphor will be counterbalanced with a moving towards you that's what I I mean I'm not I'm not claiming to be perfect in this or anything but that is that was what I aspire to do I aspire to keep those it's almost like the catapatic catapatic and apophatic movements right I want to I want them to keep keep with each other always at all times um I don't speak on behalf of Paul but I will I think we both feel the same that we want to make those sorts of movements and so that um you know that really does seem like good faith conversation is continuing to happen it's desperately and I key on that word by the way it's desperately needed right now it's right now like I have said and I'll say it again if people from my work find a way to return to any of the world religions and find a home there yes I good I'm all I'm saying is that it's clear evidence that there's a demographic that that is not currently working for and I'm trying to address them as best I can while remaining in good faith dialogue from the wisdom traditions that I think we all need to continuously learn from that's and that is the position I will keep sticking to because that is where I feel I belong and where I feel where I'm being authentic and genuine yeah so where I'd love to set the table today guys is to maybe compare some of those dialogues of what I would say are typical of the secular age um in the west um the dialogues I say between a hypothetical it's not just limited to these two a Sam Harris and a William Lane Craig and so much of these dialogues debates really arguments um especially around the time of that sort of rise of new atheism seemed to be about really no one ever gave proper categorization and definition to what they meant when they invoked the word God and I think that was one of the benefits to Peterson's public debates with with Sam Harris was we need to really assess and not just assume you know John I think you mentioned in the past you know we need we need to take a little Wittgenstein Wittgensteinian approach here and go let's let's reassess what the language that we're using even means and so in a lot of ways I look back on those sorts of arguments and debates and they happen all over with internet apologists and internet angry atheists and I see people talking past each other and what they're typically talking about is setting that term God still within a very modern frame so what it seems like the argument has been about is about whether or not a supreme supernatural being exists in an arena of other beings so the thing that might come to people's minds when they talk about does God exist and when they invoke that three-letter word God is they picture either you know the the white-haired bearded man on top of the Sistine Chapel painted by Michelangelo reaching out his finger to Adam right that might be one image that comes to mind or I think one in more recent popular culture has been the the character in the DC comics mythos the doctor Manhattan from Watchmen if you're familiar with those graphic novels it's also become an HBO series it was a movie and so what you see are people conceiving of when they think of God as a Paul you've called it like a super thing right we extrapolate all these human characteristics and qualities and we think of a supreme being but we're still thinking of the supreme being is just being a top a sort of hierarchy of beings you know and it doesn't get to what the word God has meant even in the classic Christian tradition of the past so what I'd like to do to get the dialogue going is to bring up maybe a proposal for how we could better use that three-letter word God and see if you guys are in agreement and to do so I want to share my screen because I got a couple of quotes and I always find that when you quote something especially for those on video there's disengagement if there's not a video a visible piece as well so I'm going to share my screen and just make sure you everybody can see this as well so all right you guys seeing that picture doctor Manhattan right there okay great so I think the the sorts of arguments about God in the secular age have been largely marked by this sort of conceiving of God as Dr Manhattan and what we need to do is we need to shift the dialogue into a better understanding of what that term God means and I think we can talk about God in two senses there's God as a metaphysical term which would mean that which is ultimately necessary you know till its ground of being we have these philosophical categories of necessary and contingent so in order for there to be anything at all what is it that being itself wells up from what is the source and font of it so when we talk about God we're thinking of it in those terms but there's also thinking of God in an existential sense and I think this is the way Peterson often invokes God as one example is to think about what functions as sitting atop the hierarchy of our values as our ultimate concern that's a tillic word as well and we see that embodied in the sum total of our daily life and activity so I'm going to bring out a couple quotes here from David Bentley Hart who is going to kind of expound on God as ultimately what his ultimate ultimately necessary ultimate reality the ground of being and then we'll talk about God as an existential term and I'd like to get your guys feedback on these so again this is from Hart and I brought hit brought up this specific quote on multiple occasions talking about your work John but this is from the experience of God being consciousness bliss good book yeah it's a very important one everyone should have in their library I think God is not only the ultimate reality that the intellect and the will seek but is also the primordial reality with which all of us are always engaged in every moment of existence and consciousness apart from which we have no experience of anything whatsoever or to borrow the language of Augustine God is not only beyond my utmost heights but also more inward to me than my inmost depths to speak of God properly then is to speak of the one infinite source of all that is eternal omniscient omnipotent omnipresent uncreated uncaused perfectly transcendent of all things and for that very reason absolutely imminent to all things God so understood is not something posed over against the universe in addition to nor is he the universe itself he is not being at least not in the way that a tree a shoemaker or a god is a being he is not one more object in the inventory of things that are or any sort of discrete object at all rather all things that exist receive their being continuously from him who is the infinite wellspring of all that is in whom to use the language of Christian scriptures all things live and move and have their being in one sense he is beyond being if by being one means the totality of discrete finite things I think this is what is a key difference between the maybe modernist debates on this and what I think is going to characterize a new post-secular age so I interrupted the quote there continuing on in another sense he is being itself in that he is the inexhaustible source of all reality the absolute which the contingent is always utterly dependent the unity and simplicity that underlies and sustains that diversity of finite and composite things infinite being infinite consciousness infinite bliss from whom we are by whom we know and are and in whom we find our only true consummation so that again for me would be if we're going to talk about God in the metaphysical sense I think David Bentley Hart gives one of the best definitions in the Christian tradition of that let's talk about Tillich now this is from Tillich's Tillich gave a really important sermon in New York I can't remember the year this was but this is a if you're going to read any Tillich I would as an introductory I'd say find online the depth of existence it's a sermon Tillich gave post-war post-world war II but here's the to invoke a sort of more the existential sense of the what the term God can mean the depth of thought is always a part of the depth of life most of our life continues on the surface we are enslaved by the routines of our daily lives in work and pleasure in business and recreation we are conquered by an innumerable hazards both good and evil we are more driven than driving we do not step to look at the heights above or the depths below us we are always moving forward although usually in a circle which finally brings us back to the place from which we first moved we are in constant motion and never stop to plunge into the depth we talk and talk and never listen to the voices speaking to our depth and from our depth we accept ourselves as we appear to ourselves and do not care what we really are like hit and run drivers we injure our souls by the speed which which we move on the surface and then we rush away leaving our bleeding souls alone we miss therefore our depth and our true life and is only when the picture that we have of ourselves breaks down completely which to me is I think part of the meaning crisis only when we find ourselves acting against all the expectation we had derived from that picture and only when an earthquake shakes and disrupts the surface of our self-knowledge that we are willing to look into a deeper level of our being today a new form of this method has become famous the so-called psychology of depth it leads us from the surface of our self-knowledge into levels where there are recorded which we know nothing about on the surface of our consciousness it shows us traits of character which contradict everything that we believe we know about ourselves it can help us to find the way into our depth although it cannot help us in an ultimate way because it cannot guide us to the deepest ground of our being and all being the depth of life itself the name of this infinite and inexhaustible depth and ground of all being is God that depth is what the word God means and if that word has not much meaning for you translate it and speak of the depths of your life the source of your being of your ultimate concern of what you take seriously without any reservation perhaps in order to do so you must forget everything traditional that you have learned about God perhaps even that word itself for if you know that God means depth you know much about him you cannot call you cannot then call yourself an atheist or unbeliever for you cannot think or say life has no depth life itself is shallow being itself is surface only if you could say this in complete seriousness you would be an atheist but otherwise you are not he who knows about depth knows about God so the questions I want to bring to you guys here is does this in the post-secular age that I think we're moving to the dialogue is shifting and we're re-understanding God perhaps in a more ancient light one that again isn't exclusive to the Christian tradition there have been people in the Islamic and Jewish and certainly in the Hindu which of course is like a name given by colonials to the religion of India the question then for me then is not does God exist but what is God like and I feel like that's what's been shifting in your dialogue together so in other words what should be of ultimate concern and then finally the question for me is does the metaphysical God that which is ontologically metaphysically necessary and the existential God match in our lives to me this is like what's at the heart of Kierkegaard's message and the Kierkegaardian challenge is to be an authentic self we need to have a synthesis of the infinite and the finite to actually be grounding ourselves in that to have the existence of our daily lives actually be grounded in that which is metaphysically ultimately necessary so that was a lot there I wanted to get some initial reactions starting with you John because I know this may be a point where certainly I share more in common with the way I interpret reality in some regards with Paul than with you so I want to start with you to see what your initial thoughts are points of resonance and maybe potential points of dissonance with both of those definitions. First of all I would like to say that I agree with you I see both Jonathan and Paul at Paul VanderKlay that's good Paul V and Paul A that's how we'll do it as more radical than perhaps they might be initially received. Jonathan is stabbing at something very deep and I mean that in both senses of the word the profound critique of nominalism and its pervasiveness in our thought I think needs to be made more central in what Jonathan's doing and Paul I know Paul you see yourself with it squarely within their tradition and I'm not going to challenge that in any way but I want to say you are doing something of significance with the God one the God two you're trying to get and it's more than ever reconceptualization right you're trying to reopen up relationship that's what I see you trying to do so I agree in that sense with Paul that I think there's something significant going on I think what's happening right now is a deep reflection on God I would put it to you this way first of all initially but before we I move towards the quotes first of all I don't think we just have the supreme being God Wittgenstein we should play to pay attention to the form of life and if there was some recent research I think around 2005 you know and those were the teenagers of the time so they're the adults of now and they called it their their the most Americans was moralistic therapeutic deism yes that the main function of God was to inspire us to the good and God is a purely private affair and we like this and we love it and I think this is a disastrous place to get to and so does D.C. Schindler I think it's the rain shadow of this the religious civil wars of the 17th century and the birth of the secular state has look look when we when we bring this into the public we kill each other so what we'll do is we'll keep it private and it's subjective and it's feeling and it's other than reason which means it eventually becomes less than reason by the way a Christian D.C. Schindler makes that argument not me he says when we when we do that that's the inevitable consequence he calls it mythology the hatred of the logos right and so I think that's the context and so it's not just the supreme being it's the supreme moralistic therapeutic deity kind of the of deism and so I I think that is a disastrous position because I think what I hear us talking about is an intersection of terms these three God being and reality that's what I and then the attendant transcendentals truth goodness and being these are doing this to my mind right now and and and and and what and those were what you are not allowed to talk about with moralistic therapeutic deism right and so for me this is why there's a cusp there's a kairos here we everybody both within and without religion I think into the degree to which they are they are being kooker guardian remember that kooker guards big thing is when people avoid the revelation of authenticity by avoiding onks they avoid it so I'm not talking about people who are avoidant right now with distraction and stimulation not that level of despair there's different yeah yeah despair I'm not talking about that I'm so right that's and that's another thing but for the people who are trying to respond rather than just react to the meaning crisis I think God being and realness and reality are all circling are all bring brought up and and the transcendentals truth goodness and beauty we want to talk about these again in a deep way and I think and from the outside this is how it appears to me and I so I don't mean this as a critique it's just an observation Christians want to talk about it but they're struggling to talk about it because they feel ensnared by this framework right which was put by the way in place for good reason with the birth of the secular state the the religious civil wars of the 17th century were horrific they horrified and terrified people right in a deep fashion and I get that right and then and and then we re-traumatized ourselves with world war two where we said okay we'll do a political ideological version of this and then oh no look at how bad this so let's just keep this right right but of course that's that's useless that vacuum is filled so we have the simultaneity of people disenfranchising from politics whereas everything is becoming deeply political and the political is just pseudo-religious so that's the framework I see this discussion is taking place with it I don't know if that if that resonates with either one of you or both of you but that's the context in which I want to talk about this I want to talk about I like I think unless we can really learn and that doesn't mean just nostalgia but really learn how to fall in love with being we can't respond to the meaning crisis so being realness one of the things one of the way I'm trying I am starting to hear how people use this word in this recent dialogue is God is something like the intimacy of the transcendent and in the depths of my indice and then the depths of my intimacy finding something transcendent like God is right there the God is like you know Schindler talks about you know God is being you know you can read Aquinas to say God is the ocean of being but being points to the intelligibility of this if I can use these two words slightly differently whereas God points to the intimacy that's also transcendent and the transcendent that's also intimate right and then we're trying and that's what I'm seeing if you'll allow me as right the being is the ontological or metaphysical I would prefer ontological and God is the intimacy trend the intimate transcendent and the transcendently imminent but there's the craving like I've been saying this for quite a while I think I mentioned in the Four Horsemen like the meaning crisis is in many ways an intimacy crisis it's a desire for connection but it's not it's not the connection that you have to something that is subsumable and consumable to you it's eros it's the desire to be intimate with something that is other like Murdoch said it beautifully love is the recognition that something other than yourself is real right and this is what I've been trying to get out with the participatory knowing it's not fusion it's not homogeneity it's contact with separation it's intimacy and I think that's what what people are longing for and so I think the Tillich quote see I'm getting to what you put up I think the Tillich quote Tillich was trying to get the ontological and that together I think I mean I love Tillich you bringing out Hart who's clearly from the neoplatonic tradition like thoroughly that's like platinus would almost agree to everything you wrote there right and then Tillich is the other great Tillich is Tillich is more of an influence on me than Heidegger it's profound influence on me and I see Tillich trying to express with ultimate concern that our relationship to realness is not an abstract one I'm going to mention this again and then I'll let Paul talk I was just thunderstruck I was reading a letter from Spinoza and and I keep coming back to this because just like and he said God does not have abstract thoughts and what Spinoza was trying to get at is if we remain at the level of abstract thought we are not in conformity with God and when you read the ethics and realize all this abstract logical stuff is to get you to a place of intimacy of deep participation in God that just hit me as a profound thing right and so I think the challenge is this for me is and this is where Paul and I rub up against each other Paul V and I and I think you and I too Paul A I think there's something really important about love and intimacy here but I do wonder if Christianity can get out of the straightjacket it's in that I've already like there's deep reasons why the moralistic therapeutic deism is predominant and I would say even with it was certainly the you know certainly predominant in a lot of what I was hearing a lot of what I continue to hear and I'm wondering I'm wondering to what degree what degree we can talk about this in a way that will allow I'm really struggling here so please forgive me my friends but we can talk about this in a way that engages us at a point of Kierkegaardian authenticity without requiring everybody to come into complete agreement metaphysically because typically we've we let me use one distinction from Kierkegaardian and then I'll shut up right Durkheim says that like we can pursue mechanical solidarity which is we get intimacy and cooperation and co-being by pursuing a homogeneity right and then he compares that to the division of labor in society where actually we make people distinct but completely interdependent in their distinctness and to be fair to me you can read Saint Paul is saying that when he's talking about the body of Christ and the foot and the head and the foot not trying to be the head and all that so I'm not introducing something completely foreign to the Christian tradition but what I mean is is it possible and I don't mean this as an insult please is it possible for the body of Christ to truly include the Buddhist and the Hindu and the Muslim and the Taoist and the Neoplatonist without the attempt of some sub-substance of just subsuming it and saying but in the end it's homogeneity and that's the thing that concerns me that's where I sort of that's where I find I'm sort of hesitant to identify with any of the I don't call myself a Buddhist either by the way I think we're facing I think there's good reason why we're in this place of novelty and kairos that we've all acknowledged because I think there is something unique in what we're facing right now we're coming to this weird consolation of post-modernism and then the emergence of secular religions that are tearing your country apart as far as I can see and therefore threatening the whole world because the United States is the tsunami that can drown all shores hey you guys have hockey as your secular religion so yeah but you know but you know we've got football you've got hockey it's well I was talking more about the political arena yeah I know I know um and that was not a criticism that was a concern yeah right it's a good criticism yeah they're very concerned so I just there's something new here there's an opportunity I think there I think we are going to I know Tillich talks about the god beyond the god of theism in another famous essay I think we are at that place that he foresaw and I suppose I'll put it this way and then I'll shut up I think Christianity faces a choice a choice of doing and a choice that it's made before in the past when it met Platonism and then when it met Aristotelianism and that when it met science there's another choice point here right now and I see what's happening as a as that kind of deep choice point for Christianity I will not presume to say what I think Christians should do I think that would be arrogant um I just think that I'm concerned that some of the things that Paul talked about Paul V are going to predominate in Christianity isn't going to be able to hear the call of what's happening right now that's my deepest concern and I'm trying to state this with affection and respect great John it's excellent these are good critiques I certainly have some thoughts but I want to give Paul the opportunity to respond to him first I'm sorry for talking a long time but I didn't want to just no apologies needed I wanted to get like the like that's really good where I'm coming from I'm sorry good where I'm coming from really good I don't think anyone that pastors a local church has any question about the fact that Christianity is in some straight jackets that it can't get out of because now I so there I don't know if it's I think it still exists there used to be a satirical Christian publication called the Wittenberg door and um and and a regular common a regular column in the Wittenberg door was entitled dogs who know the Lord and it's funny and it's satirical and it's a good time and I used to love the Wittenberg door anybody who follows my videos know something of my sense of humor but but there's a deep there's a deep sense in which Christianity asserts that dogs do know the Lord but they don't know the Lord in any way that will afford them entrance to let's say a confessional church where they appeal before the council and make a profession of faith you know I I David Bentley Hart is such a beautiful writer that even though I don't know how I got comped into his sub stack but somehow I did maybe somebody who listens to me wanted to influence me or gave me a complimentary um subscription to it which I really appreciate because he's just a deeply beautiful insightful powerful writer and his influence on the people who are now around me influencing me is deeply profound I often have the sense reading David Bentley Hart that um some of the temptation of narcissists that I read his words and they're so captivating and beautiful that they I have almost have an out-of-body experience and here especially in this season of the church's attention upon the incarnation I want to make an appeal for dogs who know the Lord because and I really love what you that quote you brought in from Spinoza John because I think that's right in that I think it's deeply Christian and and this is what pushed back against many who at the time you know the the author of the gospel of Judas imagined that Judas is the hero of the story because Jesus could then be released from his body and Jesus would no longer have to suffer the indignities of of common human necessity and and especially the the painful catastrophic reality of decay I mean that word I mean it was 15 years ago and you know I was working through part of the beauty of being a local Christian pastor is that you're forced to sort of keep an eye on the knitting in that there are people in front of me who are who don't listen to my videos and they're never going to and they all so much of this language I mean if I put Paul Tillich or Carl Bart or even David Bentley Hart in front of them they're never going to read those books and they're never and and much of the language in the books and much of the language that we reliably put out will simply go over their heads you know again another piece of my you know deep appreciation for what John has done is even though you know I tease John and some people in my community say I listen to John Vervecki I have no idea what he's talking about the fancy words yes yeah the fancy vervecki words as Job said but you know John has has consistently talked about an ecology of practice and you know dogs dogs who know the Lord are 100% practice to the best of our knowledge because their knowing of the Lord is not the kind of thing that involves what we human beings are capable of but human beings live in a range of capacity yes with respect to all of this ideation and abstraction yet Christianity has long I mean the Christian God begins the story in a way that no Greek God would by getting his hands into the clay of the earth I may be wrong about the group but and making a clay image and breathing his breath into it and creating a nephesh by which it is this embodied it's this meeting of heaven and earth and so I think that the deep challenge for me as a pastor is is not only trying to help the church get out of its straight jacket which quite frankly is nothing new I don't think any close reader of the New Testament can imagine that for all of the you know for all of the excitement about what the early church did and believed I think did you ever read the book of first Corinthians that that we would be under any under any illusion that simply presenting them with the best words possible would resolve all of our problems and I think this is perhaps Luther's greatest Luther Luther's greatest misconception because I think that was at the heart of his reform that he was well if we get the best texts now that we have the printing press and the printing well if we get the best texts now that we have the printing press and we have a better reach Luther and Erasmus you know if we get the best words in front of them and and we use reason to sort of get all these words in line then you know surely if I just present these things to the Roman Catholic hierarchy they'll say oh of course it'll it'll all be great and that of course it wasn't and then Luther and Karlstad have their falling out and the Protestant Reformation just becomes this this sort of you know deconstruction of of what had become Christendom and and at the same time you know I'm I remain a Protestant I think also Protestantism was able to recapture something else and and and partly by virtue of the fact that it's quite clear to me that the the the church state combination that had been medieval Catholicism had gotten you know terrifically tyrannical in many respects and and that power had to be undone and so I part of the reason and I know I continue to fight battles on this with respect to God number one and God number two was that if I were you know I really like the arenic and the agentic and you know you can use imminent and transcendent often I'll use general and special revelation just because that's a language that people who've had a degree of catechesis can maybe appropriate but number one and number two are so on one hand flexible and but but they're not nobody's going to be afraid of number one and number two and and the goal I believe of the Christian faith is that in fact the goodness of God and and the glory the glorious potential which God has clearly built into this world which I think all of us see in our aspirations is is that which will be manifest and when I look at for example Christian eschatology you know unlike as so many of my you know as American evangelicals and fundamentalists imagine that we drift up into the clouds and live in the skies when we're you know when we're gone which is you know again anybody who knows a little bit of theology will say I'm not sure that's I'm not sure I'm not sure that's what Jesus intended with the resurrection but that you know God will be all in all and you know Christianity has always said and I think embodied in its continual transformation and that's a dynamic within Christianity which is difficult because and that's a dynamic within Christianity which is difficult because on one hand there's this strain in Christianity that always wants to keep going back to its roots and so the the orthodox are like well we via our divine liturgy we will not change okay and the Roman Catholics will via our connection with the um with the bishop Peter the bishop of Rome and the hierarchy we will not change and Protestants with their with our solo scriptural commitment to this book we will not change you know all have consistently been changing all along in order to try to stay faithful so there there is within Christianity I think a a confession that all of our approximations are insufficient and and you know I've learned a lot about um you know some of these other traditions Eastern non-Christian traditions that I knew almost nothing about just simply by virtue of the shape of my life but within Christianity we've I you know I learned these things as a as a teenager in catechism class and I learned them as a young adult and in Calvin seminary which is a conservative reformed institution um that that God is always beyond us and and and the shape that God wishes you know I'm a Calvinist is is also always beyond us my total depravity does not um no matter how much I strive I will never get beyond that in this life and and so God will be beyond and his desires for the incarnation of his will in this world will be beyond our capacities and our labels yet that I think at the heart of Christianity is that while he may be beyond our capacity to understand and his faithfulness may be beyond our capacity to instantiate in our lives he is fundamentally for us and and and so we you know I love Hendrik de Kock who was a rural Dutch Calvinist minister who started this offskiding which is a a split in the Dutch reformed church in the early part of the 19th century you know he had this phrase which Richard Mao has picked up you know follow that lamb wherever he goes and you know to me that's where we're at that um the the god of this universe who is as I think David Bentley Hart beautifully articulated there is for us and in this process Christian eschatology says he is for us and he will finally succeed and we will be blessed by his success and I think um given such an image of a god like that who was not only high and lifted up but is manifest in the glory you know I I love god number one and god number two I immediately went to Isaiah six you know Isaiah comes into the sanctuary and he meets god and the temple it's like who would have thought even all the theology says that's where he's going to be and you know then there are these cherubim you know these wings six wings not two um holy holy holy is the lord god almighty holy holy holy three holies you know he's beyond any of our conception of him the whole earth is full of his glory you know his his weight you know his his weight his cavode his fingerprints are all the way down to dogs who know the lord even though um we would you know we might train our dogs to fold their hands on for a youtube video but um this is the this is the level of application which being in ultimate goodness and power is determined to present to us and I think that's so then as a pastor of a local church here's I've got words I've got actions got a little bit of an institution there's a tradition got a little bit of an institution there's a tradition and you know especially in this season the logos becomes flesh and tabernacled among us and you know the beginning of the gospel of john you know you know we have seen his glory but of course in the gospel of john the height of that glory you know the book of signs the beginning and the book of glory is you know the last part of the gospel of john which is of course the crucifixion well how is the crucifixion his glory so yeah right I went on too long too but I that's what I see no it's great um for both of you then I mean some of the follow-up questions and feedback like I would immediately have is like obviously you have this picture in Isaiah 6 like you're talking about and I think this is echoed in some sense in the neoplatonic tradition that when we begin to talk about the one when we begin to talk about ultimate reality that which we can think no higher than god in the metaphysical sense we always have limitations of language we have limitations of perception part of this is because in the christian tradition our finitude is by right ordering so to have a finite perception of an infinite being is just that's that's not a that's not a sin problem right christians would also then say well part of our problem that we experience why we can't solve the nine dot problems of life is not just because of our finitude because but there's also something wrong with our framing there's something that we would say is the presence of sin and I mean that in not just in the harm artia like missing the mark sense where I look and I go like john when you originally did that nine dot problem in your lectures I paused and I was like okay I'm going to figure this out and I couldn't I had a framing issue right part of it was my the finitude of my mental capacity but part of it was I was just missing the mark because I had gone through maybe some cultural programming in preschool kindergarten where I tend to look for boxes and neat triangles and color in between the lines so there's the also the sense in which we have been born into the world and under the presence of cosmic sin that christians would affirm like there's something misordered which keeps us from seeing what should be of ultimate concern to us the prophets the old testament biblical prophets to me if I were to sum up what their message is it's you've made propositional claims about the metaphysical god and yet the existential god if we were to evaluate the sum total of your life and your actions shows that you're worshiping idols so there is something incongruent about these two what I'm really interested in in in the way you guys have dialogue and I think the future of dialogue in like an increasingly post-secular age is that I see some positive movement towards among christians and even you know john you consider yourself a non-theist and going okay what do our words mean when we use these particular words so john when you talk about like being and reality I have no problem in my own mind making that substitute for the three-letter word god because what I see you doing is you're saying I'm reaching for that which is of ultimate concern and is what is ultimately necessary and I'm looking for conformity and adherence with that and so I have no problem with that because I I see that as being congruent once we kind of take the crowbar and we peel underneath the layers of language and so I I see no problem with that and I do feel and correct me if I'm wrong on this john I feel like what's at the heart of your project is in some sense you are trying to match and again feel free to correct me on this you're trying to help people match metaphysical god with what should be of ultimate concern existentially in our lives is that fair how would you yeah that's there qualify that well I want to respond to both the pauls um and given hopefully an integrated answer I think holly that's a great question to pose to me um I think what you're saying is fair um I agree with what Paul V just said um and he and he's right I I worry about and I criticize the idolatry to use your language or my language the tyranny of the propositional and I hope that's not what we're doing here um but um let's talk a little bit about I hope this isn't insulting it's your term the dogs that know um right that that and this this goes a little bit more toward the cosmic sense of sin right yeah but you know there is another practice it's called science and we can't ignore it and that practice inseminates our lives and is instantiated as a as a omnipresent ontology which is technology which has a life of its own and has magical almost religious qualities for most of the dogs if I can use that word again non-pejoratively right I don't like it because it sounds a little bit insulting but it's the term that Paul introduced so I hope it's not being I actually meant dogs I didn't mean people well there we go well but but but but you but I think you were you're pointing to a continuum yes yes yes right okay but anyways uh the point out I wanted to make is um that and this was Wittgenstein's point people uh you know there's a sense in which philosophy is unavoidable even in a sort of a therapeutic liberation sense because um common sense the the common sense shared worldview um Wittgenstein said Wittgenstein argued um you know we're often caught in the grip of a picture we have a picture that we adhere to that we think makes sense but and it's like what Augustine said about time I know what time is until you ask me we think the picture makes sense and then when we when we get pressure put on the picture to try and right uh to articulate it we it falls apart in our hands and and and and I and I think you're seeing this by the way Paul's pointed at Paul V like videos of Christians going through deconstruction leaving the faith because they were caught in the grip of a picture right and they were not I'm not going to be they weren't pursuing philosophy or theology but something slams into that picture and the picture fractures because they're caught in the grip of a picture that doesn't actually carry understanding or wisdom and for Wittgenstein to use Frankfurt's term this is the deepest kind of bullshit so there is also a possibility for a lot of silent right a lot of silent I don't know what to call it vulnerability in that way um and so I think we need to yes we yes we are doing this right but the point of this the point of this reconstruction a reciprocal reconstruction is to reach back down into the level of practice because that's where the transformation has to occur the the perspectival and the procedural and the participatory levels um which is again why I keep I keep trying to bridge between these precisely because of that so so like I want to here I want to talk about the four L's right and I want to try and talk about them from the level of these three other things I want to talk because these are the ones that instead of these terms and they're beautiful terms and I use them myself from from heart until it but I want to go to you know the the identity claims that are made God is love God is light right God is life and God is logos right because those terms stretch from the height of our conceptuality to the depth of our embodiment and then I want to put these three words the place from which we talk about them incarnation embodiment and incorporation because they all overlap and they're all circling around each other right now because I think of incorporation as pointing to distributed cognition in particular right and so the I I want to talk about these things right in in as new a way as possible where we're as much as possible trying to see where we are bullshitting ourselves and I include myself I include myself where we're bullshitting ourselves by being in the grip of a picture rather right than understanding this is this is the deep if you want to be really fair to me this is the deep thing by me by the two worlds mythology we have these various pictures of two worlds and mind and matter and right and we have these pictures and people pronounce the pictures that's what the propositions are doing but they're I feel that they're in the grip of these pictures and this doesn't have to be at the level like I said of seminary the the the Christians that that deconstruct out of their faith they're in the grip of something and it's and that grip is often and Paul you've mentioned this it's Paul V it's it's modernity but modernity is science and technology it's not out there as an abstract idea it's here it's in the it's in your computer screen it's in your mic it's in everything around you like like but there's also no escaping it I don't mean this is like an apologetic response but I'm trying to pick at what your what point you're trying to make here John is like it seems like what you're saying is like people operate always within a picture they were storied creatures so we always operate in this narrative framework our narrative perspective is limited we all confess that you're saying a similar thing to what I was saying about either our finitude or the presence of sin right it's is limiting but we also have to act in the world a particular way and so the question that I have is like how do we we this is a this is a difficult thing for Christians this is a difficult thing for Paul and I right because I think there's pluralism implications here and we need to get at that at some point here too as well but I think one of the concerns I've heard you voice is like I think maybe you're concerned that let's say even the the Christian story that Paul V and I inhabit which may be different than you know the the moral therapeutic deism you commonly brush across even our frame is limited because we claim Jesus as Lord you know and so but if you're to open up and say okay well your problem is Paul and Paul that we need to consider that maybe even that image could be an idol this is certainly a concern other religions have of Christianity it's a concern Islam has of course that you have made an idol out of the invisible God so not only is John or I should say Isaiah chapter six Isaiah is in this temple-like atmosphere in the in the holy of holies in heaven and he goes I'm a man of unclean lips and you've got these angels these crazy creatures that day and night are saying whoa you've never seen that before that's kind of what I think of when I think of the word holy have you ever seen that before no I haven't there's this infinite they've been doing this for all eternity and then you jump ahead to this very clear like appropriation of that in the apocalypse of John and John is in a throne room he is in the the the utmost innermost courts of heaven and he's a sees a slain lamb on the throne right so Christians like name and we say the image of the invisible God is made manifest in Christ but is there a suggestion here that and again you're not going to offend us because we need to rep I'll speak for myself I need to wrestle with this perpetually right is there any sort of image of God an idolatrous image and if that's the case how do you ever live in the world in any particular way because you have to live within a framework so if I was like well I'm totally I could be wrong about this then you're stuck in perhaps a different mode of despair that keeps you from acting in the world a particular way well I want to respond to that and then I'll let Paul V talk um um first of all I also balance that with you're never going to be free of a framework relevance realization okay okay so I'm not I'm not I don't believe in the sort of the pseudo Zen that passes for Zen in the west where I get free of all framing and all perspectives I think that's bullshit um yeah yeah well then you wouldn't be able to get off your couch um so I so keep that in counterbalance okay um secondly I I I do have a concern of Jesus becoming an idol um rather than an icon yes very much but what I what I was just trying to say a few minutes ago is that reverberates back for me the the pictures uh the pictograms around Jesus as Christ I think prevent Christians for for for talking about love and light and life and logos in a way that will reach other people oh definitely I you know I was astonished and I this is not meant to be self-promotional so please don't hear it that way how many Christians said when I talked about agape I talked about it better than any Christian they'd ever heard talk about it that shocked me right and it's like whoa like right and and I don't think it has to do anything with my particular skills or anything like that it has to do with what I'm talking about right now I think there's a way in which Christians have become hamstrung about these terms so although I I'm worried about the idolatry I where it I see it more prominent is an inability to speak about the three L's or the four L's like I talked about right in a way that calls to us as embodied beings right that's that's what I see right right so many people right they deconstruct because they're in the grip of a fragile picture that can sustain the blows of the world right now or they feel starved within many of the non-nones are nones not because of lack of belief but because of lack of belonging and people are not hearing that I'm sorry I'm getting a little bit harder to preach not hearing that right and and I my concern is Christianity has this pictography around Jesus that is preventing a new and needed new discussion about life love logos and light that will allow us to re-understand at these deep levels what we mean by God that's my critique that's what I'm trying to put at center right now it so it's lines up with what you're saying Pauli but it's it's it's it's more than that I want I and it's this that's more is what is what is grabbing my attention right now because I see elsewhere in philosophy cognitive science and even in some of the theology people doing this they're going they're trying to go deep back and rebirth I mean and Christianity should be interested in rebirth right interested in a rebirth or like a deep rebirth I think that's what Jonathan profoundly and provocatively means when he thinks that Christianity might itself go through death and resurrection he's saying something really profound there and really challenging to a lot of Christians he's on I mean how he does it I don't know he stands in the depths of orthodoxy and speaks to the horizon of heresy and he manages to do that and everybody goes oh I love Jonathan I've I tried to do that I'd get slammed right but anyways right but that's what I'm trying to say so I'm trying to be very deeply provocative but I'm doing it I'm doing it I'm doing it as a call right a call to for response from you I don't I'm this is I do not want to be doing phyllo nikea I do not want to be doing that I do not want to be doing that right it like you know that's it I'll shut up that's what I want to say I don't find anything that you said there John to be um there's no apologetics in there for me no I don't I don't hear any of it there and I think part of the difficulty that is happening certainly within the church but but often I think especially with those who are perhaps not as deep in the church as let's say I mean Paul and I have and continue to be is that this this this renewal of our stories and renewal of the images is in church a perpetual it's a perpetual project now that that is often not recognized outside the church for very good reasons partly because um there's always this tension I still haven't found this Peterson had a great little riff at one point um about you know change too much and you're gone and you're gone change too little and you're gone and you have it in terms of opponent processing yeah this opponent processing is always within the church and in fact how that then scales out into the body of Christ is you know you know super super hardliners who are you know totally way over on the conservative end of the spectrum that don't want to change at all and then you're super open as people who are wanting to change everything all the time these things these things fractal down and out in the church all the time and so then to be to be within the church working on these things is you know we're always doing that and that they're they're even in little sub communities like the Christian Reformed Church even at Living Stones um you know to a degree within my own head but beyond you know in terms of between denominations the orthodox the catholic all of the protestants you know within the catholics within the orthodox I mean these these this process is continually happening and and the and you know I don't I don't want to take anything away from Jonathan because I'm not saying that he got it from Chesterton but what John talks about in terms of the continual resurrection of the church Chesterton wrote about and I don't remember if it was orthodoxy I think it's the everlasting man he has an entire chapter devoted to that where he looks at Christian history and says it keeps coming around you know I look at for example um I very quickly when I saw Jordan Peterson I saw some some pattern recognition of something that happened with Billy Graham now that seems like a strange combination because in terms of their confessions Billy Graham and Jordan Peterson seem to be almost contradictory especially if you look at Billy Graham through his son Franklin let's say um who is not really the same as Billy but this it's difficult even it's difficult for us to know even even though the history was not long ago that Billy Graham was filling you know stadiums around the world and if you read something like you know don't look at the don't watch the movie read the book um Unbreakable um Louise Ampini something like that um it's a phenomenal book about this guy who just endures the most horrendous suffering being at sea in a raft and then winding up in the worst Japanese POW camp suffering unbelievable torture surviving all of that to come back to the United States to finally get a good job and marry the woman of his dreams only to be um only to find himself an alcoholic and he has no idea you know he completely shipwrecks his life in a way that being lost at sea and being in a Japanese POW camp couldn't do and he's doing it to himself with alcohol and you know today we might say we'll get into an AA program or get into detail you know whatever but what happens to him is you know he goes to a Billy Graham you know crusade and stops drinking and turns his life around and his life goes in a beautiful direction it's just a remarkable story and so no John I think um we're more with you than you think on this point because working pastorally with almost any person who is stuck because you know before there was therapy and all of this we've had you know we've had pastoral ministry and I think in many ways we've seen in the secular age you know a lot of new things created and psychology and this has you know flown back and forth into the church and there's constant conversations about that too but people who are stuck are stuck in stories and Christians are by no means Christian pastors are by no means unaware of idol Jesus appropriating and possessing congregations and even traditions and that there's always a breaking of idols Christianity is a very iconoclastic tradition even as it creates new icons because in many ways the only way to break an icon is with another for human beings because you know Calvin talked about you know the mind the human mind is a perpetual idol factory and and I think part of why we know this is we almost can't function without them we need an idol in order to break the last idol and and and that frustration I think has been you know well known within the faith and um there's a major and also right now isn't there Paul what's that I mean there's a major in evangelical context in particular Protestant context there's a major massive I don't know if we'll look back and say it's a Protestant Reformation scale in the future but there's a massive iconoclasm going on right now a collision of competing pictures of what Christ is like what the Christian way is what ethics ethical implications it's just it's a big one massive right now and and and the question is what will emerge right it you know I don't know orthodox friends notwithstanding I don't know to what degree Paul of Tarsus would find the current church you know in any way recognizable compared to the kinds of things he planted but then again how on earth could we conceptualize how a first century person could in any way apprehend what is going on around us here in North America today so we're always in this struggle and um I you know I would I've just been reading some history of the French Revolution this this weekend and it seems so timely so we always keep coming around to these things and so I I agree with you John I don't I don't think I don't feel challenged or in fact I feel a degree of um commonality when you talk this way because it's what I deal with every day in the church and in within Christianity okay can I say one thing then because absolutely that was very well it was very well taken by me that's what I'm trying to say um it would be good if we could talk about like I said um I found this book deeply provocative because he talks a long time about love and the postmodern predicament very deeply very profoundly in a way that I found deeply educating before he dare mentions God and I think that's something that I'm also wanting I'm trying to recommend right can we get to a place because you know what maybe not everybody in the pew wants to talk about all this hype but I bet you they care about love they care about light meaning intelligibility and right the lived meaning right they care about logos and they care about life and if we don't start talking about those things I think what we do we do two things either they will eventually go somewhere where they can talk about those things um in whatever way that that's a vacuum that will not be left unfilled is what I'm saying right um and so if we and I agree I don't want to do like I know I I'm guilty uh verbosity I get that right uh but my my honest intent is I don't want to do this I want to renew our ability to deeply like deeply individually and collectively reflect upon these things from a place of embodiment that's in relationship to what you guys would call incarnation and I'm happy to talk about what that might mean in relation to but because there's like for example if you're going to keep talking about incarnation and you're not talking about embodiment that's going on in cognitive science you're missing the boat you are missing the boat right and if you're talking about incarnation and you're not talking about incorporation both in the sense of distributed cognition and corporate structures that are the principalities and powers of our life you're missing the boat that that's what I would say to you right that's what I would say to you and and when you're going to talk about embodiment you have to talk about love and life and light and logos in a like in that deeply embodied enacted embedded extended fashion um that I guess that's what that's what I'm saying and I'd say amen to that now I'll I'll say a little bit more now about deconstruction I am surrounded by it I'm not going to go into details because it's you know even though I talk a lot on the internet someone who would watch very carefully might notice there certain areas I don't talk about yeah I am I am surrounded by people that I love more than any any other people in the world um people who are I'm closer to them more than any other people in the world who have um who have walked away from the faith who have deconstructed and I have heard the you know very often the kinds of testimonies like I we heard from Audrey Assad in the video that I listened to from yes yes um where they have where they have spoken about um oh I they just have a sense of liberation they have a sense of you know they've gotten these idols off their backs and they are released from these stories and they're released from um behavioral constraints and accountability and all of this stuff and they they very quickly have a sense of liberation and they can breathe more freely and you know and for this reason you know in terms of proximal betterment um I have no question that their their deconstruction was necessary and and productive often watching people long term in this however I have also noticed you know Clay Rutledge has written about a number of these things you know from a non-christian perspective um that the vacuum when you you know Jesus talks about this in his parables when you break an idol and you break because idols aren't just an image these images you know they're they're institutions they're lifestyles they're embodiment I mean we embody these idols so they break this idol unless there is a better something to replace it what tends to creep in is usually the um just the stuff of popular culture very much well yeah and you talk about this too and I know you do um and so I think this I think this process I think this process is endemic I think I think it's been endemic within the history of Christianity which is why Chesterton has written about it and Peugeot talks about it and the I think some of the deeper questions are is is this process actually progressive in that do we actually make progress with it um and and again in terms of how it scales and fractals in individual lives you know human beings are in some ways also fodder for this being that um that we are all participating in because you see you know you see some people fail and you see some people fail all the way to the grave and again as a pastor it's very difficult as a pastor not to recognize the failures of our the failures and limitations of our practices because you might have someone who has been sitting faithfully in your church participating in all of the programs and the kind of embodying of embodied love that the person they say is their master has certainly at least not too many of us who are witnessing them been manifest in their lives and that that causes obviously consternation and reflection on behalf of those who have positions of authority and responsibility in said institutions but um I I am not anxious about deconstruction because I don't understand that there are stories and pictures and um narratives within Christianity now that need to be broken that doesn't bother me yeah I am more anxious about the fact that so often those who deconstruct simply um default either to the church of Netflix or sort of a so many friends who have you know they've left a traditional religion and oh they do some yoga and they do some meditation they do a few things out here but it's sort of like another pastor of mine that says all these people have left my church to be orthodox and you know what they don't do go to an orthodox church and I see that in the spiritually but not religious and they've sort of become just an alternative to this image that David French just wrote about yesterday in terms of white evangelicals that they're just as captive to another political ideology as the white evangelicals are to a particular political ideology and so what we're really looking for is in fact this we're all looking we're all looking not only for proximal betterment for that but for that betterment to continue to scale and and that's why so in so much of this John I count you as an ally because you're helping people to deconstruct better and our iron is sharpening iron and whereas one hand many who have deconstructed simply won't listen to me because I'm a Christian pastor but they will listen to you and you're challenging them to say that was one of the best presentations of my position if that's what I have that I've ever heard Paul thank you thank you very much for that I really appreciate that like profoundly and all the meanings of appreciate that reason one more question and then I want to hear what Paul has to say let's take me as a potential example and I have many people that are similar and and the people I see the people who are attracted to my work and some of them do return to Christianity and or to Islam or to Buddhism right Judaism I had amazing conversations with Zevi about you know his take on mysticism right what do you do with this what do you do with this because I'm now talking at the level of the four L's of life and love and light and logos I have a loyalty to Socrates and to Siddhartha that I'm not going to abandon I'm never going to betray those loyalties and I'm not I'm not unique in this and to end to Plotinus right I had those loyalties are like because they are doing exactly what you're proposing Paul they are affording me not going from deconstruction into decadence and so and in that and like I say how would you and this is an open question right how would you welcome back people who need to live out those loyalties this is this is the question I wanted to get at because Paul when you were talking all I could think about is now essentially what we've boiled this whole discussion down to is like competing visions of the good and so then how do we make both the epistemological processes how do we identify like what's the right methodology for determining the good what the good life looks like what's true what's beautiful but also like what's our hermeneutic key and I don't want to throw a bunch of language in there because I think you guys were doing a really good job both of you distilling this down to where the every man every woman is at in this this grappling process you talked about in one of your conversations John about how much your friends had noticed in you when you started practicing Tai Chi religiously how much transformation was occurring in your life and by that I assume you meant positive transformation very much so the first question I came to mind for me though was there is how do we put this in talking about that let me let me circle back around to this this thing I you've talked about before about what would it look like if all of the internal mechanisms and machinery that we have bound up in our egotistic self get accepted onto the world and I am ready to have a Billy Graham altar call when I hear that let's come streaming down the altar of the Pentecostal Charismatic and me you know says we're gonna line people up and and say yes to that but I am able to and I'm able to be honest about my convictional location my convictional location I'm confessing is situated in a Christian story so when I hear that I'm confessing just like you are with the Buddha with Plotinus that for me and this certainly isn't this would be a ridiculous claim to make to say that Jesus is Lord in all aspects of my life that's that would be ridiculous but when I look at that I go I can say yes to that honestly because I see the slain lamb as the prototype of a new creation and so I'm confessing like my hermeneutic key I'm engaging with what you say John is positive because I'm confessing my allegiance to this picture of Christ that I have and so what I what I see sometimes and I think you know Tom Holland brings this up in Dominion is like I want to get out a little bit and again this isn't to move into like Phileah, Nikea or to get into apologetic mode I really want to wrestle with this because this is one of the things as a pastor it's just a human being the world is shrinking and our engagements with people across a variety of religious commitments of non-religious commitments of substitute secular religious commitments we have these engagements happening all the time and I feel like in the West we are still dealing with like the implied thing that your friends and you can correct me on this John when they saw something in your life that was transformative they probably saw what Christians would say are fruits of the spirit like that's not to say that's the only way of looking at it but if if let's say instead we were in like a ancient Mayan civilization right no we're gonna have especially when it comes to worship and what might even be coming out of us in altered states of consciousness I think we would all be in agreement whether it's ancient Mayans or whether what Himmler was doing with Nazi occult stuff that there are encounters that people have that we would say move into that state of self-transcendence like they move beyond their egotistical concerns and now they're encountering principalities powers they're encountering something beyond them they're hyper objects whatever language we want to use and what is it that allows us to look at the Mayans who are killing people as part of one dimension this isn't certainly all the dimension of ancient mind religious practice but one dimension is the killing the sacrifice of human beings and we're able to from our conventional location look at that and go that is not a vision of the good life so the question I guess I'm really trying to get at is don't we all have as you're confessing John and I think I'm confessing like we have to confess our conventional location and we all have a functional Christ like I know I'm using that in like maybe a colonialist sort of way of doing it a functional buddha a functional what sits atop our guiding story what is it that informs and writes that story what is it that sits atop the hierarchy of values is it an archetypal figure is it when we envision the ideal what is of ultimate concern we're making like a hermeneutic choice with the rest of reality so I'm able to say honestly to you John and I think you hear this from people and I know you don't know what to do with it but people look at you and the way you engage with us and they see Christ likeness in it and I know you've heard that from people and I know you don't know what to do with that but I'm able to say that because I'm confessing honestly that I see Christ as sitting atop the hierarchy of all that is true good and beautiful like I see that but for someone else that goes well I'm not I don't accept that that would be the full picture don't we really need to get to the point where like we're laying on the table with each other what are those things that we're saying as of right now I'm not budging from this like you're honestly doing with us and I appreciate that well that's that's profound yeah I don't know what I mean I I'm appreciative of people saying they see Christ likeness I guess I was hoping they'd also see Socrates I was hoping they'd also see Siddhartha I was hoping they'd also see Spinoza and other people do so I'm saying to you people will say I see people will say to me I feel like I'm in one of people comment I feel like I'm in one of Plato's dialogues listening to you and the people you speak right and so they see Socrates and I'm not claiming to be Socrates anymore than I would dare to claim to be Christ or anything remotely ridiculous like that so please take that as please take it charitably right but I would hope that they're seeing you know the the symphony of sages that I have internalized and for me that they I guess what you're asking is the the phenomenological cognitive existential marker for me is when that symphony is concordant when there's harmony when there's beauty where's where's when and when that beauty is the beauty that is the doorway to truth and to goodness that's when I feel I'm on the path and again of sages is a great way of putting it John I don't mean to interrupt but because that gets at the question I'm trying to get it is yeah who's the conductor of the symphony of sages there is no conductor when you're playing jazz a part of me would push back on that because as a musician as a musician myself and I'm not a jazz musician but in my mind but I she is jazz like when you're fighting far there's a harmony though that happens even in jazz even in the dissonance so there's a difference between when my kids are just banging around with the piano and a jazz musician but what I'm saying is like even in jazz even in the intended dissonance I would suggest like this is how we talked about it in my my charismatic wild I'm acting essentially as a Christian shaman worship leader days okay we were searching for harmony with the spirit and there was something that we real we felt would happen when we all got locked in on the same page and their spontaneity and even in our music you know what I mean I'm saying yeah so we named it as good because we said this is good because we identified it as the spirit of god the holy spirit whether we're right or not in all those instances is another question but we were still honest in naming that okay so let me let me respond then and what I was trying to push back on I don't think there's a cause of the logos other than the logos and trying to look for but there must be an origin cause of the logos I think is right but do you have an icon though or several icons or like the boundaries of what the logos is from what other principalities and powers that might be like hey let's go let's let's kill some people you know like let's have human sacrifice like right you can say no to that and yes to another thing but yeah and I agree and so what I'm what I'm saying is and let me try and do this carefully please I don't think we ultimately have any deeper criterion than our sense of like Spinoza again truth is its own criterion right and and beauty and goodness and and this is Plato's sort of what he ultimately is getting at if you don't have the virtue and the virtuosity to recognize them there's nothing that I can do nothing to give it to you right if right if you don't have honesty how could I possibly appeal to you in any way to get you to pursue honesty right and this is this and this is the great you know and we have to use this metaphor very carefully now this is the seduction metaphor right and I guess my response to you is how do we discern the spirits to use I guess the biblical language you want is yeah I mean how do you discern the true and the good and the beautiful how do you separate those out and I don't know of any way of getting at a set of propositions that will algorithmically resolve that that is my concern oh that's good right that's that's my concern and so what I'm saying is I mean I think all of us have a fundamental faith in the daha sense in the intelligibility in the intelligibility of reality the light and the logos that's livable and lovable and affords us right like like think about love like let love think about when you're in like we're in love and we fall in love like love simultaneously comes to us emanation and it wells up within us emergence and just just be with that like really sink into the phenomenology and then and then think what would it mean to participatory knowing to know by loving right and part of my response is I mean and it goes to the tiller quote like I I'm more willing to trust those aspects of me and other people that have gone deeply into tasting and seeing that the Lord is good they have to take right and you can say that's fallible yes it is and so is anything else I would say you propose to me and and when you guys are honest you say that the church is fallible the scriptures can be interpreted you know and there's no I don't find any this is like you know the first noble truth of Buddhism there is no place where I can get outside of my finitude and my being fallible and so I think that one of the greatest idols we have and we see it in the idolat in the idolatry idolatrous ideologies is people claiming that they can get out of that oh no I I'm out of fallibility I just know I mean and that's that's what terrifies me and it's obvious in the service of well you know I just know that like like I strongly believe with good evidence and argument that racism is wrong but that's different from I know and I infallibly know that scares me that scares me so I right that is not something I want to be saying here so I think how do you discern the spirits the depth of the people that are making the claims I and I don't know what else I can ultimately put my faith in right I really don't I really don't and for me it's at least a really powerful heuristic that the people that go like this that it's because they have they they have not lived in the depths the way they need to the way they they have not been they have not been educated in the depths they might have been exposed or fallen into the depths but that's not the same thing as being educated in the depths right and that that and that's what we're doing here right part of the answer to your question is this right is this that's exactly and I that's what I mean by the dialectic into the logos I don't and you I understand and and I'm not trying to say like uh poo poo on what you're saying I understand what you want to right and and you should right you want to say but beyond that isn't there in a sense you're right but now you're you're shifting me off what do I think is the ultimate real to how do I ultimately decide and those are not the same question and I'm trying to answer the second question I'm trying to answer the second question and I'm telling you how I decide I just want to say John that before Socrates was Socrates before he was Socrates I don't know if you understand that so I do I do I do understand yeah too short um now I'm getting it thank you Paul that was very kind there's a I often much of what you just said about um I loved how boy you know you keep quoting Spinoza and I'm thinking you know I got to do more reading of this read Carlisle's book Paul you will love it Spinoza's religion is the best book on Spinoza just like DC Schindler's book Plato's Plato's critique of impure reason best book on Plato Carlisle's book on Spinoza brilliant recent brilliant and it goes to it does what we're doing here it reaches into the height of the metaphysics but into the depths of the participation yeah so you know I I look at that so in so my Calvinism I can you know especially when I call myself a Calvinist on the internet people go all over the place because of other Calvinists that are around and that's fine um but what you just talked about I mean you can have you can have the infallible word of God but can you know can you appropriate that infallible word word into you and Calvin's answer is no only the spirit can do that it takes you know we the the only connection between us and this word of God is in fact the spirit and so this has been you know been being played around I hadn't read any Carl Bart ever in my career until recently and you know I find Carl Bart to be deeply Calvinistic but it's you know um Marilyn Robinson is a Calvinist and John Piper is a Calvinist and you know there's a lot of Calvinists around I didn't know Robinson was a Calvinist yeah Marilyn Robinson is a Calvinist her books are astonishing novels yeah yeah they are yeah beautiful yeah I profoundly recommend them to anybody anybody listening read her novel her trilogy yeah yeah I think John's shocked that a Calvinist can write like that so so sorry I didn't mean to be insulted oh I'm not insulted I did I knew that once I I couldn't be a Christian for a minister and not identify as a Calvinist so I thought I'll put it out there and I knew everything that I would get back from it which I regularly do but that's okay um part of you know I look at Lewis with some of you know John I you know when you when you tell me that about your loyalties to Siddhartha and Plotinus and Socrates um I don't I don't first of all I think it's just part of what the American experiment got right and that the enlightenment got right post Protestantism and post the the the pluralism of confessionalism that brought all that bloodshed in Europe was um I I cannot take that away from you John nor should I try and um using many means to try such as you know ostracize you or put you on a rack or take your money away or your liberty away etc etc etc um in the same way that um you know you've spoken of Sarah your partner why should I why should I take your loyalty um why should I take that away from you as well I mean loyalty is what it is so let's um let's let's realize that to begin with part of what is amazing about C.S. Lewis is that on one hand he can sound so you know thoroughly now how to go about this okay I'm gonna backtrack again in my tradition in Dutch reform tradition we have this we have this Dutch polymath at the turn of the 19th to the 20th century named Abram Kuyper and he was he founded the university founded a political party he wrote dogmatic theology he began in liberalism and transformed into what is now neo-Calvinism and he did all of this stuff and and he tried to hold together two things in Calvinism which are very difficult to hold together one is the antithesis which is good bad right wrong black white and the other is his doctrine of common grace where he says you know basically as Richard Mao has riffed he shines through all that's fair now we have a real problem holding these two things together it's sort of like binary and analog yeah and I think though that in order to hold them together you can't deny either even if you can't reconcile them but but we in our living not maybe not so much in our theoretical talking or another our abstractions because these two things are abstractions they're antithetical abstractions but in our living in narrative we sort of integrate them and so someone that I think integrated these things quite well is someone like C.S. Lewis because he has his on one hand he has his trilemma which has become this you know this thing that's used in apologetics that Jesus is a lunar liar in a lunatic liar or lord I mean talk about antithetical he's going to put you on this rack and say okay choose and on the other hand he writes in something like the last battle where there's this Emmett I think his name is who was this who was this officer in the evil army and now he is brought into Aslan's presence and Aslan says to him to the degree that you served the best of this evil god that he had you were serving me and you think well how on earth could Lewis hold both of these things together how could he be both the author of the trilemma and the author of the last battle where he seems to in some ways be riffing on his spiritual mentor the Scott George McDonald how can both of these things live in Lewis? And others because he's got the magician's nephew I don't know what they're teaching kids this day it's all in play dough. That's right and yeah a guy who was used to be the author before he died he was the editor of the Christian Courier which is a Canadian Calvinist publication and he couldn't stand Lewis he said all that Platonism he just couldn't stand all the Platonism in Lewis but there he was and you know part of what we are living through is obviously the globalization and the pluralisms that globalization brings to us where you know we've got Moses and Jesus and you know for many of the Jewish friends well that's exactly what if you believe the gospel accounts it's exactly what Jesus was wrestling with with the Pharisees and the Sadducees and various groups and his you know and Jesus would say well if you really knew Moses you'd know me and well which Moses so I John we are certainly living in a world now where we are trying to figure this out but yet there's also and I think you know I believe that it is in fact at the embodiment level the New Testament is very strange and that we have all these Protestants running around and you know we're going to believe in Jesus and post-Luther this mental assent and I'm saved because of this mental assent and I walked down the aisle for Billy Graham all of the New Testament descriptions of the last judgment people are always judged on what they do it's very unsettling the Protestants right they're always judged on what they do well now if you're a solo script or Protestant what are you going to make of that is it work salvation and then you know Protestants have been wringing their hands over fighting about these kind of things forever but there's a sense in which that I I've often said that narrative is this massive compression engine by which we can take this world and you know put it into something that we can appropriate and manipulate and use well I think action is even a more massive compression engine yeah yes and and so um you know I I have been blessed John by your binary commitment and your loyalties to Siddhartha and Plotinus and Socrates because I think through the distillation including the sort of Tom Holland context that you all of this has been brought through the distillation of them into who you are and how you have chosen to live your life even just the the thin narrowness of it that I know you through these screens because we've never met in person and we certainly aren't neighbors where we see each other and you know know so much more of our lives together but I have certainly been blessed by Siddhartha and Plotinus and Socrates through you and and so on one hand Kuyper doesn't give up on the antithesis but he is also the most prominent theologian in my tradition of common grace that you know Christ works through Plotinus and Siddhartha and Socrates and in some ways claims them now again that sounds terrifically colonial and so I'll you know I'm not going to hold anyone to that simply just matter as I can't help but be born in 1963 to Stan and Barb and catechized and all of that cake is baked into me and so I as a human being am always going to be on one hand this terrifically limited creature by time and space even if I have this imagination that can do all kinds of things and yet that that then is expression of the embodied and the particular yet the particular is in another way is in another way the action the real the physical is in another way more real which I think the enlightenment and modernity gets right more real than all of this language and verbalizing and imagining that I do there's there's a reality to that that simply will not be denied and so I I'm not in any way bothered by your loyalties and your commitments any more than I'm bothered by your loyalty to Sarah. Well thank you it's Sara by the way. Sara I'm sorry. But well let me let me let me reciprocate I'm talking to you both of you talking to JP talking to JP talking to Jonathan talking to Mary has helped me a lot to and I mean this again in the three senses of the word to re-appreciate Jesus so like for example I'm I'm reading through David Bentley Hart's translation of the New Testament doing Lectio Divina on it because I want to reconnect with with that I don't know that perspective and presence that people find in the Jesus of the Bible I don't know what I don't know what name to give I'm not claiming I'm becoming a Christian or anything like that but what I'm saying is I felt responsible to be responsive to what I was seeing in all of you and so I put it into action and I put it into a kind of action that has the real good faith potential to transform me that's how I felt called to respond to what I was seeing in the good faith discussions that I was having with all of you so I'm reciprocating back what you said to me. That's great John I want to throw in some stuff that Paul was talking about just as again another voice from a Christian perspective I'm not a Calvinist I probably would be more in that Wesleyan vein but religious pluralism was like the one of the primary along with theology of culture was one of the primary areas of my focus in my master's program and I ended like what was essentially my thesis with that scene from the last battle Paul. What you're talking about I think I want to just affirm even some of the the critiques and pushbacks you give John are really instructive in helping us recover what I think has been the lost I know this sounds like some sort of history channel weird claim here but the lost Christianity a Christianity that has been largely lost in American evangelicalism and fundamentalism I can't speak necessarily even actually in the Catholic Church I mean the second Vatican Council countered what was effectively I'm going to get my years wrong but at least over a thousand years of Catholic Church teaching that was saying there's no salvation outside of the church and the second Vatican Council they changed that doctrinal position to what was held by the patristics and this is a shift from no salvation outside of the church to this understanding of and I'm not saying this is what you're saying John but I'm saying what you have to say brings us into a positive reassessment of our past. This shift from no salvation outside of the church to no salvation outside of Christ is a big difference. It's a big difference that gets at this heart of even what you're talking about with jazz right. When you're playing music jazz music there is harmony even in even in intended dissonance at times there are there's unspoken rules to the genre of music right. Discerning what that is and living in harmony with that is really what I would say is at the heart of these you know these supposed law gospel divides so people pit Paul against James in the New Testament and there is no pitting of it. The image that the author of Hebrews gives of heroes of faith includes Rahab the hooker right and what made her a hero of faith was not that she had all of the propositions about God correct. She certainly didn't especially from an ancient Jewish perspective she was the in the enemy camp right but what she did do was she identified she responded to the light that she had she responded to the light that she had and she actually manifested in her response fruits in keeping with the Torah which was to provide hospitality to strangers and in that way she's listed alongside Abraham as a hero of faith. I think one of the things you're helping us do John is kind of reassess this and the technical term is ecclesiocentric exclusivism this claim that there is no salvation outside of the church that it requires people to have engaged a specific proclamation of the gospel by Christians in order for someone to come into some sort of harmony with God right. That's what the atonement is at one meant that harmonization the adherence the coherence you talk about this with the cup you know coherence and adherence. That is something I think we've lost in some of what I think really not to pick on you know some Protestant reformers like Luther. Luther misunderstood I've got a friend Matthew J. Thomas he's got a great book on second tempa second century reception to Paul's letters and he shows that among the very earliest Christians there is a very different understanding of what law gospel meant. We pitted it in the Lutheran tradition right as you have all of your works and all of your works are total trash until you've made a profession of faith about certain propositions about Jesus and he calls into question that NT Wright there's sort of a new perspective on Paul school thought that's that's challenging some of that law gospel divide instead what NT Wright argues is we're misreading Romans. Romans 1 says that access to God has been available to all people at all times even among the Gentiles and he even says Paul says the Gentiles became a law unto themselves right and they responded to the light that they had. What we get called to and this would be my interpretation I don't even know if Paul's in agreement with me on this what Christians are called to is not that there's an exclusive team in which God is extending salvation to but he's extending a new vocational expansion a vocation that was once held exclusively by the Jewish people to be a light unto the nations and what God extends in in the New Testament is this announcement especially we see in Pauline writing that the vocation of being the people of God to be a blessing to the world to be salt and light to announce the good news is now extended to all people but it certainly doesn't mean that access to God is limited to people otherwise I mean have we really sometimes Christians don't even think through this stuff like what do we do with the however many thousands of years I mean we say post-Christ at least you know maybe 1400 years depending on you know how you date this between European engagement with the first Native Americans on this continent so you're telling me for the 1400 years because those people had never heard the name Jesus that none of them had access to God and I think that is really at the heart of like C.S. Lewis's critique in the last battle I think it's something that we should be challenging Christian communities to think about and for me that does nothing to threaten my commitments to Jesus as Lord in any way shape or form I don't see that as a threat I see when I read Buddha when I read Platinus and I find points of harmony I'm able to celebrate that and to celebrate it honestly saying like John when I engage in good faith dialogue with you I confess I only see in part we prophesy in part this is part of the Christian commitment we're waiting for what that which is perfect to come then that which in part will be done away so when I engage in like inter-religious dialogue I can still come because we need to get down to like how do communities actually function then right in your religion that isn't a religion how would a community yeah yeah around that actually function and then how would they engage with others and their neighbors and then how does that scale all the way up to a society and civilization yeah I'm allowed to engage I'm not allowed I find great freedom in engaging with Muslims with Jews with Daoists with nuns with you know D.I.Y. spiritualities that exist in Western culture and finding things like to celebrate about it because I see it as bearing witness to Christ so that allows me at least even if I'm not saying in a colonial way all of you need to get on board with me I'm at least able to functionally engage with my neighbors in a way that I think your critique is really it's not just your critique but it's a really important thing for Christians to reevaluate like are we serious that we're saying like people that lived in the Chin Dynasty like with no access to the name Jesus like they're all of their efforts to reach out to that which is of ultimate concern of crying out of earnest spiritual searching produced complete and total emptiness I personally wrestle with that I struggle with that and I didn't used to but I do think that you're providing with us a valuable critique that I think Christians should wrestle with even those that say that aren't unitive pluralists like a John Hick so John Hick was a unitive pluralist who was arguing that all religious experience insofar as it produces these sorts of morals which that was kind of like the thing like which morals are we and that's kind of getting to my earlier question as long as it produces these morals they're all the same experience that's different to me than this sort of Christo centric inclusiveness and it's very different than the exclusivist position I'm talking too much but in rambling at this point but I'll leave it there no I mean I yeah I mean Hicks work the fifth dimension and interpretation of religion were influential on me but I ultimately also am critical of this Kantian perennialism I don't think that's a good I think I reject both sort of clear perennialism and clear relativism as trying to talk about this that's why I try and I'm trying to make a place for pluralism and I try to use the analogy like you've heard you've both heard it you know we can have a universal theory of evolution but that doesn't mean that all the organisms are going to turn out homogenous in fact the theory predicts we're going to get many many different organisms right and that's right along that analogy the the cognitive evolution of meaning-making is going to be universal but that doesn't mean right that all the products are going to be homogenous but neither does it give into a kind of relativism either right and so yeah that I agree and I I would suggest to you that that while that problem is has some unique aspects to Christianity I think that's a problem of the world right now of trying to get between the two easy answers that we're given are perennialism and relativism and I think they're both problematic now of course I'm not saying that the perennialists and the relativists won't try and make can't make good moves and try and you know I'm not telling anybody to stop doing their philosophy that's would be ridiculous but what I'm saying is I think right now I think that's a general problem I like hearing my preferences don't matter but I'm just trying to say I like hearing that you know that this problem is being wrestled with I grew up in an imperialist colonialist triumphalist version of Christianity that would regularly pronounce would when when any other religion was announced if it ever was and when it was in you know was infrequent but when it was it was immediately followed by the phrase and it's sending millions of people to hell right so Islam a religion that is sending millions of people to hell that's like that was always the announcement of any other religion which you know it's again a traumatic thing because I go to school and I meet people and as a kid what am I how am I going to think of these I'm going to think of them as the incarnation of evil and yet they're nice kids and yet I'm like I'm terrified of going to their house because it's evil and there's evil there right and and like so that like hearing something different again but I've already said that I hear a lot of different I'm trying I'm trying to do something that somebody called me on and I'm trying to do it here and I'm starting trying to start doing it more regularly I'm trying to trying to see and interject the projections from and and therefore biases that my traumatic encounter with Christianity are colored the way they color and distort my vision and I'm trying so I'm doing the Lectio Divina on the New Testament this one of the it's the personal reason above and beyond the general reason why I want to talk to people like you because I want right I want to I want to be drawn beyond my trauma and I want to be able to speak as much truth as possible so what that's a long way of saying I'm finding I'm also finding these discourses tremendously helpful and in in not only in philosophical ways and those are important but in in personal ways I do not want to be criticizing if that's even what I'm doing I do not push back I do I do not want to be pushing back on Christianity just out of my own traumatic bias I want I mean I want to try to acknowledge that I'm no doubt doing that I want to try and see where it's happening but I also want to try and open up to the possibilities beyond that and you you're both right now helping me do that so thank you Paul do you have any closing thoughts I think we're going on over a couple hours here yeah I have to go because I'm going to be talking to Sevella soon about Neoplatonism so I'm looking forward to that yeah no I again I just deeply appreciate I deeply appreciate this I mean for me Christianity is the strange religion in which on one hand the Gospel of John and the Gospel of John Jesus claims to be the way the truth and the life no one comes to the Father except through him and then also in the Gospel of Matthew Jesus commands all of his followers to love their neighbor all the way up to and including their enemy and in the Sermon on the Mount sometimes Christians will I mean well doesn't Christ say be perfect and I say yes read the Sermon on the Mount read the context in which the Father's perfection Jesus commands us to emulate the Father's perfection and that perfection is his generosity towards the just and the unjust it's right there in the Sermon on the Mount I mean I always heard be perfect but it's sort of pulled right out of context which you know and but but no so um and I I consider I don't know I just feel a true tremendous amount of gratitude to God and to John and to Jonathan and to you Paul and to all of those who are participating in this little corner of the internet that was of course something coined by Sevilla um just to just to be able to just have the amazing good fortune to be able to participate in this right here and right now I it's it's it's one of the remarkable most remarkable passages of my life and I feel deep deep gratitude for this so I just want to say that that. Well I I also want to express the gratitude but I want I want to make a request I would like the three of us to try taking each one of the four L's and talking about God before we talk about God if I can put it in that paradoxical way I want to talk about love and how it discloses being I want to talk about life I want to talk about logos and I want to talk about light and I want to talk about God before we're talking about God and I would like to do that in your company if that would be great if you would like that sure I'll love that I'll um we'll reach back out after this and maybe nail down a time in the new year after the holidays to have that discussion and John will just kind of let you set the table and and if if you want me in on that great if you just want to dialogue with Paul there's no offense and that no no no I I this is this is good I'd like to I'd like to do this again good good well thank you gentlemen this has been tremendous I'll have this out probably on Tuesday for everybody and I'll share it with you all as well so you can do what you want with the files and put it on whatever platforms you like or not or burn it whatever you want to do so thank you John thank you Paul thank you both thank you both of you take care goodbye
