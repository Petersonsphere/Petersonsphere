 kind of um it kind of bred themselves i guess de-bred themselves but they left nice furniture did they oh they let you shakers left beautiful furniture interesting yeah you think that they would have used it to copulate but that was part of it well we are recording so we can do whatever you'd like um uh well we were talking about something that was interesting to me that you're bringing up because about two years ago karen strawlin contacted me because for whatever reason she liked the videos that i was doing she's uh i don't know if you know her she was in the red pill movie she had a guest appearance there she's a youtube star uh talking about men's rights issues but we were we had this long discussion i think in the october of 2017 um where she dialed in to interview me but i ended up interviewing her and we got into this really long discussion about the culture and she kind of i was asking the question is there any way for us to band together do we always need to have an enemy is it common enemy that's going to bind us together and without that common enemy is our society going to fall apart and just now when we met in your parish earlier today you said that what would tie us together is a common narrative and that felt like a better solution than a common enemy because the enemy is just going to have to i don't know the enemy is only going to channel our energies in a certain way whereas a narrative has the capacity to channel it in a variety of ways you i think it's an interesting question to ask whether you can have a narrative without an adversary oh okay and i think it's i think it's a narrative affords a lot a narrative affords a lot of diversity within a narrative but narratives almost always have an adversary or a challenge that it has to overcome yeah otherwise you don't have an error you don't have a story that's worth listening to well then what is it about okay well let's look let's look at your religion which is probably the hero would be jesus though what is the adversary of jesus is it satan or is it something else what does satan represent satan it's rebellion i mean the christianity has said there's there's satan the world and the human nature okay these are these are the three adversaries in a sense and if you look at the early chapters of the gospel of mark for example a lot of the gospel of mark is set up as jesus versus jesus both versus chaos in some ways but also jesus versus satan and the enemy okay the enemy the enemy like is this like some sort of alex jen conspiracy like deep state israel roman conspiracy it's church lady it's satan um but but you know if you look at say ephesians six the apostle paul says we battle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers okay and so these enemies don't necessarily have to be human beings in fact every alien movie would have a thing that unites humanity against some foreign invader now principalities and powers are non-human other principalities and powers they are supra or meta forces right and actually the conversation that jonathan p√©jot and i had um the last conversation we had we started talking about angels and demons and principalities and powers you can think of you know for example maybe one way to think of a principality that would be a way people would understand would be uncle sam so uncle sam is a sort of a principality and via uncle sam all kinds of people can be united for him or against him and so if you look at for example posters recruiting posters in the first and second world war you will have you germany gets germany and japan and second world war get get represented as principalities and the united states has a principality yeah yeah and so all right you mean enemy need not be another human being yeah but there needs to be something to fight against well then that that folds back into a certain i guess version of the social justice narrative that we are fighting against the principality of structural racism patriarchy and structural racism isn't as uh it's it doesn't have the same ring or kind of mythological power as the patriarchy or as rome or like as a god or a principality but it it the way that they talk about it as being implicit in everything and just implicit inside of all of us and in all these different structures and interactions there they're trying to point to an enemy that that's that's a of a higher order of magnitude or being than just you know the white male or the you know the oppressive class but more of the structure and i wonder if that is at once a kind of a better way of going about things or what are the what are the pitfalls when you say that the enemy is a principality it's a non-human or superhuman pattern of existence and then how does that pit yourself in a i guess a fruitful struggle or developing coherence of the individual when facing that well one of the things that it does in for example a narrative like you have in the bible the principality is out there but it can also be in here yeah and so and that would scale to woke religion or what i call progressive liberationism where you know the the racism is out there but the racism is in here and then you have to figure out well how can and this is kind of the perennial human challenge how can you address the the principality in here without destroying the person because it's it's you can one way to get rid of racism is kill racists yeah yeah um the question is can you save the racist from racism and this is i mean this is these are old old questions and conversations and if you look at totalitarian governments you know they they constantly were dealing with this but it's just almost always easier rather than to deal with something that's inside a human being to get rid of the human being yeah and and to force that individual human being to be an embodiment wholly of that thing and then symbolically use that person to excise all excise all the all that racism let's say from the community that's right if you can pin it all on one person that's right that's right but that's not that efficient no i guess that you still have racism but you get a brief respite from it in your feelings or in your imagination or well to go back to where you started this if you're if you're gaining your if as a civilization as a group you're gaining your energy by being oppositional i mean and orwell dealt with this in in 1984 you always have to have an enemy yeah and you always have to find someone who you always have to find the enemy without and the enemy within because if that's what your organ is that if that's what your movement is driving its energy from once you lose that enemy you've now lost your reason for being and you've lost what all of the thing all the energy that is giving you loyalty support all of those kinds of things and we've seen this you know the march of dimes very famously they were going to fight polio then they beat polio yeah what do you do with the march of dimes make a wish foundation you start fighting other childhood diseases yeah yeah because you just keep marching you just keep marching and then and this is what we see again and again the success can be the worst thing to happen to a movement a particular type of movement then that then can't doesn't reformulate itself as a movement once it gains success or well certain things are set up to be able i guess in the foundation if you think of the movement as what happens if we get this goal then what you know right i guess with feminism is it ultimate egalitarianism or will it always only ever be for this one group to gain more well and this is where with a bunch of these movements like feminism like racism you've got challenges that in a sense because you you okay so maybe your goal as a feminist movement is to have let's say equal pay equality something like that okay the difficulty is that that's too complex of a thing to actually succeed at and so it's something you can always be striving yeah yeah yeah yeah and and we see that happening and kind of almost blindly i mean i i i already hear brett weinstein in my head because now he's in my head because that's what happened to me this little upgrade of brett weinstein but it's almost like the the movements that persist are the ones that figure out that one cause that is perpetual that's right in a way that's right like almost blindly that's right that's right and so for example calvinism which is the tradition that i come out of total depravity is a is a doctrinal feature of calvinism and so i was with total depravity total depravity means that i will never as long as i live eradicate sin from my life okay now that's fairly handy because it's handy in a number of ways one of which so i was doing a conversation with the youtuber mr reagan when i was in southern california and he he was trying to establish my conservative credentials of which i have very few and and one of the things he asked me was are you a racist and i said yes and he didn't quite know what to say because well and i said well i'm a calvinist and so i believe that i am a racist and a bigot and in fact okay i per the heideberg catechism have a natural tendency to hate god and my neighbor this is part of my doctrinal package so i will never actually arrive at any of these goals as long as i live a pure non-racism a pure non-racism a pure non-sexism as not having bias against and that's just a tiny part of it i will never love my wife as i should i will never love my children as i should i will always fall short yeah i was i was having a an conversation with a with a listserv and one of the guys who actually started following me following me with jordan peterson found his way into the listserv a little small little church wonky listserv and he's an atheist and he's been going to church and for a lot of these atheists the confession that he's actually been going to church is you lose status with your atheist friends and so he was talking to this person and one of his friends said well but i can't go because she had grown up in a church i could never go to a church because i can't stand having people tell me that they're a sinner and actually this person was thinking about it but and jordan peterson's ideas about you know set a goal and are you actually achieving the potential that you have or are you falling falling short and if you sit down and you think about your life and you think like kind of you know kind of wasted a lot of time yesterday and i've blown a lot of money on senseless things and no i'm not striving i'm always falling short and for this individual he now has a certain understanding of what christianity means by sin yeah and so you're always following you're always falling short well so church part of the reason that i watched all of these other conversations about racism and sexism and lgbt stuff i was watching those conversations and i was thinking this is just like calvinism and that's why i found james lindsey because this is just like calvinism yeah except that with a with christianity and a tradition like calvinism all of this stuff has in a sense matured including all of the dodges so you can actually it actually can become a dodge to say i am totally depraved i will never measure up therefore i'll settle to settle with what settle with i'll be a bigot i'll be sexist yeah yeah yeah okay and and then you can sort of invert the conversation and for a while i was having conversations with someone who was just kept hammering at some of these points and so i just i just put i just signed my name paul vanderkley bigot and this began to annoy this person because he says well you're not a bigot i said no i really am but but you're not the kind of bigot that i want this movement to fight and he had specific ideas about how other people should change their mind in order for them not to be bigots okay but the problem with that is it's a never-ending game there will always be another there will always be another layer of bigotry there'll always be another layer of bias okay so there's this there's this narrow path between uh just calling the whole thing off in either direction saying okay i'm just gonna completely devote myself to eradicating myself because i'm full of sin and therefore i depraved myself of life because my life is full of depravity or just completely saying well i'm full of sin so it doesn't matter i'm scott free right like what's the point so so with these woke religions and then this ancient well this older religion like what what do you think is the saving grace in something like the church or christianity or a religion that that comes out the other end of generations affecting good in the world like what is what is that that can accept that that guilt part of the package and what do they tack on top of that that makes it more complete or whole or healthy i i think i think part i you know when i watched your conversation with james lindsey i thought you guys really touched on it because here's james lindsey noted that for some of the for some of the individuals they weren't allowed to deconstruct oppression or racism they get themselves an island that's right that's right that island if you look at this in terms of religious terms that island is an idol and we would call that technically an idol because they are using it as their god that then becomes the thing which organizes the hierarchy exactly yeah the reason christianity and other religions but christianity in particular began talking about idolatry is that it recognized something that's actually connected with the sermon on the mount god in the sermon on the mount says you may not represent me by anything within the created order wait is this the mount cyanide this is not cyanide okay so third commandment you shall have no other gods before me you said the sermon on the mount but this is the previous sermon on the mount my wife my wife always says you should not be on youtube you always say the wrong thing um but no the the ten commandments okay yeah because what god says is that you may not take anything within creation and make that god if you do even in your own creation that's right your mental exactly if you do that well if i do that what will you violate the commandment what does that mean yeah what does that life starts breaking down it doesn't get stuck it starts breaking down well it will it it breaks down because it gets stuck okay so so you so and tim keller actually i moved the book about this um this book counter for gods plug for tim keller um my office is such a mess because i throw things places um and he testified how messy my office is but we are wearing pants we're wearing short pants what happens if you take something within the created order and put it at the top of your hierarchy is that you can't actually i don't think you can actually function within a hierarchy because things will get stuck so i was talking i was telling you a story about in riverside church in new york city where a very prominent and successful woman pastor did not have her contact renewed contract renewed she was complaining about sexual harassment the new york times and the peace said how could this basically said how could this happen in a church where leaders walked with dr martin luther king jr yeah so sexual harassment thing was equated with the fight against it fight against racism even though dr king had some real issues with sexual harassment i mean he cheated on his wife you know some of the things that that david garrow has found recently so there's a lot going on there but it imagines that there's this implicit hierarchy that if you're woke you'll be anti-racist you'll you know be fine all of these things come together and so what happens in this situation when you take any certain element and you make it sacred you turn it into an island you actually will not be able to function as a community because what happens when your your your feminist is a racist because they're not the same thing and it's actually in jordan peterson's first biblical when he did his biblical talks he goes into the fact that one of the things that christianity did and said right off the bat was that the emperor or the king and this gets into interchurch religious things with respect to the pope no living person or even dead person see jesus isn't dead in christianity can be at the top of your hierarchy god is always a part of it which is why i leave in my horrible mess here why i have a dollar bill okay because on the dollar bill the i is above pyramid okay and it's always separate and why because once you have the thing at the top of your hierarchy within the natural order you cannot actually navigate and manage the other issues you are going to come about so you need something outside of the system on top of the system that affords you to step out of the system or even project yourself or even just hope or even just like send your tendrils out there your intuition something that's not even formed just reaching out of the system in order to reorganize and refresh and re-enliven the system and you can see this working out for example the pedophile priest scandal in the roman catholic church as if we're not going to get enough trouble for this video the pedophile priest scandal hits the roman catholic church in a particular way because their hierarchy is the church you can have protestants that are abusing children but the bible can't abuse a child yeah well you can charge the bible with giving ideas yeah yeah okay yeah but the bible itself can't but even in protestant christianity the bible isn't god the bible isn't holy even that is different from it so in christianity you set the top of your hierarchy above anything in the natural order okay so this is the tricky part and this is a little bit meta but i've seen it happen what happens when god becomes the idea of god no longer god itself but the idea of god which is a natural thing which is something that human beings have made and can pass around what when that what happens when that becomes the is there not a false god that is called god and tastes and looks and acts just like god is but just as the representative there are all the time yeah every single person has an imagination of who god is in christian theology says all of those imaginations are also tinged with sin and depravity and how do you how do you ever escape that you can never escape so you never escape it but then how do you act within it in a productive manner and i guess productive or generative or healthy i'm still trying to i'm still trying to give a name to the state of the system that is the is at the top it helps you navigate towards it but you never reach it and that's why it's fundamentally not utopian so god is a direction not a place or heaven is a is a you wouldn't say it's not a place but it is in fact a direction that's where you get your telos yeah that's where that's where you navigate towards and that's why if that's why you continue improving the system yeah because you never actually will arrive but is there not something real inside of the system inside of the inside of the religion that that makes it real to people is there not is there not room for an experience of god like an aesthetic ecstatic experience or a mystic experience and is it possible to have a church without that kind of experience or is it just pointed to no i well so god shows up in the book of isaiah in the temple and isaiah is there in isaiah chapter six and the seraphim that are around god they shout out holy holy holy the whole earth is full of his glory holy holy holy is the lord god almighty the whole earth is full of his glory there you have the two ideas holy holy holy is to say something is holy is it is separate yeah separate separate separate right so it's in hebrew three times is the most separate so a deep hole a hole is deep deep the deepest imaginable hole is deep deep deep that's how hebrew works so holy holy holy is the lord god almighty yeah so god is you'll never reach him yeah okay the whole earth is full of his glory so he's reached down right he's always he's both transcendent yeah and he's imminent okay and so you can experience god but your experience of god can never exhaust yeah or contain yeah so it can be tasted but not colonized and and i asked that to go back to the original question about the narrative and the narrative christianity or the narrative of community is there is there not something that that that needs to be alive inside that narrative that and how do you how do you foster a living experience of of the holy or or the holy holy holy and the individual in the congregate if and is it not important for somebody to feel the reality of god in order to go through all the motions of a system that puts god so far above you and so so much around you like is there not need to be a direct experience and how does one and i guess i'm because i'm bringing it into where i see verveki going with with mindfulness or there has to be a practice the narrative's not enough the system's not enough we need some sort of practice is there that in christianity and where is it now it's it's there very much is so holy holy holy so there's the top the whole earth is full of his glory you can you can bump into god all over the place you go to yosemite national park you go and walk to yosemite valley and there's god's glory okay god's glory god litters the world with his glory you can find his glory in beer you can find his glory in a good piece of cake you can find his glory in a flower you can find his glory everywhere you can you can have that you can have that experience and that sense of experience now the question is how do you respond to glory and and this gets this and and i think glory is a nice way into it because well let's let's imagine i've used this illustration before let's imagine a baker a baker you know the best baker you can imagine who bakes the best cakes you can imagine what do we mean by the best cakes these cakes are filled with glory and they're filled with glory from you know the farmer who has planted the best wheat and the dairyman who has made the best milk and the sugar and so you take all of these things that the columbian exchange has put together and it all comes together in a piece of cake and the baker here's a funny thing about glory to the degree that the baker tries to own that glory the glory is diminished the glory is enhanced however when the baker cuts the cake gives it to you oh yeah and you glow yeah glory shared is glory multiplied glory grasped hoarded glory is glory diminished yeah okay and and this is a really funny dynamic and and so this is part of the reason why christianity says that grace is a gift we receive it with open hands gifts are not taken and what this means is that the kind of transformations so okay so sin so i realize i'm the center i realize i listen to jordan peterson i realize i play way too many video games i look at too much porn i don't treat women well i should really marry my girlfriend and have kids so i gotta shape up all right so you shape up and what you realize is that there's more shaping up to do and and you keep realizing that you keep following short well what do you do with that how do you not let that how do you not let that destroy you well one way is to realize that even the movement to clean your office or to shape up your room even that is a gift to you because if it's not a gift to you if it's something you achieve now suddenly i can look down on vanderkley the porcelabu's office is a disaster yeah and now suddenly i've diminished glory between us and so it's always a gift but yet it's a weird kind of gift that i actually have to take responsibility for and turn myself towards and yet even in the process of that just like the best baker in the world the minute the baker begins to take the wrong kind of pride in that cake the glory of the cake is diminished yeah and so and now people ask questions about the hiddenness of god well god is the most humble being in the universe i mean if god would if god would show up like if god would show up and brag about how amazing yosemite valley is god would be diminished if you want to know the you know an amazing thing for a baker to do would be to you know set up his cake in grand central station just put a little sign you know here's some cake have some and let people walk up to it and you know how could i imagine that the best cake i have ever received has been given anonymously to me in a place i would never accept it so are you saying so are you saying that the appreciation of creation is a form of becoming in contact with that which is god yeah yeah and and then how does one go about refining that or how does one go about diminishing that which obscures that view and is that where we get into what ethics are and morality is and question on what's on top of the hierarchy because if you make yosemite national valley your god yeah you will destroy it it has to be a gift from something which is above and unattainable well how does that relate to to the negative things like like sin or like let's say racism again if you make if you make race the god is there not a way to make race something that is a part of of of ending racism or like like the the vanquishing of of that particular inefficient disharmonious human behavior from humanity is that not a worthy goal and where does it go wrong well racism you have to say is a subset of bias not all bias is bad if you have a bias towards loving your children loving your children is an expression of bias it's an appropriate expression of bias you love your wife when you if you get married you if you get married you take this person forsaking all others that is an expression of bias that is a good expression of bias and what happens if you say i am going to banish bias from my life well you find that in strain in brave new world where you can never say no to someone's um to someone's invitation to you because that would be biased to say no but look at everything you lose so there and again if you make anti-bias is going to be my god first of all it's going to be a terrible way to live second of all you can't actually live that way and you will destroy humanity what if your job is just to go around and convince a bunch of corporations to give you money so you can teach it to be anti-bias it's not necessarily your god it's it's your trait well and that's a that's a perfectly fine thing to do okay because racism is a problem and people people should learn how to be less racist okay but let's say well there was i remember dr house so dr house was a show yeah show um there was a guy who a guy who came into dr house and he was quite angry because he learned that certain drugs were being prescribed to black men and not white men for a particular disease and dr house explained that black men have a certain propensity to certain illnesses because of the certain traits and so this drug was appropriate to black men and he claimed that dr house was being a racist because he's selling this to black men and it's obviously got to be inferior to the drug that the white man is taking well this is a case in which bias based on race is actually a pretty good thing because there are illnesses and specific things to specific racial groups that ought to be taken into consideration and if you put anti-racism at the top of your hierarchy in exclusion of everything else you cannot have a drug that addresses illnesses predominantly in the black community so what about placing what's at the top of the human hierarchy and in terms of how do i interact with human beings in the best possible way what is that what is the top what is at the top of that it has to be god but now god see here's the here's the this gets tricky again because you rightly will say well what do you mean by god and then i'm going to answer you with the best definition that perhaps i could pull out in this moment but it will be deficient okay all right but but again if you put god at the top of the hierarchy at least you always have that space that well paul had this idea of god but paul's idea of god really is deficient i've got this better idea of god which actually functions better because if you take anything in creation and you put it at the top of your hierarchy you're going to have a problem like dr house red with that one black patient okay but what what about how i interact with somebody who is completely different than me how does how does having god at the top of that hierarchy how does that functionally work if someone interaction at like a coffee shop or just driving down the road and get home well this is this is where this is where i think listening to jordan peterson and reading someone like jared diamond is helpful because if you actually encountered someone who was completely different from you you two would probably try to kill each other because that's what human beings actually did for a long time isn't that what organisms do i guess that's exactly what organisms that are similar enough to hate everything different about each other well if you so if you went down to one of these tribes i don't know if there's any left in some jungle somewhere anyone not of the tribe was instantly attacked and it's actually a an accomplishment of culture if you can pause killing well think about it say north american indians what would have been the smartest thing they could have done the minute anybody showed up any white man showed up in a boat is kill him don't let him near why we don't know well there's these little things called germs and smallpox and influenza and well that just sounds crazy you know kill him and then the truth is what happens say in a christian scheme is that well jesus comes along and says you know here are the two rules love the lord your god with all your hearts all mind and strength love your neighbor as yourself yeah okay so you meet someone and well there's rule number two you've got to love them okay well then you have to figure out what love means okay yeah they that's an interesting inversion because you brought up the isaiah part that put god holy holy holy right and then the glory manifest and right and then jesus collapsed now collapses that into this thing called love it's no and that seems to be maybe i'm wrong it seems to be the opposite of separation yes but and what how does love clean and how does love survive that that leap of that that purely transcendent thing from that purely created thing jump to john 3 16 god so loved the world now what's interesting about john and the word world is that in the gospel of john world is almost always a negative thing the world is your world name yeah exactly that sense of it god so loves the world that he sends his son sends his one son to what to die that's what love is so that's how that's how division is overcome jesus comes and is killed by the people who receive him and then is raised again mm-hmm so the because that that rhymes with abraham's story about the courage of abraham to be told to do this completely outlandish thing which probably wasn't that outlandish because people were killing their kids all the time back then it's just kind of part of their religion then but he was told to kill that one begotten son of him his own and and then that that that was mitigated in a different way than than there was no resurrection there i guess right there was this swapping out there was this kind of magic trick right there's a and that in fact was ritualized then in hebrew sacrifice where once a year the head of the household would come and present the animal at the temple places hands on it in a sense all the sin gets transferred into the animal and the animal gets killed instead of the family okay so what what do you mean sin then well all of the shortcomings sin the opposite of love or they're in a completely different relationship than opposite sin is not satan no right sin is missing the mark sin is falling short sin is let's say gets complicated um when any of us were born our parents had some ideas about what they wanted us to be yeah and so in that scheme sin is the difference between what we've achieved and what our hopes would be okay now our parents are imperfect but in terms of sin is the potential we have never realized in god's eyes and so love is what is used to basically handle sin say well ben hasn't quite reached our yeah expectations but we love him yeah but the difficulty is okay what in terms of the missing has to be compensated for in another way for the family to actually be together and that's where sacrifice will come through it that the way that you just described that really reminds me of how you're describing like there's always a separation between the top of the hierarchy and in the hierarchy right or there's that that having that god it seems like there's that that sin is the same exact distance between god and the system and so it's this weird trap again to have this adversary that is built into the system where the system can if the system ever achieved god it would stop being the system in a way it seems like if we ever become free of sin we would stop being we would stop participating in this the story as we know it would end yeah and that's exactly what happens in the bible and we don't know what that's a good thing we don't know it is a good thing it's it showed to be a good thing in the sense of every you know their life doesn't end but this this the gap this gap ends okay what we can't conceive of is what and who we would be without it yeah we we can't conceive of that but if that gap ends and i guess i guess every every decided attempt on our part to bridge that gap ends in failure yes yes that's utopianism yes trying to bring about the end of history yes and so the message of the bible is in a sense that that gap will end and it will be something that god does because when we do it we bring actually many of our problems are failed utopian solutions yeah and how does how does sacrifice how does how does slaughtering something important or letting go of something important whether it whether it is meal by fasting or whether it is a relationship or or anything how how does that provide some sort of traction in appeasing god or bringing us closer to god or not without bridging that gap on or around it seems like there's some sort of participation of the will towards god embodied in sacrifice that seems to be safe from that utopian i am ending the world but there's still a participation i'm i'm i'm i'm making i'm cutting i'm killing something here or yeah i'm destroying something well the need for sacrifice i think can be seen in in the story of the prodigal son so you have an older brother and a younger brother the younger brother says to the father i want to cash in now everybody in the jewish village would have beat the son to death here you know that's what that's what a son deserves for making such an outrageous statement but the father doesn't do this he in fact does what the town would imagine to be the most horrible thing to in fact give the son a third of the rich man's goods he takes it into a far-off country squanders it begins to realize oh crap my life is a mess what can i do and this is where i differ from a lot of tellings of this story because when he's off far off in the field feeding the pigs he has a little speech that he develops and it's exactly the speech from the book of exodus that pharaoh says i'm going to go to my father because he's a dupe and i'm going to say oh dad i'm sorry i shouldn't have done this and um the father basically won't even won't even listen to the kid's speech throws his robe around him because the village elders are going to bar him throws his robe around him puts sandals on puts a ring on his finger kills the fattened calf and says okay where's the sacrifice in that story who has paid the sacrifice for that rebellious son the father has paid it but someone else has also taken a hit and that's the older brother because the story doesn't stop when the father welcomes the younger son the story continues because and the story is set up amazingly well because the older brother is far off in the field and the father goes out to meet the older brother who's far off in the field and the older brother says basically screw you you know i don't agree with what you've done to that that asshole he deserves you know he does not i deserve far more than him because i've done this myself and the father says you know everything that i have is yours and the older son's kind of like yeah i know can't you see that your brother your son is your brother is alive and we should celebrate okay so where does the sacrifice come from well so what happens with the israelites make lots of sacrifices the book of hebrew says you know they made lots of sacrifices none of these sacrifices were sufficient yeah what sacrifice was sufficient to welcome the younger brother the younger brother couldn't pay that sacrifice he didn't have anything he had just squandered it all um the older brother couldn't present that sacrifice because he would have to do what the younger brother did in order to have the stuff to give the sacrifice who is the only one that can actually pay the sacrifice to restore the younger brother it's the father so jesus the father pays the sacrifice so now where does sacrifice come in well misery deliverance gratitude our sacrifices are expressions of gratitude in kind in response to the sacrifice paid by the father for our reconciliation and how this is this is where it gets confusing me because jesus is at once a historical historical entity a teacher with teachings right and and and god yes and also the sacrifice yes yes and and and all all at the same time yes um and there's no contradiction it just seems like i don't it's really hard for me to compute like there's it seems like there's these different jesus's yes and which one how do you make jesus a hierarchy where's the hierarchy he plays he plays different roles and that's why jesus is a person because people can actually function um if if you're in a family you function in different roles and so jesus in fact does that and because i would argue that all of these narratives that we are using to make sense of reality are images that make sense to us of reality and it could very well be that we can't really grasp we can't exhaust the reality of the world with our minds and so we need these to basically make sense of it and so you're exactly right jesus in this story plays multiple roles and so and christian theology is full of these kinds of things so you have a trinity and they're all the father son and holy spirit are all equal in the trinity but they have what christian theologians call an economic subordination so who comes up with a term like this great but it makes it work and that's what theologians do but these all of these attempts are to try to help us understand this system but that's exactly what science does yeah but we don't need to necessarily understand the system because understanding itself comes up the works i mean i and that's why i for my one of my hierarchies is that well if god is god then then i need to i need to have a personal relationship with god that's beyond creation that's beyond my senses every instance of me explaining that would have to use terms that you did like you use cake you use the sensory experience use the term glory you used a lot of positive aspects of it but i think that even that like like i just want to point out that i'm pretty sure you're using all those things it's metaphorical that's the even though that those that there's only thing that i can really communicate or something that we can both share which would be the taste of a chocolate cake yes and so far as you're not gluten intolerant or chocolate chocolate phobic or whatever like that yes but but i wonder if if like some some sort of practice that's within christianity bridges that gap of understanding where it becomes embodied where christ becomes embodied in a relationship with the world and how you act in the world or or any other sort of i think that happens all the time maybe one of the things that i've been fascinated by and just doing a lot of thinking about lately is in fact what is what is stuff why why do we have i mean christians aren't gnostic why do we have a world with plastic in it wait christians aren't gnostic are not gnastics okay gnastics would say that this world that has plastics is only a transitional element to a world where there would be nothing material okay that's basically what a gnostic is okay a lot of christians out there are really sort of gnostic when you hear them talk about going to heaven forever that's not the christian story christian story is resurrection that's kind of bizarre because the greeks didn't like it because they said you know but everything in this world decays yeah ideas don't decay so ideas are where we're all headed an embodiment and this is where the whole earth is full of his glory every time a mother sacrifices herself for the well-forever child she embodies christ um people embody this drama this is sort of where a lot of jonathan peugeot stuff really gets handy people embody this drama all the time it's all around us the the interesting questions are why contextuality why materiality why why why this way um my hunger yeah yeah yeah the lack of things yeah well not not just the lack of things but but the the force that that compels you towards things that are i probably should drink something i didn't want to interrupt you this is my water bottle which i never wash so i'm not gonna have you grab onto that okay where were we well there there were some weeds and we were lost in them or maybe not i guess it comes to okay this is this is an interesting thing um because how do you have a society working together one way is to have an enemy another way is to have a narrative but you said that the narrative usually includes an enemy includes an enemy but doesn't make the enemy the be all end all of the entire narrative yes there has to be something beyond the enemy that the narrative is hoping for the um you know the again something that's outside something that something well i think this gets to the point of where you were going it has to be inside enough so that it can be tasted but it has to be also outside so that it's not exhausted by the tasting yeah yeah yeah yeah it doesn't just dissolve the the dragon in the hobbit the goal of the the goal of the hobbit is that the dwarves will once again have their home in Erebor the dragon is an obstacle the dragon is an obstacle to that but the dragon also is that which will test you know the characters and reveal their potential and whether they will live up to the potential so bilbo bilbo would never become bilbo without the dragon the dragon has to be a part of bilbo becoming who he can be and we see that in stories all the time the best stories are always structured that way right where the where the enemy isn't the goal or the enemy isn't the god right in a way and even overcoming the enemy alone doesn't exhaust that which the story desires and seeks after there's something there's something that that that seems dead to me about robin d angelo's theology and i don't know how to put it but when she talks about the ways in which uh well one thing i don't like is that she reduces everybody into their race with the goal of i guess liberating us from race in the end or racism but um the way that she pits one in this eternal struggle against society's lack of of love for this other group or society's insistent oppression of this other group it seems like it has all the trappings of a religion but it doesn't seem it's it seems incomplete somehow and and even even the the conversation that i had with james lindsey we didn't get into this but it seems like he's been working a lot on the religious imagination or religious psychology and showing how it pops up here and there i don't think that that's a structure that we can get away from um one it's it's it's a structure that's going to pop up no matter what but but because for whatever reason but but how do we build something that takes advantage of those in a in a positive way all those religious trappings and it seems like social justice as a religion is an incomplete religion what would separate christianity and i've asked you this several times now what what separates christianity from a dead story what what is it about the the narrative of christianity that even if it does trap everybody in it by embracing everybody it gives everybody a full life within that that context that narrative well in terms of what you just said at the end there i think that touches on why um why robin de angelo's theology is insufficient because merely overcoming racism does not mean a full life and so what you will see in in examples like this which is you have an idol which is let's say anti-racism very quickly what they have to do is scale it up and try to have a try to have an eschatology a final glorious state that is beyond anti-racism and you can see this you know for a number of years ago i started following everyday feminism because i i was fascinated by what they were doing and then i found this video where this woman basically explains well we use the word feminism but what we really mean is and then she didn't have very good words to use but i could very easily translate oh you mean the kingdom of god yeah yeah yeah you are trying to arrive at the kingdom of god and you're using anti you're using feminism to arrive there at the kingdom of god yes the only difficulty is that for many many people let's imagine an aspect like ten fingeredness okay let's imagine that our desire is to eradicate any bias against people with less than 10 fingers yeah and you're going to establish an entire religion around this well there isn't really a terrible history of bias against people with fewer than 10 fingers which you know anti-racism has but the point is your story itself is way too small to actually encapsulate everything that human beings know yeah we are interested in okay and that's part of the problem and so so the trick out of that would be something that would be intersectionality intersectionality where where you feminism links up with anti-racism links up to i guess indigenous rights links up with environmental rights i guess too though that's even a completely other order and like links up with communism and and poor people's rights and then immigration rights so you have this we're going to eventually fill out we're going to build a full utopia by bringing all the all the all the causes together and it really brings up the lord of the rings it's like like there's a super ring that we're positing where where all these other intersectional rings will eventually bow down before this utopia but but it seems like one way of of branching out of that little tiny island is to go into all these other causes and then have a i guess the progressive platform or a caucus of causes right but is that is that sufficient is that the way to to end to arrive at heaven or is it still is there something buried in that that's causing it not to reach its goal well there's two problems one problem is their purview of human life is way too small and their hierarchy is way too constricted okay because they've even beyond the cause even even one cause like even a multiple cause thing is still it's still and and so what you find in i mean jordan peterson says that ideologies are crippled religions and and what i would argue sort of like vervecky does is that so john vervecky as he was getting into these later things he notes that what happens sort of as christianity is is crumbling in the west people try new things to replace it so communism comes about and capitalism comes about and all these things come about to try to to replace christianity and they really don't work part of the reason they don't work is that they're way too new so even if you look at say a religion like buddhism buddhism you know goes all the way down and says well what's our problem well suffering is our problem yeah and so a universal concept that's a much that's a you can that's a much bigger concept than all of these other little issues that will be looking at yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just so then so that's the one problem the problem of purview that they're not they're not recognizing all of the problems of humanity and and how they're pitching it is just way too small yeah for all the problems that we have yes and in fact most of these problems are limited to a particular strain of they're projecting it out into the world but go to other places in the world and explain it to them and they'll look at you like micro what yeah exactly it just makes no sense i mean it barely it barely leaves the twitter sphere i mean it doesn't so you got the problem of purview yeah the second problem you have is capacity to fix it and which for me as i watch these movements invade the church i very much see this as a different gospel because okay so i'm so i'm i'm racist i'm a Calvinist i say oh okay yeah i get that uh what's your solution to my racism well you have to own your privilege and own your racism okay i did that because in fact i not only own my bigotry i own everything okay it's like when you're playing a kid and you i've got this invisible against everything shield that's what Calvinism says i'm totally depraved so keep going so listen to me okay and then what you say to me is because of your whiteness you can never actually know how to do this right okay so why should i spend time listening to you because you're forced to because you signed up to this implicit bias training so you're there anyway well i'll probably i mean there's there's no there's no solution to racism in their world and there's not actually a god who can grant grace and this also our god who can grant forgiveness our god who can bring reconciliation so there's a problem of purview and there's a problem of insufficient remedy okay can there be a secular form of grace then that's something that communism failed at right grasping like can there be a a theology a theology that that works a secular theology that works without a dispensation or something from beyond the human world i've seen people try dispensation so i know the story there was a young woman very idealistic woman who was working with a group of people and they decided they wanted to throw a hawaiian themed party okay and this person goes to a a university and thought that this was cultural appropriation because none of her co-workers were hawaiian and so how can you find sanction to throw a hawaiian themed party find a hawaiian person to grant you permission to throw this hawaiian theme party and i heard this and i said well what happens if another hawaiian person says no i object you're appropriating my culture who is going to who is going to say which is more hawaiian to gain sanction for this hawaiian themed party can we have a party with pineapple that doesn't have a hawaiian theme i mean i mean this gets crazy yeah yeah yeah yeah and so what i don't see this this shows the deficiency of their universe because bell hooks can grant you know absolution um you know who is the authority in the hierarchy that can say it's okay well you're always going to find somebody else who's who's trying to climb the top and is and the way they can gain status is by saying bell hooks said that wasn't racism but i say it is and these things will go on forever and again you don't have something above the system that will finally in the eschaton no oh no okay no not the end practice judgment but you keep on getting a taller and taller system right until it completely collapses right or breaks down just that will warfare it seems like it brings to to mind niches will to power like the will to power is itself the manifestation of transcendence is that i'm going to try to dominate the system and and he even talks about like like resentment as a way of controlling the narrative and stuff so is there is again is there a possibility or is the function of theology is to put into a variety of terms the story or or or theory uh a aspect of something that is supernatural that's grace that comes from outside of the system that comes from outside of my experience that then enters into my experience and and saves me or bridges that gap between me and that which i cannot bridge without destruction without destroying myself right and how does how does how does grace so i i just wonder if if how do you sell grace to people who say there's no god well people well for one thing i don't sell grace oh no discount by definition it's free um the what i often find with people is that okay so what does theology do theology christian theology in the sense of a a fully manifest world religion has within it most or all of the things that a human being needs to as the hyper catacomb says live and die happily and when it says that it doesn't mean happy it means blessedly in a full rich sense and and to have that there are certain aspects of your theology that have to manifest there needs to be an end state um so the question that you might ask is when will racism finally be put to rest the difficulty that you have in a secular world is the container of a secular world itself already has a story and the story is human beings do stuff until the heat death of the universe and then everything that has been you know that you have known goes away that then impacts how we live our individual stories in different ways and so what happens with other religions is that they they look for ways out of some of these dead ends and and i think part of what we've seen in contemporary culture what we've seen in terms of the meaning crisis the work of john vervecki and jordan peterson uh victor frankl many others really in many ways the whole 20th century has in many ways the whole 20th century has been a quest for this which is is there any hope beyond death and death isn't just physical death it scales all the way through yeah yeah um and in a way your question about grace is grace is the answer that there is hope and it comes from outside the system is it not also an opening of the system of preparing a space inside the system for that to happen for for the transcendence of the system you can't you can't know it if it doesn't somehow also get manifest within the system yeah and that's why that's why every mother who sacrifices for the welfare of her child you know reveals god to the world yeah so god is there how do you pay attention to that how do you pay attention to god how do you listen for grace or glory or what there's i there are many ways people do it all the time and even if they don't know it i think every time augustin had this idea that basically not just augustin but so the whole earth is full of his glory in a sense god clothes himself with the universe and so when you walk into yosemite valley there it is and people will in fact seek it i'm reading a really interesting book right now on basically the age of addiction where and he's going through the history of of pleasure i read a really interesting book 1493 talks about the columbian exchange basically the eastern seaboard got colonized in the south partly because nicotine and tobacco is such a potent drug i mean without that we don't know that the lower colonies ever would have gotten started without they were growing drugs and the world was hooked on tobacco that's what happened well sugar and tea caffeine yeah all all all along so is there glory in nicotine yeah probably is there glory in tobacco yeah probably there's in fact glory all over the place now what's the difference between enjoying a nice beer and being an alcoholic two and a half it's it's a it's a difference that we know but to actually you can describe it but in a sense we we stand before it with a little bit of awe and terror but right there is in a sense the difference between salvation and destruction in some ways because there's glory in that beer yeah but what happens when um what what is what happens in addiction when the beer the glory of the beer becomes your terror yeah i mean someone sat in that i have a picture of a guy used to sit right in that chair and my i used to clean my office every week back in those days i gave that up years ago but he took a he was an alcoholic was homeless lived across the street he just came into my office one day because homeless people know they can come here and sit and talk to me which is usually what they want to do and he just plopped the can of beer right on my desk and says my life is in that can oh there's his god and that's the story of an idol and that's the story of glory there's enough glory in beer that it could capture him but it's his twisted relationship with glory that was destroying his life and in fact like many homeless people he got hit with a car crossing florin road one day and he went to the hospital and they patched up his hip and they let him out and he used to watch him sleeping in the weeds in the bushes in the church cross street making his way around the neighborhood in a walker with broken hips and it's like this is this is a um this is a story this is a story that reveals a lot of the world this is humanity in our relationship with glory so you find glory all over the place and glory is in a sense something that you know pleasure is is in a sense a navigator for you towards god that sounds weird because you would think no it's very hedonistic in a way yeah well there's there's a calvinist preacher a celebrity preacher named john piper who has worked that vein pretty of course he'd be a celebrity yeah peddling that christian hedonism yeah yeah i mean why why peddle what you can't sell grace anyways but you can sell like feeling good about that second beer well but it but it's but he's not he's actually not a prosperity preacher but he makes the point that you know god is most satisfied when you are most satisfied in god and part of the reason part of the reason religion has been probably the original drug for human beings is exactly this there's so much pleasure that can be derived in religion and it's so i mean it's so distillation in an arrangement of pleasures i mean if you just look at the catholic church and and i don't mean this derogatorily because i when i go at least to europe and i visit those cathedrals i can feel the the worship in there but they have all they they meet and they interact with all of the senses that's right that's right the one of the most um one of the most effective evangelism strategies in the united states today are prisons people go into prisons and take away you know they're gonna have to smuggle drugs and they're gonna have to decide to have sex with you know whether or not you know they'll be gay for the stay whatever if they're gonna get pleasure in prison how come so many people go into prison and come out religious why it's because they found the pleasure in it when all other pleasures were denied them they found the pleasures in religion yeah and what what do you think those pleasures are they're self-discipline that's part of it there's pleasure and self-discipline there's pleasure and insight there's pleasure i mean look at the look at the monks the the um even the the desert fathers who in the early christian period you know would go out into the desert and starve themselves yeah they did it for pleasure yeah you said well what kind of weird pleasure is that well you haven't fasted for three months starts racking up it's there's there's a lot people pursue religion for the pleasure of it okay but there's it seems like there's something different that you're pointing to you're pointing beyond just pleasure but you're using pleasure you're pointing beyond even glory but you're using glory and i wonder if there's been moments in your life where vervekis touched on this um like these super conscious moments that he's had in meditation or something is or and and have you ever experienced something that that's beyond words that that you you've felt a greater glory or greater plane of existence or have you however you say that and then when you come back how has that affected you or how has that changed you and has it made the gospel more real to you yes all and then that happens regularly happens in christian worship happens in prayer happens when i make videos i mean part of the reason i make videos i've kind of paused conversations because they're taking so much time because when i make my own videos you know insight is is part of pleasure and and and that's a religious experience the guy who they made the movie church of fire about he ran in this weird way it's shown only a couple times in the movie he had his head back and his his mouth open and people like why did he run that way he said you know god made me fast and when i run i feel his pleasure that's why he ran and so my my world is my world is full of pleasure and even when you know i mentioned i talked about daniel who's out of prison and back in the neighborhood and you know just sitting down with daniel and watching the the strange manifest hilarities of of his incredibly sad situation there's even pleasure in that in seeing how these things come together you know some pleasures part of what happens in a life of religious practice is that you you you find these pleasures more and more regularly and more and more easily you see them all over the place you see god's glory um you know so so we had a meetup last night and at the end of the meetup we have this little routine that we usually do we take a picture at the end of it which kind of gets people out of the circle and then they can kind of break up into little groups and i looked up and people were all having these little conversations all around the room and i just had a vision of god's glory where all these people are and then you might say well you know what kind of glory is that i i see it as an amazing thing where people are having meaningful conversations and um and enjoying it and i've seen over the long haul this has brought really good things into people's lives many of them atheists that are incredibly surprised they'd be doing this with a christian minister in a christian church yeah but i see god's glory in that and it's all over the place so the i guess that there is a a solution to the hobbled religion of social justice is that peterson's term a ideology is a crippled religion yeah hobbled maybe crippled is politically incorrect let's define another word hobbled we're on we're not on a disabled religion no a religion of disability is this not right sure i i liked what you said about the the the conception of life as mirrored in what they're trying to rid life of or what they're fighting is so small like and and i really felt that too in these privileged workshops where we would just have to talk i when i first entered into the privileged workshop world at evergreen state college and we'd have to like play this game and like put up all of our our vectors of of awesomeness that we didn't actually deserve because they were just given to us or disparity you know whatever the opposite of awesome is i'm like why don't you guys just talk did christianity not do it right like enough like why don't you just talk about charity yeah why not talk about peace why not talk about like love isn't that what you're really trying to do why dress it up and all this stuff and and i wonder if that's because they can't they can't get funding for that maybe there's there's some core impulse of charity that they're trying to to give but the the language itself obscures that and then allows for all this other weird false stuff to creep in because they're not just using these old terms that my tradition has given rise to and a lot of people have hammered at and checked for right the chruden peterson has a stock story that he tells in the bishop barron video recently where a student comes up to him and says why don't we just tell the perfect archetypal story instead of having harry potter okay yeah and and and peterson says because these stories bring it closer and peterson is right there's a real habit now so i have lots of friends who are not christians and into new age or atheism or all these kind of things and so there's a there's a real what has happened in our secular society said well we're not going to talk about jesus love we're just going to talk about love and we're going to talk about and so we're going to we're going to use all of these words that any particular religion has been stripped off of and in that way we'll get around the problems of pluralism okay you that's exactly the same issue as this purely archetypal story in that it what the what the story gives it is context and locality and nearness that's right and so so if i say racism and i could say well okay let's throw out the word racism let's just use bias because okay let's let's move up the hierarchy and say okay you've got racism sexism homophobia all of those are examples of bias so let's throw out all those words and let's just use bias and let's make bias our enemy well right right away as i mentioned earlier you're going to become aware that you have a problem in your hierarchy yeah that you need bias i just you know there's more water in that thing you need bias do you need sin in a way i mean that is a really complicated question on one level in order for the story to make sense you need an enemy so you need sin in that but i'm saying do do you not need that gap do you not need that missing of the mark do you not need imperfection in order for the story to matter in order for your own life to matter if in order for you to be anything other than a purely archetypal typical every person do you not need all that stain and discomfort and failure constantly this is a very old very long very passionate theological debate that has crept up repeatedly in christianity how many churches has it spawned just by the arguments that have had it's not been that type of debate but it's a big one and my best answer to that is we don't know any other world beyond this one of sin which says i can't answer that question because the question then goes into god's why is there sin in the world that gets into theodicy is sin in the world to make us better could we not be better without sin okay but you but you still you can't tell your story without it right that's exactly the answer but okay we can't tell a story without it okay because there would be no story it's a part of the dynamics of the universe right and it's and it's exactly part of the so when you get into places in the bible where they want to talk about what will life be after sin is resolved yeah you get things like well there'll be no more tears there'll be no more suffering you'll get a lot of negations yeah but not negations of there will be no more laughter but that's implied right well that's you know and some old testament ones have you know when it's it's really hard for us to conceive of a story without an adversary yeah or a gap to be overcome right challenge right right okay and chaos in some ways functions in that so in the in the in the book of revelation there's the new jerusalem and there isn't any sea and that symbolically chaos will no longer and everybody's like i love the ocean why would get rid of that dolphins that's right it's really marina phobic it's it's a symbolic message that chaos will no longer you know you'll no longer you'll no longer be war and drought and everything's a desert well this is this is i mean the the metaphor itself breaks down when you try to break the metaphor right and so to ask a question like well what happens when there's no rival what happens when there's no challenge what happens when there's no gap and i would have to say i can't conceive of a story without those things i can theoretically imagine that let's see this is where i go is that's the kind of question that god can handle not me okay and so that's some would say ah you're punting well okay yeah what what happens when you get to fourth down and you know you're not going to make it you punt yeah but how do you how does one how does one embrace their sin then in the right way or i guess acknowledge it as kind of like not only as an adversary but kind of like as a as a guide through life and and and in in one say in one sense perhaps to see sin everywhere is to also see the the overreaction to glory right is to see it kind of as a friend like somebody that's so in second corinthians paul is plagued by something and we don't know what it is a lot of people talk about the thorn the thorn in the yeah and he paul has had a mate paul talks about having amazing revelatory experiences where he's drawn up into third heaven and he's given all of these spiritual gifts and he's been given all of this stuff and so he's you know okay so god is going to you know grant someone a request it should be the apostle paul and so god paul says okay can you take care of this thing for me and god says no my grace is sufficient for you i'm gonna leave that with you and it's like but but isn't you being god mean you're supposed to and god says no being god means i get to write the story and if i'm going to i'm going to leave this as part of your story and you're gonna have to live with it which is finally a tremendous act of submission on behalf of paul on behalf of paul is to accept his yeah his thorn story whatever that is yeah and and in a way i guess the acceptance is the freedom from it yeah yeah and because here's an ironic thing again if you make if you make your whole life about that thorn it now functions as that idol yeah and so you have to give that up too and there is and there's tremendous freedom in that and you you you regularly find people and this is i forget what i was listening to someone it might have been your conversation with james and and someone basically once you have that island once you say this i won't give up yeah i see people like that all the time you know maybe they were abused as a child and they will never give up their even after the person who harmed them is dead they will never give up the anger against that person and talk to a shrink about that and they'll say yeah that's that's they're going to ruin their life this is why forgiveness is so powerful because you you go to that person mentally if they're no longer there and you say i forgive you i release you from the evil you did against me and now you're free so in a sense okay let's wrap it up because we have a meetup coming yep um in a sense we started out with a problem of how does how do we make a cohesive society but in talking about social justice they have a very noble goal of trying to save the world and and that i wouldn't say is not your goal too like you are you are participating in a project of salvation and i don't mean to make it grand maybe you'll try to run away from that but it really does seem that that's part of the purpose of having this building around you and doing the work that you do and it it seems like there's there's some sort of qualitative difference in the way that you interact with that you do your work and and and it comes about in the stories that you tell with the homeless people where you recognize with some distance and some humor their situation and you don't condescend to the tragedy of their life but you it's almost like you embrace that tragedy it's just a part of them and and you accept that and in that acceptance do you think that that through doing that do you do this consciously um in doing that is that the better way to go than than to pity them or to to merely give them the shelter of your concern they don't let me so daniel is particularly eloquent about this i'll be sitting and talking to daniel i'll say daniel you know why don't we you know why don't you let me help you get into why don't you let me help you get off the street don't try to save me that's what he says to me don't try to say but he keeps on coming here yeah so what is salvation is he looking for yeah so he's looking for something he's looking for friendship he's looking for someone he can talk to he what he doesn't want to lose is his freedom and for him his freedom means living this incredibly self-destructive life and part of what i what you learn i mean a lot of this for me goes back to being in the dominican republic where you go there as a north american missionary with a very generous mission agency behind you you go to desperately poor people for whom just a few dollars can mean a world of difference in their lives and you very quickly realize just how impossible it is to save human beings from themselves these structures from all kinds of things and so no social justice warriors i i they often have great hearts because they want to make the world a better place what they are is naive about human beings you you will not banish someone's racism in any of the ways that they talk about then maybe it'll help but racism will not be banished neither will bias it's it's these are you know these things are too great and they're they will warp other things you know there are how many pieces of literature written about some missionary who went someplace to try to save a group of people and completely screwed up his family yeah it's what we do and and almost every almost every salvation project is to rescue us from someone else's former salvation project so you know the whole i mean racism was invented to resolve certain things for the people of the time yeah ddt antibiotics um you know internal combustion engine electricity goes forever on one level you are advocating for an utter fatalism but there's something else that you're advocating yes yes you're not saying give up no i don't believe i don't believe we should give up that's right that's right and misery deliverance gratitude and all my servants sermons that way you cannot see this is the basic format of protestant christianity is that god has saved the world and we said well why is it all screwed up he's not done saving it well god has saved you well why am i still all screwed up he's not done saving you well then what should i do you should act like your savior well how did my savior act he loved others he lived he lived your welfare at my expense that's what he did that's what it means to love wait say that again your welfare your your welfare at my expense that's what love means if i say ben needs this ben says paul i need 10 bucks to get back home i give you 10 bucks that's your welfare at my expense 10 bucks is a little thing but maybe yeah there might be reasons why you asked me for 10 bucks and i don't give it to you um love is really complicated yeah but you christianity basically says god has saved the world it is not yet saved christians until that point have to act like their savior how does their savior act well you look at jesus on a cross okay so no i'm christians are should be the most optimistic people around because i'm not in any the least naive the most optimistic i would hope so some weird kind of intersection of those two things because people are as jordan peterson says chimps filled with snakes that's how we are he's very calvinist in my opinion which is probably why i started listening to him maybe you know what he he he tries to keep his belief system as that postulated thing over there right which is right very wise maneuver to do what he's doing yeah yeah but i know i'm i'm very optimistic even though um i i'm not a climate changed outer i think we're probably cooking the world and i think it could be disastrous i mean when i hear christians say well god won't let such and such bad thing happen i think well there was the dark ages there was the bubonic plague um you know most all those folks were good catholics when they got wiped out um there were i mean bad things happen in the world all the time and could we be cooking the world for a really bad thing yeah hope not stuff yeah stuff doesn't mean you're going to become a gnostic just to stop the end to get out of the end of the world i guess gnastics are the most dangerous people because well you have to they're running from something they know because if you know the gospel of judas jesus real problem was that he had a body and so if you really want to liberate people get them out of their bodies yeah okay yeah so yeah well but we can do that with what we're doing right now with some dr goggles and you know a couple of ounces of ketamine or whatever it takes that's right but now i hope for the um my my hope is in a new heavens and a new earth and that doesn't mean we shouldn't um we shouldn't try to do right by this earth i think that's just stewardship yeah and it's love well it's a it's a form of renewal is it not yeah yeah well let's wrap it up okay thank you i don't know you're gonna cut it that's freddy have you never watched the freddy
