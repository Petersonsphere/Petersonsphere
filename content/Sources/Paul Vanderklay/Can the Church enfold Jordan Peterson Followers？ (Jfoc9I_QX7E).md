 Totally. Well if I'm recording it then see I know you. Yeah we have to kind of introduce ourselves again don't we? That's right I don't introduce myself because by this time I think most people watching my channel know a little something about me but why don't you introduce yourself? Sure yeah so my name is Nathan I just moved from Seattle to Spokane which is Spokane's about 280 miles east of Seattle. I lived in Seattle for the last six years. I worked as a registered nurse and I just married my beautiful wife who's a medical student over here in Spokane so that's kind of what I'm up to. I went down the Jordan Peterson rabbit hole about probably two years ago or so and I've been digging deeper ever since and then I stumbled across across Paul's channel at one point and it seemed like a really natural fit because of my background. I you know have a bit of background in the church as well as specifically the Reformed Church and stuff and so it seemed like someone I should reach out to. Awesome and so yeah Nathan and I've been getting to know each other a little bit. I run a little program called Sierra Leadership Network that that Nathan Nathan jumped into and so yeah so what do you have on your mind today Nathan? I saw you on the list I thought oh wonder what what do I Nathan wants to do? What's he got on his mind? Well I know when I first emailed you I said something about you know wanting to talk about you know the real reason why non-christians don't want to go to church. Particularly you know college educated non-christians don't want to go to church and after our conversation with our most recent SLN conversation I kind of realized I really just wanted to talk about exactly what we talked about SLN you know what the vision for the church going forward and how it fits in with this with this Jordan Peterson phenomena and I thought your video today particularly with Tim Keller was very like salient to the conversation so so yeah I think there's I sort of wrote out like a bunch of I had this ongoing list it's like four pages or something that I've written of like different questions and things I might want to talk about with Paul and I'm now I'm like I'm looking at all of them and I'm like now now it's just the paradox of choice I have like no idea which one to start with. On the bright side though you know we save a lot of time here because I don't even have to show you my kitchen you already saw it. This is true this is true. Exactly. So well why don't we start out with that main topic I mean what are your thoughts? Why now I have you see see in a lot of ways I am it's really hard for me to know a lot about this because there has not been a period in my life where I have not gone to church probably nearly 52 weeks a year. I go when I was a foreign when I was a foreign missionary that was weirder because that was just a much different situation but right in the United States if church is open I want to be there I love church. Yeah. So is that the case for you is that how you've lived your life? Well for the most part I think definitely like up until age 18 you know I was like four times a week if not more you know particularly in high school I was really really involved and I was pretty convinced that I had a cult of ministry and stuff and I was really involved with the youth group I played on the youth band I played on the worship band like I mean I was the kid who wanted to be involved in everything and be the Jesus kid you know and you know but come age 18 and moving to college and stuff I definitely it was not the case after that I went to a Christian University Seattle Pacific University and certainly you know it's definitely a Christian University it wasn't ashamed of its identity but there was something about not having an automatic community that I have friends and family around that just made me not want to go you know and and every church that I encountered seemed to be like the purest instantiation of the stereotype of an overly conservative church or the purest instantiation of the stereotype of an overly progressive church and it just you know none of it none of it attracted me at all and further you know on a practical sense it's like I couldn't with my class schedule you know I was studying really hard for you know trying to get into the nursing program within this university and it just wasn't practical to be involved in any church on more than a once-a-week basis and I don't like being involved in a church on only a once-a-week basis like I'm actually part of the church you know and so I probably spent I spent almost the entirety of my time in Seattle not going to church anywhere consistently and you know and the other thing I just said about why I wasn't going to church it's like I was telling myself that for the entirety of church until you know I finally you know I got married this summer and I moved to Spokane and I look you know my wife and I looked at each other and we both kind of said it at the same time that like we really need to get involved in a church once we move you know if not just for practical purposes like we need to meet people you know we know nobody and you know fast forward three months of consistent church attendance later and I realized that the real reason I didn't want to go to church was because I didn't I guess internally I didn't consider it worth it to be interacting with people who I consider to be less intelligent than me I guess you know and I kind of had this epiphany at I started my own Jordan Peterson I met up here in Spokane and it was like three weeks ago or so I was talking with two people who showed up and they kind of said the same thing that a lot of you know Jordan Peterson folks say and that's that you know I'm not a Christian and I didn't go up in the church but Jordan Peterson has really convinced me of the value of church and I kind of want to go but I don't feel like I've had the right experience and I don't know how to get involved in it and I don't understand what's going on and I just kind of said you know it's funny because it was a great illustration of like of the fact that we're not transparent to ourselves because I found myself saying like I realized that I the real reason I didn't want to go to church was that I had disdain for people I considered less intelligent than me you know that's the reason you didn't want to go to church so it's kind of like I'm telling another person this and I'm telling myself that at the same time and then you realize that's a really I don't like people who think that way what an elitist I am exactly I mean it really just made me cringe at myself like really like that's why you didn't want to go to church to actually think about people you know I mean it's not as if like I mean it's not as if all of a sudden my frustrations with you know certain things that go on in church you know banishes overnight like just last week at Bible study I think we wasted like 20 minutes with one of the members really wanted to make the case that Halloween was the most evil thing in the world and we just couldn't get him off of it and it's like oh my goodness like we just move on this is ridiculous but like but my reaction in terms of like really like not wanting to be around that person ever and actually going out of my way to not be around those kinds of people at all and like they have they have no value to me whatsoever they can't edify me whatsoever like that's just a bad that's a bad mindset is what that is yeah it's it's evil let's oh yeah it is it is it is from the pit of hell and it is inside of you Calvinism and so I'm like church isn't for me it's not for me at all you know I mean it's for me and and everyone everyone else you know and so all levels of the hierarchy get to be get to be equal at church and and there's value in and like intentionally actually being around those people I mean that's like but that's the classic criticism that people have of like the you know the college-educated progressives is that they they talk all day about the you know I'm talking about the far-left progressives I'm not talking like the moderates but you know they have something they talk all about their compassion for the poor but they absolutely cannot stand being around them and so instead they just they just like programs to help the poor so that they don't have to be right you know it's like it's it's classic but it's like a little did I know that you know I was you know I was I was embodying that perfectly I think everyone should be in church but I personally don't need it congratulations exactly exactly yeah yeah and well it was it was funny also to watch kind of the reaction of the of the people who I was talking with at this at this meetup you know when I said that their reaction was more or less huh yeah I guess I'm just not there yet like in terms of like yeah I I can kind of identify with that you know and it was really like refreshingly honest like they were they were very honest about they were like yeah I kind of kind of feel that way about it too you know so it was yeah it was interesting and it just shows like how much you know and it shows how much of a difficult position people like you are in where it's like you're challenged with crafting a message that can speak at the highest levels of complexity and the lowest levels of simplicity as well you know so well I that's off to people like you most preachers I think are almost always preaching to themselves because I I want to preach sermons that I won't be bored with mm-hmm there that's a there's a real selfishness in there and and you know I have to stop and think now I'm I that actually this sermon is for them there and yeah and so well that's kind of one side the other side is oh those people out there this is what they really need to hear and that's that pastors who do that oh that just gets awful fast and yeah because ever everybody everybody just gets a smell of that sanctimonious attitude mm-hmm they just don't have anything to do with it but yeah well and that's kind of the difficulty too it seems is that like the other side of that is that people are also very allergic to anybody telling them something you know anybody bringing any kind of moral information from outside of themselves you know it kind of goes back to the yeah because I mean one and I find this with myself a lot I spent enough time outside of church and immersed in you know the more outside pop culture where I didn't you know it was definitely time where I didn't actively identify as a Christian I didn't not identify as a Christian but I didn't I wasn't embracing it as like you know a fourth you know a foremost part of my identity and I find even now I find myself really like I mean last week at church like pastor might gave a like a Calvinist sermon I mean it was like a real stereotypical Calvinist sermon going through the Ten Commandments and like this is what's moral and this is what's not let me tell you and I sat there squirming in my seat the whole time you know I'm just like I know he's right but I don't like this so much because he's moralizing and it's like well I mean you could you can fairly also create you can also fairly critique the certain aspects of the delivery but the end of the day I feel like it's probably a part of the secret sacred self inside me that doesn't want to what it doesn't want to let go of what I really think is the true origin of morality with you know so so yeah I think that's that's part of it too that's that's that's very I remember Neil Neil planting who was our our Systematics prophet Calvin seminary one of the tidbits that he said he said you know sometimes sometimes when you preach sermons you should just tell people what's wrong you just you should say sometimes you should just be clear you know what adultery it's it's wrong wrong it really is and do it and if you're doing it now you should stop instead of any preachers then you'll go the sermon on the mount well if you're lost so we can all feel bad about lust but yeah that's true but also adultery it's wrong and stop it you know there's a value to that yeah and I think you know when I when I think about you know what Peterson has done he has found a way to do morality with people and in a very effective way but also without really necessarily triggering he's kind of trees he's clearly triggered the left because you know but for a lot of other folks he's the danger of that is always self-righteousness because you can if you if you if you help make if you how can I say that if you encourage a bunch of people and their self-righteousness you've also lost because that is the so you've got the law and it's the violation of the law is dangerous but also the compliance with the law is also spiritually dangerous yeah and you know it's the it's turtullian and the two sides of the horse it's Tim Keller does that real well with the prodigal sons there's the the sin of the younger son and the sin of the older son the older brother so yeah exactly exactly we're such good sinners we're so good at it even even when we're following the rules now you see you and I are really gonna I talked to so few Calvinists in this little journey of mine that you know you and I can really nerd out Calvinism what is that are you just determinists yeah exactly exactly no I think Peterson has really what you're getting out there in a sense is really that Peterson has kind of perfected the art of you could say it this way I guess yeah Peterson has really perfected the art of laying out you know a broad moral framework and allowing people's internal consciences to just convict themselves it's like they don't need anybody else to really stand out there and and preach towards them you know he's taken and that kind of it's an elimination of what you described there and that's that's a power dynamic that's a power dynamic between the older brother and the younger brother and the older brother and prodigal son is is mad that the younger brother isn't getting you know that essentially the hierarchy is being flipped and flattened through radical race right and and he's he's mad about that you know and yeah I mean Peterson has kind of taken the the any social power that the convict or might might gain from that he's kind of taken out of the equation you know and and I mean that well maybe that's what the church needs to do tell me Paul what do you think how would how would we go about doing that more well it's so funny because you know by the proverbial basement dweller that's that's part of what my you know when I when I talked to my wife about Jordan Peterson stuff and you know the proverbial basement dweller the guy who is literally living in his mother's basement California we don't have basement so he's he's in the house some other place but he's he doesn't have a job he spends his time on YouTube and video games and and it's not like mom hasn't been nagging the crap out of that dude you know about how many different things forever and Jordan Peterson comes along and you know thousands of them are like oh well maybe this isn't okay but maybe I should clean up the basement and and not play video games 15 hours a day yeah and smoke all this pot and eat all those Cheetos and and you know drain my mother's life worrying about the lostness of her child mom's been nagging at him forever yeah and then mom then mom might get then mom might get another attitude like oh so I deal with this forever and this Canadian psychologist comes along and now you act yeah it's like what is it about that right I mean I think a little bit of it is that like it's it's really obvious that Pearson really genuinely wants the best for them you know and is able to say that in a way that like I mean I guess there's something probably inherent about it coming from the mother that's not gonna work you know it's nagging there's there might also be just Peterson's better at saying it in a way that makes them you know realize it's like I really do want the best for you and why don't you go make something out yourself because you're pretty pathetic right now you know yeah it's also something that you know this is a liability of my profession sometimes the preacher is like the mother and depending on you know how you grew up and where you grew up the preacher the preacher's voice is like the mother's voice well of course you're gonna give me crap about you know wasting my life you're the preacher that's your job so I'm not gonna listen to you it's so cynical well really though it is it's so cynical like people have like the baseline presupposition that people take before they walk into a church is that like is that the preacher just wants you to give money to the church and it's all about the church the church the church and it's like I understand why they like like hey fair enough man we're not without sin you know like and there are preachers like that exactly they are out there oh yes I could name names and and I would never well it's easy to pick on in because he's on TV but I know it's that is it that is a real thing and it's a temptation for preachers not to use people and it's it's a continual temptation to love people and not use them it's basic for all of us but yeah exactly exactly well let's talk about the about the divine though between so there we've got these people who were meeting in our meetups and I think you and I are both having it you know similar experiences here and they're they're pretty comfortable with God number one you know the union God the evolutionary God the God that emerges from culture from the bottom up and now they're staring at church and the problem is I feel like what a lot of them are trying to do is they're trying to go to church and this is what we don't want we don't want to we don't want to train smart people to go to church and translate all of God in a God number two into God number one you know every word that the preacher says this is what Tim was talking about at us at the SLM meetup the other day is that like you know you could just walk in and translate every word that the preacher says into Jordan Peterson language and then and and and we don't want like that doesn't it doesn't seem to me that that's the goal because that seems to be like to me that points to a desire to bring it back to a reductive materialism where it's like oh yes indeed I can maintain my materialist framework and just look at it with an evolutionary context and see all this stuff is evolutionary necessary because of its evolutionary necessary I can maintain the materialist view of the world and also live in this community sort of and it's like but you're doing mental gymnastics you know all day long for it you know and it doesn't seem to me that that's the that's the goal and we should we should also point out like the point why the point of trying to preserve the materialist framework in my mind would be that you would also trying to preserve the the original problem of the secret sacred self the idea that the true morality comes from within you and that seems to be that that like morally speaking if you want to look at it from like a really social sociological perspective of what causes a society to adopt good morals versus bad morals it seems to me that the separation between like the origin of the morals from from yourself like the origin of the morals being whatever it is it's like whatever it is that's making me do the right thing it's not me you know it's external you know and it's it's not me that that's the point right and that gets back to the Jewish idea of you know not making a graven image of God and not speaking the name of God because when you name things and carve things you're protecting yourself so if we're trying to avoid that then we can't let we can't let the Jordan Peterson project being like a compatible ism between Christianity and and pure materialism so how else do we bridge that gap I guess is the question oh so I was having a I was having a conversation with Adam at think club and actually Adam and I have we've talked once on the air but we we swap tweets and emails and offline and he's he's terribly fun to talk to and so he listened to my conversation with Glenn Scrivner from the UK and and he said well I you know I've got some insight into you know Jordan Peterson's attractiveness he said you know he he he he does everything he does without getting into the supernatural and I hand it's not totally true but there there is a degree of truth to that because obviously especially for people who are coming over who Jordan Peterson is raiding from the Sam Harris camp the supernatural that they're they're really they're really touchy about the woo so it's like you know if I said if I sent some D Proch Chopra here I'm out so right and so that's that's an issue that's obviously an issue all the time with church when I so I often have often I've had enough situations where especially when I first started doing videos I'd have people just they they'd see my videos in Sacramento they're into Jordan Peterson so they're they're gonna stop by church and you can you can very quickly tell the disappointment because I was hoping this would be like going to a Jordan Peterson lecture on the Bible but it ain't you know the exactly yeah the pastor is only gonna talk for 30 minutes then he got all this music and praying and stuff which so you know a good number of people go to the meetup and there's no music or praying or even a sermon there at the meetup there's just conversation but but part there are a number of issues I think that are involved with that part of the the the materialist vision is a motivated vision and it's motivated by the lust for domination where where we if I can if if I can penetrate the inner workings of the world and know it all the way through like I can let's say know the engine of a Volkswagen Beetle mm-hmm I can master it and it is it is the last chapter of CS Lewis's the abolition of man it is the it is the dream of perfect mastery the problem with it is that very quickly it philosophically it runs into it a problem almost immediately because okay I am mastering it okay what's I right you can't master yourself or you know there you have a circularity so that's that's one of the issues I think another issue is the difference between the difference between a hooker and a wife and or maybe I mud there's an old the original Star Trek had an episode I mud where this guy built women for his planet and they're all you know 1965 beautiful and and and then you know the start they the enterprise comes along and the dude wants out well why you've got you've you've created the Stepford women here but and it's exactly the same problem in that to church is more like a wife than this robot that you have constructed it's filled with people who are going to be annoying and inconvenient and make selfish demands and and occupy your small group for 20 minutes with a tirade about the evils of Halloween that is what church is about and people are like well I don't want any of that I just want YouTube well here's the thing about YouTube YouTube is more like the hooker or the robot or the Stepford wife that you can click on and click off you master it being a Christian is being a slave you are you are beneath God in the hierarchy he is your master and he tells you what to do yeah and right there is the entire story of Christianity because we don't like that arrangement we want to be on the top of the hierarchy we want it we want we think we want that but it you know I mud the dude mud wanted off the planet with this Stepford wives so and and so then when you get into church it's like the pre the sermon was boring today the worship leader picked crappy music I have to sit by and actually CS Lewis writes about this dynamic a lot because talk about I'm smarter than everyone at church CS Lewis was smarter than everyone at church exactly yeah and he had to learn to go and and he writes about it quite a bit actually in screw tape letters to go and listen to and he hated the music and I mean for CS Lewis I mean church must have been horrible but he had to grow in Christian maturity to love it I remember a great saint when I was in seminary I was going to church and a seminarian came and preached at our church and it was awful and I sat there and I just thought this is horrible and this woman that I knew was she was an older woman and she was a saint I remember her saying wow I really got a lot out of that message and I thought what here little 23 year old me who had had a couple of preaching classes so full of myself could say everything that was wrong with that sermon but this saint could listen could sift through this pile of banality and come up with a gem and grow spiritually and when she said that I thought that is the difference that is what sainthood that is what saints do and why saints thrive in church and you're only going to become a saint if you go to this place with annoying people and learn to love them and even in some times and places submit to them yeah crazy yeah oh well it's crazy because it you point you really pointing out like the it's the paradox of Christianity in a lot of ways it's like you know you have the death and resurrection of Christ and fundamentally that is that's flattening and flipping of the hierarchy but then our fundamental relationship to God is an establishment and placement in the hierarchy you know and and that's that that seems to be paradoxical where people either either come at the idea of a narrative in a hierarchy as you know it's either fundamentally bad or it's fundamentally good and there you go yeah well the amazing thing about Christianity is and I figured this out when I was studying Luke and when I was reading it was Joel Green's commentary on the gospel of Luke and I began to realize everything in everything in the there's all these status things going on and then when I saw it in the Bible I started seeing it in the world and I thought it's amazing what Jesus does with these status conversations because on one hand he's using them all the time and on the other hand he's flattening them with with Jesus you both have stat a world of status and hierarchies and you have a world of equality but figuring out the dynamics between those two things it's not easy Jesus is the highest he becomes the lowest then he says to his disciples no titles among you you're all brothers and sisters and it's like well how does this work exactly it's interesting you say that about Luke in particular does that play into like I mean I've heard I've heard it in some of the classes I've taken on theology as well that Luke as one of the synoptic Gospels was written very much like with with the Gentile audience in mind does that kind of play into that as far as yeah oh yeah well I think well it was it was partly the commentary when often when I go through a book I will decide I might have four or five commentaries in a particular book of the Bible and I'll say okay but this time when I go through I'm gonna focus on this commentary so that I can really take a deep dive into that one particular author and that was Joel Green who taught at Fuller I don't know if he still does but he he really opened up for me see we and this egalitarian society we we're Peterson is dead on right our biological systems are attuned to status but in our society we've got great status denial that okay equality equality equality well when you go back into the Roman world you realize oh baby pecking order yeah that that all of your interchanges with other people they're all about status and how you relate to another person I was just actually yesterday listening to a George Marsden did a talk at Brown University and he was back in the 18th century talking about the fact that hierarchies you know that the world was full of hierarchies and everybody knew where they were in that and that was the same as when I dealt with the Haitians there's no there no equal people among Haitians and our culture is weird this yeah but we're in denial about it because we all know you know I've got 9,000 some subs on YouTube that means I'm below other people who have more and I'm above others who have less and it's true and at least you're able to talk with people like me you know at you know at 50,000 I you're probably out of reach for me right I I you know I'm such an egalitarian American I I hate that because and people say oh what you're I want to talk to you now because someday you won't be able to and part of me knows that may be the case that might be true someday and another part of me hates it yeah because here's the thing and I always say hierarchies bind and blind because who can Jordan Peterson talk to know and it's not even that he can't reach down and pick up one of our one of us you know one of us underlings and and condescend and and talk to us it's that he in some ways can't he's got a deal with these things yeah he can talk but it's that you don't get rid of the status in that way all the postmoderns and some of their critiques there's validity to it they're pointing at truths out there but it's and that's what I love about Jesus because hmm he's he's the king of the world he's the son of God and he walks into a village and you know he's at the well and his disciples go for food and the Samaritan woman comes down and has a conversation with her in John 4 and I just think gosh that's beautiful hmm yeah exactly yeah yeah well I wanted to also bring up this this theme that you talk about a lot which is um you talk about how you know Jordan Peterson is coming at things from the this is kind of a little bit of a turn in a different direction but you're talking about how well this actually fits pretty well now I think about it Jordan Peterson's coming at things from the bottom up right he's he's looking at you he's looking at Darwin he's looking at you know all these all these psychological types and so he's looking he's making a case from the bottom up why can't things come from the bottom up and the top down because I see verses like this and you know you can tear my exegesis to part here but you see these verses that talks about they talk about how you know the law is written on people's hearts and that you know the rocks cry out his name you know and all these things about how it's I get to you know general relation and specific revelation right and given these themes I mean is it surprising really that like that you know Jordan Peterson's bottom-up case would actually make also make a pretty darn good case for Christianity as well as the top-down case for it I mean I struggle with this idea that like it's really incompatible and I think this is actually where like Jonathan and Matthew Pajow might be might be useful right like when you get to the bottom of something it it's like the extremes are closer than than the middle like you know like once you get to the bottom it flips and goes to the top you know and I find that I find myself thinking about that I'm like it would totally make sense that like if you know that if you dig down deep enough into something the opposite becomes true like when you dig down deep into quantum physics and you realize that the world has fundamental absurdity and you go it's and you go oh I actually know nothing about the world and I'm incapable of knowing anything about the world because of my a prior interpretive structure so sure resurrection yep I can I can make that leap of faith yep like all of a sudden you know the scale of what kind of decision you're making to find meaning in life is is a lot different like it becomes clear to you how few choices you have you know and that that's thing is like we really don't have a lot of choices about like what we're gonna go and it seems to me the deeper the deeper you dig the more clear it is it's like meaninglessness and nihilism or the church that's in that that Tim Keller 2015 Faith Engel Forum that mushy middle that's polarization they're squeezing it out and they're going one to the other the the reason it's our it's a cultural bias blindness that gives us difficulty from the top down and actually Keller in that same talk talks about that and you see it all the time Africans don't have a problem with top down Hispanics often don't have a problem with top down people all over the world don't have a problem with top down we have a problem with top down now we think our we think of ourselves as top of the heap because we're a superpower and we have cell phones and we have technology and so that's how we think of ourselves and we look at other people and say well you believe in spirits and stuff and actually later in that same talk Tim Keller will talk about Africans where you know people are like well that Christianity is the white man's religion but Africans are like no actually Christianity gets us a lot better than you secularists because you secularists hear us dealing with the spirit world and thinking I you're a bunch of ignoramuses who don't know anything it's our cultural blindness it's our cultural biases that blind us it's so funny you say that it's exactly right I mean I we our church you know we were just going through the membership course and stuff and I had us take you know one of those cheesy little spiritual gifts summaries and I mean it's not it's not easy it's useful but but I did the whole time I was doing it I was like this is psychometrically valid and not only that I saw a file not only that but like you know the average score I had was like a 15 and in most categories or something like that which is like you know right in the middle between 15 and 30 and on prophecy I scored seven like the lowest you can possibly score and it just goes to show yeah I mean like I think of the idea of like of getting a message from God someone someone tells me they have a message from God for me and I go okay alrighty then it's like yeah you know that's that's it's a tough thing to do it you know because how do you how do you reconcile this when it seems so in conflict but but I mean but at the same time it's like we're looking at it from such a bottom-up modernist materialist way of analyzing the world and seeing it as a space for objects that can be nicely quantified and it's like I think once you stop really doing that and realizing it's kind of both and then or realizing that like science is actually nested with it's just a tool that's nested within a form for action you know and that's and and biology shows that you know and and reinforces that then then you can start to see you know the utility of some of these things you know and that's been a huge I think that's a big part of the reason Peterson has been bread-pilling people because he better than most has been able to has been able to has been able to expose the ways in which our materialist biased isn't even scientifically valid and and actually right that's been known since early in the 20th century but there's always a lag in these things yeah and so as again as the last little clip I had with Tim Keller I mean philosophically the you know most of this stuff Sam Harris just didn't just never like to stand on yeah but popularly he there's still he's still getting traction in the in the culture which is ironically the inverse of you know what he says about Christians all there's but they're receding it's like no Sam it's yeah that the winds of change are not really blowing your way sorry yeah exactly exactly yeah it's like you know being being created in the image of God we come to see it's like we come to see our power to I'm flicking that's something I kind of wrote to myself was salient to it but like we see we get obsessed with our own power to put things in order you know and that's and you know when when we expect bedrock finality at the bottom we instead encounter the endless void and it's only then we begin to understand our need for a creator I think that's I think a lot of Peterson's folks are kind of in the process of going through that and realizing what that is and struggling with what the implications are and so I guess this brings us back to our initial question like what can we as the church be doing to to better serve these people you know to bring them into the fold of the church you got so many barriers like our our language we've got our rituals like what in the world like worship like what exactly are we doing when we worship what probably actually be a good idea to clarify that so we can actually tell them what we're doing I mean I play on worship band even at those new church that I'm at and it's like like I can't really tell you what we're doing we're just singing some songs and you know and it's like and and we feel great about it and we're we're worshiping like why are you what do you mean what are we doing you know it's like it's it's it's hard to jump over those gaps and I don't every once in a while I think I should just call Paul and we should just go plant a church together just go plant a new church I just I just talked to a guy in Ireland he's like there's no Christian reform church here that I can go to Ireland and end up will love it it'll solve this problem but his whole family will be ticked off because there will be the Catholic church but no and you know the irony part of what's been fascinating about the Peterson thing is number one even he doesn't fully know what he's doing so here you got a guy who doesn't go to church who a whole bunch of people are starting to go to church because of him and he's not really saying go to church he's saying clean your room and the application has been I'll clean my room but then maybe I'll think about that number two a big and part of this is Jonathan Peugeot's influence you know a number of people that I've talked to they're going to the Orthodox Church and yeah I mean kind of that as well yeah and okay why well they don't know and you know we can kind of make up say well maybe it's this or this or this or this but something's going on there there's real reasons for it and you go to the Orthodox Church they're not there you know are they necessarily going to explain this in all materialist concepts or psychological concepts to people Jonathan Peugeot says I don't pay any attention to Jungian archetypes I read Church Fathers it's like oh that's interesting yeah it's not a criticism on my part it's just the fact that the Orthodox Church they've got their program they've been working it for 2,000 years they're not gonna change because of Jordan Peterson or you and so now we Protestants we're we're like oh we're all over the place we're all over the place we're like you know oh I got to be relevant got to be relevant so you know it's like a church for you and that's right and the smoke machine and exactly and so well now we got to explain now we got to explain what we're doing in this worship service but then we stop and think well what are we doing in this worship service exactly and the weakness of Protestantism and evangelicals yeah that's right that's right but at the same time it also you know part of my concern so when I was talking to and on Twitter I was I was going on with Esther and Glen a bit about or Esther Esther kind of when I this thing that's really gnawing at me and how Jordan Peterson has exposed the poverty of the church to connect and reach out to this particular group of people Esther Esther got a little defensive for pastors and churches it's like I'm the pastor I'm the church why are you getting defensive for us but that's but you know but I don't want to thousands and millions of people are finding Christ in churches all the time that's always going on and sometimes when I talk it makes people think like churches are all dying all over the place and that isn't true and it's part of the reason I wanted to play at least part of that Tim Keller faith angle forum thing because the church continues to do its work people continue to find new life in Christ through the church through many many different kinds of churches and even though in Western Europe and the United States this church is struggling in many other places in the world the church is growing by leaps and bounds so it is it is not the case that the church is knocked out of the game but what Jordan Peterson has done is exposed I think some of what I listen to a I listen to a video today from a from a from an atheist a celebrity atheist kind of a B level one on YouTube and he made the point he's a why why evangelists why apologists get no traction with me and the 11 out the 11 minute video could have been cut brought down into one sentence which was they don't listen Christians don't listen mmm it's true now here's all the things you need to do Christians don't listen you sit down with someone and and listen and listen and listen and sometimes people just talk themselves but Jordan Peterson says listening is the most powerful thing why because we think out loud mmm and we learn that as a pastor that people come into my office and pastor I have these questions and they talk and they talk and they talk and they talk and just listen and they leave with their answers I didn't give many well yeah I mean I think that's kind of the it's funny I think that that dynamic is is true in both directions you know like we I think I think a lot of times we were really afraid you know because we see we see ideas and knowledge as these colonizing things that they are and we're afraid that if we really listen to the atheists and their points and their questions then you know then our brains will be colonized with the you know the the spawn of you know whatever you know I mean I say this just usually you know I probably shouldn't joke about that too much but but you know it's like like oh the the atheism will infect my mind you know and it's funny because we criticize the you know we criticize Dawkins for calling religion a mind virus you know and it's kind of seeing it as the same thing where it's like you know the people who don't want you know religion to be in public spaces at all they're like they see it as the same thing that will infect the will infect things it's like just because it's put out there it's harming people you know and and yeah I mean exactly like I think at the end of the day we're afraid to listen because we're we're not confident enough in our own in our own faith and you know we don't have enough reasons or we're afraid we don't we don't say clear enough path to how those questions even though they might shake us a little bit might lead us to greater strength and we're not confident to take that path and I think that's where a lot of churches so many churches become so insular and internally focused is like well we don't have to deal with any of these questions because we all believe in Jesus and we don't have to justify it you know and then and yeah I mean that's there you go that's that's not a focus on Christ that's a focus on that's a focus inward you know so that's kind of a difficulty that's that's that's very right if I can keep those questions out there I don't have to deal with them and we will use punishment and enforcement and compliance to make sure that nobody raises them here doesn't work doesn't work especially in this internet age yeah yeah exactly let's see I'm sorry just trying to look for another piece of paper here yeah so so okay so the problem is we don't want to we don't want to create necessarily just just another church for them because I think and the problem with that might be that people might just see right through it you know that might be kind of the problem with evangelicals and the Protestants is that like you know the external world sees the church spinning off all these new churches that are meant for specific populations and they're like we see what you're doing you know you're you're making a church that you think is gonna attract me because you want me to go and all they can focus on at that point like their main lobe their main focus is you want me to show up you know and yeah I mean that I think Peterson is different in that like it starts with not you want me to show up it's it starts with I want you to be better you know and it starts in some paradoxical sense where it's like Peterson's not listening but it's in some sense the best thing to do is to listen you know and you need someone who's actually gonna listen you know and a lot of these meetups have started that way you know we're like your meetup started with well I'd like to listen and you're really good at listening clearly but it's like you said in a couple videos ago you know well what would happen if more people showed up to your meetup then went to church right and it's like well what I mean what what in the world would happen if like more people showed up it's like you know 50 people showed up to our meetups and said well we should start a church and it's like well I mean immediately I'm like problem you're not Christians so 50 non-christians have no experience with church can't just start a church like you know you need a core a core membership but like at the same time it's like I mean I feel like we have to do something with that like you know and I'm like I'm sitting here like what would that look like and as I sit here you know and I continue to you know contemplate a call to ministry it's like this is really fun like I love just I love scheduling meetups thinking who's gonna show up what kind of crazy things that they're gonna say I'm gonna get to talk to them and like you what they say and maybe I get to talk back a little bit and we get to have a great conversation that's like super honest and really like even and it's like it's not obvious to me that I could become a pastor and like go to a church and have anything close to the same conversation you know and I'm kind of like how in the world do I get some sort of ministry opportunity where I don't have to introduce myself as a pastor priest that looks like I feel like people just shut down they're like oh you're the pastor you are gonna moralize you're gonna judge you're gonna pontificate you're not here listen and that's kind of where I am like yeah that that bias about pastors is is deep in Christians I don't find it as deep in others really was one of the big surprises I've had in this journey that I mean there was one individual who doesn't go to church and he says oh I know why you're I know why your channel took off it's because you're a pastor I'm like that should be why my channel didn't take on you you have an investment in this that that means that there's a degree of consequence to you talking about this that there isn't for other people and I thought huh well that's true I as a Protestant my answer to the question of the buckos and church is partly I if this wave is big enough and endures enough they will create their own church now there's some heresy in that which I'm very well aware of that especially the the sacramental traditions the Roman Catholics and the Orthodox will key in on but this is in fact what happens in the world and how the church grows so I've used this example before so Wycliffe translator goes off into some jungle and you know somehow gets the people to start to trust him and gets creates a written language for them translates the Bible into them gives them the Bible and these people who know absolutely nothing start start what what is it that they start and I'm thinking about missy ologist Roland Allen when I was you know so I was a missionary in the Dominican Republic and I had a seminary education I'm there and it wasn't a few months that I'm there and thinking I don't know what I'm doing I don't I don't even know what I should want to do and somewhere along the line I heard a little bit about Roland Allen who was a late 19th early 20th century missionary he's got some tiny little books and I read those books and I thought oh because Roland Allen noticed that he had these mission stations he was supposed to visit and then there was always turmoil and stuff that would happen and he had the disturbing realization that the churches he didn't visit were doing better than the ones he did oh okay that's that's really interesting that is really interesting well and then he had to ask himself why what am I doing to muck up the work of God this this is the story of of modern missions that like in China and Africa when when the Chinese and the Africans finally were ready to tell the Europeans take a hike we're sick of you picking and choosing and and it was it was the churches once they got the missionaries out of the way those churches grew and they had heresy and they had corruption and they had huge problems yeah but off it went and yeah it'll be the same with this crowd I'm sure if it gets big enough some will go Roman Catholic some will go Orthodox but there'll be a Church of the Buccos and they'll have their heresies and it'll be a mess but God will do something with it yeah yeah exactly I mean yeah yeah Jordan Peterson might say you have to believe in the power of the logos huh well if you you know in this Christian business if you don't trust God what else do you have yeah isn't that the thing yeah exactly I mean you already made the statement that you truly believe that whatever it is that's good that you're doing or whatever it is that's orienting you towards the good or whatever the good is that you're oriented towards it's not you you know you already said that so you're placing yourself in a hierarchy below that thing that's outside of you so then you know what what follows from that what really follows from that and I think yeah like if you don't trust that then well I think a little bit of your sacred self is showing that's exactly right yeah that I that I am God okay well you're not you're you're you're a lousy God yeah exactly exactly yeah well we have five more minutes I have another talk after you so anything on your list you definitely wanted to hit um you know I think we almost went through every funny I have I have so many things but it's funny to me how many of these concepts had no no differences between them because we had like four of them at once and I'm like well I think that's great that's awesome so I think we're good we covered almost everything yeah oh wonderful well wonderful I'm glad you signed up and I'm glad we I'm glad we I'm glad we did this this was this was good thanks a lot for taking the time you know I was I was kind of worried you came up with your patreon thing and I'm like oh no he's getting bigger am I ever gonna get to talk to him we'll see if his schedule's probably totally like frozen it's like no no you plenty it's getting tighter yeah yeah it is and I and I I have such I don't want it to you know it's so bad because I should be a youtuber and I should be I go and I get up to 15,000 I want to get to 20,000 I want to get a hundred thousand subs but part of me is like yeah but then I won't get to talk to Nathan and I won't get to talk to enda and I won't get to talk to Topher and I can't talk to Topher twice and so you know he was really interesting to talk to though I talked faster than Ben Shapiro oh I saw you you were like like the the wind of his words was like you were like back in your seat like oh my goodness this guy's got so much to say it was fabulously entertaining though anyway Paul thank you so much for taking the time I'm totally looking forward to the to the rest the SLN stuff and I just shall I just consider this a yes I'm posting this or do you want to look oh absolutely yeah no go for it I mean well so I should clarify a little disclaimer the person who I was talking about who talked about Halloween of the thing just like off chance like someone who knows him watches this or something like that it wasn't 20 minutes it was like five minutes it was no big deal it was it was fine but you know just for illustration like stories are better embellished off exactly exactly all right Nathan all right thanks a lot Paul good luck with your next conversation all right thanks we'll see you again
