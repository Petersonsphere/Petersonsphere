 Hi, this is Paul and this is Rough Draft for Sunday where I run through the current edition of This Sunday sermon. I've been preaching through the post-exilic period Last year, I came across an article that really grabbed me. It's by Wilfred M. McClay The Hedgehog Review called the strange persistence of guilt. Actually, I found this article because David Brooks linked to it from his own editorial piece entitled By the Same Thing and I read through this article and This was could be one of the best articles I'd read all last year I think in some ways we have as a culture have flipped between the don't judge me Generation to it's all your fault generation. I should probably change this Title I think we switched from the don't judge me Moment to the it's all your fault moment and the one show that I thought best Exemplified this was My Name is Earl. That was all about karma And it was White Lie Christmas where Joy's mother was lying about dialysis her gambling addiction selling her daughter's car and Bankrupting her husband and all she'd ever say when she got caught was don't judge me Don't judge me and at the end of them at the end of the episode All they did was basically let the kids enjoy their new bikes That was the don't judge me moment and that moment is gone and we have a very different moment now The world has flipped. Are you white? Slavery is on you whether or not your ancestors owned or even were in America at the time Are you a man mistreatment against women is on you no matter what you've done personally You earn more than $30,000 a year you are a member of the worldwide 1% Do you use plastic do you drive a car do you travel by plane? Do you eat meat if you say yes to any of these things? You are responsible for the problems of the world This is what the hedgehog review article pointed out colonialism slavery structural poverty water pollution Deforestation there's an endless list of items for which you and I Can take the rap to be found blameless as a pipe dream for the demands on an active conscience are literally as endless as an active imagination's ability to conjure them and as and as those of us who teach young people Often have occasion to observe it may be precisely the most morally perceptive and earnest individuals who have the weakest Common-sense defenses against such overwhelming assaults on their over receptive sensibilities They cannot see a logical place to stop Indeed when any of us reflects on the brute fact of being alive and taking up space on this planet Consuming resources that could have been that could have met other more worthy needs We may be led to feel guilty about the very fact of our own existence This is a very real thing there's people all over the place carrying around enormous Amounts of guilt others very ready to self-righteously hoist them voice them on those people and there is no redemption for it Now we've been going through the post-exilic period and this is where the Jews come back to Jerusalem after the Babylonian Captivity and they start rebuilding and last week we read the prophet Haggai who was giving them dramatic promises about all of the things that would happen if they would only dig deep and Finally finish that temple and everything would come then everything would be set right then the world would be set straight and They're not doing it. It's all their fault God made these dramatic prophecies both before the exile and the Hague I and Will they come to pass they didn't seem to be bearing out the Bible product the Bible project is one of my favorite websites because they do these terrific summaries of the books of the Bible and Whereas I want to cover the first eight chapters of the book of Zechariah And we don't have time to read through them all I thought I might play just a piece of this video and Give you an overview of what's happening in that book The book of the prophet Zechariah The book is set after the return of the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem And we're told in the book of Ezra that Zechariah and Haggai together Challenged and motivated the people to rebuild the temple and look for the fulfillment of God's promises now long ago Jeremiah the prophet had said that Israel's exile would last for 70 years and that afterwards God would restore his Presence to a new temple and bring his kingdom and the rule of the Messiah over all nations The dates at the beginning of this book tell us that those 70 years are almost up But life back in the land was hard and it seemed like none of these promises were going to come true Why and the book of Zechariah offers an explanation? It has a fairly clear design There's an introduction which sets the tone for a large collection of Zechariah's dream visions And that's concluded by chapter 7 and 8 and then this is followed by two more large collections of poetry and prophecy Let's just dive in and see how the book works It begins with Zechariah's challenge to his generation to turn back to God and not be like their ancestors Who rebelled and refused to listen to the earlier prophets which landed them in exile and so now the returned exiles Respond positively to Zechariah They repent and humble themselves before God and they are able to do so in a way that is not only For God or so it seems the next large section is a collection of eight nighttime visions that Zechariah experienced And just to prepare you these are full of very bizarre strange images a lot like your dreams The idea that God communicates to people through symbolic dreams It's very old it goes back to the book of Genesis the dreams of Jacob or Joseph or Pharaoh These gave meaning to current events at the time But they also gave a window into the future and so Zechariah has his own dreams now And they've been arranged in this really cool symmetrical design the first and the last visions are about four horsemen each They're like rangers patrolling the world on God's behalf And it's a representation of God's attentive watch over the nations their report is that the world is at peace And in Zechariah's day this refers to how God raised up persia to conquer Babylon and bring peace And so the question now arises the 70 years of Israel's exile are almost up is now the time for the messianic kingdom in Jerusalem And God responds by saying that he's determined to fulfill those promises, but he leaves the question of timing unanswered The second and seventh visions are paired because they're both reflections on israel's past sin that led up to the exile So the second vision is about these horns that symbolize the nations that attacked and then scattered israel assyria and babalon But then these horns or empires are themselves scattered by a group of blacksmiths an image for persia The seventh dream is about a woman in a basket and we're told that she's a symbol of the centuries of israel's covenant rebellion And then this woman is carried off to babalon by other women who carry the basket flying with stork wings This is so strange the third and six visions are paired as they're both about the rebuilding of a new jerusalem So a man is measuring the city It's an image of God's promise that Jerusalem will be rebuilt and become a beacon to the nations who will join God's people in worship And then the sixth dream is about a scroll that flies around the new jerusalem punishing thieves and liars The idea being that the new jerusalem is a place that's purified from sin by the scriptures The fourth and fifth visions are at the center of this collection and they're about the two key leaders among the returned exiles So joshua the high priest and then zarubabel the royal descendant of david So joshua had been symbolically wearing israel's sin in the form of these dirty clothes But then those are taken off and he's given new clothes and a new turban a symbol of god's grace and forgiveness And then an angel tells joshua that if he remains faithful to god He will lead his people and joshua will become a symbol of the future messianic king The other vision is about two olive trees that supply oil to this elaborate gold lamp Which itself is a symbol of god's watchful eye over his people and these two trees symbolize the two anointed leaders joshua And then zarubabel who's leading the temple rebuilding efforts and god says that success will not come to this new temple If it's the result only of political maneuvering rather these two leaders must be dependent upon the work of god's spirit The visions come to a close with a bonus vision from the prophet and it picks up the themes of the central fourth and fifth visions It's joshua the high priest again and he's given a crown and presented as a symbol of the future messiah Who will also be a priest over god's kingdom? And then zechariah closes it all out saying that all of these visions will be fulfilled Only if the current generation is faithful to god and obeys the terms of the covenant And so altogether these three visions emphasize how the coming of the messianic kingdom is conditional Upon this generation being faithful to god which leads to the conclusion of the dreams It's another challenge from zechariah and a group of israelites come and they've been mourning over the former temple's Destruction for nearly 70 years and they ask him is it time to stop grieving? I mean is god's kingdom going to come very soon and zechariah again reminds them of how their ancestors Rejected god's call through the prophets which led to the exile and so he challenges them, too He says this generation will see the messianic kingdom only if they pursue justice and peace And remain faithful to the covenant so in other words zechariah reverses their question He asks are you going to become the kind of people who are ready to receive and participate in god's coming kingdom? And that question is left just hanging there the people don't answer and the book just moves on And so we come to the final section and we won't look at that That will be next week Now we've been talking about transactional religion and There's a reason we like transactional religion because if god is dealing square and Because he's god he should deal square because if god isn't dealing square We've got problems way bigger than anything that that we can ever imagine But but if god is dealing square and and we keep our end of the bargain We stay in control of our destiny and we really like that That's that's something that's very pleasing to that We we we get what we want and we secure our own future now The beginning of the story as summarized by that video says this in the eighth month of the second year of darious The word of the lord came to the prophet zechariah son of baraka. Yeah, the son of edo The lord was very angry with your ancestors therefore tell the people this is what the lord almighty says Return to me declares the lord almighty and I will return to you says the lord almighty Says the lord almighty Do not be like your ancestors to whom the earliest prophets proclaimed. This is what the lord almighty says Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices, but they would not listen or pay attention to me declares the lord Where are your ancestors now and the prophets do they live forever? But did not my words and my decrees which I commanded my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors It's an interesting phrase Then they repented and said the lord almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve just as he determined to do So they made confession Now here's the challenge. Can you keep your own goals? Can you keep all of them? Do you always and only eat what's right? Maybe if you medically have to but most of us are actually pretty poor at it Do you never say the wrong thing? Or do you mess up sometimes and say what you shouldn't say? Would your spouse your children your co-workers your friends your neighbors all say the same thing about you? Should god create on a curve What about the collective guilt that places us right back where this hedgehog review is see on one hand We went from don't judge me where you know, hey, i'm i'm not to blame to everyone judging all of us and Sometimes we flip back and forth between these two modes, but what about collective guilt? Is it is it really that bankrupt? Is is there no such thing as collective guilt? I mean the truth is we tend to like push we tend to like pushing collective guilt on others And evading it ourselves when in fact The bible seems to hold a lot of verses about collective guilt Why would god ask us to do to be or to do something we can't Isn't this the way jacob received the gift at bethel now if you remember that story at bethel god appears to jacob in a dream When he's running for esau and jacob did wrong to his brother esau and esau is going to kill him So jacob runs away and he's sleeping and he puts his head under a rock and god gives him a dream where god basically Reiterates all of the promises that god had given to his grandfather abram and he does so and he emphasizes it with a A ladder or a staircase with angels going up and down Jacob wakes up in the morning and said surely this is the house of god. So he names the place bethel And then he says a surprising thing. He doesn't just say Thank you lord for the astounding promises. You've given me. May i truly be grateful and live up to you He says you know lord if you come through with this i'll give you 10 of the take Now what kind of a response is this what does that indicate about his heart? See, I think we all do this and why do we do that? why Why did he do that? The problem goes all the way back to the very beginning of the bible in that we don't trust the bible We don't trust god in fact Nearly the whole book of genesis is about us not trusting god Adam and eve didn't trust god Noah had some trust of god, but he wasn't able to Really continue to do right if you look at the episode that happens after the flood God says to abraham i'm going to give you all of the things that you've ever dreamed of Of especially a son and the whole world will be blessed through you And abraham's basically spends the next 25 years trying to prime the pump god appears to jacob gives him this promise Jacob continues to try to weasel his way into the promise and god basically when confronting him at the river J box says no i'm even going to take away your ability to run away from your brother esau You all have no choice but to trust me We don't trust joe. We don't trust god that god would be that generous And that's our dilemma We have real trust issues and we don't know what to do And so we wind up doing all sorts of other things to secure our own rescue for ourselves But These eight chat these eight stories sort of haunt us because we we wonder about fulfilling them will god make good He didn't seem to fulfill the promises to the people there Most of us can lay out promises. He hasn't seemed to fulfill to us now See, here's the thing the bible is not a book of rules that if you keep that if kept will qualify us for eternal reward The problem is because it's not that the bible doesn't tell us about goodness and righteousness It's the bible just makes clear that we can't keep up our end of the bargain And this is the story of jesus where jesus does for us what we can't do for ourselves Now that makes us feel suspicious because we're fairly suspicious people Right away people will come back to us and say but here's the thing If it's just a gift You're going to take advantage of it and just say great. Thanks for the gift and go out and do everything that you did before well God had better be transactional we imagine with us or we will assume his grace and sin Anyway, this is the point of von hoffer's cheap grace The difficulty is that we do it even when god is conditional because we can't keep our end of the bargain You see transactionality actually undercuts true goodness because if you're only good because it pays Is that really goodness? And that's actually the question of the book of job If you perform better than your neighbors, you will likely feel superior You'll likely be self-righteous and and even sinners can't stand self-righteousness You then rely on your own righteousness in which Which um You then rely on your own righteousness, which is weak shouldn't you rely on god's righteousness, which is strong So actually salvation by grace affords you the chance to be good even when it doesn't pay Which is a better righteousness and it undercuts your natural inclination to look down on those you imagine aren't as moral as you You're a lousy judge and you received a gift you didn't earn it so don't feel superior If you understand the gift you will live like the giver if you reject the gift you won't want communion with the giver If you imagine you can take the gift without communion with the giver Well, you don't understand the nature of the gift Which leads us actually to communion?
