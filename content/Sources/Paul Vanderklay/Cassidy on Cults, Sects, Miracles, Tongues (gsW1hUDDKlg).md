 Well, Cassidy, we've talked a couple times before. How are you doing? Yeah, pretty good. I'm a little tired. Yeah, I'm like currently on like a like a mission trip doing like church planning stuff in San Diego. So it's been pretty full-on. So I'm a little... What does that mean? What exactly are kinds of things are you doing? So we're partnering with the church in San Diego to help them start like a college outreach ministry. So it's a lot of meeting students and like you know connecting with people and most of the people on the trip are college students. So they're you know teaching them how to be leaders and how to like evangelize. So you know lots of get out of your comfort zone. It's a lot but it's fun. But yeah it's a lot. We're all living in like beach houses in like Point Loma. So it's like communal living. Well that sounds rough. Beach houses in Point Loma. Yeah, I'm so sorry that you're suffering for the Lord so much in beat house, beach houses in Point Loma. But no it's good. Just like a lot of information and a lot of stimulation and I'm pretty extroverted. Even too much for you, huh? Yeah, at that point definitely. And like I'm like wildly independent like probably to a fault. So like being on someone's schedule and you know always having to be with someone else is something that I'm like adjusting to. So yeah but yeah it's been it's been good though. Good, good. So what's on your mind? You signed up. What do you want to talk about? So I want to kind of talk about Colt. Oh you should have invited Nick in. I know. Well actually watching his conversations is kind of why I wanted to talk to you about it because I found that really interesting. Well what some of the people are doing now and we haven't I haven't put any recordings out but some of the people are asking to do talks with two or three or four of us. Like you wanted to talk with Nick. Maybe arranging a conversation like that. That could be something fun. We could look into that kind of thing. That'd be really cool actually because that's yeah that's sort of interesting. I listened to his talk I think before we had our second conversation. I listened to his and found that really interesting and I listened to I think it was Alex too where he was like part of like the the weird Christian cult. But yeah I always find it sort of interesting because I mean like I am been around churches and stuff and I when you throw out the name like the word cult it's got a lot of baggage and like I think sometimes when you you put that on something you could immediately kind of dismiss it and go oh yeah they're crazy. But what I've sort of realized you know learning more about the Bible and Christianity it's like yeah but we all believe some crazy things and like for some people just outside of the church seeing Christianity like for them it's like a cult. And I know I guess I just wanted to talk through with you ask you like for people who are sort of hesitant about religion in general like how do you distinguish that for them between like a cult and like religion? Cults generally have an element of overt control usually over your money and your money your thought your freedom. Christianity there are definitely some churches that can get cult like. But for the most part for the most part a good church shouldn't you know so let's say contrast cults with monasticism because with monasticism if you become a monk or a nun you give up a high degree of control. But what one of the differences is that in a cult the cult leader will usually directly benefit usually financially or in other ways from the from the basically from the control of the person and in a let's say a monastic movement there is a long process by which people are they're invited okay now you try this out but you're not fully in we want you to live for a while to decide if this is right for you. The church puts a high value on the voluntary nature of this and if you if you're a cults are usually hard to get out of churches are usually you know very easy to get out of you just stop going or you just say I don't want to talk to you anymore and churches don't you know don't try to take power over. There's a Greg what's the guy's name I can't remember his name right now but he talks a lot about power over and power under. I think that's a really good thing because power over is okay I'm going to take control of your money I'm going to I'm going to put you in a room I'm gonna put you with a group of people I'm going to try to control you. Power under is much more these are the opportunities and if you if you surrender and give your life in these ways these things can happen and so that's that's usually the difference between a cult and a religion. The religion asks that in increasing measure we voluntarily give ourselves to something for a for a greater good. Cults it's like in C.S. Lewis's screw tape letters cults turn people into cattle. Religions turn people into sons and daughters. I think for me I've sort of had like a way to distinguish the two in my head I think for a lot of people just the whole idea of religion just feels like a cult and I can understand that in a way where it's like being outside of church and sort of coming back in and saying like oh we say a lot of like things that if you didn't grow up and like understand that can just sound like rhetoric and like we have these like plans that you know like trying to like help better ourselves and like I think when you're talking about cults there's all these different like levels of cults you've got like the Jonestown cults which are just like one level of cult but then you got like Mormonism which is almost now more like a religion than a cult but again I don't usually isn't considered a cult because you know they can be a little bit controlling if they want you to bring your tax returns in so you can get your temple card to show that you're tithing but they're usually considered a sect. Sect is an important element to put. A sect is usually a subgroup that imagines they are the only true they're they are God's only true people so that's a sect. A cult usually is more controlling and then religion is usually more open. Okay because like I think in some Christian circles Mormonism is like oh they're a cult but you know learning more about them like I obviously am not a Mormon so I don't believe what they believe in just the history of Mormonism is sort of a little interesting because Joseph Smith was quite the character. Yeah so that's yeah that's sort of an interesting distinction too but like then you've got stuff like like other cults that are sort of beneficial but weirdly controlling like recovery cults I have a I have a friend who struggles with addiction and when she was younger she was in like this cult that was like a recovery cult which was like yeah being in it I totally knew it was a cult but like hey I was getting sober you know like and there's like documentaries about it too of like you know people kind of talking about some of like the controlling behaviors within that and you were talking to Mick about how he like knowingly joined a cult and you're like why would you do that and part of me kind of thought about it was like well yeah cults can be really controlling and have negative aspects but there's also a truth to the fact that some of the stuff is really beneficial because you have a community of people that you can be around and you're like usually driven towards some purpose and yeah so that's always sort of interesting to me and I always wonder if like because we've sort of lost like sort of the respect for religion and that sort of thing that cults have become more popular that makes any sense yeah I don't know if it's so much religion I think it's I think it has probably more to do with family cults are very family like as our gangs gangs and cults are you know they're fairly close together so cult is really sort of a behavioral aspect more than a belief aspect okay that's maybe a way to think about it so a cult can be religious or a cult can the cultist nature of it isn't really so much in the beliefs that are prescribed or maintained by the people it's much more in the behaviors and so a gang doesn't when we say a gang that doesn't necessarily have a religious connotation but the but the behaviors are more similar to a cult and people people join gangs you know it's often people who are coming out of a fractured and difficult home life that they'll join a gang because the gang will give you identity it will give you protection it will give you family and cults will do all those things too and people just they these things depending on depending on how things go especially with the leaders they they will or won't wear long so if you look at a community like the Onita community which is a fascinating community in upstate New York at the at the you know towards the end in the 19th century and there's some really great books written on it there in some ways they were a cult but they they managed pretty well for a few decades partly because their leadership their leadership was generous they were benevolent dictators basically so there's a lot of variation there's a lot of variation in these groups yeah I mean and it's so interesting too because I've actually had some friends who've like grown up in cult and kind of talking about that experience has been very interesting and being on you know campus and talking to people about you know religious stuff I've encountered a couple people who've been in like cults and so it's really interesting kind of talking through them and that whole you know that whole idea of like ethics of belief right like when you have to see people with varying beliefs and like there's obviously this faith aspect to it and you know you hear lots of people like you shouldn't you shouldn't say someone's right or wrong for their faith or whatever but like at some point it's like yeah we have all these different beliefs and like I don't think anybody should be forced to be in a certain belief like that's silly because if you don't actually believe it why should be forced into it right but then there's that also the other aspect of like shouldn't we have some duty to be able to like understand each other and understand all of these faiths to have some idea of like which one is more valid than another yeah well belief is a funny thing because you we don't really choose our beliefs they're not really voluntary they kind of grow in us I've been I've been reading Frank Schaeffer's book crazy for God which is a which is I've found it I'm just fascinated by this book right now and it's it touches on a lot of these it doesn't really touch on them directly but his parents were Francis and Edith Schaeffer who became big names in the evangelical world but and they ran this they started this organization called Lebrie which has things all over the world was Lebrie a cult no it wasn't the cult because they didn't really control people but Frank Schaeffer whose beliefs now vary pretty dramatically from his mother and his father depending on how you suss out all of those things there's just a lot going on there and usually when you get closer to even small groups within a within even a small church or a cult or a gang or a family you'll notice there's a fair amount of differentiation I like Jordan Peterson's use of the term resolution because you as you keep going in and magnifying in you'll find more differences in people and and often these differences are not easy to are these religious differences are these temperamental differences are these differences in behavior and so to me people are incredibly complex and which makes the relationships with between people even more complex so this stuff just keeps going down yeah and it's sort of interesting because where's that line between something that's like a cult or something that's just like a super legalistic cult like church yes yes like I feel like there's even nuance and distinction between that too yes because yeah when I was younger like maybe from were part of like a really small church that when it started out it was just like a normal church but like as it sort of went on like I wouldn't say it was a cult but it was very cult like and like very legalistic to the point where like now the guy who used to lead it is like a hardcore Mennonite you know got like all you know a lot of his family you know the head coverings and the prairie dresses and like a lot of his kids are starting to like break and like break really hard and so that's sort of interesting which which makes sense to me like because when you're I don't know I think in some of those extreme cases you either see people move to one extreme or the other you know they get really involved in it and like just like deeper or they just go on another path there's not usually sort of nuance in something yeah in all the road like that yeah and as you grow older you'll see you'll see these patterns continue when I think about some of the my contemporaries who were extremely rebellious the Christian Reformed Church it was never cultish it could be sectish sometimes but people who were really rebellious in high school often would grow up to be some of the most ardent conservatives and I just always found that amusing whereas others who were more moderate so there again you have layers of temperament you have you have developmental layers going on in terms of childhood of differentiation rebellion and it's very complex and a lot of things happen yeah it is quite true that especially sometimes in small churches with strong I would say often insecure leaders they will sometimes opt for fairly cultish things our society is is as a high value on liberty making cults you know that kind of reduces the ability of cults to really gain you know really dig into a lot of people for a long time people break out everybody yeah I mean it's interesting too this is another thing that I kind of want to talk to you about as far as cults go like as Christians we believe in like the spiritual realm right and like there's a part of me that's like yeah I believe that but I don't always act like I do if that makes any sense and I always wonder like how how tied is some of this cultic stuff to that realm that's a good question so Christians Christians have a tradition of beliefs and so the beginning of John 1st John chapter 4 has the admonition to to basically to to suss out and and evaluate the spirits okay and this question of well what do we mean when we're talking about spirits I've got a whole bunch of Sunday school classes on that on my Sunday school channel not to not from the too distant past a lot of that has to go into what's what's making us move what's making us tick what's what's moving this group and and this happens at at group level not just at individual levels and so if if you have a group that is behaving cult ish Lee I would say there very much is a a spirit will dynamic behind that CS Lewis and the screw tape letters has a lovely section in fact it's the best section of the book where screw tape is talking to to wormwood and he's telling him that you know that that for demons they look at people as cattle and and God looks at people as children looking for them to up in freedom and so this cults will manifest this demonic and I use that word intentionally but cautiously we'll we'll use we'll have a demonic spirit about them you know ultimately what love is is is my desire for the welfare of another even beyond my capacity to discern what that welfare may be and and that takes that that's not an easy thing because it actually relies on a a belief in divine providence and presence that is also not something that's terribly present in our secular culture so I would very much say that there is a there is a spiritual and sometimes a demonic element to cults and and you can tell that by this desire to take away people's freedom and to and to use people rather than love them that that's in some ways at the heart of a lot of it but that isn't that isn't unique to cults by any means people have this in relationships one to another parent-child relationships child-parent relationships romantic relationships the desire to control to to consume to basically it's it's my well-being at the expense of the other and and that spirit is the opposite of of Christ's spirit Christ who by his sacrifice affects the well-being of all at his own expense so there's I often talk about that as a polarity that's a relational polarity and cults are exactly opposite of churches in that way churches ought to be seeking the welfare of the people within the church and the community at large at their own expense that should be the relational polarity of the church cults have that exactly opposite but you'll see this in relationships too you know mothers the good mother blesses the child at her expense the evil mother lives at the expense of the child and the evil mother tries to draw her life at the expense of the child that's what cults do and but you see this relational polarity in many different things in life so no there's a very much a spiritual aspect to it yeah well just so interesting from hearing Nick talk about some of that you know being in all these cults and like the the girlfriend that he had and just sort of that sort of thing was really interesting to me and just sort of that yeah that weird realm yeah just sort of like the mental illness part of it too of like how does that all tie into all of it too I think this good this gets deep quickly but but we have I think part of our we are fascinated by cults and we are fascinated by people's desire to be in them and and I think that I think that gets down deep because we have two desires we have the desire to the desire for autonomy and the desire to be possessed now that sounds strange and and I want but but in any let's say a the many relationships this gets manifest the child derives a sense of well-being by being the parents child there's an element of emotional possession that they belong at the beginning of the Heideberg catechism I am NOT my own but I belong to in body and soul and life and in death my faithful Savior Jesus Christ so so within us there's there are these two opposite competing desires one is for autonomy I don't want to be owned or possessed by anyone and the other is in fact to be possessed and and you experience this in a parent-child relationship you experience this in a romantic relationship you experience this in an organizational communal relationship so so what you have is is that both of these desires can get out of whack and and so when we look at a cult and think but what what must it be like to be so fully possessed there's an attractiveness to us about that now once we get into it very quickly our autonomous impulse says no I want to be free I want to be free but you know and you have this and and you know you want to be free of your parents but you want to be your parents child you want to be you want to be free of this romantic relationship but you want to be embedded within this romantic relationship so we have these competing desires within us and so I think it's this desire to be possessed that that cults feed off of it that's what draws us to them and gives us the fascination of them mm-hmm yeah that's sort of interesting because then that sort of ties in with like and not to just reference all of these conversations that you've had with people but when June was talking about sort of like the Pentecostal traditions and some of that like fear of like that spiritual thing that was really interesting to me too because I totally understand that and like I grew up in a pretty well I grew up in several different churches but mostly been in non-denominational churches and the one that I grew up in the most and sort of started started my faith journey and was pretty you know not super like charismatic or whatever but I've had experience in those sort of charismatic churches and just trying to be like understand them and like what is going on and I think sometimes the way that they go about some of those things can be very overwhelming and I was actually talking to Esther O'Reilly and I was just talking to her and telling her a little about my story and everything and just you know talking about what I was learning and she goes like did you grow up Pentecostal and I'm like no no I'm not really and she was like you sound like one I'm like shut up I know but like there's something to where it interests me but then there's also a part of me that's like like freaks me out all in the same breath so I don't know I think Pentecostalism is more of a culture slide for us I think Pentecostalism is a reaction against secularity and modernity and a reaction against I mean the Azusa Street mission arose at the time of really the height of of of modernity in terms of its before the First World War this is you know this is we've got the whole world locked in and Pentecostalism comes out with bang no we're gonna have we're have glossalelia we're gonna have speaking in tongues we're gonna have faith healing we're gonna have words of knowledge we're gonna we're gonna deny secularity 100% Frank Peretti is gonna write a novel with angels and demons and everything going on it's a it's a reaction it's a reaction against modernity and secularity yeah and so I guess I always struggle with the balance of that because like I read the Bible and I see like talking about the Holy Spirit and the gifts of that stuff and so there's a part of me then go okay like I don't think that like like I think there's truth to that I think there's power in that and I've had experiences that you know are you know sort of I can't attribute to myself necessarily but on the other hand there's this and not with every Pentecostal church I've been in and maybe charismatic is a better term I don't know yeah you're out of spectrum yeah yeah but I don't know sometimes it does feel like they're very sensational and not just like being like okay this is a thing and it happens and like let's let's talk about it and discuss it but it almost becomes like we are going to make it happen and cultivate it which feels very off for me like it feels like this weird control mechanism of like you know like we are gonna we're and we're not gonna let the Holy Spirit work whenever it works like those experiences which is always a little like it's it's it makes me hesitant because it's like why why are we trying to like I don't know the right way to describe it but like why are we trying to like curate these experiences but modernity is about agency and and in modernity we we we look for an attempt to control the things around us the Pentecostal impulse in many ways is one of one of receiving and allowing God to move in surprising ways when when Pentecostal churches get get big into mechanics agency they start to undermine their own rebellion and because and there are you know I've read I've read I mean there are manuals out there for faith healing and I've got some of them in my and I've looked at that stuff you know Bethel Church in Reading two hours north of us I mean this right now is one of the one of the important churches in North America that is pioneering this you know well we're gonna show everyone how to do faith healing and and you know to to to manifest the spirit and and Bill Johnson a lot of Bill Johnson's books were very direct about that now I remember a conversation I had with someone recently who said that Bill Johnson has been having medical problems and you know this in a sense the same happened with John Wimber a generation ago where John Wimber so Charismatics usually are within other denominational settings and Pentecostal is usually its own denominational setting so John Wimber kind of came along and did a course at Fuller Seminary on on signs and wonders and that caused a lot of conversation should we be teaching you know seminarians how to do this stuff and that's actually a very interesting conversation but John Wimber then eventually you know he was big leader of a big movement power evangelism power healing two big books that were written in the let's see I was in seminary in the 80s and then John Wimber gets sick and well what happens when if you say well there shouldn't be sickness if we are in fact you know correctly possessing the Spirit of God and then your frontline leader gets sick suddenly you've got a lot of questions to answer and it's usually at that point that well the the broader wisdom of the tradition comes in and reinforces the fact that these are gifts of the Spirit not technology of the Spirit and so we are always we are we always have open hands before the Lord and so then the better position is our hands open or our hands closed but our hands are not grasping the knobs of the Holy Spirit to make him do what we want so yeah I think that's part of the reason that it's kind of a natural evolution of that process but it always sort of ends itself at least among the groups that are honest and have integrity the charlatans who are not honest and don't have integrity continue to lie about it so yeah and that's um that's well that's the Jesus culture stuff yeah that's the Jesus culture yeah okay cuz I have yeah that was my first experience really with like that sort of movement I went to a couple Jesus culture conferences they are interesting people travel from all over the world to go to Redding which is a very out-of-the-way place fly into Sacramento Drive two hours north up the valley to the that hot north end of the valley and that's where Redding is and that's where Bethel Church is it's a very big deal well it's sort of interesting because I the first time I went I learned a lot from that and had an interesting experience there but then there was a lot of things too that were just like hmm and then the second one that I went to it was like fine and like that's the thing that I find with a lot of these charismatic traditions where it's like you're saying things that I sort of believe and like maybe not everything but like it's not like I feel like they're saying stuff that's wrong but then there's always that little bit of like but there's something that's also like I'm skeptical about and yeah maybe that's just me being skeptical but then maybe that's also something of like oh maybe that's a sense of I'm saying something true about that but I never could understand like the speaking in tongues thing that's what I really can't like get my head around and like because I have like I don't speak in tongues I don't I I just don't have any categories to even understand that and not that I don't think that it can happen like I've talked to plenty of people who have no reason to lie to me who've said it's happened and even people are like yeah but I don't even totally understand it so it's like okay but sometimes the way that that is cultivated just seems so inauthentic to me where it's like you just start saying syllables or words and like you know then it'll like come and it's like yeah but maybe you're just saying syllables or words and then I don't know I've just known people too who have like started in like charismatic traditions like what it's like John Piper or Wayne Gruda and then as they gone on kind of been like I'm not sure how authentic all of that was well John Piper and Wayne Gruden they're not Pentecostal tradition they're they're they're reformed I don't know if John I don't think I don't know if John Piper is a cessation secessionist or not so there's so in certain theological traditions they believe that healings don't happen these these these things in the New Testament are only part of the first century I don't know where John Piper is on that but um yeah and I know that they're not now and maybe I need to just do more research about this but I did see a video of John Piper talking about like speaking in tongues and he was just like I don't think I can say that I ever authentically did that and it sounded like at some point he had experience of that and then my my dad's actually friends with Wayne Gruda and so he sort of talked to him about some of the things that he experienced early on in his faith and sort of why he stripped that away so that's sort of interesting to me to hear that and be like okay yeah it's you you'll find my position my position tends to be open to this but not that someone from Bethel would say I don't seek it hard enough because I don't I don't you know if someone is sick I pray for their healing that's what I do this is what the Christian Church has done for always we we pray for healing now yeah I I'm not I'm not in any way anti-penicostal I'm not a secessionist I've seen too much to not believe that God does amazing miraculous things sometimes but there's a reason we call things miracles and what we mean by miracle is that they're unusual and that they're beyond our control and even often our understanding that to me is a miracle yeah and like I think I'm sort of in the same boat or like I totally believe in some of those things and hadn't experienced and have heard people with enough experiences to be like okay there's something to this but then I also sometimes go into those experiences and everything's a miracle like it's or like even some of like the prophecy like people say oh we're gonna we're gonna say prophetic words over you and they just sort of sound like horoscopes of like really general things you know I'm always like I can get a little cynical at times if somebody's pushing that stuff too much and the problem is I get a little cynical and then I get a little smart-mouthed and that's I shouldn't always do that I'll make a comment and that's not terribly generous or kind and but no I completely understand and anyone can go to you can you can just go out into the internet and and Google you know prophecies and you will find bulletin boards on the internet that are just full of prophecies and okay I said I'm sure there's stuff that's right in them because there's enough of it I don't I don't know it and in my experience but but I also know situations where people have someone will come up to someone and say well you know God has God has told me to tell you this and then they will say something to a person which is completely beyond the realm of human possibility for that complete strangers to know about them and to speak so so pointedly and so personally in their life and so that's why my position is one of an open hand and an open mind because I don't see any point in closing my hand or my mind but I also think there's a problem in terms of grasping control to try to you know make God do stuff yeah so yeah that's that's an interesting way to think about that but yeah I tend to be a pretty open person but I have a lot of dualities to my personality to be honest like I'm very open but I'm very critical in the same like in the same breath where it's like I'll listen to you but like I'm not like it takes me some time to really be able like I'm not I'm not easily swayed or convinced if that makes any sense I've definitely had conversations with lots of people about like speaking in tongues and stuff and one person told me that like it's really hard for like really intelligent people to like understand it I was like okay what are you saying about the people who are doing it yeah it was like and then I've heard people talk about to where it's like it's a it's like a baby spiritual gift it's where you start out like I don't know and I and I don't I don't think that people who speak in tongue I don't I don't say that to it's because I've known some a lot of smart people who like have told me their experiences and like you know kind of in a way of like I can't explain it to you I don't know and so I'm like okay I have I have friends who are brilliant and godly whose faith I respect enormously who have that gift and I have friends who are brilliant and godly whose faith I respect enormously who don't have that gift yeah so for me that line that lands me right back in saying God gifts the gifts he wants to to the people he wants to give them to and that's his business not mine and and the a person's spiritual maturity is not necessarily related to their giftedness yeah I tend to find myself in that place where it's like okay if God wants give me that then whatever I think there is a part of me that's sort of like I don't want it because like when I think I just I don't see how it's profitable necessarily but like again I'm not experienced it and there's different it's a different thing if it's like sort of the speaking of tongues where you're starting to speak another language and I can connect something that's really interesting but like just the the words that nobody can trans like interpret it doesn't like I'm like I don't know and then there's another part of me that doesn't really want it because then I have to say yeah I've spoken in tongues and I don't want to be that person and so that's probably like a pride thing but like yeah there's a part of me where in some of these traditions it's like they want everybody to speak in tongues and if you're not speaking in tongues you don't have enough faith and it's like sometimes I doubt and like but I believe this stuff like with a lot of faith but I think at least now it's at least informed at least to the extent that it can be like I'm still always gonna try to learn but I don't know sometimes it's like it always makes me a little hesitant like wow I feel like it can breed a level of inauthenticness when that becomes like the core of what becomes really faithful because you know you can all kind of got get caught up in them emotions and like group think is a thing as you probably know being on a mission trip and like that's the thing it's not I think that's necessarily like and I when I started college is a communications major so like the way that people communicate and how they sort of interact has always sort of interested me and like every every culture and every in group has their own way of speaking and talking in their own terminology that the out groups just never gonna understand and there's nothing wrong with that necessarily but I think just being outside of a church and then coming back into it was like before I left I never I never was bothered by any of like the church stuff and coming back now sometimes I feel like I'm jaded and cynical and like it all sounds like rhetoric like yeah it's really interesting I listened to you Job's talks last month and it was it was sort of nice and refreshing because it was like nice to see someone who is sort of like I mean I considers himself an atheist and coming to church and being like I like it I don't want to like it where I'm in the church from like I want to like it but like sometimes it's really really hard and yeah I mean it's I think it's it's definitely hard for me because I used to be able that place where I could be in church and it never bothered me and I've gotten past that point like I've gone through the looking glass and just been like oh like what are we doing I don't know I don't know if that makes any sense it makes a lot of sense and well you'll find you know keep picking up Warren's book so Warren Warren was the guy who brought me to Australia wrote this book I still owe him a review of the book I've read about two-thirds of it and it's a it's a lovely book but one of the things I really like about Warren Warren is Warren's older than I am here's his there's this book on the back Warren Warren has been in a dispensational church he's been in a charismatic church he's been in a kind of a unity church he's been in a mainline church he's now in an Anglican liturgical church and and Warren over the course of his life has managed to work through every every church kind of has their little thing that they do and aspect that you have to work through and Warren has managed to do that and he's managed to he's managed to his faith has grown through that process and and it's it's helpful to get to a point where you can you can understand both the blessings and the weaknesses see is this the oh yeah this is a good book Richard Foster streams of living waters and and what he does is he goes through the different he talks about the different broad traditions of the church the holiness tradition the contemplative tradition the charismatic tradition the social justice tradition the evangelical tradition the incarnational tradition kind of kind of goes through all of these different broad traditions of the church and highlights highlights their strengths and what they what they have to contribute to the full picture and and so as you grow older and as you taste different Chris different Christian traditions and are part of different churches you will you know what all of all of us have our weaknesses and our blind spots but but also and usually our strengths are connected to those and so part of the beauty of the charismatic their openness to God their their belief that God can do anything part of the downside is when that they get tripped up on that in terms of agency and instrumentality so so you did the thoughts you're having are part of the process and and so you don't have to be afraid of them and and then you just kind of have to watch the cynicism and the judgmentalism so that so okay so that's and when someone has just they've just recently received the gift of tongues and everything is about the gift of tongues well okay you know five years from now they'll probably mellow on it and though and some people are just always about the latest thing that they're into and that's just how they are temperamentally and so you know you know we don't have to get all bent out of shape about these things just listen and watch and learn and that's what a wonderful thing that is yeah and I yeah I'm trying my best to do that when I was in Australia I I always said I was a little bit of a denomination whore just like jumping from different denominations trying to figure out okay what you're all about and growing up in a non-denominational church you hear little things about all these denominations and like it gives you like you you have these ideas of what it is and like you learn when you go into those churches that a lot of your assumptions are not totally correct and some of them are but like yeah like there's just so much intricacy in all of them because I don't know what I as far as theology like I don't know what I consider myself 100% like I have some ideas but it just really haven't delved into that enough to like feel strong on anything certain but like I feel like yeah well I just feel like all of them have something very interesting to say about it and have a perspective that we can't see and there's all of this like balance and so I don't know but yeah my my dad's a Calvinist so I always sort of I remember growing up listening that and he actually he did that we went to Scottsdale Bible Church for a long time and that's how he knows Wayne Grudem he used to run the sound for his like class his like Sunday school class and I remember just sitting underneath the sound booth when we were kids just listening to like all of this like oh about tulip and all this stuff and so I always found that interesting and like his systematic theology was super helpful to me sort of going through stuff and I think he's he's such an interesting guy and he's like he just I think he knows the other sides of the arguments really well and so he has his own perspective but he can he can tell you the other perspective like with just as much detail and that's super interesting to me that's very cool that's very cool anyways well we're about out of time I don't know if there's any last things are you did how did the did you land the plane on the tipless restaurant thing I mean is movies that done it's um no it's not done but we're close I went all last month I'm sort of traveling around I'm doing interviews with economists and restaurants I recorded some stuff at a restaurant in New York called Dirt Candy Amanda Cohen she was on like Iron Chef Canada and she was like the first restaurant to sort of go tip-free in New York okay and it was so much fun going down there and capturing all the stuff and it went so smoothly and so I have a couple more interviews I'm gonna go to San Francisco the fourth through the seventh and then Seattle the seventh through the ninth and then that'll be mostly done and then it's just picking up little things but we have enough shot to make a film everything else is just sort of glazed so 2020 let's go yeah I'm really excited about it but yeah just the last little bit is just getting the last bit of funding but I don't know things have just like it just kept falling in my lap and just falling into place where it feels like okay this is the right thing to do just keep moving at it and like you know yeah God will take care of the rest so well Cassidy it was it was fun to talk to you again I hope your mission trip goes well yeah yeah and then you're and then you and you're able to get all that get all the footage you need for your for your movie and and you get that out yeah thanks very much I appreciate it nice talking to you nice talking to you you take care thanks bye
