 Yesterday I released my probably my first words that fudge video on the word spiritual and it'll be I'll be interested to continue to see what the what the comments have to say about that video because I know step on some toes because there's a lot of people who who have grabbed on to this spiritual but not religious thing. Now this morning I saw a very interesting piece from the from the Pew Research Center they do a lot of interesting research about words and and religious belief in America and and they just came out with a new a new typology the religious typology a new way to categorize Americans by religion. You have Sunday stalwarts you have God and 17 percent God and country believers 12 percent. If you listen to the news you would imagine that that's more like 50 percent not about 12 percent 11 percent divisively devout 17 percent relaxed religious 15 percent spiritually awake 12 percent religion resistors and 17 percent solidly secular. Now for those of you who listen to the podcast version of this without the visuals this this might be a little this might be a little difficult to follow but I'll I'll do my best. Let me pull up the web page here. So this is the this is the web this is the web page and I'll and I'll put it in the notes and you can read it. It's got some brief it's got some brief descriptions of who these people are and basically it boils people down into highly religious somewhat religious and non-religious. Three of the seven groups are composed of highly religious Americans who are united by a traditional view of God and by the shared conviction that organized religion is generally a force for good in American life. Sunday stalwarts are the most religious of the seven typology groups. They have a high level of involvement in religious congregations and actively practice their faith. God and country believers are less active in church groups or other religious organizations but like Sunday stalwarts they hold many traditional religious beliefs and tilt right on the social and political and political issues. Relatively large share of racial and ethnic minorities. They also they are also diverse in their beliefs. It is only it is the only group in which most people say they believe in God as described in the Bible and in which majority say they believe in psychics reincarnation and that spiritual energy can be located in physical things like mountains trees and crystals. This is a very interesting mix here because this gets into in some ways some of these subtle differences between this very difficult these very difficult words to define like religious and spiritual. So spiritual energy well what exactly do you mean by by spiritual energy is this this is very much the spiritual energy is in some ways is this God one energy or God to energy as I continue to think about my God one and God two definitions this kind of spirituality is a lot of woo woo and very emphasis on God aspect too. At the opposite end of the spectrum from the three religious groups are two non-religious groups characterized by their tendencies to seldom or never attend religious services rarely play it pray and reject belief in God or the Bible. Instead believing in another higher in another higher power instead believing in another higher power spiritual force or no higher power at all the solidly secular are the least religious of seven groups. Now religious or least spiritual see right away you begin with this article to begin to have questions about what do you mean by religious and what do you mean by spiritual because these words are not very easy to to nail down partly because of these competing groups. These relatively affluent highly educated US adults mostly white and male tend to describe themselves as neither religious nor spiritual religion resistors on the other hand largely consider themselves spiritual but not religious and we're going to look at the data a little bit more closely when we look at at some of these. So they're spiritual but not religious another unifying characteristic is their opposition to organized religion in between the three highly relaxed and two non-religious categories stand two additional typology groups the relaxed religious and the spiritually awake notice how they're playing on these two words and try to discern because they're not defined here they're simply imagining that we're all on the same page in terms of what we consider religious and what we consider spiritual and I think that's far from the case. Most relaxed religious Americans say they believe in the God of the Bible and four and ten pray daily but relatively few attends religious services or read scriptures. This would be what what might be called the the Christ haunted. These are groups of people that churches usually go after to try to activate to get them to have them in a sense switch categories but relatively few attended religious okay all spiritually awake Americans hold at least some new age beliefs psychic spiritual energy can be located in physical objects etc. and believe in God and some higher power though many do not believe in God as described in the Bible and relatively few attend religious services on a weekly basis. While these typology groups were assembled without regard to religious affiliation it is still revealing to analyze the religious composition of each group each has its distinguishing markers but none of the typology groups is religiously uniform and every major religious tradition is represented within multiple typology groups Sunday stalwarts for example are largely Protestants but also include Catholics Mormons Jehovah's Witnesses and Jews and while most solidly secular are religiously unaffiliated their ranks also include Americans who identify as Protestants Catholics and Jews among them. So we're going to I've got a slide here where I put the two I get to the presentation where I put the two tables together because when I was kind of going through this this morning trying to see what I could discern from this very interesting study I'm trying to figure out okay well how does this work and in some ways what is most telling about the typology are not only the questions but which questions people either rank very high on or very low on for example Sunday stalwarts are pretty much defined by participate in church groups now that's that's a little bit separate from attending religious services weekly now groups like Barna have long noted that Barna and also Gallup have long noted that people on surveys say they attend church more often than they actually attend church so those numbers could be quite high but notice the God and country believers and participate in church groups and this is one of the things that we noted during the Trump election that a lot of people who especially during the primaries and during the generals people acted more differently because then you have the pull of the parties but when people when they looked at people who are quote unquote evangelicals who supported Trump early on in the primaries most of those people weren't churchgoers but they were the God and country believers and so now you you sort of have the difference between people for whom nationalism and Christianity have a very tight bond and others for whom their Christianity and their nationalism are a bit separated and you know again I see in the media often played out the strong tie between evangelicals and and Trump voters well once you get down into the details things get quite a bit more complex and so then if you go all the way down to so the your God and country believers you know they don't attend church groups hardly at all diversely devout a little bit more now remember these are traditionally religious but majorities also believe in psychics reincarnation spiritual energies that can be in physical objects that's the the surveyors try attempt to assess this this rather amorphic group that we might call the new age sometimes they'll go to church but you know what kind of church there are churches that that are actually also major in those kinds of things as well there in a sense you've got there there in a sense beyond the main line and you can find them because they're not only let's say inclusive of of sexual minorities like LGBT issues but but they'll also be very they're very much emphasize the look you know God is the God of the Mormons and the Muslims and the Hindus and and they'll they'll very much be sort of on that spectrum but then you get to the somewhat religious groups and you'll see how participation in church groups really stays 000 or 2423 and and so you really see how churches are are very much in many ways often for the they're really convinced and you can see how the really convinced are because they not only will drift into a Sunday service but they'll be on church boards they'll participate in small groups so on and so forth now as we go down the column on the left side say they are somewhat now we get the religious and spiritual thing say that they are very or somewhat spiritual well church people well they'll use the word spiritual but they'll probably mean something different by it and you'll see that even God and country and and they'll spiritual God and country believers less less than one percent of them participate in church groups 91 percent call themselves spiritual 85 percent call themselves religious and the then the diversity of out their spiritual and religious is about the same but now notice where the religious breaks down you go all the way to the non-religious groups okay this is by definition but you look at those who call themselves spiritual even among the solidly secular 22 percent so you could have perhaps Sam Harris in that group say let's look at religious beliefs believe in God as described in the Bible 94 percent stud Sunday stalwarts 92 percent God and country now they believe in God in the Bible but participation in church not necessarily and again this is very consistent with my experience somewhat religious again kind of tails off it's still pretty high 68 believe these are the relaxed religious now again the relaxed religious are say it's not necessary to believe in God as a moral per to believe in God to be a moral person because nobody thinks themselves immoral even people in jail but religion is important to them but few engage in traditional practices now again you get to the religious resistors and they're very low in their belief that the God in the Bible is the word of God and should be taken literally now is just thinking this morning I'll probably have to do a words that fudge video on the word literal I was reading Andrew Sweeney's piece that he just posted on Amazon which was a not on Amazon on medium which was an excellent piece and I noticed that Jordan Peterson just released the two videos from Vancouver on his channel today so those will be talking about those for a bit but notice literally notice how low the literal numbers are though the Sunday stalwarts 54 percent the God in there are issues with this word literal that everybody knows and this is I think part of the reason literalism is a word that we use to fudge okay look at how fast the literal drops off now we're getting into questions of secularity all right say it's necessary to believe in God to be moral notice the Sunday stalwarts are only 62 percent there and that is very much the influence of I think probably quite a bit of preaching where and people who go to church regularly and participate in church groups know how immoral church people are and have come to terms with that but look at the God and country believers 93 percent their nationalism and their religiosity are deeply tied look at the diverse devout say it's necessary to believe in God and be moral 99 percent that's practically the definition of that group and again the group is described here as traditionally religious but majorities also believe in psychics reincarnation and that spiritual energies can be located in physical objects in other words for them even though they've got these practices that would not be permitted in ancient Israel according to the mosaic law well that's I can get into debate that's practically the definition of this group that to be a Bible to the God of the Bible and morality are one thing that's fascinating and then that question just goes nowhere with the rest of the groups believe in heaven there's another interesting one the first two categories highly religious and the relaxed religious and spiritually awake a lot believe in heaven in the 90s all across the board until you get to the non-religious groups some of whom still consider themselves spiritual remember 68 percent say they are spirit somewhat spiritual 22 percent say they are somewhat spiritual belief in heaven drops down to 12 and 4 about belief in hell pretty strong among the highly religious groups quite strong 78 percent among the somewhat religious groups and then down to the non-religious groups five and two very low believe there is spiritual energy located in physical things such as mountains trees and crystals this is the definition of new agers according to them Sunday stalwarts 29 percent you've got some of those in church some of those go to church regularly you know almost 30 percent that's a big number notice the God in country zero fascinating not into the new age thing into their nationalism these are these are very enlightenment people okay this is these are highly secular people so so that's a fascinating number then to the devoutly that's a diversely religious 95 percent well that's practically the definition of that group which leads to such a high number but then go down to the relaxed religious this is obvious how the pollsters differentiated these groups zero relaxed religious are say it's not necessary to believe in God to be a moral person religion is important to them but few engage in traditional practices zero on the new age scale and the relaxedly religious but 99 percent on the spiritually awake again that defines those two groups but look at the religious religion resistors 98 percent say that that's a huge number and less than one percent of the secular so what you really see here is that these words that pew is using to define new age spirituality is really a test of of secularity and you have the highly secular groups being the God and country believers the relaxed religious believers and the solidly secular people sources of meaning such an interesting survey derive a great deal of meaning fulfillment from their religious belief 87 percent of the stall Sunday stalwarts 67 percent of the God and country now I would love to see the of the God and country now I would love to ask them about the way they derive meaning from their nationalistic religious beliefs that would probably be close to 100 for them because being an American is how they derive meaning so they will be deeply invested in politics they will be their presidential candidate can shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and they'll still vote for them there might be I'm sure there's Democrats in there too I don't want to make this as Democrat and Republican thing but that's the level here derive meaning and fulfillment from their religious beliefs 53 percent but now obviously you've been testing for this word religion so now we're going to go to spirit so your non-religious groups are one percent but your relaxed religious is 24 that's still pretty low derive a great deal of meaning fulfillment from spiritual practices such as meditation now I was just chatting with Nathan Carey and we were via email and we're going to do a conversation coming up in a couple of weeks and we were talking about what we mean by meditation there's another word that we use to fudge Christians meditate Buddhists meditate is what's the relationship between Christian and Buddhist meditation now you get into the Dallas Willard camp and this gets very interesting because it gets very interesting so derive a great deal of meaning fulfillment from spiritual practices just as meditation 41 percent of the stall Sunday stalwarts less than 50 percent 24 percent of the God and country believers pretty low 28 percent of the diversely developed pretty low 5 percent of the relaxed religious very low 23 percent of the spiritually awake spirituality doesn't seem to afford a lot of meaning and purpose all of those numbers are low as opposed to religiosity in the top one for whom obviously the churchgoers find it the most meaningful and the most fulfilling Pew does a lot of been a very interesting study so if you go to their website these often get picked up by major news pieces across the spectrum derive a great deal of meaning and fulfillment by being outdoors and experiencing nature now there now here again they're trying to how are we going to deal with the spiritual but not religious crew so outdoors and nature 42 percent Sunday stalwart 39 percent God and country 59 percent diversely devout again traditionally religious but majorities also believe in in psychics reincarnation and its spiritual energy can be located in physical objects 60 percent pretty big number now the relaxed religious and spiritually awake 36 percent and 58 percent it's a pretty big number for the spiritually awake but now 64 percent of the religious resistors most think that organized religion does more harm than good politically liberal and democratic very interesting politically liberal and democratic they love their national parks 42 percent of the solidly secular so contrary to public to popular belief they have feelings too say religion and religious organizations do more harm than good in American society oh more good than harm sorry Sunday stalwarts 86 percent of course of course they're doing good everyone assumes their moral God and country 77 percent you know they churches are important 72 percent 27 percent attend services weekly churches are important we're glad they're there we don't necessarily give them any money we don't necessarily show up on Sunday but we sure want to keep them around 70 percent diversely devout 58 percent 53 percent the church has pretty good reputation amongst the first five groups now it falls off among the non-religious groups your religion resistors and your solidly secular now notice again the solidly secular are the opposite of the new agers these are the people that when you just have to say D prop Chopra and away they run as a vampire from a crucifix okay 29 percent that's almost 30 percent say yeah churches they do some good religious organizations they do some good very interesting say religious beliefs help a lot in family relationships 76 percent religion and family not real high in this survey 76 percent saw it Sunday stalwarts yeah well they believe it's good for their family obviously 54 percent God and country believers I think there's a lot in this question and and if you one of probably the most common areas where people flee from church will be church and family issues almost always when people leave a church it's a divorce it's a family fight it's it's see church fights some you can usually kind of work with a church fight at a church because you're not living with these people but family fights almost impossible to keep going to church in the midst of a family fight it's nearly impossible says religious beliefs help now religious beliefs not spiritual religious beliefs helps a lot in family relationships relaxed religious 21 percent spiritually awake 17 percent religious resistors three solidly secular one so so what do they think helps with families if you were to expand this my guess would be psychology and therapy and counseling because that's where Americans go for their advice with respect to families and marriage listen to the Jordan patient question and answer thing notice how many people bring him those kinds of questions and well a fair amount come to church but usually only know that some come from others but it's often because pastors are kind of free therapists because today if you're going to go see a therapist through your insurance company it's probably a therapist just starting out because all the best therapists don't take insurance you have to pay directly because the best therapists don't need to rely on insurance they've already got a well-established practice there's a few out there that will continue to accept it out of the kindness of their heart but generally speaking when it comes to therapy it takes a lot of money and well there you have it so I just wanted to point out this very interesting survey and when you go through it think about religious spiritual these words that fudge what the definitions mean the the the religious landscape in America is is far more complicated than we usually see reflected in the media again the media likes to promote a narrative of Democrats and Republicans Republicans are people who go to church Democrats aren't people who don't go to church and and they have the media has all these narratives that they keep in terms of dualism and very simplified because the majority of people can continue to follow these stories that are simplified and they're good versus evil they're right versus wrong and if you've got a media that for the most part is dependent upon a marketplace and they are rewarded by gaining high numbers this is the kind of thing you will go down to the most simplistic explanations possible but if you look at again Sunday stalwarts 17 percent of the population not big this is nationwide so you've got relatively unchurched states like on the on the blue coasts you've got highly churched states like in the old south and in the midwest 17 percent are Sunday stalwarts 12 percent are God and country believers it's not big 11 percent the biggest groups in here are the Sunday stalwarts at 17 relaxed religious at 17 and solidly secular at 17 in other words nobody even has 20 percent of the population and what this means is that when we have conversations about spirituality however you define that word and religion people are going to be all over the map so there's a little video I'll either release it on Friday and I'll release my my rough draft for Sunday video today or you know maybe I'll it'll be a special Saturday treat I often don't release videos on Saturday I for those of you who are paying very close attention I do have the I do have the audio only podcast and often when I post videos with YouTube I can nicely kind of say okay I'll post this later because I've noticed often when I post two videos at once it's just the way people work so I'll I'll often separate them but it's easier on the on the audio podcast to just post them both so those of you who have both streams will notice that if you really want to get the inside first look often you'll get the um the audio only podcast will come through right away and I think that's I've got some ideas about how people use their technology so on and so forth so so yeah that's that's it for this video
