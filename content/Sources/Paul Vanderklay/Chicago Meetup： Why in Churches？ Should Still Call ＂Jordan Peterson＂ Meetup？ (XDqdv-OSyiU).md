 Well, we got a special we have a special Conversation today. We're gonna talk about the new Chicagoland meetup and so we have a bunch of people that some of you might know already Joey is part of the Sacramento meetup, but he's from Chicago So he had a big hand in helping getting that one going Sam has been on the channel before and It's easy to find salmon the discord server is pretty active there and Hank Hank Hank I've done a conversation, but we didn't post it So you're you're new to some folks But what what brings all of us together today is our excitement over the new Chicago meetup Chicagoland meetup that started so why don't we? Why don't we start who whose idea was this first was this Joey's idea or? Who really wanted to get this thing going Hank should probably talk about I guess the previous experience with the Jordan Peterson meetup that you had before this even started going. Okay So We started the meetup Jane March of this year unfortunately, it was not as diverse as I'd like it to been because when we did it we did it on as a Facebook group only and so you got people who had common maybe political interests and I Started expressing some dissatisfaction with that because I didn't see it going anywhere and Saw Sam on the on YouTube with Paul and then the discord server got on that and Then Joey was kind enough to create the Chicago discord server and Started pushing for another Jordan Peterson meetup and Paul you were very helpful getting us a church in Wheaton, Illinois That is willing to host it in our first meeting was in November and it went very very well We then did a meetup comm so we're on Facebook meetup comm and and Right now I think we're gonna probably have 10 to 12 people show up at the next meeting and I'm looking forward to it and looking forward to Diverse people coming in with diverse viewpoints and and having some really excellent conversations So Hank Hank, what do you mean by what do you mean by diverse in this case because so often when people hear diverse Their mind goes in certain directions and obviously there was something about what happened in your first attempt that that you wanted to set, right? Well, I Surely don't want it to be political. Okay Although politics may be discussed on a general basis base, you know, and and what's going on in the culture I didn't want it to be completely evangelical. That's my background And so we do have some people with some who came that have some diverse viewpoints I Wanted to be open to discuss I said Sam and I had a lunch and one of the exam brought up is this is this is a meeting where we could discuss some tough things that At Church you can't really discuss You know, sometimes you feel like origin they're gonna read ride you out of the ride you out of the church and communicate you so I Think that these are kind of reasons for thinking Well, there you go So I got to tell you the first meeting went really well We had a diversity of age which is good Yeah, it's a motor folks like me and you had some guys in their 20s and 30s and 40s and that's that's excellent and and and we Started feeling each feeling, you know, what's going on around here and it's starting to have conversations I think as we get to know each other and new people come in and we make them feel welcome that they're they're Opinions and they're in there and their ideas are something we want to hear I think this is something that's really really good because I don't think it's happening While you and I grew up where you had lots and lots of conversations you could have disagreements Disagreements seem to be a problem now because it seems to be instead of having disagreements. It's all at war if I just You know, we have this hierarchy of ideas and we don't agree on everything I ride you out and it's not a way to live People are so different. Why not listen and find out what they What they think and why they think it? So Sam what what well, let's start maybe bringing Joey first Joey a big part of this happened because of this discord server and you you really were the You know at least part of the very small team that got this discord server going what was your vision for this discord server? That's a big question Sorry, I'm having some mic issues because I had to adjust things because we've got leafblowers going outside They're kind of the bane of my recording existence, but we'll work through it. Um So we had such a successful group in Sacramento James who's been on your channel quite a few times Him and I were having a conversation in one of them and we were just talking about how how much value we personally were Finding out of it how much value it seemed like everyone else was getting out of that And the two of us came to the conclusion that Okay, we've done this We're feeling the benefit from it. We're obligated to share this with other people So then the question became how do we do that? Around that same time you change you updated kind of your modus operandi for how you were bringing in new conversations Clearly there was a ton of people who wanted to have more and couldn't reach you because you're one person you had limited time So we had been experimenting with Facebook groups. We've been experimenting with discord channels and we just took We took kind of what we were experimenting with we rolled it out early We rolled it out early I Think I've said this on the channel before but I was like there's no way I could Run a thing where I'm managing 20 to 30 people As of I think this morning we were about at 580 So that grew pretty quick and then we Somebody on the channel. I don't know if it was cord I don't know if it was Jeff, but somebody set up a Google document where everyone could kind of tag where they were in the eyes Oh, that was you. Okay So we were trying to figure out how we can tag where everyone was Chicago came up as a location with quite a few people and I think it just kind of ran from there. So we've also made accessory discord channels for For sorry for Fresno for for The EU I guess Frankfurt is kind of the location that we're using but it's also includes the Netherlands So we've had a few in-person meetups there as well I know we have some success with some people down in Tucson, Arizona meeting up Hopefully we can keep that going. Hopefully we can keep that Growing in terms of starting lots of little meetup groups because I think that's where a lot of the value comes from this is like Okay, it's great that I can talk to Sam from from Sacramento to Chicago It's great that we had all these different things in common that were cool But ultimately I'm not going to see Sam in person very often. I'm not going to develop that next-level Comradery that you only get from a group that's in person No, no Sam. You've been you've been pretty active on the discord. How is sort of the the nexus between Getting this meetup groups going connected up with the the discord server for you Sure one thing that Hank and I have talked about and that we sort of talked about in our first meetup here in Chicago Was just the value of face-to-face Interaction and how kind of irreplaceable that is the discourse really fun because you hop on there and it's some random combination of people who have and who knows what the topic will be and and so that That's fun in its own way and you start to interact with people over and over again And you have something of a relationship with those people over time but having people who live near you that you'll interact with face-to-face and Kind of hopefully be able to build a community. That's a little bit more I don't know durable and rooted then sort of an online community was something that we wanted to do, too I don't view the discord as in competition really in any way with these live meetups in many ways They enhance each other and sort of the discord server hopefully makes more in-person meetups possible but I don't think that the that you will get everything out of an online Community as you can get from an in-person one So for you Sam, I mean obviously you're You're one of our when you're one of our special heretics we have heretics of many ways, but you actually have a confessional heresy that sure many many Christians in in the world often don't get a chance to meet how how for you is What what are you really hoping for from this meetup? sure, so I mean I I grew up going to Evangelical churches and was with in a lot of like Bible studies small group, you know sort of things That's been a regular part of my life for a long time and I'm in one right now through my local church and so I I always like having one of those but sometimes it feels like everyone knows the bounds of the conversation topic that that's allowed and to a certain amount that makes a lot of sense and That it's good to channel things into sort of a small bandwidth of acceptable topics but sometimes you want to talk about things outside that too and So the thing that got me really excited because I learned about the full idea from you sort of talking about your Sacramento one in various videos on your channel and stuff like that Michael man, that makes me jealous That sounds that sounds wonderful. I wish I had one of those it's sort of like kind of like a Bible study equivalent but it's not Officially church sanctioned. It's sort of in a weird in between and Honestly, I wouldn't mind if we talked a little bit about figuring out exactly what we are Because I tried explaining this to my parents recently and I was like, ah, well that doesn't quite get it across I don't know exactly what words to use to describe exactly what it is. We're doing Then and Joey for you who We had we had a guy show up from our meetup on a Sunday morning a couple of weeks ago And he said well Joey Joey said he was gonna be here. I said well, he's not here now I said we have the meetup this afternoon and oh, oh, that's what he meant so and Joey and one of our early conversations about the value of meetups and You as someone who doesn't go to church at all You know mentioned that you thought having it in a church was important which which actually for getting the Wheaton group going was important because I was able to use a contact that had from the Wheaton CRC and The pastor was willing to bring this to council and they were willing to host it And I was happy to hear that the pastor went to the first meeting So, you know why why for you is you know this church connection important? Which might seem weird to people for someone from someone who doesn't go to church Yeah, that's gonna be that's gonna be a difficult one as well. Um, I think part of it So part of this is age I'm probably like I'm a mid-millennial Grew up without church, but I not only grew up without church I'd say I grew up without any sacred spaces at all You know, there's the whole meme about safe spaces Which I think is what they're trying to recreate when they're when they're creating those in college Areas, but I don't think that that does any good because that truncates I don't think that that does any good because that treats a sacred space like a therapy session We have I guess elements of that because essentially what you say in our groups is is confidential, you know It's it's a closed thing. We don't record the conversations We don't put them online because people are experimenting with things. They're playing with stuff We're I've said tons of stuff in the group that I believe in a sense, but don't really believe it's like I'm what? How can I describe what I'm thinking but I got to put it into words and so a church Because of the inherentness of the building because of our collective background in Jordan Peterson just kind of understanding the greater meaning of things I think it emerges that we behave in a slightly different way Certainly like the things that you would say aggressively to your friends the arguments that you would get into on Twitter the little soundbite stuff That you heard on Fox News or MSNBC We will repeat those but we'll kind of do it in a way that we know we're doing it We'll say something that doesn't doesn't really illustrate our point But then we'll let other people come back at us I Think that's part of it but And then ultimately it just it creates something where a communities already exists And it gave us something to do to help people who were being kind to us you know that Livingston's has been so grace graceful and allowing us to to meet and to meet in their building in their facility and Under kind of their banner essentially and we're so happy to return the favor when we get the opportunity Hank how I know that you guys in Chicago had had difficulty Finding a church that was willing to host you which I personally think five years from now There's a lot of churches that are going to be kicking themselves Because they would have had the opportunity to host such a group but passed it by Hank speaking from the position of a of a guy who's who's Been going to church and been heavily involved in in church for a long time How do you see this whole thing in terms of what why would what would you say to a pastor in terms of why pastors shouldn't You know just be willing to do this but eager to do this Well, I think we can look and see that the church over the millennia changes Okay Whether you read, you know church history. I'm reading Tom Holland's book right now Okay, there's a change I I was involved in one of those changes in the mid 70s when Bill Hybels Started Willow Creek and I was in the music ministry in 1975. So I've been dating myself He saw a need the need was is that The suburban the areas that just went suburbanized There was a disconnect between the churches and the people that were living there And he went door to door and asked people what they want on a church In essence he created a church that would cater to their to them coming Okay, that was wonderful in the 70s 80s and 90s, but it's changed Millennials don't want a smoke show they don't want All the glitz okay. They don't want all the beautiful people up there singing about how much they love Jesus and praise music And so church is changing and I think churches are losing the Millennials And they know it but they don't they want to keep on talking in their specialized language In that God language when we watch Jordan Peterson with the guy from Liberty, he couldn't stop talking the God language And the problem is if you don't know what the God language is as a person who I'm talking to how can we have a conversation? We have to go deeper. They have a conversation People know that their lives, you know We're being told all the time and why new atheism is being thrown aside that nihilism doesn't work So people are looking at religion whether it's JK Chesterton who said if you stop believing in God You're not going to stop believing. You'll just believe in anything And CS Lewis, there's a lot of wisdom over the years Well, in essence Paul, you are now a megachurch pastor your megachurch Is with this 12,700 people that follow you and your little church plants are these Jordan Peterson meetup groups with with And I think it's important to have them. I think that People would not normally come to a church and they would get turned off by a lot of the artifices of of the church Still need meaning and want to hear about it Still need meaning and want to hear about it, but they don't also want somebody to be ramming the four spiritual laws They want to be heard And and there has to be a discussion and at times I'm more More God will work as God will work It's not up to me to put my hand on your shoulder and say brother. You need to come to the Lord That's good. That's God's job. Not my job But Mike what I can do is certainly have conversations with people and listen I have a deep respect for Sam and others in our group and I think that The more that we can have these conversations the more that we can Could understand the other person's point of view. Maybe I change It's always you've been married you change Okay Sometimes that change is real rough But you change You know, there we say 30 years of marriage five of them good you know, it's it's But you know, I wouldn't change a minute of it because it's made me a better person than I am today than I was 30 years ago, so I I'm excited because I I See a diverse when I see a diversity of people we have one guy who's a Buddhist. Okay We have Sam who Sam I love Sam. He triggers Esther all the time. Okay, Sam I love you because Esther just goes nuts. He flies off and I of course I'm enjoying it immeasurably It but I think what happens is when we ride people out We're basically saying I want to be in this little holy ground and only what I believe and And if you don't believe exactly what I believe Well, you know what? I'm the defender of the faith. You're out of here. That's I just don't see how that works It's it's I didn't marry my wife to have her think the same way I think and so I like I like this So, you know and I enjoy your conversations and I In seeing young men especially younger men who are struggling with how do I fit in? Okay, what do I do in the anger? You know or the or the anxiety or or you know that the sense of despair I think that what you and I present you more so than I is. Hey, there's there's a way through this There's a way that you can go through it That's what I'm hoping for So much of the conversation now or just general conversations are set up in a way That they go in a direction and then as soon as you hit the slightest barrier the conversation is supposed to stop That's not how people learn that's not how people grow that's not how that's not how I understand Paul's beliefs better That's not how you understand Sam's beliefs better. So it's like I'm not going to be able to understand Better that's not how you understand Sam's beliefs better. So it's like we We know we're here. We know we're going to be in this room for two hours We're all going to keep asking each other questions. We're all going to try and not get angry We're going to try and like actually understand each other We it's just so much more rich than anything else that we have access to I think podcasts open a lot of this up because they have the three-hour conversation format where it's like Oh, wow When these people really start asking each other questions and really start exploring things There's so much interesting stuff under there We can do that with each other and then this is that's what these these groups for me give me an opportunity to do and part part of what's so cool is that what we had with um Mainstream media is you have you know, very narrow band with talking heads Experts on things I have learned so much I mean my my channel has had many randos and after talking to you know a few people of a little bit of status in many ways I prefer the randos because I learned so much more because randos are far freer to say what's on their minds say what they think and and you can actually get a better view Of of what's going on out there in the world? I think I think another thing that that's interesting about this is that This isn't like So associated with church where it feels like an evangelism Project right? It's not like oh, we're going to watch a jordan peterson video But first you have to listen to our 15 minute gospel presentation And we'll hound joey Every, you know end of every medium ask him. Where is that? You know, it's some things that That joey and anyone else who that any stage of faith can come to for their own reason and there's a certain level of authenticity and honesty about that That is sort of different than the way churches have previously kind of related to the edges of the the non-church world And that it's an equal footing that brings us together and that we can have our own motivations and our own goals and the Own topic that we have filled enough in our heads that we want to talk about and and that's just just that's fine And a freedom to talk at our at our last meetup someone said something which I won't say here But there was just silence in the room because you know such words are and then frankly, you know, um, Our shouldn't be said in in in many places but this person had the you know, at least had the felt freedom to look around the room and say something and i've You know when i'd run bible studies in the past, I would tell people I would say, you know I want this to be a place where you can if you honestly believe something. I would rather you say it Because then it's out there on the table and and and you know, we can we can deal with it If if you don't say it Well, what what are we doing here in this space? And so The meetings have been places where people could could speak their honest truth whatever others in the room felt about it and You know to to know and be known is something that we deeply deeply want I feel like it's marketing free too. Um a lot of the the mega churches, um that we alluded to I've i've started to gain a different appreciation for them. I don't know that like I Would never attend one. They're not my thing, but I see why people go to them But I see why people are turned off from them as well. They're advertising they're marketing Not gimmicks, but they're marketing entities that their purpose is to grow and attract new members and they're gonna they're gonna Select for people that have a certain cluster of personality traits that maybe benefit the most from that kind of group Um, every single church cannot follow that except that same model living stones would not benefit from that model It's just not the right not the right location not the right demographic people that are in there It's not that like it doesn't have that room for growth. It doesn't have that that room for parking So then with with a group like this a jordan peterson group No one's ever no one's giving me a survey saying on a scale of one to ten How much do you accept jesus into your life? Like that doesn't make sense So no one's ever asked. Um Yeah, we're doing we're doing something cool we're doing something different, um I've i've kind of gained a reputation on the discord server as like i'm an atheist like that's where i'm at Um, I never thought I would be stepping foot foot into a church to do just about anything besides go to a wedding or a funeral And you know here we are two years later and uh, it's something else So Well The tie on it what joey said Churches were meant to be communities and in communities you have people who have very diverse ideas and what's I think happened is sometimes people sort of Stuff things down that they're questioning Um and You know what another thing that triggers people is someone like john walton. Um John is someone that paul knows and sam knows he he comes out of the eaglet jungle background He basically said well, we need to review genesis One and two based on a lot of archaeological things um Boy did he start up a hornet's nest? um But for years I gotta tell you as a guy we've been a christian for 44 years Genesis one two and three just didn't make sense to me I read it and say no, no Hold it. You have adam and eve then you have cain and abel and then you have Cain killing abel and then cain freaking out that somebody else might kill who's the somebody else? Where did they come from? Okay I'm reading it. I'm reading it as a book Hold on stop. Okay um and No, hank hank, you gotta understand the world was made in six days god rest on the seventh day because At the time I didn't realize that this was a response to darwinism that the early church didn't they didn't see that as a creation story they saw it as a as god coming down and ruling and We can't we we don't have these conversations because when we we have these conversations people get very It's funny a friend of mine who's a drummer at a church we're talking and people are a little upset and I said so rich Tell me does this idea of The earth being created in six days or not being created six days in fact, you know, it doesn't affect me at all I don't really care and he's a he's a strong believer and all of a sudden people just because they respected rich they they got quiet Because he said I I just don't care And this this needs to stop we need to be talking about things that are deeper, okay, and there's a lot of He also happens to be a therapist so he understands he's seeing a lot of what we're talking about he's seeing people that are having issues And I just think that a lot of times when I create a silo and I say joey you have to fit in my atheist silo and sam you have to fit in my Heretic silo and paul has to fit in my double predestination silo. Okay I'm actually making you guys smaller than what you are Okay, i'm taking image bearers of god in my mind and making them so that I can colonize them and say well now I can I I have I have a handle on joey. I have a handle on sam. I have a handle on paul You know, I don't have a handle on nothing Okay, I I have nonsense Because people surprise us all the time and I I think that's That's the wonder of life is finding out there's someone you've known for 20 years Is a lot different than what you thought they were Now jordan peterson's been out of action now for the last number of months and part of what we deal with is that we've got these meetups that are called jordan peterson meetups and jordan peterson is himself sort of a he's obviously a Become a polarizing figure there are I was just talking to someone yesterday here in sacramento And he's he's been to one of our meetups and he was saying boy I'd really it's a certain friend that i'd like to get to the meetup, but boy just having jordan peterson's name on it I don't know if he'd come Whereas others it is obviously attracted and I you know encouraged him. I said, you know, we Ironically jordan peterson isn't sort of the topic of conversation really in our meetup He he sort of was this flag around which we could find each other and then we began having conversations which were very open and respectful and free and productive and so You know he's What what do you think we do now with you know? We don't know what's going to happen with jordan over the next six months or a year if he's going to Return to the public stage if he's going to be absent. Um You know is this How do we how do we negotiate the relationships between this our groups and And whatever happens to this real life human being whose name we borrowed without asking permission So hope we don't get sued Well, I was hoping you were going to answer that for us. Um so So I was thinking about that like joey brought up marketing So how do we find the sort of people who would be interested in it? So our first chicago meeting had nine people A majority of them were people who had found us through paul's various Ways, you know people who are frequent paul video watchers and maybe on the discord server or not And then some people were associated with the the church that that we were meeting that it was kind of both of those two things um But that doesn't yield much new opportunity for finding Other people who genuinely might be interested in this sort of thing and would like this sort of thing, you know, who knows? Maybe there's you know appetite for multiple chicago locations Um and and various locations all over the place But how do we reach new people and how do we communicate to them? What it is that we are so that they even know what it is to look for I think that's a question that I have been thinking about and I don't really know I'm i'm not as concerned with the uh The outreach like the saying oh we might have a thousand people in chicago that want to do this But we can't get to all of them. Uh, the slow growth has been healthy for us um 580 is a lot of people to have on discord, but they're not all on at the same time But if we were at 5 000, it would be completely unmanageable Um Now we've got groups in multiple places. Uh, I think we just kind of do the same kind The lead by example type thing is i'll post this on my own facebook. I'll be like i've had good luck with this in sacramento I have maybe 50 to 75 friends in chicago Maybe one or two of them would be interested in joining this specific wheat and meetup Maybe if a whole bunch of people are coming from, you know, the far north suburbs or the far south suburbs They'll say well, we'll just have our own meetup instead and then We've had good luck too with our fresno group. We have a great relationship with them. They're close by we have a great relationship With our alameda group. Um, we have a much smaller group up in grass valley, which for people who don't know that's towards tahoe So like all around us there's smaller groups who interact with us. Sometimes they show up at our meetup Sometimes we show up at theirs and uh, it's a great time, but we don't want to Ruin what we're doing by turning it into a too much of a corporate entity based on growth too fast Sam and I both have a background in software Same company actually, but but you know, like there's there's a there is something lost when you grow too quickly um, and then A lot of people know I have an interest in cults There is something cultish about things that grow too quickly too and i'm not actually interested in either one of those as much as I joke around about it What what do you think about this hank, I mean I what's I mean you you said it right out there's And I noticed this right from the start. There's this weird similarity to what we're doing which looks like church planting somehow and I You know, I personally like small church Because it affords face to face belly to belly as one of my friends tells me Um, you know how I mean our relationship with the jordan peterson name is is kind of interesting and how do you see this thing going? Forward you're a business guy. You think it's you think strategically well, I i'm going to go with joey a little bit Growing too fast creates its own issues. Okay um If it happens to grow somewhat quickly because of the different ways we're trying to through this video through Meet up through facebook through other ways of getting people to come That's great we could always split up and be smaller groups, you know If we get 20 we can be 10 10 and people want to they live on the north shore of chicago They can maybe go to somewhere like north brook or they're in the south. They can go to oak forest. That's wonderful um I think the the I think this is going to be helpful and I think that uh I think this is something that's very needed. I think You know, I was turned on to jordan peterson years ago and then of course through the algorithm. I saw found paul and I think there's more to discuss. I mean verveky is doing interesting things for vicki and pajol. He had a great conversation Um benjamin voice does some very interesting things in my in my world rebel wisdom is wonderful There's a lot of things out there if if especially with youtube and podcasts That people can bring up and share and say have you listened to this person here's something, you know Here's some ideas. Of course, I think the most interesting person in the world is joe. Um The guy the guy is unique, um, but There's And without this we would have never met a guy like joe would never met a guy like sam or joey or or Or luke or all these other wonderful people mary, um, and I think that It it makes me Think more, you know, uh Things that come up it just it not just think more but just change I don't want to be It's you know heading towards 60. I don't want to be an ossified guy that this is all I you know The way things are the way things are leave me alone Okay, that's boring. Uh, I hate boring. Um So 60 60 is also maybe not the best time to become a revolutionary out of nowhere. So there's got to be somewhere in between Hey, I got my jacob here. Sure. There you go Moses led him out of egypt at 80. So uh, thanks still getting started Hey abraham was all too. Okay, um You know, so It I i'm looking forward to this and as we grow we can Because there's People who have maturity the pastor at we can at the weaton church Is got a lot of maturity we could find ways to Either separate and create another group Or create subgroups where we all get together um But but i'm hoping to grow because like I said my concern is when I heard the one young man on with with paul and and I put a little thing saying please come to our meetup group and I really meant it because man I get the anger I get the anger. Okay, and when when you're older you've worked through all these anger things Okay, or you hopefully have or if you haven't you're you're in trouble but A lot of times men have anger. They just don't know what to do with it And part of it is talking and having other men say it's okay to be angry, but we need to move forward with that and You know we come from backgrounds joe joey. We come from backgrounds where There is a certain behavior expectation That you have to have You know, and i'm not banging on my my church or other churches, but there's why I like paul so much is That tell me the truth And sometimes we lie, you know How's it going? Jesus is wonderful in my life as i'm having all these other problems and and i'm going over here and doing this and Jesus isn't so wonderful in my life um, we need to have honesty and when paul brought up and i'll That some guys said something that shocked everyone well, sometimes that happens in real conversations where there's trust Um, well I I I love I love what you have to say here here hank I think it is I think it is needed and one of the you know, one of the strains that vervecky I loved his conversation with jonathan peugeot today and one of the you know, one of the things he keeps bringing up is you know, we need you know, we need wisdom and wisdom is part of what happened I think because of The corporations figured out that one of the best ways to um shake money out of the population was to divorce the generations From each other and keep them not talking to one another and so we have you know All these names for different generations and in churches, they often worship separately So we have churches for young people and churches for old people and people like this music and people like that music One of the key things that happens in generations is in fact wisdom where You know is is there someone who has done something that you want to do? Is there someone who has? Struggled through something that you're struggling with now They might not be of a different age if they might be younger or older than you but when people get together They can help each other and you know, one of the one of the things that i've seen in the meetups has been Just the sharing of wisdom, you know, I I hear again and again on rebel wisdom on many of these channels Oh, we need community. We need community. Oh, you know what? You know what community takes it requires time It requires presence and it requires commitment And and that has even fallen out of churches where in the past, you know 40 50 years ago If you were a member of a church you came every week and you showed up to volunteer and so on and so forth and That that commitment built community And what has happened in churches and with many other things I show up when I feel like it well, you know what it's the You don't just show up for yourself You show up when you don't feel like it for the other person that needs you there because they might just Something happened in their life and they need someone and you're there and so I You know, I right away saw in these meetups You know why why churches why pastors well Churches and pastors have certain skill sets that Whatever you believe in terms of their doctrine or some of their other beliefs They have those skill sets and we need those skill sets today because in many ways they're dropping From our culture and we're showing the signs of of their absence Yeah, I certainly think that's a great point Yeah, a subject that came up on the discord server the other day someone asked about like the Freemasons and sort of maybe perhaps wondering about conspiracy theories about them but honestly one of the things that we're kind of like is like the rotary or the elk or the moose or like those sort of you know uh Fraternity men's groups things and people in their 30s were about the age when they would start joining those groups My dad's really involved with rotary And they're struggling they have a huge generational problem and they're acutely aware of it and they're you know scratching their head and trying to do everything that they can to recruit millennials mainly and And those groups to varying degrees i'm not saying we need like masonic Initiation rituals, but they had some amount of commitment to them. That was part of what kept them going And and those sorts of groups just seem to be completely foreign to even the the landscape of possibilities for the average millennial But there are groups like that where you get together and you do some charitable cause or you know uh plan global conspiracies or what have you, you know, so um, I think that some parallel to what it is that we're doing is that these groups are sort of like that but they're focused on You know intellectual discussion philosophy religious topics things like that And we all kind of have the sense that it was jordan peterson who cleared the landscape for these things to happen Right. I think I think a lot of people felt this way watching his videos if you're an atheist you're like Oh, man, maybe religion actually I can understand it more than I realize with evolutionary biology and psychology Or if you were religious you're like, oh man I didn't realize that I could understand what I was doing with evolution religion and biology and stuff like that And so it created the shared landscape that was the bridge for people to come to without needing as much history in common as churches normally sort of requires and so it's like we're something between The masonic lodge and the church group and rotary and youtube and I still am trying to figure this out It I have a question for joey, um You I think you and some of the guys at um, you're meeting up have done Uh work at paul's church. Is that correct? That is correct. Yeah That's a it's a wonderful thing that I was a rotarian and Part of that was the idea. Okay We we have some lady who was poor she needed her house cleaned up and painted right something like that And after you were done you felt great about it I've made somebody happy. I've made somebody Um just a little happier in a in a tough situation I think that's wonderful There's a lot we've lost um, I I grew up mowing lawns I I Lived on a cul-de-sac so I kind of had like a little clustered community of people who knew me and trusted me enough to do that but uh So many of the jobs that previously teenage teenagers, especially teenage boys We could talk about teenage girls as well later, but teenage boys used to be the grunt workers of their neighborhoods Uh, you shovel the driveways you'd you mow the lawns and now all of that stuff got outsourced to people who you know Drive up leaf. They're not part of you Generally your landscaper is not part of your actual neighborhood That's just how it works Um, so now this gives people an opportunity to work with their hands This gives people an opportunity to chop down a tree this gives people an opportunity to lift heavy things and do do different stuff like that like um I've i've been into this like weird sport called slacklining and now there's people from this group who want to get into this Weird sport with me just it's a something physical something re re engaging with the body Uh re engaging with the mind re engaging with the neighborhood the community all these things kind of are interwoven um A lot of us a lot of us younger people were very much encouraged to uh Sports were for jocks If you're intelligent you're supposed to focus on your brain and you kind of let your body go You kind of let your community go and all all that matters is information and data um, but again Sam probably knows this as well information and data doesn't do anything by itself It has to be implemented. It has to be has to be interacting with something real and something alive So that I think that's where we're at too I think that's something that this group this group this extended group this discord group The youtube group does is like facebook youtube all of these meetup.com All of these technical tools were great. They gave us a tool To get in touch with each other, but we had we were only using them the way The way that was most obvious we were using them to post our pictures We were using them to share little updates to impress our friends But we were not using them to create the community that they were capable of creating so now Sam sam said we're creating a bridge in between things. That's exactly why we chose the the name bridges of meaning We're trying to create bridges in between all these different groups so that you can create the network so that you as an individual Can express all these different aspects of yourselves that self that needs to be expressed in order for you to be that For lack of a better term that divine individual in your own life I That's something I felt the lack of I was Before I was getting involved in this group before I was inspired by several of my close friends before I was Really living my own life I was living up. I was living a story that other people railroaded me on for my entire life I've escaped from that now. I get to cross my own bridges now. I get to go to my own groups now I get to be my own person And I have a lot of people to be thankful for that and that's not just people within this this jordan peterson group or this discord server or this bridges and meaning group, but Those people are definitely there and they've definitely allowed me access to the tools that I Without them would still be incomplete We're getting we're coming on an hour here and I think that's probably a good good goal for for this conversation Maybe just each of you give a pitch as to perhaps why someone like this might either want to Attend a group if you can find one And you can find you know, look for them on meetup.com you can go to the in the links below There's a link to the bridges of meaning discord server That's where joey joy came up with that name bridges of meaning and we can help groups fine But or maybe even even start a group in your area will help groups start. So why? So maybe why you think this is important or what how it's helped you and and then we'll wrap it up So Sure, I guess i'll go first um, I think that I mean I enjoy few things more than a really good conversation and I think that there are a lot of people who feel that way And it can be hard to find I have some really good long-term friends I can still those conversations with but those are you know only happen as often as they do So having a group intentionally devoted to having conversations is something that I was really looking for And like I can listen to my own thoughts when i'm having trouble falling asleep But the part the cool thing about other people is they're not yourself and they think things that you don't think And challenge you when you say something stupid or that doesn't make sense and all those things So if that's something that you're looking for and if you listen to paul's channel, probably you are then um And if you live in chicago, well, then there's probably a link below To get involved and if you don't live in chicago or central california or something like that um I think that you know, just start making noise And uh the the people will come around there's enough people on the discord server where if you start saying that's what you want or or have a conversation with paul or or joey or or luke or someone else i'm sure that you can get the What's the thing where a nuclear bomb needs that amount the critical map to get the group to happen? So so that's what i'm looking for That's what i'm hoping for from this group in a purely selfish way is to have those conversations that I really value and really remember but Are hard to find I'll go next. Um I I agree with everything sam said and in community I think that We need to be in community and we need to have people And part of that is as we're having discussions and you're building the trust and you're building a relationship You know sam and I went out to lunch. It was wonderful Okay, i'm sure we'll do other things Um, I paid for lunch sam's going to pay for the beer that we'll have after the next meeting I'm german paul so I can drink. Okay um very german, um And you know remember what you bridget kippling said there's humans and then there's germans. I've lived that um so The the idea community is we have to be in community and what i've seen said so much by Talking to my daughter's friends who go to college is that lack of community that we had When we went to college when we did things together Stupid things as college kids so i'll never tell my daughter I did. Um I don't know if I told my wife. Um, but The the idea is is that there was a community there were friendships that were built. I've had these friendships of um, Sam met one bruno Bruno who goes to our group. We've been friends for 40 years Okay He's done things at my house. He's a builder. I've helped him out with stuff Uh, it's it's just been a wonderful relationship and Relationships are just so doggone important Joey why don't you wrap it up? Uh, okay. Well At the risk of sounding too dramatic. Um These groups are the things that were promised to me but never delivered Uh, these are the conversations that I want to have on online forums, but can't that I want to Get into arguments with people on twitter and learn from them But won't the things that you try to get out of people when you're having a conversation on facebook But can't the things that college could never provide because college Overselected for age. So I never you never had the conversation. It was always too much of a hierarchy There was a teacher and there were students Now We have that multi-generational People who are engaged interested And want they just want more they want they want that meaning that's I guess that's the word that keeps coming up I think I think the bridge or not the the maps of meaning work Jordan peterson did was more important than his 12 rules for life, even though 12 rules was more popular uh, there's There's the meaning crisis that we've talked about and this is Not the solution to the meaning crisis in your personal life, but this is the kind of thing that finally Gave me the tools to feel like i'm working on it and that's fantastic. It feels great. Um And it's and it's free and it's super easy and it's like it's so Yeah, it is and so thank you joey and stay on the line. We'll we'll just i'll just end the recording But I I appreciate each of you. It's been Again, these last two years. I can't believe it's only been two years We started our first meetup in january of 20 of 2018 We'll have our two year we'll have to have a party or something in in january 2020 a birthday party for the group But it's you know through Through doing these youtube videos And the meetup groups You know, i've i've met each of you some of you in person and maybe one of these days i'll i'm very much wanting At some point to be able to get out to the shit Chicago and meet with you guys in person. That would be great but I I deeply appreciate each of you and what you're doing and I I really want that, you know, I really want to see that meeting take off and have lots more people be able to have a group that they can trust and Gain wisdom within and um, and just you know find a lot of life So thank you all and those of you who watched thanks for watching
