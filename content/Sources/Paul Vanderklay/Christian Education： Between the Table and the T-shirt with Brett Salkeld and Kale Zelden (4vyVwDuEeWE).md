 What's the line? The devil has had the money long enough. Let's see what God can do with it. There we go. There's our introduction to Christian education. Right after you hit the record button. I did already and I ain't editing. This is Paul and I've got two friends with me. I've got Brett and Kale and this is our second three-way conversation and we've been talking via email what we want to talk about because I love having these two guys on because I think there's a chemistry here and Brett wants to talk about Christian education. Now I'm a product of Christian education. The Dutch Calvinists, the Christian Reformed Church is huge in today's schools. Almost everywhere a Christian Reformed community of any substance was planted, the first thing they would plant is Christian education. So that's huge with us and we always had Catholic schools around us. Kale teaches at a Catholic institution and we've got some other news stories about this but Brett is working on this stuff so we're going to let him lead off. Yeah well so Paul just sent an email saying like the last time we got together it was fun so should we do it again and what do we want to talk about and I'm working on a book for Catholic teachers and I thought well Kale works in a Catholic school and in my ecumenical dialogue work I've encountered a lot of Reformed Christians who tell me you know you should learn more about how the Reformed have thought about Christian education because they've done sort of maybe more systematic thinking on this than the vast majority of Christian denominations and so I thought well that might be an interesting conversation between the three of us and then Paul you sent some wild news stories and some other things so we thought there's probably enough material here for you know a good 90 minutes at least so what's our must-be-done-by time here? 5 15 5 20-ish. Oh good because it's only one o'clock here so I'm ready to go. Yeah we're on three different times though. Paul I'll start going like this when it's like I'm catching the heat so I'm good. But basically like just two hours from now for Kale. Yeah Max Max yeah all right all right so Brett what are you writing about? Oh so okay so I'm writing a book about a concept that I don't know how many people have heard it but in Catholic education circles it's it's and in Canada in particular I don't know as much about the states it's caught on called curriculum permeation and it I was first introduced to it when I was designing a course to teach for Catholic teachers at our local Catholic college and I went to the school board to consult with them what they'd like to see in a in a course for Catholic teachers teachers that they would want to hire and they said curriculum permeation and I said oh okay what's that? So I actually I learned about it while teaching the course and the basic idea is something like look there's no neutral place from which to teach any subject like even math there's certain presuppositions you're going to bring to your teaching of any area at all. Math, art, history, science and so the goal in a Catholic school should be for teachers to be able to teach every single subject from a specifically Catholic point of view. So the the criticism of Catholic schools right is it's like it's it's just a it's just a public school with a cross on the wall and a religion class and in Canada we um I mean there's people we have some publicly funded Catholic schools in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Ontario and lots of people who want to see them gone say well you could just go to your normal you know public school and then we could just tack on a religion class and that would that would be the same thing like you'd still because it's in it's in our it's in our history that we have rights as Catholics to a Catholic education. It was part of getting Quebec in on confederation was to give minority religious school rights right and people say well your your rights would be met uh in this other way and so part of the push is like actually no it wouldn't actually if if the whole if the whole framing of education is secular and then you tack on a religion class what you're actually saying is religion is an interesting option that some people are into and we're we're okay with that if they keep it to themselves which is not which doesn't actually give religious minorities the rights to have their children educated in their own religious tradition it actually severely undermines your ability to communicate your faith your children because the whole structure says um yeah this is a neat optional extra for people of a certain sort of bent you know maybe that's ethnic maybe that's personality but it has nothing to do with what's true and this is the concern that religious minorities have is they think certain things are true and they want to communicate to that that to their children of course the secular wing thinks certain things are true too like that religion maybe isn't that important and should be kept private that's that's a truth claim that's being reinforced in in the way religion is treated in public schools um but they'll pretend that that's not what they're doing so so so my my book is like two halves the first half is like this theoretical sort of exploration of like there's no neutral here guys um you're going to teach something from some point of view and everyone's got their commitments and and let's not pretend that religious people are sort of um and religious schools are the only ones doing this and and and in fact that's not brainwashing but pretending that you don't have a point of view pretending that you're neutral is actually much closer to brainwashing than saying hey here's our perspective and we're going to teach from that and and you know being honest about it then the second half of the book is really an exploration of one subject after another so okay so if in theory we can teach math from a catholic point of view what what does that look like what what are the catholic presuppositions of math what are catholic applications you know um and i talk about i say content and context so uh some things have more content right like literature and the arts you're going to have more catholic content but but even something like math where there's not a lot of catholic content i mean maybe you can talk about some famous catholic mathematician or something um but whether or not you've got a lot of content you've always got a context and so uh that that's that's the second half of the book is walking through content catholic content and catholic context in health, phys ed, social studies, history, math, science, uh literature and the arts Wow i feel like i was just so when i went to calvin college one class that everyone had to take i went i actually managed a way to get around it but was c-poll which was um christian perspectives on learning which basically is the entire speech you gave right there brett because the entire christian reformed day school there's an organization that is that has at least i don't know their current status uh christian schools international that this has been their perspective it's uh it's connected with abram kiper who was this dutch polymath who both founded the free university of amsterdam led a split off the state church and became prime minister of the netherlands founding the the pillarization movement which which basically afforded different lanes as we'd say in our modern parlance with respect to this but the idea behind that was exactly what you laid out a certain degree of presuppositionalism that all subjects must be taught there is no neutral space i you just basically laid out the whole thing i'm just blown away well this is why people keep telling me that i'm not a good teacher i'm not a good well this is why people keep telling me i need to learn more from the reform so it seems we've got some yeah some common common ground here but i've done a little looking i haven't found like the book on on you know the the reformed christian day schools that would that would lay that out but that might be an interesting i'll look around for you you mean like the way that like saint ignatius handles the studio or ratiorum from the jesuit perspective brett where he had something like that would be comprehensive yeah yeah yeah here here's here's like the blueprint for how we do this yeah um yeah because i mean i'm i i'm leaning on like catholic tradition but i'm also operating in a in a context that the you know ratiorum wasn't written in right i mean sort of the bigger question in the background culturally is sort of religious pluralism and its relationship with the state and secularity and who gets to say what's what i mean the the irony well i don't know if it's irony maybe it's a little ironic is like you know catholics catholics are always very worried and christians in general post-modernity you know so and basically i'm making a post-modern argument right i mean i'm saying like yeah that's why i wanted to i wanted to jump in on that yeah you know because it's you know i i have sort of two questions um you know what was the sort of the the standpoint assumptions of you know the the really um the building out of of the u.s catholic church um primarily from the big city standpoint it sort of spreads out um what was the original sort of thinking about thinking with those schools in terms of curriculum etc um and then secondly you know uh if if paul you know is is a product of christian reform day schools and that whole sort of culture why are we here right and and you know paul you have said on a couple of occasions that something stopped working and and so the question that that i think i have is you know um what stopped working you know what you know what what what changed um because it sounded like it was a pretty pretty solid and well thought out model um so what changed i don't know you go first brett i gotta think about that question because it's a hard question yeah i mean i i don't have a really solid answer but it's a question yeah it's not a trick question yeah i'm thinking through this no i think it's a good question okay so i mean this might be completely wrong but here's here's where my mind goes right i've met a handful of people who are now like in their 80s and 90s i've given parish talks um on a few things where a few people in their 80s and 90s asked questions that were clearly the product of a really integral holistic well thought through catholic education um and i've sort of been sort of like stopped in my tracks because i'm used to speaking at a certain level and there was there was there was a woman in a small town in saskatchewan who asked a question that showed a knowledge of like christian history and like the history of a certain question in moral theology and she had like learned it in grade eight and like i know college grads who've never heard of it i can't even remember specifically when it was right now but i just remember being sort of stopped in my tracks and so i mean there there was some there was something pretty solid in at least some places i wonder if part of what happened is um in those times and places there was a there was a cohesive catholic subculture that was quite distinct from the broader culture and so the question of permeation was never explicit it just it just sort of happened yeah right you know and this is again this is something that you talk about a good deal paul that that there's this sort of uh the surrounding ambient culture is such that it was thick you know and that and that that the uh what strikes me again i'm listening to hours and hours of you talk about all a variety of things paul is is how um you know that that it was an intentional um creation like the the point of it all was a sort of a differentiation right that that you know that you know if i as a sort of um you know whatever a cradle catholic um look at at the sort of the history of the united states and the history of united of education in the united states i mean the default assumptions of the u.s educational system the loose confederation that it always has been is is sort of a kind of a default mainline right and so that u.s public schools were essentially free mainline schools in some kind of nice and i'm using that word on purpose some sort of nice way kind of rubbed off edges and kind of cleaned up but but but catholics coming in and establishing these these in certain cities very elaborate and very extensive um uh parish school systems you know uh those were always intentional and there was always the sort of the heavy the the heavy the hard squeeze by the pastor to make sure that you know bill and and sally sent sent their their five six kids to to the parish school and in fact it was well it was affordable and there's another labor is an issue we can talk about that later on it was affordable but it was like you're going to do this if you're going to be a member in good standing then you're going to send your kids to to our school and so so paul it sounds to me that the christian reform tradition has a similar sort of the pastor has a heavy exertion of influence on the families right oh yes and and again this has broken down yeah right not same same and and and but in other in places in the denomination still usually in rural places yeah but in many places you you wouldn't really be a member a member of the christian reform church in good standing if you were sending your child to public school you would be called before the contest consistory and you would have to give a really good reason and in fact what was happening in the churches was that the churches basically you know put their money together i mean it was affording that the church itself was a relatively small thing affording the k through 12 and in fact over time a lot of pastors became rather resentful because the church was sort of living on a shoestring and as expectations rose you had gymnasiums you had football fields i mean you had everything for these christian schools and that was really the community effort and you and one of the differences between the christian reform church and the reform church of america is reform church of america sent their kids to public schools if you remember the christian reform church no you were part of this group yeah and and you were catechized you know not just in terms of the bible class that you had but in terms of all of your classes that was the point of the entire educational system and in fact even calvin college was first founded to prepare ministers and then teachers for the christian education movement and wow even in my youth you know i i mentioned before in place like whitensville massachusetts for my cousins that the great fear was that they would marry catholic girls sure so the great hope was the christian school because there would be these calvin college graduates single women coming into the community and in fact one of my cousins married one of them the first day of you know my aunt's are looking around of their prospective daughters-in-law i mean it was that deeply tied to the community but that has so that is so i have a question about that yeah i have a question about that the word for that is endogamy right is that the right word for um to to marry within a faith tradition i don't know it sounds right etymologically that sounds plausible yeah so okay well anyway i'll use the word sorry everybody um i think that's the right word that of course has broken down hasn't it paul i mean the the idea that you know um for most people um that you know your primary concern would be whether or not your child um marries someone in in the faith tradition that's almost entirely broken down except for weirdos like me right like i think about this all the time for my own children because i i want my kids not only to to take up the faith but i i know in my own experience that that that is a source of not not my personal experience my wife is a is a devout catholic and um is all in with me but but i know from from personal experience that that is oftentimes a a a friction point uh through which the kids kind of fall fall fall down or away or however you want to characterize that you know so so interestingly that calvin collins sort of served that kind of in an endogamic function or something yeah and and it seems to me that we're circling around a few few related issues related to pluralism right so if if both in the catholic context and the reform context this was maintained through a pretty tightly uh boundary subculture yeah then then my my first instinct is well where did it go wrong it's that it wasn't it wasn't equipped to deal with moving beyond the subculture and so i i suspect that what happens in catholic schools is as they as they open out to the broader culture they they're unwittingly ideologically colonized by the secular right and so so most of our catholic schools are you know for a long time it wouldn't have even occurred to them that they weren't teaching math from a catholic point of view they just say well you can't like math is just math so you know and and uh and i think this movement towards curriculum permeation is kind of trying to make explicit something that might have been obvious you know a few generations ago but in a pluralist context we actually need to explicitly say um no there's not a neutral anyone pretending to be neutral is is actually making a power move and trying to neutralize you um and and so we kind of have to we have to push back against that sort of overwhelming narrative that that that makes religious claims and religious worldviews automatically suspect and and sort of outside the norm by claiming some bogus neutral in the middle and i don't know for sure but my gut tells me that to go back to the original question to start this like what went wrong i think we weren't ready for pluralism and and we've been blindsided and now we're just sort of waking up and trying to claw our way back into the game well and also what is included in pluralism right i mean you know that i you know paul you know you've been talking a lot about this and again you know in our in our church uh brett you know we've just had some interesting things come out from the cdf the last few days that has caused all kinds of ripples throughout the twitterverse and you know paul i know that you know your tradition is anticipating a big report on on on a matter sexual and so you know how does that fit into this sort of pluralistic narrative because it's one thing to talk about pluralism between you know catholics and baptists and and whatever evangelicals and jews and muslims it's it's another thing when you're talking when you're taking it out of something that at least has been traditionally considered not a religion into something that is increasingly taking on the clothing uh and the affect of a religion i you know i've been thinking about these issues quite a bit lately and it seems human beings need a they need something to be activistic about and in the in for the christian reform church historically they were activistic about their particular christian reformed identity i mean to be marry someone of the reform church of america that was a mixed marriage got it and so we joked about it and and so the the the flag of being christian reformed was and within that there was a whole package of things and i think part of i i think in the in the counterculture there was sort of a pushback on all such particularity all such sectarian um sectarian things and they're obviously there are a variety of other competitors one of the things that i've been talking about a lot in my videos is sort of this default christian nationalism you know evangelicals are you know losing setting their hair on fire over christian nationalism and i it's really remarkable honestly as a as a as a sort of sideline watcher because i have a lot of obviously friends you know i'm i'm amazed at the hand wringing and the the the it's really wreck it really seems to be obsessive at the moment yeah and and i you read any history of american culture and it's like yeah that that has been the default position in terms of protestants which roman catholics of course know because you were excluded from it until quite recently right and and so now suddenly dread christian nationalism is what we're to set our hair on fire and it's like have you read any history but but you had all of these little segmented groups that could sort of stay to themselves and their rallying cry was for the christian reformed church you know to be distinctly reformed in all of these things and in the you know in the in the counterculture that all got sort of watered down and so today we sort of have well what ought we all to be activistic about you know it's sort of this progressive liberationism it might be we you know um it might be anti-racism ought to be the one thing we're about so now suddenly let's say the christian reformed churches anti-racism is the main thing and it's not evangelicalism was always sort of this weird broad get souls into heaven by a personal relationship with jesus christ christian reformity had its own particular flavor on that but eventually was sort of widened into evangelical or mainline ism and so like i've said you know with with rod rears benedict option when i when i look at this idea it's like i don't know we sort of practiced it until the 1960s and then the walls came down and we're not really talking about it why like what's what's the stag like what is the thing what is the thing you know there's i don't know if you've ever seen this movie called cold comfort farm it's actually based on a novel and it's kind of a riff on english novels like stock characters in english novels but there's a recurring theme that this character keeps saying i saw something nasty in the woodshed it's like this this traumatic event that that that you don't talk about you say that you saw the thing but you never actually talk about the thing so what is it about this moment in church history american in church history that you know we we saw something nasty and we're never going to go there again a lot of people point to the second world war which sort of drafted people from across the country into this war effort and a lot of and you know we had a whole generation of of leadership in the christian reform church who had been through the war and i think what a lot of people realized is that sort of our little huddle around dutch calvinist christian reformity we weren't that different from all of these other people and we sort of look silly with our provincialism and our clannishness so let's give that up and then especially in the civil rights movement they're like oh here's this new existential and and yeah correctly so jim crow treatment of african americans is horrendous and so we can all sort of get on with that and then women we can all get on with that and so these these broader national agendas sort of swamp and continue to preoccupy and anyone who still sort of clannishly holds to their christian reform provincialism you know see see this is so interesting because i i think that's i think a corollary corollary was happening with with the the catholic world because remember the catholic world was also a ghetto i mean it was you know it was really you know the most that you would see a catholic mixed with somebody else's if you were irish and you you know you live next door to the italian family like and that was you know and so it's funny you go to chicago and like you've got all of these you know the the next door you know the the neighbor you know the irish neighbor girl marries the next door neighbor italian boy and you have these mixed marriages and it's it's it's kind of it's again it's kind of a catholic joke but um you know so you think about just the phenomena of you know you live in these very ghettoized worlds like you know i live in this neighborhood in chicago right i live on this block and this right next to st rayfields and we don't like those you know we play coa ball against you know st john's but that's about it like you know and so you have these blocks you have these schools and then all of a sudden this huge war effort takes everybody out of all of their various tribes and the u.s military has this radically homogenizing effect and not only of course does that happen with jews and you know with catholics and jews it's catholics and protestants protestant and jews like there's this incredible mix that occurs there um that yeah how do you come back from that right you know how do you go back to your enclaves after you've you've been in a foxhole you know jimmy murphy has been in a foxhole with saul it just doesn't have you can't go back you won't go back and these were the leaders of the church for the 50s 60s and 70s and so it galvanizes the war and led the church right and what galvanizes them at least amongst the catholics and i think this was the way that catholics have always from from what i'm understand from what i've read what i've talked to in terms of generations above me is that catholics have always been really really anxious about fitting in to america right and they were not they were not because they didn't eat fish on friday there were all these sort of these distinctives that that they had held on to um but uh you know they they really really wanted to get on but one thing that they were you know that they were sort of in common with the sort of the wasp establishment is they were very anti-communist right i'm talking about the american catholic churches very anti-communist right so that becomes this thing that carries you all the way through so that you know you no longer have to worry about the distinctiveness of your various faith claims and faith traditions and priorities but we're all sort of american working against you know the the evil empire yeah well and then so then you've got the world war too you've got the cold war which sort of i mean christian reform church generally speaking quite politically conservative yeah and then you hit the counterculture and that so you have sort of this new amalgam which is sort of nationalistic and then the counterculture you have a deep anxiety about american exceptionalism richard nixon lied to us um the vietnam war was not a war against communism we got embroiled in a civil war which we probably never should have belonged in and then you know at the end of the cold war the the wall goes down and now the okay now it's anti-islam okay and just the narrative keeps unfolding and all of these former these people who had escaped the ghetto they you know the dutch ghetto and the catholic ghettos of various ethnicities now suddenly wait a minute all of this stuff that we had in terms of our religious matrix that's all sort of getting mapped on to these bigger movements and now suddenly evangelicals and roman catholics via roe v wade you know maybe a little later for the evangelicals suddenly find themselves shoulder to shoulder with the catholics yeah you know and again i've been reading a biography of jonathan edwards i mean the the ant i mean jonathan edwards was trying to evangelize the indians and the worst thing that could happen is that the french canadians you know get to them first and make them catholics because then they're going with the anti-christ i mean that and they're going and so they're really going to hell right no no absolutely no i think that's right that's right and it's it's baked in right yeah so so okay so getting back to the bret wants to get yeah sorry sorry go back yeah well i just i just wanted to say i mean it seems part of what happens in in things like wars is we rewrite the stories we tell ourselves about about ourselves yeah exactly exactly it's and it's a new narrative and so the old narratives that grounded my identity maybe in my irish catholic heritage or whatever it happened to be maybe my dutch calvinist heritage yeah now is rewritten so that that's a very secondary element of my identity and my primary element is as an american who you know won this great war and and you know now we're against communism and like these stories become the primary lenses and they relativize the religious lenses and so it pluralism is a funny thing because okay we become more pluralist in a certain sense you know but we but it's it's not actually consistent because other things that become the dominant narrative don't really admit of pluralism right you can be plural about all these secondary and tertiary questions all you like as long as you're with us on this primary question and if i get to but but i'm i'm gonna hope you don't actually even notice that the primary question is there i'm hoping you think it's completely neutral and so that there is true pluralism at the secondary and tertiary level and we we just ignore we we become blind to the fact that we have these other commitments that are in fact commitments instead of just the way things are right and i think all of our religious communities um i think we're figuring this out now but for a long time we just didn't actually see that we were playing the game with rules that were set from outside and we i think there can be a healthy pluralism that a catholic can participate in um but i think when we tried to do that we we kind of got the wool pulled over our eyes because it wasn't actually a healthy pluralism it was it was one that says that's nice that you believe that nice little thing if you keep it to yourself over here and keep quiet about it and so um whether it's about math or it's about morality um we still have this same sort of thing right like well there's there's a neutral morality that we all agree on and if you have some funny additional catholic morality that you want to tack onto that well that's your business but keep it keep it to yourself keep it to yourself so if you want to if you want to do something um you know publicly scandalous according to your own community's standards um well the community has no right to really enforce that in any kind of public way because that's your public life you know and and so that that leads to you know i think it's these presuppositions in the background this pluralism that isn't really pluralism that leads to these kinds of inconsistencies you know that show up in in various um questions that we might discuss so right and in in keeping with that you know are we asking our schools to do too much right like in other words schools have been have been i think maybe the remaining institution you know that that is sort of you know sure like let's just take like a you know like a local uh catholic high school you know he's got 1500 kids and it's a robust enrollment and you know that whole sort of thing right it's got a it's got a prominent uh you know football team and um you know all that everybody wants to go to the school so there's a wait list you know the whole thing right it's it's it's established itself as a sort of a pillar of uh the city uh in which it exists in um and that has that school has found a way to weather all the stuff it has weathered you know the the the the ebb of um you know church attendance you know it has survived church attendance it has survived um racist frames of of seeing the world i mean it just survived so much right and so the sex abuse crisis yeah decline right it's right it because it has this it it's its own thing so everything else has essentially died right or has or has really lost its influence and its hold but the the school remains and so why is my is is is i guess the first question why has the school been able to survive and is that a good thing or a bad thing like i don't know well part of what's going on so so the christian reform church established this whole network of christian day schools at tremendous sacrifice to the communities to establish them and what happened as the walls came down is that fewer and fewer more and more christian reform people are sort of now you've got permission to send your kids to public school or the homeschooling because the christian reform church is sort of in the are we going to gravitate to the main line or to the evangelical and the crc is always in that tension so what happens with even if and then christian reform churches are in decline pretty dramatically over the last 20 30 years okay has that been a gradual decline and then and then a a fall like that or is it just been a gradual in the 1980s my father came home from a whole missions meeting they were going to set a numerical goal this all church plant stuff church growth stuff of 400 000 by 200 by 2000 for the denomination and right now with probably a split coming over same-sex marriage i wouldn't be surprised to see the crc get into the 150 125 i mean it's been 40 years the crc has been dropping like a rock especially in urban areas okay but now here's the for the most part because of this kyperian philosophy christian day schools are run by the parents not by the clergy because we have the sphere sovereignty ideas in our theology so parent organizations run the day school not pastors pastors are in some ways outside okay interesting wow and so what happens when the christian form churches are in decline those were the feeders that pay the tuition to keep the school going well the schools start looking around where else can we get students and they're they're getting them from other evangelicals who are homeschooling didn't work for them but serious evangelicals but the second group has been i think this is true of the catholic schools has been people who are dissatisfied with public education and so i mentioned to you guys if you look at eastern christian school association on wikipedia i looked at that a few years ago and notable alumni of my high school of my school system peter kreeft who was in the reformed church of america after calvin college disappointed calvin college greatly by going to the roman catholic church and then a whole bunch of names including the jonas brothers who are all entertainers young entertainers and it's and i had it where i met someone who is a relation of somebody i met here in sacramento completely apart from church schools that said oh my nieces go to eastern christian like what yeah well they didn't want them to go to public school and for a lot of these other conflicts that we see happening in roman catholic schools such as this woman who is you know doing some online pornography but she's very upset because when that got out the the local catholic school showed her the door and this you know major op-ed piece in the sacramento b over this hit other national things and so whereas before the christian school was a function of the insular specifically dutch reformed community now in a consumer culture right affords you know better than public school education a little safer context my wife is a public school teacher public schools have a duty to educate everyone a private school can look at a family and say you're not our kind yeah yeah you know that yeah and that's what i mean like what do we think schools are for right i mean there's been a sort of a change in terms of its it's its appreciation as a as a as a as a commodity right as opposed to something that's serving formation right and and i think that's a big difference you know that story really struck me you know the sacramento story because the they were indignant the the husband and wife who have run this very very lucrative only fans site you know they were indignant that that you know like well what does this have to do with our kids which was pretty amazing and of course me the conservative crank wants to say oh i don't know everything i mean you know and and yet you know but they were they were outraged right it seems to me in the story they were outraged that the the principal had the audacity to um have a problem with it how dare how dare you sir like that was the sort of thing how dare you have a problem with my only fans site i had a woman in my church she before she married a young man from my church she had been teaching in a roman catholic school in the bay area and you know just a couple of years ago there was a rather dramatic thing that hit the paper where the roman catholic church school in the bay area was daring to teach roman catholic perspective on human sexuality and it's the parents sending their kids to the school that were outraged how dare you teach this to our children and of course from a religious perspective it's like why did you pick this school if you didn't and and now you're outraged that this particular religious community would like to actually teach their beliefs and i mean this is going to hit this is going to hit you know calvin college just recently had another flare up with respect to uh same-sex you know lgbt questions yeah what happened tell us that story because i don't think everybody in the audience knows the story well well somebody you know some students um set up a table kind of a like a stephen crowder table stephen crowder table lgbtq is sin you know change my mind and so then some of the professors you know put on a t-shirt that basically said we love our lgbt students and given the position of the christianity forum church that's completely understandable but in terms of how this gets then promoted out to the public conversation you know okay well should you know it a generation ago bob jones was basically said you can't participate in the federal um the federal student aid unless you segregate your school and this is of course the question is that same going to be desegregated school is the same going to be used unless you know christian educations especially schools there's a fair amount of buffers with respect to churches but again back to your your comment brett schools are seen as sort of public institutions and so for a let's say for a christian it's for calvin college that because it's the one university that's owned by the christian reform church it's sort of the exception they can't really deviate from the christian reform church's position on same-sex issues so so how was that going to play out honestly i mean again as a as a you know look i brett and i can can riff for days on the amount of catholic colleges that position themselves in a sort of heterodox position as regards the vatican in terms of catholicity right i mean you know we could rattle them all off essentially right you know that that every college it's easier to count the colleges that would align themselves with the magisterium of the church than it is to count all the ones that don't i mean like but but by uh it's like it's not even close wow well in the christian reform so so calvin college professors have to sign a they used to be called the form of subscription it's a covenant that basically says they are in alignment with the doctoral positions of the christian reform church yeah and the the document that will come before senate when we get to have it after covid basically asserts that this posture on same-sex relationships is a confessional issue that is a traditional perspective on marriage that's going to put that could we don't know that could put some faculty at calvin college who have more of a progressive view of same-sex marriage in a hot seat confessionally so so what happens to them well that's a really good question and that's why this you know this this issue in the christian reform church really has the potential just just rip the denomination apart as it has in many other many other denominations because it's getting to the point now of you're going to have to it it has been sort of a something under the radar in the denomination until of course one prominent grand rapids church ordains a deacon and a same-sex relationship but we haven't had synod and now this other document comes which is a conservative document but we haven't had synod basically if synod says this is the position of the church love it or leave it it's going to be very interesting so you you you predict that then you'll have people who will then leave it because they don't love it well yeah that's that well what see the question is going to be because of course the conservatives are going to go and say unless you discipline neil and avenue of what if classes so a church is within a classes well what if the what if the classes decides we had a we had a situation like this in toronto a few years ago where a church sort of asked the question synod told the classes take care of this and classes said okay we will and so it was resolved but classes grand rapids east is the central classes calvin college is there all of the christian reform institutions are there if classes grand rapids east won't discipline neil and avenue you know this basically it's your vatican no that's exactly right yeah i was just going to say yeah that's i was thinking the same thing brad so and and we've and so our sister denomination the reform church of america who's never done christian day schools they are right now basically in the process of splitting up and they're splitting up between east coast mainliners who have always been ace east coast mainliners and sort of western big box evangelicals who have not had much of a reformed accent and then some dutch immigrants who are probably closer to the crc so this is all happening in our in our field and of course christian schools are right in the crosshairs because you know there are there's talk of well file a lawsuit that calvin college has to can no longer discriminate against lgbt students by not affirming their you know potential marriages or their relationships so right so just out of curiosity though at a place like calvin college do they um at least on the books discipline um uh let's say you know sally and bill are juniors at calvin college right and they're they're dating um do they involve themselves in the sexual um lives of no bill and sally not no not really no what if they get caught no uh it's this again so so your earlier question is that 50 years ago 70 years ago a young couple that perhaps comes up pregnant out of wedlock would go before the congregation and confess their sin publicly to the congregation and then probably be married um you know so but but no the the calvin college has tended to have a much more um you know we're not going to really we're not going to really get involved in terms of disciplining the students morally okay but the but a lot of the chatter is well calvin college is not affirming of same-sex marriage yeah that word that word that word affirming is doing lots of work isn't it it is doing a lot of work and that is the line yeah and whether or not anything but this again goes all the way back to brett's book in terms of well is there what is our source of sexual morality and is this something that an institution everybody sort of assumes a church can teach this they might not like it but churches have a lot of protection in the american constitutional system yeah a school is sort of in the middle and especially in term because of christian the christian reform church schools are run by parents a parent a parental association can say so what's the relationship with the church i don't know what that relationship are all of your day schools and colleges technically owned by the church no right because we have they have a variety of different types of schools right so they have schools that are owned and operated by religious orders let's say like a jesuit order or a dominican order or the benedictins or the franciscans or at all the various sort of so those schools are owned and operated by those respective religious orders that are incorporated right but all of those schools operate bread you you're the you're the one who should answer this all of those schools operate under the blessing of the local bishop right so the bishop exercises the authority over which school can call itself catholic and well we call it but yeah go ahead then but then there are also schools that are in fact owned by the diocese right there they're secular institutions within the church right so they're there it's a diocesan school right right secular in the in the old medieval sense of secular not in the not in the contemporary sense right so and then add add to this in my context we have publicly funded catholic schools so i mean this question that that you raise you know the bishop gets to say which schools are catholic yes in theory but we call that the nuclear option because that's right i mean that's really that's that's the one sort of lever you have but if you use it it's you've used it once and it's blown up right if the bishop says this school can't call itself catholic now well then it's then that's it's over it's outside of the and if someone in canada were to do that then the legal questions that would follow from the you know the legal right to catholic schools uh if the bishop doesn't want them called catholic i mean i mean you'd be in some you'd be in some situation well and this is the kind of thing like every you know every like you know rock rib conservative catholic or trad catholic's like yeah why don't the bishop just tell those jokers over at you know university you know x and high school y that they just they just need to get in line and do the thing and it's like yeah it doesn't work that way i mean it does but it doesn't because you've effectively shot yourself what is it you know you you know you saw off the the branch that you're all sitting on yeah no it's i mean we talked in our last time about the kinds of decisions bishops have to make and how people imagine that there's really easy answers uh to some of them and like i mean here's here's just one concrete question okay let's say i'm a local bishop uh and i'm not super happy about the way i don't know teacher x is dealing with questions of homosexuality in the classroom right but i'm also in an arrangement where um like literally thousands of kids who could never afford a catholic education uh otherwise are receiving a catholic education so like when someone's like well tell teacher x to smarten up or just shut the school down uh a bishop like a bishop can be oh yes but also these thousands of children who can never afford a catholic education what about them ah to heck with them you know like yeah it's never like that you know it's never that easy but um it's easy to be an armchair bishop yeah for sure for sure so but then i was i was i was wondering you you had asked earlier a question kale that got me thinking about what schools are for and i wonder if introducing this is and it is important so for catholics there's two competing things going on when you found a school one reason you found a school it's because you've got a catholic population and you want to get your catholic kids a catholic education right probably you don't want to send them to the local protestant or secular school right right um but but of course that's not the only reason catholics found schools i mean go to india or japan where where far more people are educated in catholic schools than than the catholic percentage of the population which in either of those countries is miniscule they they educate far more of the population than than they make up right right and so catholicism has for for well at least 500 years maybe longer thought of education as an act of charity and mission and mission yeah uh and so so when you're let's say you're in canada are are your catholic schools there because your catholic kids have a right to a catholic education or because the catholic church has a right to do its mission um and and i can say this now but a couple months ago i would have had to been much more careful because we had a court case in front of the supreme court hinging on just these questions we won uh unanimously but one of the one of the misconceptions was that this was the only reason catholic schools existed was to give catholic kids a catholic education but historically it's never been exclusively catholic students so the whole court case had actually emerged from the fact that there's a small town in saskatchewan that lost its public school reformulated as a catholic school all the non-catholics in town didn't want to bust to the next town over so sent their kids to the catholic school anyways the public school system sued the catholic school system uh saying you know you're you're stealing all our students and you don't have a right to educate them um and so we we actually lost at first at the provincial level but then we want we won the appeal and then it went to the supreme court and we won but it would have had massive implications and i would have been told don't you talk about it on youtube while the whole thing's going on because of course you know it's a delicate thing but but what i what i think is important for us here is when you say well what's a school for is yes it's to provide catholic education to catholic kids but it's also part of the mission of the church and that necessarily implicates it in a pluralistic society where there's going to be people with different values uh you know negotiating these things and and how do we figure out who gets to say what goes and and i think this this imagined neutral is is operating a lot when people are saying oh this catholic church shouldn't teach this or that or the other thing well what should it teach well it should teach something well what is that well the neutral secular morality that is that i don't recognize as even being um even contextualized in any way it just sort of floats about right so i think this this is in the background of a lot of stuff is this we are trying to figure out how to be robustly catholic or reformed or whatever it is muslim you know whatever your tradition is um in a pluralistic context and a lot of our difficulties come from like there's there's two really bad ways to do it right one is to totally blend in with the with the world and one is to accommodationist yeah right accommodationist and another is to sort of push back in a way that's really naive uh and creates a lot of its own problems right and so i i think um even the recent blow up around bishop barons push against the the accommodationist on the one hand and the rad treads on the other is an expression of the same basic problem we're trying to figure out how to live outside of our little enclave in a way that's robust and integral but still um what's i mean i don't even know the right word but still open in in the in a healthy sense right okay so that underlies a lot of this so i want to jump in here i i i think i agree basically with what you're talking about and i think that um we're struggling here i guess my my frustrations are that the the all of the energy in the room uh so to speak all of the energy in in in our um world here is is not um pluralism actually right all of the energy in the room is toward a kind of well i guess what you know like oppressive tolerance right the sort of the gram pshian notion that um you can you should only tolerate that which you actually think is true right and so what's interesting to me you know westley yang uh commentator calls this the you know the successor ideology and the successor ideology to sort of this liberal pluralism that all of us have lived in and have tried to sort of operate in you know you talk about this history paul of you know world war two being this moment right and basically this is a this moment of sort of the expansion of tribalism to be included into a sort of a broad liberal consensus right that's cute because all of us are sitting ducks for something that is not interested in broad-minded tolerance right and yet they have co-opted the energy and the the the the moral high ground of of of intolerance in the name of tolerance right so like what's going on in calvin college is a perfect example and i don't want to pick on that because look i could pick 15 examples in which the catholic church lost years ago its universities right so i mean more power to calvin college that they've been able to you know stave off this fight until 2021 um but the the the successor ideology is not interested in accommodation right this reminds me of the thing that rod drear always talks about you know that you know um that will never happen but when it does you you bigots will have have um you know um you know what you're claiming will never happen but when it does you bigots will have deserved it right and and that's that's where i think we are we're all i feel like we're just sitting ducks for the maw of this voracious uh neo ideology in canada we just expanded our uh access to assisted suicide uh and of course four years ago when the law was struck down and all of us said we need robust protections in here or it's gonna it's gonna you know within a few years we're gonna be uh killing the mentally ill you know people people suffering from mental illness no no they would never lead to that it's only in these cases like lew garrick's disease and bone cancer these extreme circumstances where people are already on their deathbed and you know of course that's all we're gonna do and we say well your logic uh you know your argument actually leads in a much more expansive direction well well come on come on yeah and then so reactionary didn't take half a decade right um i i want to share a quote so i just gave a talk to a group of catholic teachers for red deer uh alberta there there and they wanted me to speak about for tele tuti so pope francis's latest encyclical and i found a quote from it that i just found really speaks to the the kind of situation you're talking about like the sitting ducks so i i'll just i'll share it and i don't know paul maybe you can put it on the screen when you produce this or not i don't but it's it's from paragraph 13 it's actually a quote from another document he he um gave after a synod on youth so he's talking about young people which is particularly interesting for schools right he says if someone tells young people to ignore their history to reject the experience of their elders to look down on the past and to look forward to a future that he himself holds out doesn't it then become easy to draw them along so that they only do what he tells them he needs the young to be shallow uprooted and distrustful so that they can trust only in his promises and act according to his plan i'm going to pause the quote for a second there i think sometimes what happens in at least some educational contexts where critical thinking what what is called critical thinking is basically just deconstructionism is precisely to make the young shallow uprooted and distrustful right okay back into the quote well let me do that last sentence again he needs the young to be shallow uprooted and distrustful so that they can trust only in his promises and act according to his plans that is how various ideologies operate they destroy or deconstruct all differences so that they can reign unopposed to do so however they need young people who have no use for history who spurn the spiritual and human riches inherited from past generations and are ignorant of everything that came before them and i just grab that like when you say sitting ducks i think this i i think that's exactly right we we've been sort of stripped of our identity and our heritage uh because and we're told this we're given this odd sense that like our identity and our heritage is somehow oppressive to the people around us but of course that's not applied in reverse other people's heritage and identity isn't supposed to be oppressive to us i don't say that about my muslim neighbor uh so so it's this but i but the um but the the pluralism the false neutral pluralist is just as happy you know the the way they accept islam i don't think they they don't want to accept islam on its own terms any more than they want to accept catholicism on its own terms they want to domesticate all of us i think part of the way the game is played now is this part of the reason education is such a such a battleground right now and we see this with um there was a there was a lawsuit around sacramento a a kindergartener was transitioning and and you'll find this now in the lower grades and so it was you know here here in the kindergarten class in public school you should read this book about transitioning and so there's a there's a sense that okay here is the dominant public morality if this is if this is right and wrong we have to raise our children in it so then of course church schools uh whether they be reformed or fundamentalist or baptist or roman catholic they'll tend to resist this and so you'll have conservative elements in the community that say i don't want this being taught to my child and if you have the financial resources i'm going to send my child to the public school but there's what happens you know the way you the way you sort of indoctrinate a a a broad public population with either the truth or the lie is to usually break things down to fairly simple fairly simple things so for example even this uh crowd or steven crowder table at calvin college lgbtq is sin now any christian reform minister going back to the 73 would part and say hey wait a minute here that is not the position of the christian reformed church there's a whole lot of nuance but the way you mobilize the public is to break it down into very you know things with handles on so you can send your troops out to to beat on the others so and and so what what we tend to have then is now okay now we're going to have all of this segregation and schools are going to bunker down and and part of me wonders if we're not just sort of heading back into new ghettos where um we're going to have except the ghettos are going to be rearranged because that used to be the roman catholics well now now the catholics and the conservatives of various other traditions we're going to say okay we're going to we're going to not worry about some of the other touchy issues between protestants and catholics because these bigger issues which are more salient are what unites us and and you just get a sense of you know now we're starting going to start a new cycle and of course this in the united states gets played out massively in terms of the political parties so but i still what the thing that i struggle with about maybe it's motivational like i i really i don't quite understand what the end game is for those who would like to ignore the tradition right and and i'm using that of course in its most expansive and and common way that we talk about tradition even amongst our respective traditions right but i mean i just don't know what the end game is right so so you've got the troll group who sets up the steven crowder table right obviously trying to get a rise right that is that is tailor-made for some sort of weird uh sliver of conservative instagram world right um and so then the professor gets up and says uh you know i love my lgbtq plus you know students right you know which on the surface of it well of course we have to love our lgbtq plus students right we're christians right okay but we know that that's not the point either right it's not it's actually not a winsome point that is being made okay so that's charade number one but number two is like okay play this out what do you want to have happen what's the future of that and and i that's where i my my mind just i just get a blank fog like what does that even look like i i wonder if it if if it hasn't really been thought through i wonder if if the thought process is um that we've all been so co-opted by political ways of operating instead of appropriately reflective philosophical and theological reasoning that we don't we don't actually take the time to think about the implications of these kinds of questions we need to figure out um how we're going to position ourselves in our social and intellectual networks to be on the right or the wrong side of history and engage engage at at the level of political sort of sloganeering right so that i mean that both the table and the t-shirt are are forms of sloganeering which are not designed to seek understanding uh so so we posturing wait it's posturing right which is which is a political sort of approach to a question that that is here's the thing that we're not going to find good answers to this let's say the question let's say the question in the background is okay christianity needs to think about um this cultural moment where people are expressing experiences in certain ways in certain categories and what does that mean for us that's that's actually tricky work that the church does for 2000 years right we engage with cultural ideas and human experience and whatever right this is the sort of the but this is the pastoral lane right that's that's the word that's going to be carted out right and sure three of us are mature men we understand what that means but we also understand right bread something different in the roman catholic church than it does in the but not as but not as much as you might think paul i mean you know you're right well but the idea here is is i you know pope frances to his credit talks a lot about this idea of accompaniment and and all that but all of that actually does have limit so okay so i would say the pastoral is part of it but i would actually say another part is philosophical like i think i think we actually we actually need to do the work to think about what this means so so for example i think that if if a significant number of people are rebelling against categories that the culture is used to think about gender of course maybe we maybe there are things in the way we've been deploying the categories that are worth thinking about right now without presuming any answers but i so but what i want to distinguish is the pastoral but also philosophical work on the one hand that the question i think demands of us if we want to be honest and the desire on the flip side to turn it into a political football to score points in in what is it's it doesn't it strikes me that what's happening when when these you know table t-shirt things go on is that we're not actually having a serious conversation about this issue this issue has become a proxy for every issue where the left and the right are against each other where we need to demonize the opposition and so here's one more chance to say that these other people these people are unfaithful or these people are hateful or what you know whichever category that you need to continue to further um delegitimate the position of the opponent because we're not actually interested it seems to me in these kind of things in seeking understanding we're interested in scoring points because we've let every single issue including one like this that impacts real people very seriously become political footballs and it frustrates me when as christian we get sort of co-opted into the political battle so we can't do either the pastoral or the philosophical work of really engaging the question because it before before it's anything it's about how the other people are wrong on this and and it's it becomes it becomes impossible actually to to gain any deeper understanding right right but but but i still think that we have to be honest about the frame right you know that you know and i'm not preaching at you uh brett i know i know you know this but i feel like i have to say it out loud here you know it's like it's not equal actually you know like you know talk about the table and the t-shirt i love that that's we should use the table the t-shirt you know it's like one student one's teacher right so right away you've got interesting power dynamics going on there um one is anonymous ish one is not you know and so that's part of it you know and then motivation is another part of it and so you know where and then and then we can also consult is you know let's try to take it out of this sort of charged political situation but okay well like what do we really think about this stuff right i mean from from whence do we derive some sort of axiomatic points in which we can make an argument about the telos of human sexuality let me think where can i go for that well and you know you see what i'm doing here i mean it's like i don't i don't like the pretend game right i don't like the pretend game of the t-shirt side of the equation i i've been preaching you know we're in lent now and that a christian reform minister is i love that paul i love it paul i love is is a really amazing thing if you compare the christian reform church in 1960 i don't think any christian reform churches celebrated lent so we're in lent and i am so on one hand we've sort of got the problems of the bishop where the bishop looks at this and says we have to be pastoral we have to be um we have to be pastoral we have to think about the big picture we have to do all of these things and that's exactly right and so if you look at say the calvin college administration these are not stupid people they they made all the right noises and but again to the revolutionary in the street you know to to to bring up the 1960s culture culture you know you're that's that's the kind of slow you know that's the kind of slow tolerance to the status quo that the man uses to defer the revolution okay right right right so then i love to look at jesus because what i see jesus doing in the gospels and i've been in luke from luke 9 you know all the way to the end of the book is jesus is riding these dynamics yeah like a boss because on one side and he's the fuck he's doing one of these like the whole time that's right you've got the mob on one side that would love nothing better than for jesus to say if you don't follow me to jerusalem you're not gonna have a country and you know let's storm jerusalem and take him out so he's got the mob that is just waiting to be incited and of course you've got those who are you know the romans and tax collectors and prostitutes and sinners and you just watch jesus weave through this but jesus isn't doing it like in a sense a bishop has to now or a college president at calvin college to you know let's slow down let's balance let's think jesus is doing it in real time in the midst of the mob and it's gonna cost him his life yeah i was to say it doesn't end well initially but this this i think is the kind of vision the church needs to have in that it is it should not be surprising to christians that you are going to find yourself on the bad side of the power differential on a regular basis if you're running a christian college you don't want to stay faithful to this particular perspective of human sexuality you might lose your preferential treatment in terms of the united states program of of tuition assistance this is this is the big story and so i think to me i would like to point to jesus and say well this is probably the guy we should be paying a lot of attention to now that doesn't necessarily answer the question of the t-shirt and the table in the moment but but that is where we should look to to figure out because at some point jesus is he's eating with Pharisees and he's saying oh by the way you i noticed you didn't wash my feet and he's not afraid to call them whitewashed tombs and to the sinners he's saying oh yeah they are sinners and today i mean all of this of course has been wedded into into history and through the counter culture and so now even when we read the power bill the prodigal son we sort of cheer for the son as a revolutionary and say well hey wait a minute here these these tax collectors were siding with the imperialists and the oppressors and jesus fail jesus eating with prostitutes they are sinners because they are collaborating with the enemy and you know jesus is soft on you know the the jewish girl sex trade um you know this is these are all the varieties of issues and they're all right there and so i think but even even in part of the equation but even in that right uh you know he calls he calls them us them us out of yes that right and and you know and i can't get over the fact um that god jesus wants me jesus wants like i'm not like he wants something for me and and and and sometimes i don't want what jesus wants for me and you know we've all lived lives here and we know we know that tension in our own lives where i want something and i know that jesus wants something else for me something more for me and i fight him on that score right you know like yeah that's great jesus i don't want that right now thank you very much i'm i want this over here and i don't you know so brett you were talking about you know sort of talking like you know you don't you know if you're if you're merely sloganeering you're not you're not dealing with persons right and i worry about the you know the that's why i brought up the pastoral you know that that that the pastoral is supposed to call me out of myself um out of my my my my my sinfulness out of my selfishness out of my um narrow appreciation of what my desire is today on friday afternoon right i'm i'm supposed to be called up and out to something more and why have we we seem as a church broadly broadly understood to have lost our nerve when it comes to challenging each other um and paul you know this is going to be right up your alley but this is why i think jordan peterson is so inspiring to people because he goes right to that point and he says no you know in his way right and i i would submit that there are certainly limitations to that um but he's saying no like don't just give in to yourself right like that's an that's an anti-gospel but one of the things that i think i'm going to sound like a broken record but one of the things i think really hampers our ability as christians to call one another to account is is the political framing we have so um the recent dust-up over bishop barron's piece where he got criticized hard from the left and from the right but what did they say the left-wing people were happy for him to critique the right and the right-wing people were happy for him to critique the left that's right right and so it was it's like everything is already preset if i if i criticize it criticized isn't the right word if i try to hold my brother or sister christian to account on this or that topic i can be dismissed as as you know trying to impose some political category right off the hop so because our categories are primarily shaped by the political culture we have built in excuses to not listen to one another uh when when we try to hold one another to a higher standard so i i feel like we're really crippled by that and and your example paul of how jesus sort of weaved through that is amazing to me i i was thinking of the the line you know and this is the judgment or depending on your translation the verdict but and this is the judgment that the light came into the world and people hid because their deeds were dark and it seems to me that what's happening with jesus in his various encounters is he is when people encounter jesus they get shown for who they really are and i have to learn that like when we do messaging out of a diocesan office we know that we're going to get certain responses right so like do you tell the truth straight or do you do you try to like anticipate this kind of feedback that you know you're going to get and try to mitigate it and play that game and sometimes you say to yourself wait a minute it's okay if they say what they're going to say we'll just we'll say the true thing and let them say what they're going to say because actually when they say that then the truth about their position will be known and we don't have to worry about like they're free to say that wait like let's say the true thing and let the reaction be what it is because because that's the judgment the judgment is here it is it's now out in the open so let we don't have to play that game now i'm not using a specific example and and it's it can get really complicated but i think just in general trying to remember that Jesus's approach he wasn't afraid of conflict if conflict would lead to clarity right i think i don't like conflict if it leads to lack of clarity if it just muddies the waters and makes us all confused but i'm a little bit conflict diverse anyways and i need to remind myself by looking at Jesus that conflict can be okay if it leads to clarity right and and and i i just wish we we were more committed to our own christian presuppositions so that we would be able to critique one another well you know those spiritual works of mercy right like correcting you know the ignorant um like it's so hard to do because our own egos are in the way in a way that Jesus didn't have that same problem but also the categories to dismiss us as coming from this or that political thing so i don't need to listen to you it makes it really hard and if we don't live in real community with real flesh and blood people but we only live in virtual communities with ideological allies and opponents that multiplies it by 10 you know it just gets so much worse but that's what i'm talking about the energy in the room is is precisely there right uh there there is no community uh period full stop yeah you know this this is what what pageo called peterson out on the other day right paul it's like you don't have a community you got fans and and stop before you talk jordan those are not that's not community you know and george was like oh okay that's right yeah it's true i have a i have a friend who is who is deeply um troubled by the breakdown in our local catholic community uh you know the kind of facebook wars that happen people who should be on the same side of things getting in dust-ups and he's just he's made it like a like a ministry almost to just phone people like as soon as he sees anything going off the rails on facebook he just phones you and and he'll and they'll like go out for beers with people on either side and like help them to see and understand one another better because because the the platform does not allow or i shouldn't say it doesn't allow but it certainly doesn't enhance and it certainly mitigates our ability to have healthy conversations and he's just like no i'm going to do something about it i'm going to actually build real community i'm making phone calls i'm inviting people out for beer so that these like differences which if they happened over beers they would be like interesting discussions yeah you move on and like let me buy you around and we're done yeah yeah right but if they happen on facebook they like shatter your community or or or show that there was no community or you know something like that yeah right and you're right in that again what i'm really impressed with about what jesus does in so i've been reading a bunch of ken bailey who ken bailey is a new testament scholar who wrote in the 70s during the bay route civil war yeah okay yeah you've mentioned him before and so jesus through modern eyes comes from there and so he's he's sort of looking at it from middle eastern context but he's also looking at it through the lens of the bay route civil war in the 70s and again jesus jesus just manages to to hit these things at all different levels and so this sunday he's going into jericho and actually ken bailey has a video on on youtube about this which is tremendous he's going into jericho and of course all of jericho you know the the jericho bigwigs would have come out to meet him and you know they're all trying to hustle him into jericho because they'll have a big banquet for him and they'll celebrate the the local rabbi celebrity coming through jericho on his way to jerusalem and of course there's a blind guy say oh jesus jesus and jesus that's a shut up you know you need to deal with this homeless dude and jesus stops and has them bring him then and then of course jesus is passing through jericho and everybody is panicky because oh no he's not going to let us put him put him up overnight and then who does jesus fought but psichias in the tree and say oh change of plans i will stay in jericho for a meal i'm going to your house and you just watch how not only is he shattering because i think you're exactly right brett that okay it's lgbt it's it's we have a variety of of issues but the political dynamics the proxies of this conflict insert any other issue and the dynamics are the same and jesus has a way of saying okay we've got romans versus jews here we've got tax collectors and centurions and we've got zealots and essenes and but then there's also the like your friend on facebook there's also the political and then there's the personal and jesus just has a way of cutting through all of that and so okay i'm healing this blind man and i'm going to zekias i'm going to your house and then he tells the parable of the mina and so you know again i think as we navigate these waters we should work very hard on paying attention of course along the way jesus is teaching about a whole variety of issues and i'm not discounting those but i think we've paid too little attention to the political dynamics that are at play and understanding how this should give us guidance in because the bishop you know the bishop has to also navigate those things as does the local pastor as does the president of the college and the the skill with which jesus does this i think is part of the reason the you know in tom holland's words you know how how are you able to make a someone crucified as a slave intelligible and attractive not only to your present generation in the first century but every other generation that is going to come after across all of the other cultural spectrums and in fact and tom holland says this is an astounding literary feat and then i add to this it was done four times by four different authors in the same century and the one thing all four had in common is this one man and so for me in terms of the church in terms of all of these issues we should be we should be laser focused on jesus and saying how did he navigate these wars can i say something about prayer in so you see i mean oh no talk about prayer no talking about prayer i mean so here here's the thing right trying to trying to follow jesus is tricky uh in a lot of ways okay that was a really general statement but what i mean to say was like when you're god and sinless and and perceive the human heart in a way that nobody else can um maybe you have some tools for walking through that uh that the rest of us don't have to the same degree right um but but here's so so i i worry right like my ego is going to get in the way the great the great problem with me challenging uh somebody who i disagree with is that is that instead of me making the truth clear what i might be making clear is where my own ego is at and what my own problems are and so you know a lot of times we wonder like we when we think about well you should pray before before you have this conversation or before you enter this situation you should pray oh well why should you pray because god will give you strength okay sure that but is it like some sort of magical like like you get this sort of grace infusion where you get you like now you're now you've got the superpower or that or god will confound your enemies so that they won't know how to talk or something that's right um but it's humility right i mean you're you're praying for for lord grant me an insight into my heart into their hearts you know and this is i mean you know paul when you when you're working with you know people in your congregation i'm sure this is precisely the kind of dynamic that you have to sort through it's it's not it's not different than the dynamic if i've got a squabble between two students and i've got to be magnanimous enough right great sold enough right to to hear you know hear student a hear student b and to hear me like where where is my where where's my bias where's i'm going and i need to be able to kind of rise above all of that in in or pierce through it or something along those lines and so again i keep going back to this table and t-shirt business right what is the motivation like what if like why does the troll student set up a stephen crowder table and says you know lgbtq is sin is that what it said paul is something like that right what does he really do it right no no that's an actual question right i mean we we know that he's trolling right but why what is he doing my guess oh yeah so go ahead go ahead yeah i mean i think one reason people troll people who troll me i think i mean here i am psychologizing the enemy which is always dangerous i think one reason people troll is because they're anxious there's like there's something wrong in the world and i don't know what to do about it and taking a pot shot at somebody on facebook or setting up a table in a student commons or whatever is is at least a way of doing something because because the world is going to hell in a hand basket and i have no agency right right right i need to do something right yeah right so so it's this moment where it's like i think something is true i look around me and it feels like nobody else is willing or wants to say that something out there is not true and the not truth being said out there is threatening something that i actually hold as sacred right and and and and i and i'm i'm worried right i have i have genuine anxiety that that that that i am going to somehow lose right and not in like some sort of silly game type way but like to really not be affirmed right and you know just i was just listening to something the other day paul uh another jordan peterson podcast and i think it was with bread it was the second one that he did with bread and i don't know if it was on his channel or it was on bread i think it was on his channel on his channel and he starts and he starts breaking down right once i'm sorry sorry brett um he starts breaking down and he says you know brett you have no idea how starving people are for affirmation i thought that was really a profound moment and i had not quite seen the jordan peterson phenomena in those those terms exactly right and so again going back to the table and that should be for both sides i was just going to say yeah yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna come come to that right and so okay so then you've got the guy with the t-shirt right so do the same thing what is he worried about there are good reasons there are real things that he's worried about right that that this posturing in the commons with the the stephen crowder table is hurting a kid another kid a group of kids i get that i really do get that but what is your role as the professor you know is your role to to like throw off the gloves and jump into the wwe ring with with the the the table guy i don't think it is i think i think with the bishop i think yeah no i think that's a failure of you're not showing empathy to the troll because we we've been taught that the troll is bad right the troll hates gay kids let's say maybe he doesn't hate the gay kids maybe actually he's worried that something that's even more important than the gay kid right in this in this like the gospel let's say like who's going to stand up for the gospel like i think that's important or he he might be gay himself and he's been pushing the sucker down i mean he might see plenty of that maybe so right maybe maybe he's right maybe the troll is actually a kid who suffers from same-sex attraction and he has made you know a pinky swear with the lord that i am going to abide by biblical teaching i'm going to like suck it up i'm gonna i'm gonna do this i'm gonna be you know a suffering servant and i'm looking at people across the commons and they're like oh don't worry about that suffering you don't have to suffer the only reason you're suffering you haven't given in to what you really are i mean that i mean just these the layers of gospel and anti-gospel fighting with each other in this silly little you know table t-shirt situation i mean it's it's a real it's it's a real um it's something i mean it's something and it's sad because it becomes immediately this 2d black white thing and we're yeah and to bat to brett's point it becomes political and it becomes a zero-sum game winning and losing um and it becomes everything in our culture all at once but paul but it has deep i mean look calvin college could fall apart on this this oh yeah oh yeah college could be dissolved in a matter of months because of this and this is the wisdom with i mean if this isn't this isn't the whole answer but part of the answer is don't feed the trolls i mean right like wearing the t-shirt in response to the table might just be reinforcing and posting it on instagram sure right right so just um i mean if if what we really need is is um encounter with a person well then the troll the troll is a person who needs an encounter but the troll the troll is tricky because the troll has set themselves up they've asked for a certain kind of response um that won't actually help their own situation right and so you like this is what jesus does right like when someone asks for a certain response that's not actually gonna help he doesn't give them that response right like like he won't play that game and i think learning and i'm not i've i've made this mistake on my own facebook course i've been getting trolled and i didn't realize until after i responded that oh that was a troll and i just gave the troll exactly what they they're looking for therefore i lose even when i'm right i've lost you know and like that keeping at the forefront of our mind that the encounter with the person whether it's the uh you know the persecuted minority or the or the troll or maybe maybe they're the same person uh for what you know i mean in all of myriad situations if there's no encounter with a person if it's only an encounter with an idea idea or worse with an ideology um there's nobody wins so how do you how do you re-dimensionalize the world from a flattened 2d binary i i you know so one of the things that i was working through with my lentin series yeah jesus loses his culture war he goes up above jerusalem and he weeps and he says if oh i i long to gather you if only you would be gathered and jesus knows within a few decades you know there's gonna be the revolt in 67 rome is gonna come in you know the the menorah is gonna be hauled through with the triumph of titus that is coming and the son of god can't stop it or so right there you have to begin to say what exactly is jesus doing and how is he working and what is he willing to you know and again because i've made this point before after the if if if i were jesus and popped up out of the grave on easter sunday i'd stop by pilots house i'd say how do you like me now you know knock on herod's door jesus doesn't do any of that and and so yeah and and and so then i think we in the church have to focus on him and i don't think we're gonna just read this now suddenly and oh here's the answer this is what we're gonna do no it's not gonna be that way right and we're gonna make lots of mistakes along the way and that's always the way it is but i think i think it is the gospels are deeply instructive for how to navigate this culture war and and not just in terms of what are what's the right side of the gay issue or the abortion issue or not just the right sides of these moral issues but in fact how to engage each other in i don't even know the words to say but but how to how to play this game in the midst of a culture war and i think that's what jesus is teaching us and i think we have a lot to learn so yeah so now you're the one with the time thing i just want to make sure you know that gail yeah i know i got a couple minutes that was a nice tight package right yeah yeah well then you know what that i i'm not gonna i can't speak against that i think that's the real deal right there so maybe that's where we'll end this for now yeah yeah i'm i'm good with that sounds good so all right well i'm gonna end the recording and i'll have a minute or two just to just to just to wrap up and so thank thank you for watching oh it was great thank you all i'll leave a comment i know there'll be a few to be with you guys again yeah all right
