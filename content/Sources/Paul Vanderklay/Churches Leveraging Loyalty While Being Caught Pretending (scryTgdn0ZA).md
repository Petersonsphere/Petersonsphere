 The time has come I am here. I just want to show Jacob what I just found Look at that. I know how to do it now. I know how to do it now And I see all the other places I can put in the branding I just have to develop the branding and put it in and some people Suggested that I develop branding from the Freddie and Paul show This week has been a week of the channel learning from each other And as Chad I've been paying a lot of attention to a lot of the channels in the in the corner this week Chad I think had a really good video yesterday where he was thinking through some things Christian Baxter is in there Charlie Brown Stefan from Europe What's his outstanding documentary a lot of if you go back to Jordan Peterson's Biblical series the first Biblical series I looked it up this morning because I was on Twitter tweeting about some things 12 million views on Jordan Peterson's biblical series number one What was that one about he didn't even get to us and typical Jordan Peterson fashion He didn't even get to talking about Genesis yet in the first video He was talking about the idea of God and he's talking about I remember one of the things that he talked about in that video Was you have to you have to practice? You have to embody before you actually know anything and so first we do and then we sort of represent represent we create representations outside of ourselves and then we watch ourselves do things and then we think about it and It's a slow process I think one of the distortions that has come to us because of all of the screens is the and the books before them is The idea that we can instantly produce and know When that is not how we are it takes time for us to know and that's where sort of you get this when if you were a kid growing up in a Christian community and you were reading the King James Version and And you read things like an Adam knew his wife and she conceived it's like Because as a kid you're like wow what what what kind of knowing is that and It's it's the kind of knowing that is embodied and it's the kind of knowing that is practiced and as I was listening to I caught Christian Baxter and Pete from strange theologies conversation and Christian brought up Thomas Kincade and of course like many people When you heard Thomas Kincade Can members make special elect emojis? I don't know Grizz. I don't pay attention with all of this stuff I gotta watch the cow. I gotta watch the hive mind because my ADHD brain is already distracting itself. Actually, there's a piece in the Conversation that I did with guy the wrestler About ADHD, which was really cool. He's getting his PhD in cog Psy So anyway back to back to this knowing this embodied knowing Part of what I see us doing in this little corner is becoming a body we are we are becoming a body bit by bit and We are doing it by watching each other sort of like Jordan Peterson talks about in that first biblical series we're watching each other and and And I heard Pete doing it in this conversation with Christian. I heard Chad doing it Grim I think is a is a ways ahead of us partly because grim has such a deep understanding of the hooks that set and video games have in us We're remembering to embody bit by bit because the programming is finally sinking in that's right Grizz you're you're very you're very right Yeah, there you go, Mountie Mountie with a $20 super chat And and we're watching each other and one of the other things that I was thinking about we've had this We've had this rush recently in the corner And waves of obsession sort of hit it off with his his video and then Christian Baxter with his videos of edits and Others others are doing it to where we've we've been we've been around now for six years And it's sort of like a six-year-old You know, it's about at the time that you're five or six that Before your five or six, you know, like when your diaper changing a kid our first kid was in the Dominican Republic We had all tile floors and the houses of the door were open. We had a fenced in yard And so we'd let my my son run around, you know, but naked because it was hot and you know You don't worry. You don't worry about diapers or anything like that And a child doesn't a child doesn't worry about diapers or anything like that And a child doesn't a child doesn't know that they're naked and this is sort of of course part of what's so interesting about the Genesis text when when the Lord says to Adam and Eve who told you you were naked and it's about six years old that the child begins to close the bathroom door and the child already begins to dress themselves and has a sense of being seen of Self-consciousness and so I think all of the chatter in the corner about self-consciousness is kind of We're we're moving we're moving into that new stage where we're self-consciousness and You know the Lord might come to us and say Who told you you were naked and and we didn't we didn't know we were just naked on these screens and we were Talking unfiltered Lee it's been interesting watching all the reactions to the little bit of editing I did in one of the versions of the verveky talk if you've only seen one version you haven't seen the unedited version There's no real new content in there But we take up we take out all of the unfinished sentences and John doesn't do it as bad as I do But we both are stammerers and that's in that sense kale check your email If you if you want in I I've given I've given a few people yeah, we're live Luke. I've given a few people access Maybe I'll maybe I'll Luke Oh Luke has two classes Sam might be able to join later. Let me see if I can add Luke Yeah, yeah, we've got a hierarchy People who got in early in in the six years You know or sort of it's it's not unlike It's not unlike who was it it was it the sale was it Benedict who said or it was Xavier who said give me a child for the first six years and I'll have them for life and so Sam and the so Luke and Job You know they were the super early and then Sam was just at the end and Sam said you know The the the og Randall's door closed after me and then you have the second waivers Grizz came later Chad came later, but one of the things that I love about this little corner is You can make your way up in this hierarchy With Skill hard work and determination you really can and as I'm watching I've been watching Chad for a number of years now and I can see the quality of his I Can see the quality improving and I can see that in Christian Christian is is already there and you know And I'm never quite sure that it's actually the quality sometimes. I wonder well, maybe I'm just Understanding them, you know sort of the problem that when I first discovered Jonathan Peugeot he's talking and I'm like what what what's going on there and And after I've been listening for a while I begin to understand and oh, there's dr. Jim um, I begin to understand and I begin to Appreciate and of course one of the big elements that came in One of the big elements that came in this week was T grog showing up in the live stream on Luke's channel and I mentioned that briefly I didn't give it the full treatment I did isolate the clip on Vander clips if you want to watch it if you have difficulty finding the the Luke live stream but for me that was a a pivotal moment because Suddenly something was happening that needed to happen. Let me see if I can find it And then a pastor friend of mine who's done a I don't see it right here. Um a pastor friend of mine who's done a Who's done a? Who's been getting into the corner? Did isolated the live stream or isolated a clip from the live stream of everybody celebrating when T grog came in now? I think part of what yeah Part of what happened in this corner is that? Trolls are welcome ish You can troll and you can be welcomed as a troll But you're gonna be tested as a troll and what you're gonna be tested for is If you control in the right way in this rather trolly corner And So T grog comes into that live stream with Luke and everyone is excited to see him and The thing about trying I'm always mind-reading attempting to mind-read the comment makers Especially if they're repeat comment makers, you know, that's what makes Anselman so mysterious He's revealed himself quite a bit But we've never seen his face and we've never seen his face He's revealed himself quite a bit, but we've never seen his face and we've never talked in this way we've only known Anselman through text and So we were you know T grog in text he could have been he could have been 20 years old He could have been 30 years old, but he comes in as somebody probably around my age and He starts telling his story and start talking about how he grew up in a difficult a He grew up in a he grew up in a difficult Environment it was in a family of alcoholics and then got rescued by the church and it was a rigorous conservative reformed church and that rigorous conservative reformed church really rescued him but he eventually began seeing the difficulties of That And he took a hard turn against that he saw Duplicity Luke, I'm gonna read I'm gonna read so this is the This is the the thumb the thumbnail that I made for this and some people noticed well, it's a church, but there are these a Skew banners hanging in the church and there's not an altar. There's an organ and Which sort of represents music and then the carpet in the middle is all broken up and everybody's sort of sitting in the pews with their heads down and And sitting in the pews with their heads down might mean they're praying But it also might mean Some of what Sam that this this comment that Sam made Which I pinned on Emily's story now Emily is actually in the backstage here food truck Emily is Working it's lunchtime. So it's a busy time. So she's listening in the background She might jump in when she has time Sam might jump in if he has time Cale might jump in at sea of time because this actually relates to kale story, too Because there are sort of two kinds of people there are more than two kinds of people More than two kinds of people but there are people in this corner that have stayed in church or have bounced between Churches and are now in a different church. And then there are people who are sort of church exiles who are Whether they're still in church or not in church. They feel exiled and when Sam wrote this I thought Wow as a six-year-old corner, we're sort of figuring out We are we are becoming self aware. So Sam writes this Emily's story seems to share a pattern of a lot of people in this little corner of the internet People just trying to make church work but they are curious and ask questions and expect demand even answers from leadership that is just under-equipped to answer as frankly all leadership is and And So they throw you under the bus to save their own face while pretending they are defending the institution meanwhile taking advantage of your loyalty to the institution the whole time and now of course you can hear a lot of you can hear a lot of Sam's story and that Sam of course if you look at the the little clip that I did with the wrestler Yesterday that little bit from that little bit from guy. Yep where You know you have the model and then you have the story and of course the depth of the model Sam denying the Trinity in Trinitarian churches make Sam an old enemy and I remember when Sam first emerged in the corner and And You know our our resident grandma that we loved You know just she was the first one out with her claws, you know, mama bear defending the pack from evil Sam and Now of course She began to she began Mary began to gentle and then could talk to Sam and now we can compare some notes with And now we can talk to Sam, you know old servetus we burned at the stake but uh, you know, is it a sign of Is it a sign of corruption that we haven't burned Sam at the stake? And so Sam noticed this in Emily's and this is very much also with Luke's and even though kale you see kale as a as a loyal son of the church of the Catholic Church, he's not leaving but Boy, he's got some questions and and this is quite widespread So I'll finish reading this and Luke then you can jump in the failure of the low openness high conscientious leaders who feel like they live in threatening times and need to tighten boundaries but can't Articulate why and the high openness high sincerity folks who get caught in the gears as the machine Titans I Feel for you Emily no fun although I'm not sure that was really the heart of what Emily of Emily's journey but that Tension is right there in Emily and I think the the conversation that you did Luke with Sam on confessionalism and you're continuing Coming back to you know, feel it just bristling and chafing against confessionalism a lot of that is there I listened to a video between John I think it's John Harris and Rosaria Butterfield and Rosaria Butterfield, you know a few years ago she sounded very Sympathetic at least in terms of People who the lifestyle she used to live as a lesbian woman and this latest book just seems You know hard lines and she's not gonna write things for Christianity today or the Gospel Coalition Anymore because they're maybe too squishy soft and winsome. Hmm, and I think in some ways here in the corner where we've we've both got we've both got the winsome and the hard liners and and I see us as really working this tension in the church, I don't know so there there's a Luke I have to give you credit here because I hadn't really planned this morning's live stream, but I thought I want to have some just chatting dynamics But the way that you've I think continued to evolve the just jet the just chatting thing on your grail country morning streams where you begin with you know You begin with your typical luke ness where you've you've got your ideas and you're wandering over the place But you sort of set the tone Before you open it up and then of course when you open it up it can go different ways. So Yeah, well Yeah, this is a it's an interesting This whole phenomenon is an interesting thing. It's something I'm still trying to get at I made that video on conservatism which probably of all the videos I've made and of the Pushback I've gotten like that one I feel like I must have not communicated it very well because it was just not understood at all but I think it's related to this is that the The the hardline impulse to me is a very Jonathan Haidt conservative disgust factor impulse It's this well-intentioned thing to to keep the outsider and the dangerous and the fringe at bay to protect It's a it's a temperamental disposition toward order Yes, which is fine. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it Which is fine, yeah, there's nothing wrong with it which is necessary you need it Yes, but but there is a concern like Peugeot said once that he said And he's talking about temperament conservative type people. They're they're fear like the the The example of their fear would be the camera the thing that you can't you can't put into a category It's this weird thing and he said liberal ten type people truly temperamentally liberal people They fear like the hillbilly It's the it's the inbred closed off thing where there's no new life. It's the kind of hyper ordered authoritarian Totalitarianism that's for sure me but the problem I think in modern categories and especially like American politics and culture war is they're both conservatives Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's right and And part of you know another strain that came out strongly this week and again partly through Your work on grail country, but also through Emily's conversation so Gavin and Chad had their wives on yeah, so good, but their wives weren't seen Mm-hmm. And so part of what I'm working on is behind the scenes Because we're struggling we're struggling with the Feminine because the feminine is the strange thing which directs our attention But is always as Peugeot said it's always sort of veil. Mm-hmm So it's it's the you know, so that's why you know the fan dance Is you know was a motif in burlesque Because what the fan dance does is works that boundary Between full revelation and that which seeing doesn't actually Fulfill and And so, you know this week I had I Had just I played just an astounding Conversation with Elizabeth Oldfield. Yeah, it was great. Love it And then the astounding conversation with Emily and For those in the member section, you know, it's been interesting because part of the reason the member section is key is because It's at least enough of a veil where you know, there's another there's another randos woman conversation That is is just amazing behind the paywall And of course all that older women are just amazing behind the paywall Behind the paywall and of course all that old Laura stuff. Yeah was incredible so and and you know you talk about it, I don't talk about it much actually, but but you often talk about the fact that So many of us here are Those of us who are married here so many of us it's just sort of one of us is in and sometimes indeed and the other is Really concerned. Oh man, I I Chad and I've been talking about this because multiple times Chad or other people have talked about having a conversation with you like I would love to have a conversation with you Gavin all of our wives and even have it not be recorded just to get just to talk my my wife was just like No No, I will absolutely not do that I have zero interest but part of it's hard because Chad had that video recently where he said I think it was I don't know if this was in a video or a private message to me and he was saying it's really difficult to explain to your wives or to somebody who's not Participating in this or who's not initiated in this world. What's happening? This is such a weird thing I I can't there's no parallel that I can compare this to there's really not It's a new thing. Well Chad in one of his video yesterday. He asked Are there other flotillas? Yeah. Yep, and and that was an interesting question because again we're at sort of the six-year-old developmental mark as a body and we're you know beginning to realize that we're naked and We're we're looking around and wondering is anyone else like us around? Yeah well, and this is I'm increasingly fascinated too with the the the body because this is a subtle body Yeah, and and the bodiedness of it and what are the boundaries of that body which gets into the heresy question of like when? When is something inside and outside the body and who decides and how do you discern that and navigate that hole? It's a fascinating conversation with me. I actually pitched it to another because uh So Katherine just I've been messaging her because I'm just like where are you? I kind of disappeared and she replied to me the other day that she's just kind of dipping her toes back in and I was like because Katherine's a little bit temperamentally different than me and But we have a great relationship and so I was like maybe that's I'd be a fun conversation to dive back into to have a Heresy TLC conversation because that's that comes up because that's what like MJ. Do you know MJ? He's a biblical Unitarian who comments a lot, but he's never yeah, yeah, yeah MJ I was thinking M and J but EMJAY. Oh, yeah MJ is another one in who has who has sort of found the liminal space here Yeah, and by I mean MJ's comments are always It's funny because in some ways he's like grim gris because he's always he's but he's not looking for the conspiracy theory of The three-level agency three-letter agency. He's looking for the spiritual Yeah, he's looking for the spiritual fraud and everything he sees that most of us say. Oh, this is good He's like, how do you know this isn't Satan's ploy? But but again in that ordered way Yeah, he's always fearful of the chaotic not hyper ordered right which is hilarious because he's a Unitarian Yes, and so he's always talking about heresy and it's like Yeah, well and yeah, it's a so he or Phlebas he either here Phlebas said this to me the other day Because because they're getting this vibe this increasing thing that now this Conversationalism this dialogos these long-form things. This is going to be the new this is the orthodoxy of TLC Where the kind of bounded set? Exclusion based on confessional isms is the new That's the new anathema and I said but but the difference at least for me though That's maybe true because somebody made that comment recently like we can't disagree or some ideas are more popular than others I was like, yeah, that's fine. We can disagree, but I'm not gonna exclude you Like I'm not gonna ban MJ or Phlebas keep saying what you're saying. It's just And and so that you know So then when CW decides and CW who is the new Anathema and I said, but I'm not gonna exclude you You know, so then when CW decides and CW who is If somebody is in this corner and they have not watched the two-hour plus rando conversation with CW You have some homework to do. Yeah because it's Entertaining and substantive it's substantive and so when CW decides he wants to make his splash in the corner He has this three-hour beast of a conversation with Nathan and and of course some of these characters are You know sort of the monsters because they're liminal because Nathan of course They and Nathan of course early on You know was was in bridges of meaning and he has some of is one of the Distinctions of being one of the few people to have actually been banned from the server brought back in banned again And again to get banned by Joey. That's like, you know Mm-hmm. That's just like going through puberty. It happens to everyone But to get banned by others in that in that leadership group of BOM that was you had to really You had to be the kind of troll that the rest of the trolley folks looked at and said no That's that's not what we're playing here. But all of this figuring out what we're doing Is this move towards self-consciousness playing together? And so it's like Peterson talks about in that first biblical series Where and and like a toddler does we're looking for the boundaries if I do this will I be excluded? How about this? How about this and we're watching each other and then we watch someone else do something and oh they they got and and again, this isn't because this isn't This doesn't have a leadership structure like some people want it to have which would be You know very institutionalized because you know, at least for my part I've said I don't want that What that means is that we sort of discover the organic boundaries rather than having PVK Establish institutional boundaries, which I think Sam goes back to I thought this was this was a Moment of self your your comment was a moment of self-consciousness for the corner Well, thanks I also you're right that I sort of had me Luke and Emily as Sort of top of mind when I was writing that comment Because there are others I think there are also others in the corner who Feel very comfortable in their church and But are worried are worried for both sides like in the Christian form church This is the issue right now On one hand, it's what are we gonna do with this with this whole sexual revolution? And at the same time it's Rita's cry at sinned Is this sinned telling me that my children can't be saved? Me that my children can't be part of the church right, I was so split in that moment like when Rita's her name when I like I know exactly what you're talking about and she's you know She's getting choked up thinking about this I'm like, oh man the boundaries are tightening and that always makes me nervous because I'm the next one to go as soon as boundaries are tightening and But I'm like, oh man, I kind of agree I hope actually the conservative faction of the CRC wins in some sort of sense, but I'm like, oh And I don't know I've like my own You know gang kicked out of churches has always been tied up with the LGBT question every single time There's this like what you would think what does the deity of Christ have to do with LGBTQ issues, you know But like every single time like what happened to me in college was the university game mad at the Christian fellowships for excluding gay people And then the Christian fellowships tightened down there and exclude me right that that was you know, the first thing and It's like I cannot tell you the number of times where something like this has happened where I am talking with a pastor or an important person The church I tell them my beliefs for the first time there some amount of flabbergasted and they'd be like Well, that would be like not believing in you know, that would be like believing gay marriage It's like in what possible world, you know is what I'm telling you like believing in gay marriage But that connection comes up all the time and then like another really weird thing that happens I still need Jonathan Peugeot to interpret this pattern is someone will kick me out of their church or whatever and then like a year later come out as gay and Apologize to me and then tell me that they're gay now. I'm like Huh You don't say and and it's like I don't know what that's about like Eric Eric the the priest said something like You know We don't want to glorify heresy and probably most people think that that's like what I wake up in the morning getting ready to do But I have never called myself Heterodox or a heretic or I you know, I don't like I'm not the heterodox, you know YouTube channel I think I'm orthodox and I and I'm not like trying I'm not trying to Like the intellectual dark web like there's that Jonathan Peugeot tweet We're like you're never gonna build something if you call yourself heterodox or dark or rebel or you know All these sorts of words and I like when I saw that to him like yes exactly. I'm not trying to play that game It's just everyone thinks I am Welcome Emily I Wanted to say something real quick because I think this is funny You remember in my I mentioned my parents getting kicked on the ministry. I left this part out for a reason but People started confessing homosexuality to my father and they the leadership felt like they just were losing complete control over They couldn't handle it was too. It was too much, you know, yeah, it's almost like he was turning them gay Wow You know what I mean, I know what you mean well and Sam that that is such an interesting observation and You know in some ways it hits on US politics too, because of course in 2014 when Trump starts looking at the border All the political pundits and TV were like what? isn't the narrative health care and It's almost like once you look on borders Many of the border issues just will become salient and and obviously I you know for for Christian history the border between the Trinity trinitarian and non-trinitarian became an immensely important important border and of course This it was fat. It's actually in my rough draft today. I was fascinated by the new Alexander the great series that's on Netflix somebody and end wokeness account in Twitter writes, you know Gosh, you know Netflix has Alexander and in the first turn ten minutes they turn him gay Any of us who have been listening to Tom Holland are like oh That whole gay thing. That's just the start of this conversation boys and girls. I mean You want to talk about sexuality in the ancient world Bring it on and it's like gay and there's a little bit of truth in that the way Netflix was handling it That cuz they are turning him gay Yes, but but of course Alexander engaged in all sorts of homosexual activity like his main love partner was a castrated Babylonian eunuch who was this pretty like 13 or 14 year old boy that then you know gets castrated So he keeps looking the same way for the next couple years and that's Alexander or Nero Alexander It was a unit like when he captures Babylon It was one of the you know the court sex slave eunuchs in the the court of Babylon and that's his main love interest for the rest of his life and Like You know, it was funny. I was watching like a couple of weeks ago. I was watching with my wife My big fat Greek wedding too and one of the subplots is the grandfather wanting to prove they's descended from Alexander the great I'm like no one's descended from Alexander the great He had two kids and that they were killed early on after Alexander died in the secession battle So he has no descendants. No one's descended from Alexander the great but part of that he wasn't Genghis Khan Because he had his same-sex sex slaves that he preferred to whatever women in the town He had just captured and so that's why there are names and it's of Alexander the great Well women are really difficult to deal with, you know, you really have to Don't give them the mic speak about your woman But but you know, so but to come back to swing back to one of the one of the interesting things here is the I mean what I'll The the woman who had who just hit a randos conversation She was really reluctant to release that I said why don't you try it in the membership section? But there are there are a number of women including Vivian We'll see if she makes an appearance in the comment section that look at this corner and are like What does this corner do do women fit into this corner? Because this is a really male space But yeah, we saw this on the discord server to on bridges of meaning discord server people would say all they're almost all men I said, yeah, but boy, I'll tell you those women have power. I mean because you if you'd cross Sherry or Andrea or Some of these other women in that discord server. It's like and and you know this in churches, too I mean Ministers they really keep an eye on the older women because that shadow matriarchy they have power So yeah, how I would say like of my closest friends in TLC half of them are women That doesn't mean yeah Well, I mean there's there's there's some there's some great women in TLC. Yeah, I mean you just but they're not they're not always There I mean in part of this is just the temperamental difference between men and women largely as a rule there's always exceptions, but women don't have nearly as much of a Need or desire to talk about what they think about everything all the time Is that true yeah Yeah, but not like in the intellectual Most of my friends have been guys for that reason I think I Should just say Emily I really enjoyed your story and I thought that that was wonderful So thanks for sharing Thank you. I was literally sick at my stomach for about 24 hours afterward I can't believe I just put that Well, also because I was like I felt like just a babbling full, you know But whatever it is what it is At the end of the 24 hours. I was like, all right, it's out there and I'm done and I'm just releasing it. So but you're That's one of the powers though of the randos conversations and personal conversations is that they're personal and so I always like to reference that Matthew McConaughey thing when he was writing his memoir when he said he think more universal he wanted to make it the less Relatable it came to everyone but then the more personal he made it the more universal it became That's because when you're telling your story Relatable to everyone and it's not I've had so many like right now. I have my inbox I keep getting notifications the more people that are seeing the video. They keep reaching out to me. They're finding me on Twitter Thanks for that Paul They're reaching out to me on Twitter or through my channel and I can't tell you how many women are like I didn't know that other People had similar experiences or they're afraid to talk about it Especially like more like the sexual abuse stuff and the reason I'm very vocal about it And I'm I don't have any more shame or hesitancy I'm not afraid to make people uncomfortable even talking about it because one out of four children has been sexually abused I think that's the statistic and every time I'm in a group of I mean whether it's men or women there You know and as soon as I open up a little bit about it They're able to open up and so I found that it's kind of a necessary courage because that's the only way you're gonna get healing And I think so much of people So many of our issues is just we have things in the darkness that have to come into the light you know and I think that yeah, so yeah when you're vulnerable and you invite someone else into your openness and The powerful thing I mean Well, I think it helps Emily that you are You are a worship leader. You're used to being on stage and even though Like and Sam got on that cuz Sam is also a worship leader, which is interesting. Oh really? And yeah, well Paul and lightener we have more than our fair share of Guitar strumming worship leaders in this little corner. We could make a great master. Wow That's great Yeah, yeah, it's super interesting. So you and that and when you're a worship leader You have to you have to get comfortable with sharing vulnerability on stage. Oh What yeah 100% even everything I mean think about it wait when you sing It's so easy to become self-conscious like oh, what does my face look like? Am I making like a weird face or you know, like am I moving too much or am I not moving enough? And you'll get comments. They'll get feedback about stuff like that But one thing that like I would say I continually get feedback on Is they'll say when I sing it's like I'm telling stories and I don't I I know what they mean And I don't know what they mean at the same time, you know, and I think it's If I have a gift if I can say that or be so bold. It's like I feel very deeply connected when I'm singing Yeah, and it's particularly in that environment like when I'm able to forget myself then I'm And I think that I don't know. I don't know how that translates but it does Cuz I get to be back on it constantly To be a good worship leader you have to be sort of like the emotional model that everyone in the church is looking at To figure out what they're supposed to do and how they're supposed to feel and how they're supposed to react And so you're sort of trying to channel the mood That are the vibe or the spirit or whatever that the whole church is supposed to be experiencing and that it's it's kind of a heavy burden to have to be able to do that on command well And not just that there's you have to resist feeding on the energy of the room Because and I remember back when I was like 1918 I read this watchman knee book called the latent power of the soul has anyone ever I've y'all what ever read any watchman knee I've read some but it is I Got into him for a while. First of all, just like a Los Angeles perspective from like an Eastern perspective, you know, he's Chinese anyway and he mentioned something in there about that kind of Like when he would get up to preach there is this temptation to like feel the room and when they're energized or whatever you feel energized and But then there's a real danger in that because he's like you should be relying on the Spirit of God for example, you know And sorry, there's a train going by Well, I think we want to have some amount of interacting with the room And some amount of feedback of that and that can be really good and helpful and exciting. I think that's me Yeah, I think it's a well, I think it's you're engaging with it like in a conversation you have to be aware of what like the facial, you know, whatever but You can't be like so if people aren't into it whatever and if all of a sudden your spirit just like falls and you just you know What I mean? It can't become You can't be reading people for like how good am I am I doing okay? Am I am I doing good like, you know, I Don't know that makes sense the Gospels. So again, I'm in Mark and the Gospels Jesus and the crowd have a very interesting relationship in the Gospels. Jesus is very suspicious of the crowd he He works the crowd but he never surrenders to the crowd I think we get at that in this video space with audience capture You the worship leader shouldn't be captured by the audience you could if you got to go Emily Just turn off the camera and I'll drop you out of the room. So I think I think they have it. I'm checking on them Okay. Okay To see there's there's a reason she's food truck Emily and you see that here So And as a and so then when I contrast let's say worship leaders with ministers and preachers I mean, there's some similar dynamics, but that's where this this confessional element This confessional element is important. It's interesting. What what Eric says here what father Eric says here How do you get back to Jesus if not be a tradition? and You know part of what's going on right now in late Protestantism is a continual conversation about tradition and that's that's to me where the Islam questions really get interesting because if scholars like You know some of those that Tom Holland worked from for the shadow of the sword are correct Islam seems to start as this sort of a common folk religion a monotheistic Folk religion that was kind of a least common denominator in a certain area and you know we shouldn't be afraid of that in America because the United States has had that for the 20th century and 19th century had especially the 20th century had a very much a common The lowest common denominator religion you see that in Norman Rockwell and whether you are Trinitarian or a unitarian or a Catholic or a Jew? Whether you went to church or not as long as you believed in God and you like to Frank Capra movie yeah, that was good enough and And then of course traditions developed from there. So You know, and I think the turn with many towards orthodoxy, you know, I was impressed Some conversations with you know, I'll use Jordan Hall because that one's public, you know, Jordan Hall Joins Christianity and he's not orthodox Sounded pretty Calvinist if I had to guess too and like you should get a victory lap every once in a while Paul, you know You know the the ortho bros and the the Catholics get all these or all these victory laps every time someone converts to their thing I think you get to pat yourself on the back a little bit sometimes He's probably my guess is he's it's probably a fairly It's probably a fairly liberal form of Calvinism not not terribly strict, which is which is fine So but but that's but but that's part of his town is a PC USA camp Like a summer camp in a college of the PC USA of the PC USA Which is the liberal one right which is the liberal one, right? Yeah So I suspect that there are some highly devoted mainliners that that he has What is mainline I keep meaning to Google it The mainline is a train route that runs from downtown Philadelphia through the ritzy suburbs of Philadelphia And that came to be attached to the sort of churches that you would see in ritzy suburbs Which are sort of like the high prestige high social status Denominations which would include Presbyterianism congregationalism and Episcopalism and unitarianism kind of Methodists and some Methodists, but the big the big stone and brick churches that you would see in a cushy suburb, right? And that's what it okay. Well, I'm in Texas and like growing up. It was definitely Baptist and everything was first Baptist. I was wondering about that. I'm like there's so many of y'all. I'll see you all be first There's no there's like absolutely no second Baptist or third Baptist You know what I mean? Like it was all first Baptist, but we would always call them like there was a church It's called Greenacres, but everyone called green flakers or green fakers like, you know So I had a bad idea about I Don't know how I got from that from mainline, but some some northern Baptists were also mainline and liberal So it's That's all the rich people well There you go Northern Baptist is very different and it can often be quite liberal in your northern cities And it's an entirely different species than southern path. Yes, and then there's black Baptist Which is also its own completely separate species Although that main line and the social power Black Baptist like African American Baptist Church So a very their own thing and I was thinking when we were talking about worship leaders even the idea of having a worship leader is a pretty African American idea and oftentimes in African American churches It is the preacher who will be preaching and then get very inspired I'd start singing to a song and then the organ player is immediately right there behind them to back it up and everyone sings The song and the the the preacher is leading at the whole time and then we're back into a sermon And then that could lead to a different song right and That that idea of having sort of an emotional focal point at the front is I think comes I think comes from the African American tradition more so than the European Protestant tradition And also partly because of the in the African American Church people didn't have much access to education Yeah, so they had to lead with other things you couldn't have a hymnal even you can count on your your congregation to afford or read hymnals So you have the call-and-response songs where there are verses that the leader will sing and then there's a chorus or an echo back That is very repeated that's easy for a congregation to do while being led without him knows or whatever or PowerPoint slide Yeah, and you had the You know it people shouldn't fail to appreciate the ways that the American Civil War Fundamentally reshaped to the church in the United States And what that what that meant? That's okay. You're on you're on You're on cellular so we got lots of experience with that. I'm so I'm so Tucker Tarty. I just accidentally just click out of it You're so Tucker tired I haven't listened to Tucker's talk with Putin yeah, that'll be my treat for this Oh my god I had a question that isn't related to Vladimir Putin um how did how did it feel reading the comment on on your own video? Because that's a weird first experience I Totally cried like I felt so you know at first you're kind of bracing yourself and then there's just so much so much love honestly and Yeah, I felt really good and also just felt like oh my gosh There's some I didn't know that this was gonna resonate with so many people and that yeah, it felt really good Have you done one Sam oh I did one once of a once a long time ago It's probably been over three years ago at this point Maybe even almost four there was there were problems with the first one remember that there was so we did We had a first one and like I had a bad internet connection And then I recorded it in a separate part of my house the next time like you can tell it's not this background I have new Wi-Fi since then but Yeah, I remember that so I got to I think that part of the reason why the first one that was published was relatively good and coherent was because I'd like a practice run with you and so I Have to go back and find I have to admit that this whole time I thought you're CW I got your face mixed up with somebody else's name Yeah, see W and I have a W is CW is a curious fellow. He has his own story that he he would also fit the comment that this The title of this video was inspired by he also got chewed up and ground out by a PCA church for Not being able to like their definition of inerrancy among other things CW got himself kicked out of an OPC church He made them discipline him and then they did It's all interesting And he came from a way international background like myself, so we you know, we have more than a few things in common Wow, I didn't I didn't know I didn't know that he didn't spend much time in it Like his mom was only in it for a while. And if I remember his childhood was Rather had a lot of moves in it. So I don't think he got a full dose of it. But he was in the way for a while Yeah, yeah So Sam What do you think about this thesis of self-consciousness and the corner? I mean you've been watching it for a while now I Mean, I feel like this isn't the first time we've had a bout of navel gazing and again I don't think it's a bad thing as long as it's not too overly narcissistic To define the relationship and define the thing But I remember I don't know We've had a couple times where we've had to think about who we are Like you keep bringing up there are people who wanted to organize this thing and I'll admit I was what me and Hank were Calling you on the phone sometimes to trying to come up with our ideas of how to do that and for the record I am completely Grateful that we did not take my own advice and I think that you were right and that time has borne that out So I'll repent from those earlier ideas But I think that it's it's Interesting that it's still going We haven't we're maybe a little bit bigger and we have some new momentum It's not like a ton of accelerated growth, but we haven't fizzled either Right. There are obviously some people now who are less engaged than they used to be But there are also a lot of people more engaged now than they ever used to be And so I don't know and who was it was it Chad or grim who asked about are there other flotillas out there I was chum. Yeah, maybe someday we'll be sailing in the ocean and be like We'll meet up but um, I don't know I feel like we're doing something like reinforcing a Form of I don't know Consciousness or spirit or something in each other that is some way of Strengthening faith through whatever in the world is going on Do you think father Eric is right I Don't think so. I don't know. It would certainly be a huge blow and I don't want that to happen And Maybe not Could be right There would be have to someone who would fill that vacuum and that would be hard and I think that Well, it's interesting that Peugeot isn't trying to do something similar Well, what are the interesting things that came out and both my recent conversations with John and Jonathan is they both in their videos said I'm not trying to start a community. You're like I'm trying to start a community. That's what I'm doing and that that was interesting to me because I think part of it is so you have the verveky foundation and they have volunteers and You have the symbolic world which seems more loose, but they sort of have the container of Orthodoxy around them I don't know that there's anyone gonna be at the stage at the symbolic world summit who is not Orthodox and I think that's I Think that's telling yeah. Yeah And so it's basically becoming sort of an orthodox evangelism arm is In a certain sense what the symbolic world seems to be sort of at its core I know certainly I know lots of people who are going who aren't Orthodox, right? but is the symbolic world really just sort of a Evangelical arm of the Orthodox Church and I know some people would love my channel to be that for the Christian Reformed Church but and and this and this is what's interesting again to me and You know, this is sort of the self-consciousness thing. I mean Emily Both you and Emily have aspects of your stories that get into this comment that you made there's a there's a not fitting with church Even while I mean Emily is a worship leader at a prominent prominent evangelical church I'm a minister in an Evan in a evangelical ish church and Sam you you are kind of an ongoing exile except I'm good attending mainline churches at the moment me and Jordan Hall, I'm good. I'm going to you and see you make it sound like you are going with Jordan No, I wish that would be fun. Um But yeah, I mean I'm going to a mainline church because that's really it's like the only option that that is Viable with all these the constraints of my theology and having a family is a lot So I honestly never I really never thought I would would go to an evangelical church. I felt like honestly embarrassed You know So here's something for our two worship leaders if this appeared on Twitter and the question was is worship overproduced which That that's sort of an easy thing and kind of lowbrow America when you know We've got the smoke machines and we've got the stage and we got the lights and of course, this is all although This is popular in lowbrow America Over engineered is this that was exactly my follow-up tweet which was What about this my friends? Um Good point Is this worship over engineered? I mean Okay, the problem that I have with this and this is what I've been struggling since the absolute very first time ever went into a church was I am very resistant to having my emotions pulled at and music has such a powerful thing and I feel like so easily it gets used to Manipulate and almost like falsify spiritual experiences and a lot of that overproduction can be Yeah, it can be that it can just be engineering a feeling that's not necessarily having anything to do with God And so and so I'm always resisting Resisting that and there's like a constant war going on inside of me every you know And I feel like I'm in a really good group of leadership that they're aware of these things they talk about these things I'm just like I just don't want to be part of yeah Orthodox don't feel any of that embarrassment about their buildings Yeah, that's what I think it's hilarious we we are like meeting in what looks like schools like boxes, you know But we bring the music And I Shouldn't forget how good at music we are compared to the Catholics and the Orthodox I mean, I've been to a Catholic service one time where we sang a mighty fortress is our God I'm like looking in the him though. I'm like, are they gonna credit Luther with that one or not? So much of Catholic music is Protestant and The Protestant think Protestants are way better at music then Catholics are Orthodox. I'm sorry I okay some chance can be cool sometimes but let's just be real here the product What's that sometimes the theology it I said the lyrics aren't always that great and sometimes the theology is very iffy Sometimes I actually one Easter. I was singing a song and I said guys like in the middle of the rehearsal I just said can y'all please Go over these lyrics, but can you please can we like there's something not right? And I don't even remember what song it was. I was like, like first of all, it didn't even make sense Second of all, what the heck are we singing? So there yeah, there are That's the thing that we do on Sunday I have so many questions about It's a real problem for me it was dirt it was during a live stream that I realized that a deep part Protestantism was the spiritualization of the Architecture and the physical floor layout of the Orthodox and Catholic We you know you lose vestments because you have the priesthood of all believers You lose the rail that separates the boundary whether it's physical and a rail or a beam or however The tradition has it you lose that And and you have You Protestantism Replicated or basically spiritualized What had been done in other ways in the traditions and that was super and so then when you see an Orthodox Church in a strip mall You have to ask Can you really can you really I've seen it. I've seen I know I've seen them too, but because there's like, you know 12 You know Syrians in some small town and so this is what they can do Right. Yeah, but that's why I guess they don't do house church Well, they would so so that's why so a good friend of mine he was taught he had an Orthodox priest in it was a good friend of his in the same town and My friend had planted one of the more successful Christian Reformed seeker churches And he so he was talking to his Orthodox priest friend about evangelism and he said oh We're we're we're not doing evangelism yet. Okay, there's there's I want to I want to What up cycle has done? I'm still figuring out the whole membership thing if you've been waiting to get in membership But for some reason you can't afford three dollars You can take those memberships up cycle is just gifted ten free membership so you can become a member I hope kale gets in because I want kale in there but Anyway, so I'm gonna stand up for the Protestant music a little bit I see the comment section giving me some pushback on this first off people have like such short memories That they think all of Protestantism is just what one Evangelical megachurch looked like last Sunday or something like that when the reality is is that Protestantism is this? Enormously broad thing, you know, I cited a mighty fortress is our God that song is 500 years old and You know, we've been at this for a long time And so you can't just like pick your least favorite Example that feels the most cringe to you now and project that back across half a billion people over 500 years and think that that's a fair thing to do but I think that that really the reason why Protestantism and music go well together is because the experience is so egalitarian and that it is remembering to meet people where they're at and to make sure that no one's left behind and that music has that ability even more than architecture or Other things like that. I Think that's right and it's we also tend to forget the fact that even though Americans come from all these other different countries of the world the American Church was deeply impacted by the English language and by you know, there's this period in in England when sort of the Golden Age of him to D where people these these theologians were writing hymns because they knew that the only way to get theology in the in the newly industrialized urban masses were hymns and Many of our great hymns come from that period and we are actually I think again in another golden age of Protestant hymnody, although him isn't exactly the right word and I mean praise songs kind of went away in the 80s and 90s, but You know You have to remember you need you need 10,000 bad worship songs to get the one gem Mm-hmm and that there are there's still more people today alive who find that form of worship compelling and Touching them in a way that growing up in their Catholic Church, no matter how beautiful it was does Yeah, and that You know be very careful to just discount this or throw it away as you know, 7-eleven songs and Electric guitars and stuff like that Christianity has always been taking advantage of the newest musical technologies to reach people You know as an organ shouldn't an organ not be allowed in church because it's powered by electricity, you know, so Well and and Dale Addings comment here first CRC orange city Which probably means nothing to most of you aren't city is in northwest, Iowa They do a lot of deciding who's going to be president in northwest, Iowa That would be a traditional Christian Reformed Church and many Christian Reformed churches traditionally These were big singing churches. You didn't have anyone on stage. You just had a hymnal. You maybe had an organ and Boy they They do your own harmony Would you did the CRC have choirs that were sort of like? Interest and would lead singing in some kind of sense or was it more egalitarian than that? There were a couple there were some kind of Cathedral Christian Reformed churches the Christian from churches always been caught between the tension between the main line and the evangelical So there are a few that did the choir thing but but many were Congregational singing which was interesting because that was a deviation from the tradition which was Only Psalms and then even so sometimes acapella So but I loved for a while we had acapella singing here at Living Stones. I loved it Yeah I mean acapella singing can also be amazingly beautiful and awesome like primitive Baptist Appalachian music Like that stuff is bone-chillingly cool and they have like super strict rules about what the music can do and You know no instruments and stuff like that. That's some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard and bluegrass owes a huge amount to the spirit of primitive Baptist Appalachian music and so Well, it was also very it was also very interesting that So you had the you had the seeker movement which sort of brought the stage and then you had the emergent Movement and the emergent movement sort of brought folk Music and put that on the stage and so, you know, I Think I guess is I've seen a couple of your little videos that a nephew or something did it instead of you Emily But you're you're a little bit more folkish than you're not up there being Taylor Swift Now on a stage, that's actually That's you're 100% right. I'm definitely more folk-style singer Like finger songwriter. Yeah, so anytime they give me one of the like big songs like what's her name Lauren Daigle? I always have to have it Redone for me because I you know, I'm not one of those And that powerful thing is but to build an Orthodox Cathedral I remember the you know, the father at st. Andrew's I don't want a black I don't want a bad mouth hand but he was talking about you know, we have over a million dollars just in the stone in the floor and In a in a Protestant Church if you have someone with some musical skills and a guitar You know There you go. You can work with that So Alright the difference between that kind of hierarchically oriented church structure and egalitarian oriented church structure, too There is something a little snooty about assuming that you can't do worship properly until you've got a couple million dollars into your granite floor But I just point that out. All right, I'm dropping Can I say something up like to This kind of goes back to the very beginning when you were opening up to this and it's related but maybe a little bit About like teagrug and I was thinking about That and also how I view evangelical church or the church I'm at now and worship and all these things in such a different way And it's back to that message. I sent you to from actually it turned out It was the intro to the Chesterton book on everlasting man when he talks about You have to get far enough away from something sometimes to see and hi Chad anyway, um, and I feel like that's something that happened for me it's like I had to go so far away until I almost forgot the whole language of it and then when I heard someone else like Jordan Peterson and pageau it's like there's they're talking about it like a foreigner talking about it and I was able to see it through completely different eyes and Yeah, I have a completely different appreciation for church as it is and all of it All of its weirdness and all the problems I have with it Like someone who traveled really far away from home and really got homesick, you know, I see it I see it that way That's Sorry, that's e-grog thing. I feel like I hope he's having it some more Like sometimes they become so familiar to you that you have so much contempt for it, you know Anyway, well, I think it his in his story and I I hope I get a chance to talk have a little deeper dive with him because he There's there's this kind of continual evolution where on one hand if you get saved by something If you get this a look like if if Chad if Chad hit a point where he would look at AA and say If you could sort of see through AA That hits hard and and so you're kind of constantly Working on working on these things. So Yeah, that's why I really like what guy was talking about with the model versus the story You know like so like if if I if I if I made a Basically, I would it would become the the model would be the most important thing and I did that for a while and Yeah, probably got pretty close to basically deconstructing myself out of out of AA but So it's actually in this in the stories that we share with each other like where where the the where the life is and so there has to be like this this kind of like balancing between the model and the story and That so that was pretty huge that was very helpful That that thing that he pointed out there Which made a whole bunch of stuff like kind of snapping the alignment for me Especially with some of the annoyance that I was having around Like why is this person saying this thing? Like I don't understand doesn't make any sense. But then I was like, oh, that's that's why because He's this person has a vision. It's very much model oriented not story oriented and So and then one other thing back to what Emily was just talking about about how Peterson helped you come back around we've heard this a lot with a lot of different people Laura Laura from Chicago or from Burlington or whatever have that same same exact thing and that's why I was saying like Peterson reminds me of what Zeppelin and and the Beatles did with blues music and they brought Christianity like like those bands brought the blues back to America And and then that's kind of what Peterson did for for Christians and then also ears of people that had no understanding of Christian or you brought like this real lush like Spirits it was like whoa, you know, and so a lot of us I mean myself included I would be married or in the church or any of that stuff without without Peterson You know, and anyways, it wasn't just Peterson. It's also Sam Harris and all those guys it's like when you get so far like for me like so I traveled so far away to where I was like So immersed in the new atheism stuff and then all of a sudden you hear this voice like a voice crying out in the wilderness I've heard like a million people describe Jordan Peterson voice like that It's like all of a sudden like that was the voice that was calling to me and I was like, yeah That sounds way better than this stuff, you know But in Peterson moved did the thing where he was weaving real nice between story and model story and model story and model and so Like he was using a model of psychology But also he was using the Bible more like a story than a model, which is really interesting Right kind of cool. All right guys, I gotta get back to work. I'm trying it fired. All right, don't don't do that I'd get fired if I didn't own this place. Yeah Pat this first time I've Say a little bit about yourself Well, I we did a rando away a way back and I thought you looked a little familiar. Yeah. Yeah, I've just been lurking ever since Yeah, Paul. I reached out to you recently. I just Enrolled at Calvin for an MDiv. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. You're that Pat and that one. Yeah Well, oh gosh say a little bit more about that it's been Long time since I've been out of Calvin Sem. Yeah, sure. So I'm doing them so folks who might remember not I my first career path has been studying music on the double bass and sort of struggling to to make a career out of it in the professional orchestra additional world and Not the first not for the first time I Wondered about doing vocational ministry and in seminary and all this stuff. So this time around it seemed like it was time So I'm still staying in Ottawa. I'm doing their their hybrid program and Sort of watching and waiting to see what comes of it Any any impact from this little corner on the students at Calvin Seminary Any anybody else watch well, you're not on campus. So you're a little disconnected probably yeah, I'll be going at the end of February so I'll see if we if I find anybody in the woodwork See what happens Dale adding the orange CRC comment, which was a great comment Yeah, just reminded me. I hadn't been back to that church for a couple years and went back there about three months ago I've been going to a Lutheran Church in Dallas area and I literally I was up in the front row With my kids who were the first time they were over in the church. I know it was just deafening in there We've forgotten how loud it actually was a Few hundred people who can sing and are singing together and are well led is a makes a formidable sound Yeah, I mean and plus it's just it's normal to be singing four-part harmonies. Yeah, that's just everyday occurrence. Yeah. Yeah, that's what you If you grow up CRC, that's kind of what you grow up with Pat I don't I'm trying to remember. Did you grow up CRC? No, my my wife did I grew up sort of Catholic and then Remembered became an evangelical in my 20s. Okay. Yeah and And so you you're worshiping in a CRC Not at the moment I'm at a Baptist Church right now One of the worship leaders there too and yeah, well I intend to be ordained with CRC Have a long story there I guess but yeah That'll be that that'll that'll that'll bring some interesting questions on your candidacy exam Yeah, well, I'm already in touch with with classes and yeah. Anyway, it's been it's been pretty sweet They've been very accommodating and and sort of understand where I'm at. I'm just not ready to leave yet That's all right. I'm long and short of it Alan Alan what brings you here? Are you are you have do you have enough with the with this little corner? bellybutton introspection I'm getting ready to drop some more enoughs, you know, we're getting ready But actually I mean sort of branching off of the enough a everyone was so incredibly exceptionally kind to me in the comments of my Rando's so, you know, I was very thankful for that But as well, I was kind of doing some reflection after my talk and I kind of after speaking with some friends realized For me for my personal development If I'm gonna be in the corner anymore, I gotta have a voice or you got to get out like it's it's one of those things where if I'm just voyeuristically watching other people talk about ideas and you know, it's actually not good so And I love the corner so much that I'm like, okay, well put up or shut up so You know, this is me in the corner and there's tons of topics I'd love to talk about but that's just I you know, I saw the chat pod up pop up I had no meetings for the next 30 minutes. So hey, I'm here. I'm putting up or I'm shutting up. So good good well, I like that Emily's keeping the camera on the food truck because of course we have the We have the we have Chad doing his tile this this actually goes back to the bridges of meaning days when I I used to just have my camera on in my office and other people would do the same thing We were just kind of virtually not alone together at work here. There's a there's a there's a one of our bigger monsters over here and the Waiting to be let in so everybody brace yourself because I'm gonna let him in hang on. Here he comes the monsters here I like judaizing Pharisee a lot better The Jacob Federechi Probably the probably the person that I have had probably the most pleased to ban him from the corner But here he is You wouldn't ban me from the corner. I Don't want the corner to be the kind of place that I can ban people You can ban people Yeah, but I don't want to That's right but the fact is I mean This is this is so people watching you talk about Jacob I think oftentimes get the wrong idea of our relationship could be Like if you were to say hey Um, you shouldn't do that I would take that seriously and you know, I would I Don't want to say that to you because you know you don't Think well, what's wrong with your internet connection today? Jacob? You usually have a good connection. It's it's been since the storm. Oh That's right. You guys got dumped on in LA. Yeah the spectrum yesterday I barely had internet but Speaking of CRC next week I'm having a discussion about therapy and theology with the reverend cedric parcels Good good. I think cedric. I think you and cedric are a good, uh a good pairing in terms of conversation I like your conversations with cedric and I think Speaking about this little corner. I think what we really need to talk about is where Therapy is different from theology and the conflation of the two is is what I think is the problem Go ahead dale. Do you want to say something? I was just thinking about multiple topics the therapy theology thing is getting to me I happen to be going to therapy because of divorce for the last two years typed off and they aren't They aren't anything to do with each other You know, one is how to try and how to understand other people's relationship to me at least You know Um theology is how I should live my life. They're way different things, correct? But too many people think they're the same I I wouldn't say they're the same but I wouldn't also say they're completely disconnected therapy has to tell us And uh, they're not disconnected because they're both dealing with the emotional support support systems of the body in a lot of ways I I think you get a lot of trouble when your therapist becomes your priest or when your priest becomes your therapist I think you get a lot of trouble that way Well, let's let's welcome let's welcome ash into this ash another major Um, I think another major randos conversation I think especially for a lot of the protestants a lot of the reformed people because there is kind of a complaint that That but my channel isn't reformed enough and uh, jacob would ironically both agree and disagree with that but um I don't disagree with that at all. I I I but but you also think that there that this that Reformed christianity's idolatry. So you both want me to be more of an idolater and less of an idolater at the same time I'm not here to change you paul. I've said that a million times All right ash, what do you have to say for yourself? Well First off i'd like to clarify something. I'm not sure if I can call myself order for christopher I don't know. I don't know what I am I don't I I like to be in the hallway and and look into a lot of denominational doors Uh, and and just stay at the edges of them. I've always been that kind of person from my story You know being an armenian living in a muslim country Immigrating and just i'm always on the outskirts of things. So I don't feel very comfortable right in the middle of something Uh, but I I did have a question and I don't want us to come across A mean spirited at all. I i'm really you know, we when we talk about Religion and uh worship music styles of you know or church church buildings that were much more, uh, you know spectacular versus the You know the high school, uh thing And the music being more, you know performative and so on The other question I have is There's I think the same thing applies to The teachers themselves in other words the level of Study that you had to attain and achieve in order to be called a minister was Exceedingly high. I mean my understanding from reading these guys harnack and and boving and so on I mean you you I mean these were brilliant people and Now, you know, it's it's very easy to be a pastor I mean you could just start a church just i'm starting a church next week and have a facebook ad and and uh Call up a high school gym gymnasium and start services. So so the The barrier to entry is very very low now and I think you know Worship was led by the minister And um that minister had to know quite a lot of theology quite a lot of greek and hebrew and so on so the You know if we're going to talk about the music being a little bit more pop we have to also talk about how the Leadership has also been More sort of you know, let's say common and there's good and bad in that but I think it's an important aspect That is a huge topic Because it has everything to do with What you are educated in and into and the for example in the seeker days Evangelicals are constant if there's a form of christianity that is um deeply impacted by modern psychology, it's Evangelicalism there's probably I i'm not going to talk about jewish groups, but there are problems but evangelical study themselves continuously and one of the big findings during the seeker heyday was theological education was a negative indicator of pastoral success now You have to ask yourself What all of those metrics are and what they're pointing to? Because a word like success is sort of this word. That is a telos in and of itself but i've This is this is so so difficult because it has everything to do with the the the way that the body of literature Connects with The culture that the people are in for example, if I had a phd in um In georgian studies That wouldn't help me a lot pastoring at living stones and so This is a this is I mean ash that is such a huge huge topic And and it's a big deal and you know, this actually is a topic that jacob connects with a lot, too um because jacob is someone who Go ahead i'm just gonna say I think it has a lot to do with the difference between psychology and theology And I think it has a lot to do with you know pop psychology being so common in the church and why? the you know What do what do aspiring pastors do when they want to hone their skills? They watch ted talks and they they look at all the top 10 ted talks and how well they performed and they try to get Their intonation and their timing and their pace and you know So no wonder you sound like a ted talk and no wonder the the the uh, not you not personally I'm just saying, you know young pastors. No wonder it sounds like a ted talk and and no wonder it's uh, The complaint is i'm going to listen to a ted talk at church But but you wouldn't say that most evangelical preaching well boy That's I mean it's I mean ted talks are basically a style of rhetoric that is actually probably at this point Uh losing its luster because it's been memed it's overdone. Yeah Um, whereas there was there was also before the ted talk in the in the crc There was what was sometimes called the the prank tone Which was the preacher's voice? And if you were preaching you sounded like something and it was phlebas here in the corner that said You know when he first learned oh, there's a christian reform minister on youtube who's gotten some traction You know phlebas's first instinct was that's the last guy I ever want to listen to Because there was a tradition in which that minister spoke and You know But part of the fun thing about for me about jacob and why I like having jacob around is jacob gives unfiltered opinions on various always unfiltered opinions on various elements of let's say what's going on in jewish communities and You know and jacob's own What what are the interesting things that's happening now and where ash you and jacob both have interesting stories is that You've got You're you're both people who grew up in islamic societies as minorities So to be jewish in iran after the iranian revolution Think about that to be um, you know to be armenian in egypt At once it starts creeping away, you know, it's egypt of course was part of that big secularization of islam After the first world war and then you know as the 20th century and into the 21st century increasing islamic identification so There's so many subtleties in all of these systems The difficulty is we we we have to work with such low resolution tools Well, I I will be first to admit it's far easier to be an armenian in egypt than jewish guy in in So, yeah well Depends when but yes more recently. Yes, but um, I think one thing paul um through erin ren really pointed out was Evangelical christians are starting to have to Understand what it's like to live in a negative culture in a culture that is actively opposed to what you believe And that's I mean that really is what when the woke talk about privilege, right? It's it's not like they don't have any like it's not like they're only talking of uh Ridiculous stupidities there is such a thing as privilege now it's That doesn't mean I agree with everything else they say about it but Evangelicals are losing their privilege in the united states. They just talk I think it's I think it's more complex than that because of the relationship between the mainline and the evangelicals Because what what the american culture war has long been? Is a fight between these two? Aspects of civilizational christianity protestant civilizational christianity in the united states and um So and and a lot of what people are looking at are at these boundary markers But of course boundary markers are always a product of selection so No, and and I I agree with I agree with erin's Book the question is just going to be It's really hard somehow Associating the the what it's like to be an evangelical in america with what it's like being a jew in terran I mean I hate to say it paul, but um, I do see our culture possibly going I'm not saying it's likely to happen, but i'm saying that there we definitely are at a point where at least some people Uh burn want to burn down churches And and they will I think it's going to be a very interesting conversation So one of the videos that's in the membership section that jacob will not watch because he won't give any money to youtube You can grab one of up up you can grab one of those gift memberships and go see it jake. I think they're all gone Oh Um Is and i'll probably release it soon Is my conversation with john lumgar who is doing jazz cow? um, but we get into what I got into a little bit with elizabeth oldfield about What it's like to be a christian in england because that was fascinating how If you go to church and you believe stuff about jesus that are sort of crunchy christian stuff And you're in england You might not get a promotion or a job if people find out you go to church Even though it's a country With a state church I mean, it's just Fascinating how nuanced these these things are and so I I think I think a lot of american evangelicals are Getting kind of like cry babies right now Um, they don't have it very hard. They really don't It's relative it is relative. It's relative and if you're used to I mean, yes, I remember in iran as a child going to a jewish school where we had to Uh to have classes on how islam is correct and judaism is wrong. That was a jewish school right, and so imagine sending your kids to A school that tells you Right that it that teaches that your religion is wrong Well, of course we would never put up with that here in the united states. It would be intolerable But that's because we're used to something that I I think is much better And so yeah, we are getting um Yeah, that's funny, uh joy says Um, I I am kind of talking gad saddish. I really am because gad sad like me Has a very similar experience and I don't want to see christians in the united states to go through what? Minority religions in muslim states do and that's where we're headed if we're not paying attention I think that the difficult questions are What With I know I get a I get some pushback with this recession of of of modernity What does What does state religion look like in a post secular world Because a lot of what you're pushing against jacob Islam, you know basically the iranian revolution Was ahead of their time Compared to what's happening with christianity in america, and that's where I can see your point Did you know that michelle foucault was a big proponent of the islamic revolution in iran? And as were the french intellectuals and the post modernists That's interesting it's and and The fact is the woke in the united states have been in bed with islamism Which I have to say to be fair to the muslims islamism is not islam It really is not And what we are seeing with islamism growing in muslim countries Is is actually the exportation of Post-modernist ideas into islam So don't think that islam is is some sort of Outside thing that is just creeping in without being affected by western culture. It is And this is part of what makes me so anti-woke Okay. All right Well, there's a reason jacob's a monster and and I think a good one Um because he uh has has a lot of influence and speaks very strongly. I i dale I don't know if we've heard. I don't know if you had something in particular you wanted to bring into the conversation No, not particularly it's just I was having a little bit of free time so I jumped in okay good michael Are andrew andrew you come into these things and you seldom say too much Which Talking That ain't gonna happen Okay, especially you're used to you're used to jacob's dreams. So uh, that never happens in jacob's dreams. Well sometimes I'm sick of the dog. Do you want to throw anything in here andrew a super random question What happened to the puppies man? Like those are the highlights of your stream then My puppy is in prison So there is a um part of the puppy raising program that I participate in uh, they have prisoners in stockton who raised the puppies for so So she's in the prison for a month and um And then she um, and then we'll get her back. So Which is good because we don't have any other puppies in the house and this dog gets very excited around other dogs So having a little bit more opportunity to live with some other dogs and some other people Uh will be helpful for her training, but we will get her back. So This is what we do to the rubber chicken Yeah See I can't put kermit and some of the muppets up there because once these really smart sony cameras recognize a face Then i'll be blurry. So um Michael what what do you have to say? Uh, well I gotta go back and listen to most things. I just jumped in right when ash um, he asked his question or you know talking about uh You know, this is the stuff that i'm thinking about all the time, uh, just as far as What's going on with evangelicalism and you know the changing landscape of all this stuff so um You know, I think it's It's it's it's interesting how It is important for us to think of these kind of society societal levels about these things but then on the other hand like You know with my project I i'm uh My my trade school project i'm like officially, uh Prototyping it or whatever. So I got a kid who's coming with me two days a week, you know And so it's like that's one person that I have to You know focus on the issues going on in his life and and and and it's you know, and it's been helpful for me too to kind of just you know hear the the troubles that um Young people are struggling with and and figuring out how to proceed into the future and I think I guess it took me a while to kind of figure out but like the the with the symbolic thing of like pageau Um his whole like worldview and actually I really like james jordan better if anybody's listened to his um stuff, but It's really good at Helping to Retranslate these truths into whatever new context people are um encountering and so um You know, I so I just you know, I think we can we can never stay on the mountain we always have to Recalibrate and look at what's going on and figure out what's you know, what's working and what's not working and But we but with the mind of like what is what is the permanent goals and it should be more than just You know getting people in the seats. It should be for their long-term success and benefit so Okay I I just got the message that someone is trying to enter the studio and we already have 10 people so uh I'll leave because I gotta go listen to the beginning of the stream. So Okay, good to see you all. All right, michael pat you had a question that you dropped in the chat You want to you want to raise it? Yeah, do you know too many crc pastors who led the band? At the same time no as being ministers. Okay. No, I know of at least one up in up in canada But I was curious who's coming. I know a few um Um, what can I think of his name? Uh, he was he was the music director at granite springs and now he's pastoring in chicago He's a great musician They're they're they're all they're all there are usually a few Um, and churches love it if they can kind of get two for one So in terms of getting a job after seminary having musical skills Yeah, that'll that'll give you a leg up but my primary concern like then it just becomes the The one guy show, you know, like that's that's the Yeah, this steep slope You know and to get into to get into ash's um question about education and theology Churches there there have been like the the guy who had this this church before me He was known for spending 40 hours a week on his sermons Wow And and he he actually died young he had cancer He died young not in this church, but in the church he left this church after three years to a bigger pulpit Because he had such beautifully well crafted sermons and in fact Uh when he died they put together a book of his sermons. I've never read it. I I guess they were great sermons but The the question then is okay how The church didn't grow the church well the church hasn't grown and the church under me The church has been through some weird stuff because i'm weird but um so it's it really gets into the the question of what a church is is a church a theological storehouse that dispenses nuggets to the world is To how does how does theology? How do theology and how does theology actually form? so I mean It was very interesting going when I visited willow creek not will creek but uh saddleback in the late 90s Uh, andrew you should mute if you're gonna walk around because you're kind of there you go. Um Rick warren saying that basically, you know his church plant was doing okay But when he brought in his worship leader, that's when the thing exploded which I think gets back to sam's observation that in many protestant churches, especially mega churches Music is the psychotechnology that is carrying a lot of transformation And if you listen to preaching in a lot of mega churches, this this points to ash your point Um, I mean some mega church preaching can be a mile wide and an inch deep and I So one of the most successful christian reform churches that was a church plant in the seeker days I got to be careful with names, but um, I talked the pastor left the church He was tremendously successful the church under him grew nfl players were going to it It had great music all of this stuff in an area of this that the crc Would not would likely not have grown in and I the pastor stepped down and went away And so then I looked him up because I wanted to talk to him about it And he basically said, you know I was I was heralded as um, you know some kind of Star and my church was a mile wide and an inch deep and I couldn't take it anymore So I had to get out of the ministry and he did he got out of the ministry Yeah, I think this stuff is super coming. I wanted to add something Uh So I was gonna say one of the ways that churches I think are dealing the church that i'm in right now and like maybe North point main out of atlanta so they started franchising, you know kind of their churches And so this is how they're dealing with the shortage of pastors is they're just bringing in people who are good at speaking Um, and then they have kind of the sermons are pre-packaged and like they'll they'll fill in their parts and kind of make it their own But maybe this is a secret. I don't know if this is a secret that people just don't know I didn't know like so when people told me this is how it works now It's like so that way you make sure that theologically you're in line because there is kind of like a main like overarching I don't know authority over the messaging And they even have like the the images the themes all that stuff is all Pre-packaged and so it kind of takes that load off of the churches and helps them I guess Spread more. I really don't know but just so you know, like that is happening. I don't know if y'all know that so just a Comment to build off of what you were saying paul. I i'm not I don't I don't think i'm talking about the high level of education of generations past pastors in Sort of like a credentialed way of what what's your job is to disseminate information? I think i'm talking about it the way jordan peterson talks about the importance of young people to go to college It's because what it does is it shows employers that you're able to stick to something you're able to commit You're able to come on time leave on, you know, and so on so so it has to do with The centered set the idea that that you have committed to something you've committed to a denomination you've committed to a Set of traditions a tradition and you are going to stay faithful to that tradition and I think Contrast that with the recent study that came out in 2022 I think you talked about this the the the american world view inventory Where the I think it was the arizona christian university cultural research center They discovered they did this survey and they discovered that 37 percent of Uh slightly more than a third 37 percent Possess a biblical world view The majority 62 hold a hybrid world view known as syncretism and this is referring to pastors evangelical pastors in america so You know emily's comment really concerns me because if if it's just about your ability to present Uh, that seems I mean Uh, it seems really terrifying because the the pastoring isn't just give a message The pastoring is talking with people one on one afterwards And what are you telling them if you're not giving them biblical world view and what and if you're giving them pop psychology as opposed to Finding things that you read in the bible meshing with the advice that's given. Yeah, frankly another version another version of that is uh, like satellite churches Uh streaming the same sermon across all their locations and then they have like a local pastor He was not necessarily talking but he's doing all those other things I went to a church like that for two years and I I could not understand it for two years. I'm sitting there Why am I here watching a video? I don't get this And yet here we are Yeah, but it's sunday morning it's a big difference well My question paul, I think you're a little bit incorrect because we're actually interacting More than people do to to that video screen right, so that interaction I mean like What would a culture look like if in order for a culture to be maintained you had to pay someone to maintain the culture? like that's part of The issue that's going on and why I think house church is becoming Uh, it's rising What people trying to educate themselves? It's unstable if our education is based on institutions That are just based on jobs financial margins How do we get What I want to make a comment to everybody who's here We're we're going to go into what I call fishbowl mode Which is what we did in in germany in the breakwater thing. We're up. We've got more people who want to come in So if you're mostly here to listen, you should probably listen online But if we got points you want to make stay in the pool So that way we can make room for for for people to get in and get out I want to I want to recognize david salverde. So i'm not the only christian reform minister um In david and I had a randos chat on the same day And then david when I was looking into calvin I church shopped y'all's church I mean like virtual like poking my head in and I you're leading worship there at the same time aren't you? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so that's why I came in. That was like you asked the question about uh, Yeah preaching and worship leading and uh, yeah, I basically do that every week. Yeah Yeah, my my in-laws live up in your area so I was I was hoping to connect with you one of these days Oh, yeah, do it Great. What do what do you think of so we got another worship leader here who is now a nurse? So what do you think david I mean go ahead Um about uh, sorry about what I i'm coming in a little late. I I haven't heard everything Well, there's the tension between the worship the There's a real tension in protestant churches sam earlier was talking about the fact that Uh, I mean music and I would I would argue that in many protestant churches. You've got two very competing Psychotechnologies you've got preaching which of course is embedded in a tradition and really what education tries to do is Deeply embed people within a tradition make people uh competent within a tradition and hopefully maintain the tradition That's really what education wants to do. But then you've got this other competing thing in protestant churches, which is music and part of what happened in the christian form church during the worship wars in the 80s and 90s is that People would get upset with their church either because they did Uh go to drums and guitars or they didn't go to drums and guitars And so then they would leave the church and they would often go to churches that in terms of the theological tradition We're not anywhere near The christian reform church and they're they're angry at the christian reform church for either changing or not changing And then they would go to a baptist church and the christian foreign ministers would look and say Huh? Well, some of them were angry but but a better position would be to stop and look and say Well, that's interesting. So what really are the people here for I would I would say a few things one back to emily's comment about uh north points model for uh You know, the cumberland presbyterian church was started because they wanted to evangelize the west And and the mainline presbyterian church wanted to make sure everyone went to princeton before They went and evangelized the west so I don't see what north point's doing as quite the same thing because I think that the comments that emily was making when she was 12 about maintaining Like about church buildings plays into north points model as well So which I mean that could have been the case for the presbyterian, you know institution a hundred years ago as well, but I think that's is evangelism the mission blah blah blah the other the other side of the coin is about It's another psychotechnology with the language That Theologically from the top down living in the low church for most of my life You have to think about what it does to people if you actually believe that there's a sacrament And you also have to think about what do you believe that is preaching a sacrament and actually some of Calvin's early teachings when he talks about the logos. He actually makes that argument, but you have to The people people's like culture top-down culture defines everything you don't even know it's going on in your brain but like If you believe that That you're you're eat like okay. There's levels of it Do you believe that you're eating the body and blood of Christ? Do you believe that there's something spiritual and mysterious happening? Do you believe this do you believe this is it just Symbol, okay. We have to put our attention towards the sacred somewhere and so You know what's been the most powerful emotive thing in american pop culture in the last hundred years has been rock music You know culturally and I think that What's been lost in that? Attempt to find the sacred was to run after the transcendent, but those two things are separate and If you believe that you're eating the body and blood of Christ Transcendent but those two things are separate and If you're looking for the transcendent you can find it in rock music But you aren't going to find something sacred and I think that that's the anemia that Generate like that. I feel from my culture of growing up is an anemia for what is sacred And I think that's the push towards orthodoxy and in mainline falsism and all that stuff versus People who still find a lot of transcendence in rock music which my myself am included in that as well So there's a tension there is the transcendent versus sacred and that's all I want to say. I gotta get back to work. Thanks All right. Thanks christian I'd like to make kind of another point there. Um, you're A little earlier we were talking about there being a division between On one hand preaching and on the other hand music, but I think you have something else that runs through both of those Where you've got kind of participation versus Um spectacle is not quite the right word. It's a little too divisive a term but um You know, I felt like So I come from the nephritis church And the church I went to as a kid. I Loved the way they did the music. Um, it was mostly old hymns, which I quite liked I always hated it when they changed any of the words or anything um to make them More pc or they wouldn't take out they'd take out like the verse that had all the blood and guts in it, which Were always the ones I thought were cool um But you know um And then they did do a fair amount of having a band usually playing. Um I suppose looking back it would be pretty uh Influenced by like the black church um the type of music they did there but there's that big difference between I feel like a lot of those songs that were written for the whole congregation to sing And then where it's like this is something that a good vocalist could really knock out of the park but in terms of everybody in the congregation sitting in the pews there's like You're not part of it in the same way and I feel like i've only been to one a couple times I went to kind of a mega church that my uh One set of grandparents would go to that my family, uh jokingly referred to as latte lutheran because they had a coffee shop um but It was very much you know stadium seating and The whole worship leaders thing which is totally foreign to my experience But for it was far more, you know something you were watching rather than Something I felt like you were you were participating in his audience more than you were participating as a participant and um You know, I think that probably cuts Into the preaching too in some ways. I mean that canned Uh screen of somebody else preaching that's not even there coming in seems real strange. Anyway, that was the only thing I kind of noticed that uh I think there's a lot of tension there in the music uh for my and I feel like My concern with the real big sound stuff is the congregation's becoming more of an audience less of a congregation So to add to samuels To add to what samuels was saying and to what dale said earlier I I go to I have a good friend who's a pastor at an opc church and I attend there sometimes and The thing they do there they have an organ and they rely on this one hymnal book and the thing they do in sunday school is they teach their congregation how to Sing the song how to actually Do the hymn. It's not very And it takes it takes a group that is willing to go through the slow process of learning it so that they can Do it well on a sunday You never see that in you know, you know Standard baptist kind of evangelical the music is meant to be like I can jump in and start singing it right away type of thing so you don't get to that the dale's experience of this deafening sound by just You know Just random people showing up and picking up the book and singing their hearts out you you develop that as a community That's that's a very important point Yeah, and I suppose that's where having like a choir to um That's singing along with everybody else Kind of at least gives you some of that momentum That people that don't know as much what they're doing can oh I can kind of follow them That's right. Um steep slope as a Yeah, so paul talks about the steep slope and and and the uh, the shallow gentle incline gentle incline You know, it's fascinating is that in in some respects they have a very shallow slope because they're making it very easy for people To participate in the evangelical churches, but they're very steep when it comes to their pre-suppositional You know, you have to adhere to these to these truths Uh, then the vice versa on on you know, some of the Let's say mainline churches might be more Shallow slope, but they're very steep when it comes to the the the production that happens within church Charlie brown we gotta get charlie brown in this um, i've been pumping your video not enough people are watching your channel You're doing good work there. I don't know where you want to come into this conversation or another No, I can add something to that conversation actually because i'd like to add maybe the german perspective or the european view on it and you had a lot of um Inside on that already when you were in europe and you always said you you can't Quite get why there's so little christianity in europe left Except for the architecture and so I have a very low bar of expectation when we look at church And whether it's preaching or it's music I mean in a beautiful, uh old Cathedral sometimes only 30 to 50 people sing the old hymns Which can be beautiful, but at times you don't hear it because there's just too few people in the whole building And on the other hand if you look at the small congregations we have of evangelical churches They also have like 30 to maybe 70 people there At best you have to drive for one and a half hours to find a church that has more than 200 300 church Goers every sunday I don't have one single friend A close friend or maybe even not so close friend that goes to church once a week At best some of the family members go to church every two or three months So we have very low expectations about what to expect both from the church and from the church going people And in that sense It's amazing to look at all the discussions that are taking place in this little corner and on the b.o.m Because there's so much diversity in the u.s spectrum on not just protestantism, but also catholic Church-going people and the ortho bros, which is even a smaller uh Thing in europe. It's it's very small in the u.s already but in germany, it's like Almost inexistent, but we have several very prominent members of the german estuary that are orthodox or orthodox cleaning So i'm always wondering how can we actually transport what we learn and what we listen to in this little corner to The very specific european setting that is totally secular Where it's already weird when you say you're a christian And you belong to the very weird christians if you go to church every sunday And that makes it pretty difficult to actually find the the through line In all of these discussions that i'm listening to And then importing them or exporting them rather to the real life. And what do I make of it? It's it's not as if there are so many church adjacent people in around yes, at least it seems like that and that makes it very Fruitful to to be part of this little corner and at the same time pretty frustrating because we would we would be in dire need Of so many of you soldiers out there Getting over here to germany and helping us out solving the meaning crisis and as I said, it's a very low bow that we're working from already One of the things in the buddha and church that I found different than the crc and similar is that the crc is very much Education orientated that we always bring up private schools associated with the christian school in the lutheran church I'm a here member of they attach the church right the school right to the church Well, i'm 63, but I happen to have a 12 10 and eight-year-old children Um, all my kids are attending the lutheran school, but they're learning all the lutheran songs right in chapel every morning So it became surprising at 10 years old suddenly. They're singing the hymns as loud as I am in church It's one of the things that continued it the other thing you guys seem to be talking about only the singing versus the preaching of the word And there's a lot more to I experience in my Church in the lutheran stuff versus the crc, which is the liturgy stuff. For instance, we have communion Every sunday except for the when there's five sundays in a month Um the the form of worship is much more Strict we do the exact same things. We always did in the crc, but here it's implemented right into their hymnal in five different Worship services type stuff we go through the all the exact same things we did in the crc But it's much more formalized much more ritualized Than just just the singing and just the preaching was in the crc And dale how do you like a good question, how do you like that? The I like I like much more than I did in the crc Um it It just it exorbs you a little bit more somehow you sort of know what I expect everybody's sort of there The communion every every week. I like much more. It's just really makes you feel a part of everybody else at the same time Yeah, that's interesting because i'm gonna do a i've i've been in motivated the preacher in me has come out paul but I just have this pvk monologue sort of thing that I want to do I want to do a grill country and i'm gonna invite my friend nick freerillion because I want to have this conversation because really the Really? What is what are we going to do with the church in america? Like what is it because we see these demographics we see the collapses we have seen all these other different sorts of movements. I Uh, and I want to share some of my bona fides for like the past 10 years I've got some writings and I was doing these devotional guides because what I was trying to call people was into was a daily practice Like to get into this daily practice of prayer and some of these other sorts of things I was doing in a very evangelical context and You know for me Uh, the interesting thing is here's what I think estuary is going to be really good for Um, there are a lot of you could you just say Um, there are a lot of you could use an example in 12 step groups or a if it was explicitly christian People wouldn't go to it because they have issues with that right? And so you need to have them to come into that place in that space And I think as we're moving into this culture that a lot of people want to have these conversations Um, they're they're seeking something they're seeking god. They're seeking something and Estuary is the place that is when more and more people identify as nuns when more and more people want to have these conversations When they're seeking these things out estuary if they build this out something like this is going to capture a lot of the people But in the same way estuary is not church. So what will happen to people? It's the same thing that happens to people in a a What will happen is is if you become a christian let's just say christian if you become a christian, you know what you do Then you go to church And so when paul says go to church when when when Um peggio says go to church, you know that that's what will happen And I think one of the things I want to explore is is you know, this has been fascinating Of it's been listening to all this is I I think I have an inkling having been out trying to plant house church and been in all the different sorts of movements and everything else um I think I i'm gonna propose Something that I think that probably would happen and it's more around that liturgical route dale And the question I have is is like right now we're building the church for the crowd But the jesus like paul mentioned this earlier. I mean he was suspicious of the crowd Should should we build a church for the crowd or build a church for the faithful? Yeah, and the faithful well, I mean the history is not the church as you said, right? I can just tell you my experience with the the mega church type stuff I just a couple times I think it's called gateway here in dallas is a very large church And just been went to it with a friend a couple times I mean I had a turned off revulsion to it. I don't know exactly why but it just felt like I was going to a Concert not a worship services. I was going to a show Instead of being part of something is what but still you have what you can say is at least from my perspective across the ocean is If you judge them by their fruits It's astonishing how much christianity is still left in the u.s. Even though There is a meaning crisis and their secularization but So so in a sense even if it's a concert taking place at least it's a concert with christian songs And people are going there and talking not just about the music But they are being involved in something that is more than just themselves So in a sense they are opening themselves already up to something that is above them And so that's what I meant with the loba with the loba I mean, I don't know. I have so little expectations that I would be happy if if that would at least be taking place Regularly in a certain size in an area that I can actually drive to with my family without taking two hours or three hours That would be wonderful And it's not happening So in a sense, I can understand that it's frustrating in the u.s. To see well, I don't think this is church anymore I think this is just show But that's not what i'm saying by the way, i'm just describing How it you know, you gotta understand I come out of a background where I was going to church twice Twice or every sunday since I was okay, right? Yeah So how how I feel about it somebody else coming from the outside feels about it are going to be night and day different exposures Yeah, yeah And I I think lance and you both said I mean, i'm personally i'm decidedly christian i'm kind of becoming catholic I'm i'm more than halfway there. I've been going to mass almost every sunday or almost every week For over a year now been participating for the second time in exodus 90 program And have realized for myself that I found truth in the sacrament of the eucharist And and the utmost reality in the sacrament of the eucharist and You can think that's propositional to me. It was a totally participatory aspect that since i've been participating in it, I Every time I partake of it. I have to cry because it's like a healing Procedure that is taking place in me through the eucharist that i'm participating in and I can't explain it because I come from An evangelical background that has absolutely no understanding of of this kind of yeah And so I think there's there's more truth to to uh liturgy and to sacrament definitely But as lance said we have this kind of church. It's adjacent esuary and I would like to take the esuary also to germany and say We open it up to everyone that's in a meaning crisis independent of their faith independent of sacraments independence of whether they go to church or not Actually, I want to treat those people that are decidedly atheist As those that have to be taken care of the most Because they're being commissioning the esuary Are you? Yeah, i'm wondering And I don't know I don't know to what extent this is part of the problem that we're all talking about Is that we are all people in transition? Like I everyone I know who is a real practicing catholic Wasn't raised catholic I know a lot of anglicans who are very very big on the anglican church or I guess episcopalians for paul And none of them practice none of them were raised Yeah, I was talking my I was talking to my mom last night and she was sharing with me memories of her uh Mother walking her through Church and and seeing someone uh receiving in the wrong way and she thought in her in her mind that that person was going to hell Is that she's just allergic to all this stuff like if I tried to go anywhere near that it would be no go Well, and i'm i'm wondering for the group what it looks like Because we're all transitionary characters. We're not people Who matured in a tradition? Like even even for me like I converted 20 years ago And that's half my life ago But that's still like I don't have the experience of growing up in a tradition it deafening and meaning something to me I had to convert in order like even to move from catholicism To whatever it is that I am now Um, and like I even think that's part of um Paul's interest in those people who want to just are talking about birth rates and everything Like the biggest problem is how do you repeat culture? How do you well? I mean that is what culture is culture is like culture and yogurt right something that grows And continues and it feels like a lot of the culture is dead and requires Non-original members to know what's good about it Looks like how do we get ourselves to like the thing that we're actually in? Well, I I think um, thank you david, uh, I and let's go back to lance point I think a lot of like humility about the corner I think that a lot of like thing people think something big's gonna happen. No, you're going to do something small That's what's gonna happen You do oh and then the secret church of the corner comes down and saves every it's like if you can't go to church Go to estuary if there's no estuary you start the estuary like guys There's no like we are the hands and feet of christ like I I don't know what else like Like anytime people like the big thing's coming there's gonna be a you know 200 foot tall jordan peterson who crushes all our enemies and you know, like he's gonna be godzilla. It's like guys. It's us If you i'm literally at a church not a lot of creative people. I'm a little more on the creative side I'm literally thinking with I have one friend who likes movies and we're gonna show them Movies that aren't fully christian but have christian themes and i'm like, can I start to get people thinking about symbolism? That's it. The homework is do you know what a symbol is? It's not like the peugeotian symbol is in in transcendence with the non-inferior. I'm just like Let's just talk what a symbol is It's like when they when the disciples meet christ on the road on the road after the crucifixion They don't know him by sight They know him because of the way that he taught them and they say that was christ And it's like if we can understand that verse if we can understand how do we see christ in all things? It's like you don't need to cover everything in scripture or bible or so my point Sorry not to go on a ramble but like it's like yeah go to estuary if there's no estuary start one go to church Start your little small group at church where you talk about bible study or watch movies or guys like we're The whole point of us being aware in my opinion the whole point of us being this level of aware and thinky talky Is that we can revivify the culture and play a role not so that we can turn other people into thinky talky people But we can like get in there and be the hands and feet and wash the feet of the others In a way that we're we have access to So, you know it's and this is how you create an awesome ramble for the clip reapers Great stuff allen. No. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Charlie I think what concerns me about the transitionary kind of space and this talk of transitionary and i'm all for exploring new ideas and making things work, uh, but i'm and you You have to think about a spouse and you have to think about how do you live out your christian life with your spouse? And you have to think about children in the future and raising them and and what Tradition are you going to raise them in and you can't you can't take a five-year-old child and say, okay We're catholic for a couple of years and now we're orthodox and now we're evangelical now We're reformed. You just you can't take them through those transitions. It's too much. So You have to be very careful with picking a tradition and and Sticking with a tradition even when it's not maybe serving you as much anymore that this is the The aspect of sacrifice as well that that you know when we try to go towards yeah wonderful When we tried to go towards, you know seeking for for truth And and saying well this doesn't work for me. I want to change Well, yeah, at what point do you you know, do you have to be willing to go through the suffering of of Maintaining relationships with that community with the with the body of believers through that Time of maybe it's it's just not up to par. It's not up to my taste anymore. It was fine for me for a while It's not an you know You you can't have traditions that maintain for generations if you are going to just Walk away from it if it doesn't serve you Yeah, but that's Protestant. That's the Protestant ethic though. I mean to be really honest I mean, that's that's what Protestantism is. I mean you think about all the schisms and the divisions and Different sort of denominations all that stuff I mean that's the that's the spirit of kind of what we have and I know I agree At the same time like i'm sure a lot of people have been through here A lot of people have had their church collapse on them even if they're in non-denominational situation Like there's a falling out with the lead pastor and then you had all your kids there and then all of a sudden that church Falls apart. I mean there's a lot of And and when you don't have a denomination that's going to keep like paul's corner of sacramento open, which is like for example That's the one thing that's really scary about this vocational and the main lines and everything going away is there was just some stability in you know paul could put himself on a corner and You know there hey if there was discipline and they paul would have had an affair with an elder You know what they would have put another crc pastor in there, you know something like that stuff happens you know what i'm talking about, but but see the That place in that space just has some stability and you know, we've talked about that and that's That's kind of going that's kind of going away and the interesting thing which is And this is the thing i've been wrestling with is I see a lot of my A lot of my best friends that are still doing house church context and everything else someone mentioned earlier There's this drawback to sacramentality in the eucharist even someone like francis chan who was he's my he's my spirit pastor Evangelical pastor. I love francis. I watched everything he's ever done. He started opening up dialogues with Uh, you know looking at early church fathers and thinking about wait a minute I think we've lost something in the sacrament of the eucharist and these sorts of things but But it would appear what paul would realize is The only thing that seems to draw people right now is you need to have a rock star preacher Who quite frankly it's better if he's really a ted x sort of a guy with a coffee shop and an amazing Rock band and you're going to put people in the seats, but the question i've always been struggling with throughout And i'm gonna give my i'm i have a whole thing on this because i'm thinking about i've been 10 years trying to do it Is that that's not really producing disciples like it's not producing practices in people That takes them to that next level. That was the struggle. I was was having my whole time and that's what we're Faced with right now and I I still think like I make my speech that this is an online space and it is and we're online people But what paul is what paul's I i'm guessing what paul is i've been watching it but He knows where what's going to happen to the church because we have this old demographic. They're going to die. There's no that Not having any babies to support A society you're seeing that at the main line and as soon as these people die off those churches aren't going to happen And then if we can increasingly post-christian culture as we're moving towards more nuns and everything else The space where people can come into estuary And they're seeking god but they're coming into estuary and they don't know what they're doing yet You're going to meet people and have conversations and then eventually they'll find whatever church is going on But this this space and it's going to take a while to build this it's hard to plant and build things It's just really hard But this estuary 15 years down the road is going to provide a place where people who are having these questions and all these concerns Are going to be able to come and seek god It's there's a I mean one of the things that we've i've seen in this conversation, which has been been very interesting is that people are noting that In many ways you need a whole bunch of things to actually have a functioning church a functioning christian culture These things have to be maintained. They also you still have the chaos and order thing that if the if it gets too stale um, I mean there's all of this going on and so What we're sort of doing as a body because remember the church is the body of christ that has many members And the eye does not say to the nose you know All of this we're processing all of this in time and part of what you know, there's been so much disruption in terms of culture and What technology has done in globalization? That the church is continuing to sort of figure its way through Do we need? Educated clergy. Yes Are all educated clergy educated in the same way? Well, probably not do we need fellowship? Yes. Do we need Worship that that feels transcendent. Yes. Do we need? Eucharist. Yes. I mean we need all of these things and then what you begin to see is that Christ works through all of this stuff Uh hank who is you know, one of our favorite trolls in this corner sam's friend um He made the comment when in in one of the videos, I think it was my video It's not published on the full channel yet with um You know god God is a as a parent god believes in rough and tumble play With his children And I thought that's really good Because it's very clear You can't look at the first three centuries of the church and church history and say God does not believe in rough and tumble play to grow up his church And this is this is what we're seeing and part of the difficulty is is that With all of these transitions really important and beautiful things are lost There's always loss going on Um, and and in almost any place, you know ash my conversation with you was really moving Because on one hand you could see And and I I really like what david said that so many of us in this corner are in transition And so what often happens is that someone grows up in one area of the church? And it just feels stale it feels like old wineskin and then they go into another area of the church and it's like They come alive I mean, it's so funny because a lot of people are heading to orthodoxy But I bump into a bunch of people who grew up in orthodoxy found it scale and then are going to Maybe a a preaching based tradition or maybe a worship based tradition and But we're also living a long time which means that you know, my friend warren mills in australia, he grew up in a Dispensational tradition and then was in a charismatic tradition And now is in a liturgical orthodox tradition And all along the way in that sense sort of in a serial form Christ has been building into him the fullness of his body and part of what I want part of why I like the estuary format and This little corner whatever it is. We're doing here is that We're actually beginning to hear from people at different points and so, you know t grogan has been in the comment section and You know a lot of what t grogan is is either challenging or pushing back on is sort of christian Anthropology as doctrinal container what a christian is is kind of like a bucket full of doctrinal propositions And that's very strong in the christian reform tradition. It's very strong in the reform tradition. We really value orthodoxy and and I I was listening to Um To rosaria butterfield and she said My husband is a minister in a tradition where we have to vow that we would we would die for our doctrinal statements and I thought Wow You know in one hand you can appreciate the the conviction on the other hand You're not a bucket of propositions And you know, i've made the point before that if you're a minister in a church who believes all the propositions But is sleeping with the organist you're out You're not a bucket of propositions and um, and so Propositions are important doctrine is important practice is important morality is important. All of these things are important But we're monofocal creatures and so we're always sort of task switching So then as the body of christ we're doing all of this task switching around us And you know to come back and i'm going to end this thread in a couple of minutes To come back to where this this this stream started Which was sam and his comment to emily, which i'm gonna i'm gonna put back up on the screen here um, if I if I can uh If I can let's say figure out how to do that. Um This this comment to this okay, here we go Emily's story seems to share a pattern of a lot of people in this little corner People just trying to make church work and not only make church work make culture work and cultural inheritance work That's really what malcolm and simone bring to this is that americans it's so funny that putin sits there and lectures um Tucker carlson on on history and I thought yeah, there's a difference between europe and america America americans are like what's happening now and Most of the old world is like if you really understand me, let me talk to you about a thousand years of history Oh americans are like, I don't have time for you get lost. What's on tv? um People are trying to make church work But they are curious and ask questions and expect even demand answers from leadership that are under equipped that sort of gets to ash's comment about equipping leaders They're under equipped to answer and so they throw you under the bus to save their own face while pretending They are defending the institution. Meanwhile taking advantage of your loyalty the institution of whole obviously There's a lot of sam as we talked about sam's story in that with respect to this so you have competency in terms of Let's say your bucket of propositions, but you also have competency in terms of what is a human being? because Inside that bucket of propositions there needs to be one really big rock at the bottom Where people came to jesus and said How can you summarize the law? This is right at the beginning of the heideberg catechism Love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength and love your neighbor as yourself Upon these two depend all of the law So if you have your bucket of propositions, but you're not loving people You can have the propositions you want you're not living them so now you guys got me preaching sorry about that um The failure of low openness high conscientious leaders who feel like they live in threatening times and need tightening boundaries Can't articulate why and the high openness high sincerity folks who get caught in the gears as the machine tightens So we're we're all working on this tension here where we see A tradition must be preserved And people must be loved And so really in this disruptive moment. We're asking the question How can traditions be applied to people in loving ways? That's really hard because tradition is about sacrifice We're going to sacrifice these things in my life. We're going to sacrifice these relationships For the sake of a tradition continuity through time But jesus gives us this command love the lord your god in that sense It's sort of like a tradition because it goes this way And love your neighbor as yourself that goes this way. So now we're caught between this and this and What we're working through is okay. Okay. I need to love a tradition But I need to love I need to love That person over there and that person is probably full of hurts and anger and And and so they're they're just they're they just want to set the world on fire because they've been hurt So on one hand you say well, I know you want to set the world on fire But i'm not really going to let you burn down the church But i'm gonna have to figure out how to love you There there's the there's the tension So there's my sermon I just had an exact example of that from my daughter oldest daughter who is currently having um learning about different religions of the world And she comes up to me and asks ask me and it's like papa. How do I know which religion is true? And it's like oh man, you've just asked a huge difficult question And my my approach to it is i'm not beginning to done with her this but it's like In the end, you're gonna have to choose this one for yourself But here's the difference is it and now start looking what i've done in your life and the way I treat you Yeah, and and that is the only way i'm going to be able to show her what it is because I will not be able to intellectually try what my dad did is well, you gotta just believe it because you gotta go do it You know, it's it's like that's not gonna work and my pastor. I just told him about the question. He's like Trying to give me sort of a smart christian answer that well Christianity is the only one where you know god chooses you you're not you choose god And it's like yeah, that's a that's a correct theory theological answer to the question But that's not convincing somebody emotionally on which way they had their life So it's all the things you're talking about and I think It's sort of what got me interested in jordan peterson originally, which was a little bit before I even saw paul is that He started giving a different bridge to answer those questions to get somebody thinking about the stuff Which you can then take into the theological side as the way to go live life And you know, you know grog is grog is out here. Um, you know, and when someone asks a question like this Usually christians are okay. Well, i'm gonna quick answer this question In jesus if you look at at jesus how jesus dealt with people So if you want to know how you should live, why don't you look at jesus? Why don't you read the gospels? I know that's a radical thing i'm saying you'll never hear this in church So are jehovah's witnesses christians I don't why do you want to know this do you want to be a jehovah's witness what What what exactly are you looking for here? because What you really should be asking is well In in many ways the same kind of questions people ask jesus What's what's the way to life the rich young ruler comes to jesus and says how can I inherit eternal life? Well, jesus says well, what did moses say? Oh, i've done all this. Oh My You've mastered moses good for you. All right. Well, let's try this thing then sell everything you have and follow me The the the get the the demoniac on the other side of the sea of gallilee Jesus releases him from a life of incredible torment And he's like all I want to do is follow you jesus. Let me go across the the the sea with you Now you go back to your village and tell them how much god has done with for you And and this now we get in some deep cultural things for us, which is Jesus, would you please give me a program? And the program jesus gives you is follow me you No, no, but I I kind of want to know Do you really? There's the program follow me No, I wanted a different I wanted a program that wasn't I wasn't I wanted a program that wasn't so scary and costly. Oh Well, then go over here there's lots of people selling those kinds of programs But jesus says the only program i'm giving you is me and And then suddenly there's a lot of questions to answer and so we can say well It's so confusing because there's all these different churches out there that are saying they're selling the same program. Okay So yeah, that's a challenge in some way. It's also a benefit So go work that for a while and see where it goes I've been having some joe's witnesses over at my place a few times now. I have I've sort of dodged that the hot button topics are at least just like agree to disagree and and let's Sort of trying to build a relationship estuary style, I guess. Uh, and I gotta say I was My my assumptions of their regard for christ Assumed that it was much lower than it is Even though that they're they don't believe in the steity It was it was quite a bit higher than I would have thought and their devotion to them I mean it in many ways. They sounded just like a lot of baptists. I know aside from some other stuff Well, then then you know Joe jw's believe in jesus. Yeah well and you know when everybody sort of christians and non-christians sort of poured it on poor jordan peterson when You know, do you believe in god? Well, it kind of depends what you mean I never found that to be a bad answer because it's like There's because people are asking that question with A lot of different things that they're looking for from you because that's not really the question They're asking what do you care if jordan peterson believes in god or not really? What do you care? And if you really care, maybe you'll sit down and he'll you know, like do with sam harris Well, well what I kind of think of god, it's way too Complicated for me to want to just say it off So i'm going to read it off my computer here on stage with sam harris And he reads it sam's listening listening, but that doesn't mean like You know asking for parking spaces or praying that your aunt's cancer gets healed So, I don't know you guys got me preaching. You got me all riled up now. Oh look, we're coming full circle Coming full circle so daily reminder i'm not a jehovah's witness, but And I I could give them a much harder time than any of you could that's true Well, and that's one of the things that i'm gonna wrestle with on this live stream i'm gonna do because When I look at jesus, he never makes it easy Like he crowd comes around and boy he loves to give him a hard saying to really see and then he'll go back until the Disciples, what are you talking about the eating of flesh and drinking the blood jesus? He's like, yeah, that's true. And they're like what and a lot of them left and I just I think that's a That's something i've been kicking around like is As as we see how we're going to try and survive. I mean literally in america I hear Charlie brown was talking about what happened in germany And my seminary leader was in the early to mid 2000 when people kind of thought he wasn't insane before he went and started The house church movement. He was saying hey guys the church has collapsed in europe and it's coming to america It was like what and he and he just could see this happening and I you know Paul I could envision a future where people would be far away from me literally Where people wouldn't have a bunch of churches around them in america potentially. Yeah Well, that's coming soon. There's gonna be right. It's sooner than people think it's sooner than people think right and so and what's interesting is that The churches that survive and see this is where some people will listen to ash and think wow He's one of these dogmatists, you know lots of education and stuff and you probably don't have ash right anyway, but Ironically, it's these durable people like look at sam sam is a unitarian. He's a conservative unitarian Still in america That's what's so cool about sam. It's like wow. Look at this. They're they're out there still Um, that's that's kind of interesting I I do want to um, I do want to address The oh you got to mute your uh, yeah, I do want to address the clarity question because Somebody's got a somebody's got a lot my um Jeremy, I think you're you've got a live beat on Thanks um This clarity thing is deeply connected to The other issue of following jesus because it's like jesus. I want you to be clear Could jesus really be clear if jesus was clear you could could you hear him? Here's uh now i'm gonna see you got me in preaching mode. So i'm sorry the i'll just Take you all off the screen and i'll just do it Um when the brilliant ethicist john cavanaugh went to work for three months at the house of the dying in calcutta He was seeking a clear answer to how to best spend the rest of his life On the first morning there he met mother therese. She asked him and what can I do for you? And what can I do for you cavanaugh asked her to pray for him. Oh, that sounds like a good thing What do you want me to pray for she asked? He voiced the request that he had borne thousands of miles from the united states. I pray that I have clarity She said firmly no, I will not do that When asked why she said clarity is the last thing you are clinging to and must be let go of When cavanaugh commented that she always seemed to have clarity Um, he longed for she laughed and said I have never had clarity what I've always had is trust So I will pray that you trust god And I think that is in many ways where All of the panic is That you know If you actually believe in god You learn to trust because he's god I mean and even if you got questions about aspects of this the one thing nobody's disagreeing with with respect to god is All of the things we sold a hold hold in common with god. So, okay, I I got it Yeah, trust in what? Yeah, I know t grogan. It's okay. It's all right You'll I the problem the problem the problem that you have is if you keep hanging out with this bunch stuff will happen and um Yeah, don't worry about it it will anyway i'll shut up now last thoughts for people uh, jeremy you came in you got something You want to say? Up now last thought you got it. You got to mute that other web tab. Yeah, I wanted to build on what lance said um Oh, okay. Sorry No Yeah, no Wow Oops, sorry, okay I can't hear anybody else. I'm just going to talk for a second because i'm on speakers but anyway, I wanted to comment on what lance said about Following christ being so hard and I I have god sons in orthodoxy now young men who? have been baptized who asked me to kind of be their sponsor in the church and Over and over again what I see with them is that they have not They've they've suffered a lot of trauma in their lives. They've suffered a lot of Physical and emotional trauma, but very few of them have suffered as far as like physical suffering, you know, and i'm thinking of like Sports like in you know, like hard practices in sports two days where you know You get up at four in the morning and run for two hours Then you go home and sleep and then you come in at five thirty in the afternoon and it's 100 degrees And then you're going to run sprints and I remember one time I said to my coach coach I think i'm gonna die and he said if you're lucky you'll die, but you're not lucky so you get to run another one And and I just don't see a lot of young people really having an encounter with suffering at a level that prepares them for The the difficulty of facing your own ego When you begin to enter into a relationship with christ And it's kind of like when when peter You know after christ Came back and peter saw him again and said lord leave me i'm a sinful man that that suffering is the true call of christianity and I think that It's the christianity that a lot of people run from once they actually Once you actually see the cross once you actually see your cross that's when That's when it's really hard to face that and and be willing to take it up and and your cross is a lot of times just your ego and and I I was just I just wanted to comment on how I don't think a lot of young people have really been prepared for Learning to be comfortable being uncomfortable And now i'll i'll be quiet mute myself so I can listen All right last thoughts people I gotta land the plane I gotta I gotta I gotta administer stuff I gotta do Yeah, again like I think on that Livestream I talk about I want to i'm really been ruminating a lot about how easy we've Made church in some ways and is that to our benefit? Uh, which is which is I think is somewhat interesting. I've also went back and looked at all the traditions It's amazing the liturgies that even the calvinists were doing all back in the day um that we've kind of even fallen away from and so uh, Yeah, what an interesting time because it's it's I spent 15 years in the middle of this quagmire and you've been all over it here. Something's been happening paul. And so i'm very Uh very excited to be a part of this conversation and um, I think a lot's going to come out of it over the next little bit Yeah, I I along with our discussion, uh, and it goes back to the the pastors and the pastors falling away I I think like the And to me it goes back to jethro and moses of yeah moses can't do everything like you need the pyramid You need the judges below below moses. So Having even in your own life a series of practices and not just being like i'm going to be the gold medalist in being the ultimate christian It's just like yeah like you need yeah for some people you need to the task needs to be as small and easy as possible because Then you can do it with the correct heart posture if you're doing the like I'm fasting for 90 days and because the lord is really going to see me this time. It's like so Just doing simple making the coffee being of listening to ear to someone like the baby Most so many people don't even have the baby level down of like oh I could do this for 90 years 60 years, whatever so just Ordering it like of maybe you weren't called to be the mega pastor You're just called to be a friend to someone and once you get really good at being a friend to someone with the right heart posture Then you can make the coffee then you can Uh clean the chairs then you can and so the ordering and the layering inside and outside of the church I think is really important to not make uh tower, uh, you know fragile towers All right anybody else last thoughts Um churches need to respect the loyalty of their people and not take advantage of it Yeah, that's a that's a great point. It's a very High offering to give an institution your loyalty And it's really crummy when leaders disrespect that Yeah, that's a great point Post chat and the bridges of meaning discord voice chat if anybody wants to come over All right, so I think leaders leaders also should Honor the tradition of their churches instead of trying to play games with them and doing double speak from the pulpit I see I see too much of that as well. Oh, that's very true. Yeah, and you know in in the crc You know john suck I have used I had him on the channel actually he he was He reached about as high as you could in the denomination And when he basically realized he was no longer in alignment with the tradition. He had the integrity to leave it You know Yeah, cs. Louis talks a lot about that Yeah, but the other thing too that I want to say that you know, how does transformation happen we talk about estuary and we talk about Transforming things being transformed transformed and so on. How does transformation happen? And you know My experience and what I what I see the bible say is that transformation happens by the word of god That that is how we are transformed into his image and the holy spirit uses the word of god to help us transform So that's that's all I want to say. All right um, I am going to um Lance you're gonna be on bom in a voice chat So i'm gonna drop the link an invite link to bom into the stream here So if anybody wants to continue this conversation On bom, it's a discord platform. It's a little different but um, there it is and uh, Like I said, I got some things I need to do um, but thank you all for those of you, especially who came on and showed your face and talked and uh Yeah, so it's uh, I hope nobody no nobody banned t grog. Did they I hope not. Um You gotta you gotta I I passed out wrenches pretty uh liberally and every now and then not everybody has the same kind of tolerance for um, for uh Drama that I do. So uh, hopefully nobody banned poor t grog because he's just you know You got it. You got you got to have a little bit of you gotta have a little bit of leeway in the estuary That's what it's for. So all right. Thank you all gonna end the stream again. What's that? Do I get to throw one plug in? It depends what you're gonna plug my game What what game is this fly aces high?
