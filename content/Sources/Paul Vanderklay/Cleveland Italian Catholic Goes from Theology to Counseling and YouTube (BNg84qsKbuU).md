 Hi, this is Paul and today I'm going to do kind of an interesting thing with Joe. Joe has his own channel and so we're going to do sort of a randos conversation first and then we're going to stop the recording. I'm going to put the randos conversation on my channel and then Joe's going to do the kind of work that he's doing for his channel and we'll do that and then maybe after it's been on his channel a little while I'll share it on my channel too. So yeah Joe, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself? Yeah, you know what, so from Cleveland, I've basically been here all my life. I had a little quick stint in Boston for a little bit for school but then came back pretty quickly. So yeah, a Cleveland kid through and through. So I guess you know I was watching a couple of your other videos. It looks like a lot of people start from the beginning, right? Yes, indeed. So yeah, you know, raised Catholic, still am a practicing Roman Catholic and a very, again, kind of like a common thread with a lot of people in this community. You know, grew up in church and you know in the Roman Catholic scene, like other scenes, but in the Roman Catholic community obviously your ethnicity plays a big part into it. So my family came here really in the mid-50s, early 60s from Sicily. So both my parents are Sicilian so I grew up in the ethos of the Italian Catholic American tradition. So everything that you can think of, I mean from Jersey I'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about. Lots of Italian Catholics in the Patterson area, tons of them. In fact, if you know, getting back with the cliches, I mean part of what was fun about watching the Sopranos was all of the North Jersey locations. Yeah, no, some of the stereotypes are very true, very real. But yeah, grew up going to church every Sunday. You know, as a kid never really had any ambivalence towards it. I went to Catholic school my whole life and still stick with a lot of the same, not tons actually, but you know a core group of friends that I met from being a young Catholic kid in Catholic school I still keep to this day. And what the interesting journey has been though is that you know I've stayed Catholic and again as people are watching this, I'm sure their experience too is that you know maybe they have a group of friends who kind of split from them. And that's where we went and it's funny you know I talk a lot of my good friends, I keep my close circle of friends, well one I guess close circle of friends are basically all what they would consider atheist or I mean I would say I tease them all the time. They don't even know what they are. But you know that's how they would consider themselves and they all got pretty active, they all have pretty active jobs in STEM fields. I have some good friends that are engineers, research scientists, things like that. And I always joke, so like I said you know we're in Catholic school together and I always joke and a lot of them you know ended up going to public school after eighth grade. And I always tell them you know it's funny that if I had a conversation with you, right, so the last math class I took was Algebra 2 in like junior year of high school, right. So that's my mathematics knowledge for the most part. The last science class I took was chemistry junior year of high school. I kind of skated by taking like these weird credits in college that counted as science or math classes. So yeah for the most part right my last classes, my last real experience in mathematics and science was junior year of high school. And I think it's so funny sometimes you know if I was to go to a cocktail party with them and their colleagues and I was trying to talk shop about science, about mathematics, they would think who the heck is this idiot, right. Who is this guy who has the comprehension of Algebra 2 in chemistry, basic high school Algebra 2 in chemistry, right. I would be a laughing stock. They would look at me like I'm a fool and right they would laugh me out of the party. But I always rib with them and this is something that you know I constantly think about is you know those same friends right. I was in I was in religion class with them in the eighth grade and that's the last religion class that they got right. So it's funny that you know okay so they can go to a cocktail party with me or they can they can you know when I invite them to to my circles of my Catholic friends or my Catholic audience you know they're trying to talk shop and say oh you know the existence of God can't be real for x y and z or they they're just trying to approach it in such a well in such a crazy abstracted way that you know I look at them and I go guys what the hell are you talking about you're not making any sense and it's so interesting that just because it's in the realm of philosophy or religion they think that they have they think that they they can be part of the conversation. The thing is they can be part of the conversation. I think that's exactly why you know religion is so fascinating and why I think that a lot of people even who claim that they're atheists maybe aren't just atheists because for the very fact that you believe that you have just the same place at the table in this conversation I think it's saying something. I think it says how much you know God really possesses us in a positive way it's inescapable. So I always find that to be funny it's like yeah you know what man I was sitting next to you and Mrs. Noga's eighth grade religion class with you and I know we didn't learn that much okay so I don't know what I don't know if you can really be talking to me the way the way that you're talking to me right now you know but so in college in college I went to I went to this little liberal arts college Hiram College it's in Ohio. James A Garfield was both the president and a student there so that's really our only claim to fame. So I went there and again I've always been more interested in the humanities in literature. I noticed that pretty early on obviously since I said that the last time I took a science and math class was junior year of high school. So I went to school and I went to college and I knew I wanted to pursue something into humanities but like most young people like especially I think like most young men around that time I started to grow I started to grow a little suspicious with my faith and I remember I was thinking about this a couple days ago because I was like oh you know what what anecdotes do I remember having as a child with faith and I remember kind of around 17, 18 being on the fence about religion so even if I had a positive and again I had a very positive upbringing I had I'm blessed and still happy that they're around I'm blessed with a good family good mother and father I don't think religion was ever forced down my throat. Again being an Italian Catholic it's kind of like a way of life it's kind of like your movement it's a movement it's a it's a dance so yeah it was never really I never had a horrible ambivalent relationship right up but again around 17, 18 when I was reading more I got more interested in philosophy you got more interested in psychology and you know I was I've always been of the culture I would say in high school so I wasn't you know I did very typical high school things you know kind of goofing around with my buddies things like that I knew what culturally was going on so I wasn't sheltered in that regard so again yeah like for a lot of reasons I started questioning my faith started questioning Catholicism specifically and you know again obviously this is in light of like the priestly molestation scandal so this was also part of like the zeitgeist and the conversation and I remember just watching this one specific PBS documentary about monotheism and I don't know why but that that PBS documentary on monotheism changed my life for a little bit and I walked away from it and I was like oh well monotheism can't be real and so and I was that easily persuaded so um well there's an interesting relationship between your eighth grade story which I really enjoyed and the PBS special which is that generally speaking these types of documentaries on tv are full of people with lots of academic credentials with respect to religion but they can still be exactly like you just described yeah no I know it's so and and that's something I'll get to that I I learned so I had some interesting footing again always interested in the humanities very speculative now of my uh of my faith and we're talking right now this is I went to I when did I go to college undergrad 2010 to 2014 okay so um I went into college knowing I went into college actually proclaiming that I was an atheist so again in the same line as my eighth grade buddies and however the difference between my eighth grade buddies and me was again still interested in philosophy still interested in the humanities very interested in religion still but like on this like sociological uh framework of it not necessarily this like my heart's you know caught on fire about it or like any interest there in that regard so I remember I took a psychology course in college and I thought that it was very boring and I was like well I don't want to do this and so a lot of intro to psychology classes in college are very boring very boring I was so excited I you know I actually went in like I'm gonna be a psychology major and I went and I took that first psychology class and I was like what the hell is this I was like what are we even talking about they were talking about science and I was like listen I haven't I haven't taken a science class in two years what do I know um but so I started taking some religious studies courses and um I got really interested in I got really interested in that now Hiram although founded right um on you know I you know I'm off top of my head right now I feel so horrible I hope no higher people watch this but I forget exactly who founded um what denomination founded Hiram um but although Christian in in in Genesis what ended up happening like a lot of small liberal arts schools is they kind of threw the the Christian classes to the wayside and oh they're disciples of Christ disciples of Christ right yeah okay yeah and you know it's it's helpful to understand what you know some of these churches that sort of became the main line disciples of Christ is yeah they're one of these older they're one of these Protestant denominations in America that was you know Ohio would be a very important place in terms of their formation so yeah so very interesting keep going yeah so where was I um okay yeah so so although uh you know founded by the disciples of Christ throughout the years you know from 18 from 18 what 40 to 2010 right so you they kind of ditched the whole you know Christian tradition and and most of my 95 percent of my religious studies classes at Hiram um was in Buddhism and so I I was on the floor I was on the avant-garde I knew about Kundalini yoga before anyone and um you know I was like I was 17 18 and I was like I know I know about Kundalini yoga and now it's blowing up in Cleveland it's like every other you know in every hit neighborhood every other storefront it's like a Kundalini yoga place and I'm like man I messed I could have been I could have been having like a pretty lucrative small business right now so I did that and I was you know much to my my father's uh displeasure you know I go home and I'm dead no I think I'm I think I'm Buddhist now just stuff like that a very I mean again you know my personal is the universal this is something very this is this is part of the culturally ethos right um and so I took a lot of Buddhist classes a lot of classes on Hinduism and then my my Bible courses were very again very boring I not nothing inspiring um nothing that I could even actually quite grasp to and so um I I declared my major and I was kind of like floating and you know when it comes to like my personal side spiritually yeah my prayer life was non-existent and I was kind of you know into this weird new agey Buddhist Hindu kind of mix didn't actually even know what the hell I was even saying with that but just kind of like the regurgitation of textbooks or the regurgitation of my and I still actually you know my professor that I had for a lot of these classes I still like I love I really do have like a lot of positive feelings towards um so he never steered me in the wrong way like to some degree but you know I wasn't being like spiritually fed and so I've always been academically I've never well how would I put this um yeah I had so I have some academic talent so like you know the schoolwork wasn't always as hard so I just said well let's pick up another major um and so and I was bouncing around between history and art history and this was around like mid-sophomore early junior year and I remember looking at my the credits that I had and I remember looking at the time that I had left and I said oh well you know what I'm interested in all these things still I could I could pick up another major and I could even pick up a minor so that's what I did so I took I started taking some history courses and some art history courses and it's crazy like the combination of those history courses and art history courses um was the was was the thing that brought me back to my Catholicism my art history classes specifically so some whenever anyone asks me yeah how did you become Catholic and I will say my I will say Hiram College art history that's how I became Catholic again just looking at these beautiful things and and when I say looking at these beautiful things I mean you know you realize a lot so you look at beautiful things and you obviously start to question well what makes a beautiful thing a beautiful thing and then that goes up the scale and then that gets into more ontological questions and then that ultimately like led me back to again that led me back to Christ that led me back to the Catholic Church just being able to witness beauty not only in the expression of fine art but also beauty in the expression of word beauty in the expression of literature another thing that got me deeply into my faith again was taking a medieval literature course and I remember just being absolutely thunderstruck by by Dante and not not just like his inferno or not just like the divine comedy in general but really a lot of his work and Dante really helped bring me back to my Catholicism and has paid a played a significantly influential you know well has been sincerely influential on my life so much so that my wife and I are blessed to have a 15th month old and we named him Dante so yeah yeah so Dante Dante's had a big part in my life so after college okay so yeah like you know senior year and I'm pretty actively Catholic and it's tough like you know it's it's hard it's it's it's hard to find your footing in well again now we're talking like 2013 2014 so it's hard to find your footing it's hard to find people at a small liberal arts college that want nothing to do with religion that even if they don't have like the lexicon for like pretty depressed or pretty nihilistic pretty pretty blackpilled I guess to put it so you know it's an isolating thing so like my my Catholicism was kind of just more inward and I was I was I was kind of going to church it's hard when you don't have a car it's hard when you know your small liberal arts college doesn't really offer too many faith-based groups or anything like that um but after after undergrad I decided that I wanted to pursue this further again I was in pretty fine academic standing so I decided to go on and get a get a master's degree in systematic theology and I did that for two years and I had a really great really great experience doing that where a Cleveland school John Carroll University okay and the claim to fame I'm just going to give you all these claims to fans for these universities the claim to fame for John Carroll is that it's a it's a pretty serious for a division three school it's a pretty serious pipeline to the NFL so Don Schula of the Miami Dolphins went there um uh some other some other some other heavy hitters went there um a lot of people on the New England Patriots in the front office they were John Carroll grads so again that's John Carroll's claim to fame so and John Carroll a good good good institution um Jesuitly sponsored so had some experience with the Jesuits there and took a lot of great courses like I said and again that's when I that really gave me a language gave me a group gave me a community to express my Catholicism in and with and after that uh I decided well I the plan was always to apply uh to PhD programs and I wasn't I did not think I was a serious candidate from my hiring college background and systematic theology when they're going to say oh here's a class on Kundalini Yoga here's a class on Longchampa here's a class you know whatever so the plan was to to go to John Carroll and to uh you know do my do my masters there and then then start applying out to other places um however that didn't happen because well I was dating this girl at the time and this girl now is my wife and um oh those women I know so I was dating this girl at the time this girl now became my wife and and her and I lucky enough we've been dating since about freshman year of college and so she stuck with me she raised Catholic too she is Catholic okay that was one of my pre-reqs for getting married is it I mean I'm being serious like I for me it was very important to marry a Catholic woman and so um yeah my wife is my wife is a is an active Catholic and so I really actually consider I tell her this often I go I think my wife's a better Catholic than I am in many regards but I guess I would rather have that right and I know she would say the same thing for me so maybe that's why our marriage works um but so I wanted to marry her and I so I wanted some money and I was also worried about the prospect of getting into programs my best friend actually from uh from uh undergrad he uh he ended up getting into a PhD program and we would always talk about right after undergrad and we would always talk about the prospects of and he was he was at a good university I'll put it that way and even for him he was like well I don't know if I'm gonna get a job and so that and being away from my family again being you know Italian American it's kind of a no-no to go away from your family so so with the money the job prospects and then just like and I again I'm very close to my family so I didn't want to I didn't want to leave them um there is this job opportunity that showed up and I I took it I interviewed and I took it and that job opportunity was uh teaching Catholic theology at a Catholic private school uh in the in the Cleveland suburbs and so I I was actually a uh theology teacher from oh 2016 until last year and so I taught um in my time at the high school that I was at I I taught grades nine but I mostly taught grades 11 and 12 and so I had a lot of great interactions uh working with with you know 14 through 18 year old uh both both both boys and girls because it's co-ed school but you know particularly given my my personality and my strengths um forged a really serious and meaningful relationships with some of those young guys I was I also had the opportunity to coach soccer there and so really just great great opportunities and getting to know them and getting not only uh getting to know them as people getting to those getting to know them as faith-filled people and really realizing just how insanely difficult it is to be a a young man or a young woman in Christ at this particular time I mean I thought it was more difficult or I thought it was difficult you know when I was in high school 2006 2010 I'm just like yeah I had it real easy you know we didn't even I just simpler I guess so um I've really I really like learned and and got to know and got to counsel the struggles of of how young people who kind of want to be Christians kind of don't want to be Christians unsure about whether or not they should be Christians I got I got to know a lot of just information on that um and you know I think I did a good job there I was well liked um I would say probably at the end of my now that I I I quit last year and I'll get to why in just a second but I quit I probably give myself like a B plus rate and I was probably a B plus teacher um I was more liked than than I probably should have been but um yeah a B plus teacher I would I would say that and I still have a lot of close relationships um you know even like I had a I had a former student who's a Ohio State now gave me a call just Sunday um and I gave out my number I was particularly close with like five guys who graduated last year so with them graduating and and and me leaving the school I felt comfortable keeping in contact with them and you know he called just to get my get my advice on on some things but you know hey should I you know quite frankly it was like hey you know what do you think I here's the deal everyone's telling me I should hook up with as many women as I can I don't know if this is good what do you think and so you know I realized and I realized at the time that I I I hold this very valuable uh well I I'm just like a very valuable asset in their lives and I I don't like I don't want to make it like a power thing because it's not a power thing because you know this is the Holy Spirit flowing through me helping young men um reach really their apex potential and so you know he called me and I gave him my advice and in short no don't um that was I I always gave an end of the year speech when when my seniors went off to college and I gave him like three pieces of advice to be successful in college and one of the pieces I think how I made it was like it was like two and they were academic and the third was social and I just said listen don't have sex in college and I gave it for a spiritual reason but I also gave it a practical reason and I said listen you're going to get to my age I I just turned 30 and so at the time I said you're going to be 28 29 and here's the deal you might be single and here's the deal you might like and really you know you might like them they might be a great person you might find them attractive uh uh another 28 29 27 year old young man or woman and you're gonna you're gonna be into each other and then you're gonna have a conversation that conversation is gonna be well by 28 how many people have you slept with because that's inevitable that's inevitably going to be a conversation and if you're gonna if you're gonna be like the average college kid and I've had sex with eight people I've had sex with seven people for some I've had sex with 15 people now there's a practical element to this because maybe that young man or young woman doesn't want to be with someone who slept with 15 people even if that young man or young woman really likes you right maybe for a practical reason by 28 29 maybe they've matured a little bit and they said I don't want to do that so not only is for and there's a lot of spiritual implications on why you shouldn't do that either but I noticed with the the young men and the young woman in high school this was always hard um you try to give them the practical first before you give them the religious that's that's and some people will disagree but that's that's what's worked with me and that's what had what that's what worked for me in the past so I gave them the practical and then I gave them the spiritual and I was actually delighted that at least people but those kids seem to listen to me so if I you know so that's that's good did you have any of them now you did this you know you did this for a while so did you have any of them come back to you after their four years of high school and say they took your advice or didn't take your advice maybe it'll take another decade before some of that some of that no no so I've actually I've yeah no I've had I've had some emails so I was in the situation where like last year yeah last year was my first year where the first year I taught graduated college yeah so they were out of it so that that was that that that just happened and I yeah I actually did receive maybe two or three emails saying like hey I remember this advice you gave me uh my senior year and my senior year and and I was 24 23 when I first started teaching so again they it's this like weird surreal meta thing where they're just like whoa I'm kind of that age now and they said you know I I really appreciate the advice now two of those three were young women and that that actually warmed my heart I'm curious to see how my young guys are doing but um you know maybe maybe they're just gonna like a lot like a lot of things in life maybe the young men are just gonna take a little bit to catch up to the young women in maturity yeah I hope you manage to keep those relationships as as the years go so because that's that's a really that's a really special thing no it is and I and I want to I want to keep those relationships and it's it's it's very important to me to maintain those and it's hard to maintain those right when it's just through tax but you know I try to maintain um especially the the the students that I was most close with I try to maintain those relationships and yeah I mean at the end of my at the end of my tenure being a high school teacher I think I tried doing a lot of good work that influences what I'm trying to do now um so I have to do a lot of work that influences what I do now um so I actually left um because I was bored teaching so I will just say that so the thing I liked the most about teaching was the counseling aspect and this goes all the way back to the what we were talking about before is uh you know I had I always had an interest in psychology I was just so damn bored by that first psychology course that I I stopped taking them so it was really about year two year three that I knew that I didn't want to teach um but I just needed to make a move and I knew what the move wanted to I knew what the move was going to be and it was going to be in clinical mental health counseling um but that took a second because well a few things I was going to quit my job so I had to sell that to my wife and then uh and then um also you know so there's that and then there's the whole cope thing that just kind of came out in in the middle of that so once my wife and I you know kind of found our footing um financially and I also have another job I oh and I also actually do work um and I was working doing this part-time but now I'm full-time I'm the director of religious education at a Catholic church in in Cleveland um so but again still I mean and as you know I'm sure you know I don't care if it's what's the nomination the church isn't paying insane bucks so there's still a financial aspect of it right yeah exactly so once we figured out the financial piece um moving forward with that um I yeah I decided I was going to pursue a career in mental health counseling and so that's where I'm at now um so I'm currently in school um to be a clinician and that will end um I'll be able to practice next uh next next May that's when I will technically be able to practice so I've been you know busy with school um busy with with work at the church busy with having a wife busy with having a having a little boy um and so I really want to tailor my work well again being a high school teacher really influenced who and what I want to tailor my work around and um I do want to work a lot with men's issues I want to I want to work a lot and again it's not it doesn't just have to be men but men's issues whether that's divorce whether that's uh pornography addiction whether that's self-esteem whether that's uh anger management really the whole slew of of of what you can think of as a men's issue that's what I really want to focus on um you know I'm interested um with working with veterans so complex PTSD things like that um and yeah that's that's where I'm really focused at right now in my life is trying to find my footing in in this field and I'm trying to make a bang um in that field when I'm when I'm done and I I the board passes me that I can practice psychology in the state of Ohio right um so and again like I said like you know my experience in high school just made me realize how much of a struggle um young boys young men specifically have with mental health and we talk about in in my mental health classes um well in just in society at large right we talk about underrepresented I'm sorry unrepresented underrepresented communities right it's like a big buzzword going on in the culture and men um are really an underrepresented community in mental health oh yes oh yeah you know I'm sure you've seen this as a pastor oh I I I'd be really interested to know what percentage of people currently within the voluntary mental health um regime what what percentage of patients are women because well it's it's um and I man I wish I actually had the stats off the top of my head it is something jarring like I don't want to say it because then if someone from the ethics board you know watch and I don't think anyone would they're like wait remember that one time when you said a false claim on it's a lot of underclasses channel yeah exactly there's Joe Roman under Clay yeah how did I get to this channel well we're gonna get there so that that that's that's the question in the back of my mind but I want to hear that I want to hear the statistic or at least your your vague man with proper disclaimer I I that that's completely believable because women women are going to go to therapy man and how many and how many and how many counselors or whatever so counselors psychologists um clinical social workers how I'm curious what do you think is the percentage of women I'd say it'd have to be like 80 85 it's somewhere yeah it's again it's high up there yeah um um so you know and I know okay so I with this I also know that I'm I'm I need to be a man of my community right so it's like okay I'm in Cleveland and I know who and and I know so I know what kind of men are are going to counseling in Cleveland and I know uh the demographics of who are therapists in Cleveland and yeah it's a lot of women and so you know my job and my responsibility and I do I again this was like a three-year process of from from being a high school teacher to now so it was a lot of prayer a lot of prayer and prayer and internal prayer prayer prayer looking like I said internally prayer in in the way of having conversations with my wife right because that's a form of prayer I think um if the holy spirit is in that conversation I think the holy spirit was very much in those conversations I had with my wife prayer in the conversations I had with my father with my mother with my brother with my sister with you know other people in my family other important people you know my my job my mission is yeah I I need to I need to help men reach apex potential in this Cleveland area um and I I need and this is something that's actually you know in this particular community on the internet this is something that I hear it's like regain masculinity but yeah I want to help I want to help men regain masculinity and I also don't want to I also don't want to preach to them that the the brutish or the the more machismo notion of masculinity which I don't well here's the deal I think that could be a part of it but also I think here's the deal you know if if if you're someone who believes that men and women have particular virtues well one virtue of of of masculinity is to protect and so what if we just called it that to protect you're a man you protect your family I don't care how you do it right as long as it's ethical and as long as it's as as long as it's rooted in Christ okay right so you're not you're not jacking up weights every day you're not the most gifted on the on the field maybe you're a little more sensitive maybe you have a different way of fine that's masculine that's masculinity right there if you're protecting your family if you're providing for your family I don't care how you get it done that's what we need to recapture and for so many men I mean we have so many damn man met man childs man children running around and it's a complete shame and I you know and I again I go back to my experiences at the high school and what's your initiation ritual to be a man and this has been this is obviously not a unique thought what's your initial what's your initiation ritual as being a man how do you know that you're a man well one day I was watching South Park and I fell asleep and I woke up at 3 30 in the morning there was a girls gone wild infomercial on and it kind of piqued my interest and so now uh you know it also piqued my interest you Paul you know you left but there's something true about it I think and well what's also going to pique my interest well now that that infomercial uh has me now logging on to my computer and looking at a lot of pornography and so how I know myself as a man how I know myself sexually uh first of all like because we're we're just conflating it really we think that okay well the the sexual experience that I have is going to be the first sexual experience that I have is going to like define my manhood and so yeah maybe the first sexual experience that I have is is through porn and then you can go down that rabbit hole and then you get significantly and horribly addicted to pornography and then that influences your beliefs on what being a man is that influences your interactions with women that makes your interactions with women more pornographic that makes your sex when you get married more pornographic that makes your fatherhood and I don't want to I don't want to be like misconstrued here so I don't want to say it makes your fatherhood pornographic but pornographic in the way where you're just clicking things very fast and you're just you're not really paying attention to anything you're just clicking on something new something that's going to grab your attention right and so okay well how does that how does that translate to being a father okay well I'm not really going to pay attention to my kid I'm not really paying attention to my wife I'm just looking for the new thing I'm looking for what's catching my attention it's very real and pornography is not the only thing plaguing men right but it's it's a big thing and and it's not going to be the only thing that I that you know I want to help men with but it's a big thing right this is just one this is just one thing which is this is the scary part that's just one thing in the you know advent of this man child phenomena that we're in that we have been in not even that we're in currently we have been in this and so again I come back to this notion of just rooted in Christ though so it's like how can you make how can I help men reach their apex potential through Christ and I don't even want my counseling to be I don't even I don't even plan on labeling myself as a Catholic counselor that's the thing I believe that counseling is is is godly in nature right helping people reach their most authentic self having people reach their mental health goals and that's a godly pursuit and so and yeah I mean that's where I'm at now I know I've rambled I hope I made sense you've made 20th sense you played 20th sense you can you're gonna do fine on YouTube well how did you how did you find me because and and what I mean how did we get here well I was part of the ethics board for psychology and I'm joking um so how did I find you great question how did we get here um you know it was maybe like two years ago it like a lot of people I think it was through not it wasn't through uh well I guess like the grandfather of it all is always like Peterson like Peterson is always like the father Abraham but um I I think it was through Jonathan Peugeot more so watching Jonathan Peugeot videos than getting to you you and I mean and the interesting conversations that you have with that you've had and I'm sure going to continue to have with Peugeot and Burbanki and things like that and I got interested in your channel um through them but also you're just and this is something that I want to talk about when me and you have our second conversation is just you're so eclectic I don't know I don't even know how to grip you like where you at you're talking about it's like you started off with Peterson okay but now you're talking about cognition now you're talking about consciousness now you're talking about marriage crisis you're having these random conversations with guys like me it's like oh he he's eclectic he's interesting um I also like it's also so it's also been difficult to find a cat a Roman Catholic online crowd um I'm all I'm not a big internet guy that's the thing I've never been on like the discord I've never been on I don't even I haven't even I've never even been to the website if it's a website oh there isn't the website well I guess there's a discord website where you can download it but now that's I just embarrassed myself for however many people watch this but right so sure okay so yeah I'm not a big internet guy um and where was I getting with that oh so it's like I'm not because I just don't have time yeah I mean I was coaching I was teaching I'm in school I'm married I have a kid I mean I I just don't have I have the time to like focus on like one platform and that one platform is going to be either you know the the podcasts I listen to on Spotify or YouTube and so I always found you as like a really good I guess eclectic voice and you're you're having conversations with uh different people of different denominations I mean you're even having conversations with people of of different monotheistic faiths and I think right now we're at a as a culture we probably shouldn't we we shouldn't be like further separating ourselves and just like creating more and more fractions or fractions or sorry factions and factions and factions um I'm interested in having conversations with anyone who is a follower of Christ I'm also interested in having conversations with um you know other individuals right but as of right now you know I'm interested in you know being a part of that community that gets invigorated in in the Lord I don't I don't know if it's necessarily a good idea if we're to you know be again this is this this is like really reductionistic but be too nitpicky um it's interesting you've seen how you've seen how like communities on the left have gotten things they want to get done done because they stopped being nitpicky right um and I wonder sometimes and again I'm not trying to like politicize this but like you know I wonder sometimes like in a in a Christian uh framework it's like what can we get done if we stop being nitpicky and I wonder sometimes we stop being so nitpicky I don't know I don't know what the answer is it's just a thought I guess um you know I have no I I don't have I have an interest but I don't know if if it's right now where I don't I don't necessarily want to get into conversations about what a lot of people here I guess in this community from what I've seen a lot of um a lot of Protestants and then you have like your Orthodox you know uh your Orthodox community within the community and I'm not gonna fine you're Protestant fine you're Eastern Orthodox that's great I'm Roman Catholic um maybe we shouldn't waste and then you want to be wasting your time and maybe our conversation should be about something different other than well how can you be a real follower of Christ and call yourself a Roman Catholic I am so I don't know yeah yeah yeah that's that's definitely a piece of this that that we're choosing to um that that isn't to say that there aren't um that doesn't say there aren't differences it also isn't to say that there aren't interesting things that Protestants and Catholics can't talk about about things that we disagree on and you need to right you need to to create a good relationship yep yep but it's I think a lot of it is that we don't want we don't want these things to get in the way of the relationship because there's a lot of other good things that can come through the relationship and so I think yeah and that's a good rephrasing I think it's just yeah that's perfect yeah yeah well well good well why don't you say a little bit about what your channel is going to be about and then we're going to end this we're going to end this recording and then we'll start another recording and and you can do your shtick how's that sounds do it all right so yeah the channel just really getting it off the ground decided to play up the alliteration so uh the gist with Joe and so what I want this channel to be is again as individuals who are watching this you know that there's a lot of content on youtube in this community but also in the communities of other fields such as psychology theology and religion and again if you're like me if you have if you if you have a job you're in school if you're a parent if you're a spouse you know that staying up to date with these particular communities might be difficult because the beauty of this community is that they're usually long form so you can have a podcast or youtube uh session going for two hours an hour and a half again if you're like me you don't have the time to necessarily uh watch those and again mine's mine's very fragmented i'm i'm listening to paul while working out at like 9 30 at night and at that point i don't even know what the heck is going on so the gist with joe is having interesting thinkers in the fields of psychology theology uh and philosophy come on to explain really what's the gist of their project and so i'm super excited to ask paul this again because he is so eclectic so i'm wondering if he can where's where's the through line i'm a little afraid to answer it because i'm not sure if i know let's find it so yeah i i encourage you to check it out um paul is my first guest but hopefully i get some some very interesting thinkers uh to follow suit and that's that's that's it that's my that's my my pitch well that's good that's good well let's we'll end recording now and then we'll uh we'll do the gist thing awesome
