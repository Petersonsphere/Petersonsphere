 Hi, this is Paul and I'm continuing on my series on the commentary on Jordan Peterson's biblical series, and I'm going to jump around a little bit. This is again in biblical series three. And I was, and I'm planning on doing a piece on origin, which is kind of the second comment that Jordan Peterson makes in that, but I've been, I've been digesting the Let's find it. I've been digesting the, I don't want to tip off my hand, this Jordan Peterson transliminal 2015 video, and I've listened to that three times in a row now and I, it's, it's really been helpful in terms of, I think that's, I think that's probably the best video that I've seen of Peterson Working in a semi linear way. And, and that video has really at this point now I've been studying Peterson for about eight months, and since doing these videos for about a month now really starting to focus in and I think I'm just starting to get a handle on him in some ways and that video in particular has been has been super super helpful so now as I continue to go through the biblical series lights are coming on pennies are dropping things are falling into place. I'm, I'm understanding I'm getting a better picture of why he's repeating himself why he's working through these things, why he's rambling the way he is and where he's going with all of this. So let's, so let's jump in. And this is, so I'm calling this biblical series be I'm trying to work out a numbering system which a number of you have asked for to try to make these put these videos better in order, they do follow the playlists as I, as I put them in. And I want to jump into towards the end of the biblical commentary series three, where Peterson talks about Marduk. Know it or not. That's Marduk. So the story of Marduk, I'll just give it to you very briefly. Now again there's so much in here that I want to talk about because this, I mean what he's connecting there, connecting to the story of Marduk, I think, is that he's not just talking about the story of Marduk, he's talking about the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the story of the in which they themselves kill abso their father and they're move up don't care less Earth is important to think about these work the work that enthusiast just those p their rough-looking creature and she's the mother of all things and so she's not very happy. And again if you look at, if you look at Tiamat she's a composite beast. Now at some point we're going to have to talk about the Book of Daniel and the composite beasts that come out of the sea in the Book of Daniel and again if you look at this representation and you think about Peterson's you know cat snake bird. I mean she's not got a lot of snakes in this image but in a number of the other image she is a sea monster and but you know she's got claws and look at her claws and they're almost hands but she's got you know feet like raptors and claws like lions and a beak like a bird and wings so that she can fly. So again she's this composite monster that now Marduk is going to fight but look at Marduk too. I mean he's got wings and he's got tools and so we're going to see this epic battle. Her children have destroyed structure itself plus they're noisy and careless and so she thinks alright just like Noah. Okay her children have destroyed structure itself and again when you think about Peterson and the archetypal fathers how you know the father, the father brings order and the you know in the New Testament you would call it the lusts of the flesh. The lusts of the flesh destroy order and again as a pastor I see this all the time with people. How do people sabotage themselves? Well it's so often these lusts of the flesh that the Greeks called gods that would come in and possess and inhabit us you know and it could be Cupid which is love or it could be lust and so on and so forth. So again all this you know all this archetypal mythological imagery at play and it's not only mythological but we see it playing out in our lives which is actually the real purpose behind myth and you know why we you know why we love seeing movies and why we love myths and why we love reading People magazine to watch these people who are god-like celebrities in our culture they're powerful and beautiful and the normal rules don't pertain to them but they can't keep a marriage together because the internal gods of lust or addiction or depression take them and off they go and so this is this is replayed in Apsu and Tiamat. Just like the god that brings the flood to Noah exactly the same idea. Tiamat comes back and says yeah okay enough is enough I'm gonna take you out and she makes this battalion of monsters and puts the worst monster there is at the head of the battalion his name is Kingu he's like a precursor to the idea of Satan and she lets the gods know hey I'm coming for you and so they're not very happy about this because they're gods but like yeah she's chaos itself right she gave birth to everything this is no joke and so they send one god out after another to confront her and they all come back with their tails between their legs there's no hope and then one day there's a new god that emerges and that's Marduk and the gods know as soon as he pops up they know he's something new remember and this is happening while the Mesopotamians are assembling themselves into one of the world's first great civilizations so all the gods of all those tribes are coming together to organize themselves into a hierarchy to figure out what proposition rules everything. Okay now pause right here because we're going to get into this because one of the peoples that the Babylonians will eat are the Hebrews and Israel and their gods and what we're going to see is that in a way Babylon eats Israel but it but it's kind of like in the matrix when you know when when Neo kind of you know that the these um well they're godlike they're part of the program when they kind of attack the people who are coming into the program and they kind of explode them well Israel's going to explode Marduk and this shouldn't happen by the script and so Peterson is right and this is I haven't been able to find and locate this where Peterson talks about this this polytheistic appropriation of the gods and so and so one so these these ancient Near East these ancient Near East nations believe that the kings were were proxies of the gods now I'm going to go off script a little bit here and see if I can um now let's go back to chrome let's put me in the corner let's put Peterson in a window let's do a google image search and um so you know I even forget what I was searching um oh yeah the the um Hammurabi Hammurabi's style and and you've probably heard of Hammurabi's code but but most of you you know probably haven't seen the style and this is where the code comes from and you can see the let's see view image let's get it taller you can see here's all the writing down here and here's where we get Hammurabi's code but but what do we have here we have the god giving Hammurabi the code and now obviously you have in Sinai the lord giving Moses tablets of stone that possessed the law but but now what's interesting is that this this relationship and again Walton talks about this this is this isn't something Israel borrows from the culture this is the culture that Israel inhabits and the god gives the people the law and here the god gives Hammurabi the code and the law and the people are supposed to follow the law and Peterson talks about that in this video and we're going to get back to that a few times but but what's key here is that the the human nations the tribes the peoples these entities nations that's a modern word but these these nations these peoples are proxies for the real issue which is the gods and this shows this shows again the ancient priority that the the the material is a cre is a creation and dependent upon the metaphysical and when we talk about origin in the Greeks we're going to see that dominantly because that then gets played out in Plato that the forms are eternal and the the instances in the flesh within the age of decay are temporal every love you have will end in betrayal or death but love itself held in the heavenly in the forms will not decay every horse you know will die but the form of horse will remain in the flesh now Aristotle changes the script on this a bit but but this this assumption in the ancient world that the physical is secondary and what we would call the spiritual is foundational and primary and the physical is derivative and so therefore the gods are the big deal and the people are the working out of the gods and the direction flows from heaven to earth which is obviously why they had astrology and why if you wanted to know the what was coming on earth you had to look up to into the stars and see the movements and then you figure out just like we in California when we want to know what our weather is we look out over the Pacific well in the ancient world if they wanted to know what will be happening in meat space down here in the physical world you look up into the stars and when you see the stars move you say aha we know what's coming we can see it in the stars just like here in California when we want to know our weather we look out over the Pacific so back to Peterson you see that I jumped too quickly and go back to which tab I had him in okay here we are so let's keep going and so Marduk is elected by all the gods and he says look I'll go out there and I'll take on time at but here's the rule from here on you follow me I determine destiny I'm the top god I'm the thing at the top of the hierarchy now that gets played out between the peoples and when we get into the assimilation process of the ancient world Babylon plays this out with Israel Marduk is the top god the lord is his servant because Babylon and her armies have conquered Israel therefore the armies of Babylon must be greater and and this is all being worked out and and all the other gods say hey look no problem you get rid of chaos we do exactly what you say now Marduk he has eyes all the way around his head and he speaks magic words those are his primary attributes and so he takes a net and he goes out to confront time at and and he he he encloses her in a net which I think is so cool because it's an encapsulation right it's a conceptual encapsulation he encloses chaos itself in a conceptual structure he puts it in a net and then he cuts her into pieces and he makes the world now another thing to to remember here something that I mentioned back in my my video about chaos and Walton what's interesting here and I'm going to do more research on this is that Walton makes the point in his book Genesis 1 is ancient cosmology that the conflict myth is a secondary development a personification of these primary creation metaphors of separation differentiation that's interesting because one of the things that sometimes I do a class for a a friend of mine who who wants to wants me to introduce Christianity into his university class that he teaches one of the things I know when I go back to the creation myths is one of the differences between say Genesis 1 and Babylonian creation accounts and almost almost all all other or many many other creation accounts is the element of violence where you know here you have Marduk controlling chaos putting internet you know slicing up his mother as it were and using her body then as in a sense the firmament in which to create the world and then people are made to be servants of the gods and and what's interesting as Walton points out in Genesis 1 is that first of all God is dealing with order but this isn't even a fight he simply commands it and order comes into line and we're going to see how this plays out then when it comes to Israel and the nations and and so that this God doesn't set up a world and say okay I need people to feed me John Walton notes that what's interesting and different about the biblical biblical account is that people the creation is made in such a way as to be habitable for people and and so God in a sense the God of the of the Israelites had people on his mind right from the start now the human rebellion is going to make a difference in that in terms of the relationship between chaos and order and in a sense they are kicked out of the garden and the balance between chaos and order is overturned and now humanity itself has to wrangle with the thorns and the thistles and and the women in their productive state have to wrangle with frustration in child birth and again the language in in Genesis 3 between what the man have to has to deal with in the field and what the woman has to deal with in terms of childbirth are parallel and and so what you see here is that these two stories are from the same culture in other words they're dealing with all of the same issues but the stories are taking things in slightly different directions okay back to Peterson and then then he creates human beings to inhabit that world and to serve the gods and he creates human beings out of the blood of kingu the worst of the demons and that took me to Colin de Young who's a student of mine helped me figure that out Colin de Young I want to know who you are did you grow up christian reform because that's a dutch name and if you grew up christian reform every time you hear a dutch name you say are you one of us or maybe you're rca a cousin but uh let us know Colin de Young that's pretty damn pessimistic it's like you know what exactly it's like a fall metaphor it's like the idea of original sin but but our joint conclusion with regards to that was that human beings are the only creatures in creation that can truly deceive right we have the capacity for evil just like it says in the adam and eve story we can actually do that and that's why we're made out of the blood of kingu the king of the demons the we are the thing that can deceive that can twist the structure of reality and and here you also have another differentiation in terms of the biblical story in a sense humanity is fallen royalty but they're yet royalty they're made of the dust of the earth and the breath of god they're they're not made from the blood of demons well so marduk now the the mass of attainment has had an emperor right and the emperor was the avatar of marduk that's what made him emperor he was only an emperor if he was going to be marduk he had to be a good marduk which meant he had to confront time at chaos and cut her up and make order out of her pieces and what the mess of attainment is used to do and and and again he tells this story a number of times and it's a great story and those of you who watch his videos all the time know exactly where he's going but um you'll also notice that again for the for the hebraeus the kings are the the viceroy of of the lord and in fact this goes all the way back to genesis one in the image of god that that humanity is in a sense god's representative on the earth and to be a good representative on the earth you have to submit to the king you have to submit to your the one who is ahead of you the one who is above you now this obviously takes different shapes in our modern world where we say no i am the boss of me and there's no boss beyond me but then of course we have all of our um all of our hierarchies that we that we absolutely must deal with and peterson will go very deeply into that um it gets into the beginning of the heber catechism which begins um what is your only comfort in life and in death that i am not my own which is completely opposite of say an american creed which would be what is what is your only joy in life that i am my own that i am free to do whatever i want and and you know that shows this this dramatic shift of modernity even from the medieval world the new year's celebration they'd go outside their walled city and that's explored territory versus unexplored territory they'd go outside their walled city into chaos and they'd bring all the statues that represented the gods and they'd act this out they bring the statues that represent the gods now what's not going to happen among the hebers well you're not going to have any statues of the lord and if you do and i'm going to get into the old testament books in a little bit you're going to get into trouble but again i mean this is this is why this is why peterson has been so helpful because he's helped me put a lot of this stuff together in terms of okay now when i'm reading when i'm reading um the bible especially the hebra scriptures things are falling together and they're connecting out in interesting ways with the rest of the ancient near east because they're trying to figure something out right they're trying to figure out what this means they're acting it out and then they'd take their emperor and the priest would make him kneel and they take all his king equally all his king uniform off his emperor uniform off and make him kneel and humiliate him and nail him with a glove and say okay how were you not a good marduk this year right and then he'd recount all the ways that he was inadequate confronting chaos and then they'd do the celebration and marduk would win and and the king would go sleep with a royal prostitute and and now again pay attention to sleeping with the prostitute think about the gilgamesh epic and enkidu and how enki enkidu or enkidu is tamed by the prostitute of great walled uruk so again read read gilgamesh the reason for that was it's the same idea as saint george pulling the virgin from the dragon it's exactly the same idea that if you call if you encounter the reptilian chaos you can extract something out of it with which if you unite you produce creative order that's what they were acting out and and that was the basis for the mesopotamian idea of sovereignty it's so smart it's so unbelievably smart and you know the mesopotamians had a massive influence on the civilizations that then had a massive influence on us now and if you don't believe that read jared diamond's read jared diamond's great book why can't i think of it right now but but you know what jared diamond wrote and and how in many ways story and culture radiated from this ancient near east in many ways on the heels of of domesticated cattle and sheep and pigs and wheat and you know and so yes these stories these stories are foundational and as peterson says many many times makes young's observation that we don't have ideas ideas have us and and you know we don't have stories stories have us which again for me makes um is the devastating critique of post-modernity that says there's no overarching narrative you can't say that statement without implicitly making an overarching narrative statement it's it's simply a function of language and this was a point i made in the comment about science that that perhaps you can do science in terms of pure mathematics but you can't communicate that to another human being that doesn't know that language properly so the minute you try to engage in any scalable way with regular people you are within the story verse because it's simply built into language it is unavoidable remember where we started out the medium is the message and what medium you use will will shape and even govern what is happening one of the stories of how the notion of sovereignty itself came to be it's the evolution of the idea of god that's one way of thinking about it but even more importantly it's the evolution of the idea of the redemptive human being right and that's taken to its one of its conclusions well in the story of buddha but also in the story of christ the idea of the perfect individual and the notion is well that's the word that speaks truth into chaos at the beginning of time to generate habitable is good that's the story and so with that that's the story so with that let's jump back to the powerpoint now now one of the things that that i've been um monkeying around with is is one of the things that you get is you're going to have to begin to ask well well when did these biblical text arise and and if you dive into this world that i live in uh boy that's a big debate because we don't know who wrote these things we don't know and so there's tremendous debate and and what you have to do is is really up your resolution in terms of this and say well did these texts arise during david's realm and how does the text of genesis relate let's say to the text of deuteronomy and those issues and and so one of the things that we're going to have to dive into is this question of israel at the dawn of our empire and the relationship between israel and empire and the relationship between between god and empire because remember and i'll pull up um i'll pull up the stelle here this in the ancient near east is the relationship um who are people people are servants of the gods but now there's nuance within this because in many ways marduk creates people in order to serve the gods and if you look at ancient temples well what were the ancient temples for well you bring food offerings to the god and why do you need to bring food offerings to the god because the god needs to eat and then you read in the hebrew scriptures and they are saying things like well first of all you may not make a representation of this god well why not and and actually if you if you google online let's say google why do hindus continue to worship idols and you will find um statements like well idols are really helpful for people in their religion because you can once you have something in your hand you can you can feel it better and you can relate to it and and so why would the hebrews not do this thing which would really help them be more religious now think about that for a while and that will blow your mind and and then of course that gets dragged into protestantism and i come from an iconoclastic tradition why are our why are our um sanctuaries so bare now now technically you only violate the you only violate the second commandment if you make an image of the lord and when i say the lord here i mean the the tetragrammaton the name of the lord um and so you can you can draw a picture of jesus because jesus according to the book of colossians was the icon of the invisible god but but but this is where we're this is where we're going into this that in the ancient near east you had the gods and they were images and you had all of this and so this was this was the world that they were living in but now one of the things that you know and i over the last number of years i decided that as a pastor i was tired of jumping in and out of all these little series and and i really wanted to just preach on whole books of the bible because the bible is in fact a library and and so then i decided well you know so many people don't really know a lot about the hebrew scriptures the old testament as as christians call it so i was going to start right there in the bible and i so in a sense i started peterson's biblical series before i ever heard of peterson i started in genesis and i've been working through it and and right now i'm in i'm in kings and i'm doing the sola scriptura series right now which if you're watching my rough draft of sunday videos you know what's going on there but after that i'm probably going to go back to to second kings and then we're going to go back to elisha and and and all of those things going on but but i it forced me to kind of go through the bible sequentially and one of the things that you realize that as peterson has said many times this is a very strange library because it's also been set up in a certain way and and and the the process by which it was set up and the books were ordered is is fairly mysterious to us and and as i mentioned before there's there's unending debate about the books themselves and and how they arose and and that gets into tribalisms because um fundamentalist christians have different agendas from modernist christians and their debates with the scholarly community and if you get into um biblical studies these these debates are never ending but one of the things that i noticed was that these books their focuses and their agendas changes they go through so so if you read the book of judges for example the book of judges is is obsessively preoccupied with the exclusive devotion to the lord and and so that the pattern of the book of judges if you've ever read the book of judges is is very familiar that god brings them into the land but the people are disobedient and and they're they're they're very disobedient in terms of they're always getting attracted to the neighbor gods and and basically how this works is you come into the land and your crops aren't doing so well and your buddy who's been living there longer and isn't circumcised leans over the fence fence and says hey buddy you know you know your problem here you're doing these sacrifices to the lord but but this land right here this land belongs to bale and and and so if you if you do your sacrifices to bale then your crops are going to grow then your herds are going to multiply then your wife is going to have sons then your then then bale's going to be and bale basically kind of means the boss and and then bale's going to you know keep the keep the neighbors at bay and let your armies win and so what you really need to do is work with the bale's and so you know israelites just like everyone else are religious consumers and they're always looking for the best deal and they're always looking for the more powerful god so they look to the bale's but then the book of judges says oh no no no the bale's aren't in charge the lord is in charge and then calamities come and and israel then becomes you know in bondage again you know in egypt they were in slavery but now they're in slavery in their own lands to the to the midianites and then later the the philistines who will be you know a serious imperial a serious challenge to them because the philistines are are much more cosmopolitan people they came into the land they've got iron working and the israelites don't and the the philistines are monopolizing it so so then the story goes that the lord raises up a judge and these judges are not necessarily moral heroes i mean think about samson he's kind of the epitome of the judges um you know and he's got no self-control he you know he can't keep his you know he can't the the wrong head keeps doing the thinking and he falls into trouble with the women but but even with all of this stuff somehow the lord uses him to bring victory over their enemies and then israel has this religious revival they say the lord the lord is god and will follow him but then that generation dies and and the next generation listens to their neighbor over the fence and begins following the bales and round and round we go and this is the story of the book of judges and then it ends with this horrendous story which is actually a redux of the story of saddam and gamora which is important because you know if you're if you're a tribalist of any kind it's always convenient to blame you know issues on foreigners so you can build high walls and keep them out and all of this stuff that we deal with all the time but but what happens when israel and it's actually gibia the home of saul itself that commits this atrocity to to the leviates concubine and and and the image at the of the story at the end of book of judges is is that israel is not only just like the other nations she's the worst of the other nations if the story is the story is archetypal and and then you have after the book of judges you have this just one of the loveliest books in all of in all of creation the book of ruth which which has all of these cross pressures that are that are dealing with are the mobytes evil yeah but you know this ancestor of david and later this ancestor of jesus she was a mobytist and her and her morality outshone that of naomi who who turns in to be this bitter faithless woman who is a not only a religious consumer but she's conniving and oh boy you know let's get a shot at boaz here because you know we can make the monies and and ruth is this beautiful character and this is beautiful story how this this this noble israelite and this noble moabitess come together and the lord uses this union to rescue his people from themselves and and so it's a lovely interlude after the book of judges but then when we get book into the into the book of samuel you might think okay well now we're going to go back into baalism and and concerned about it but we don't you get into the book of samuel and the real issues are corruption now now saul is portrayed as being as being devout and saul is very religious all is very devout and he's not going to the bales and only at the end of his corruption does he actually sink to to find the witch at endor to try to call up the spirit of samuel but but the issue in the book of samuel is not the read the foreign religions and it's not it's even not the foreign peoples and this is why you know people read the bible and they say oh the bible well they have an extremely low resolution of the bible resolution view of the bible and say oh the bible is all this dogmatic blah blah blah blah the bible is anything but that is this long complicated nuanced conversation about all of these issues that grips us and and sometimes gives dogmatic answers and sometimes gives nuanced answers but here's the thing our life is filled with dogmatic answers that we must hold and nuanced answers that we must ponder that's human life and what we find in the book of samuel is that you know it's it's not the foreigners and the foreign gods that are the great threat to israel it's corruption and peterson talks about this wonderfully when he talks about you know getting the the the instantiation the human instantiation of the absolute confused with the absolute and in many ways that's what the book of samuel is about and and right away in chapter 8 when the elders want a king they want this new political technology that's going to solve all their problems and samuel first he takes it personally and the lord says no you take it personally this is about me their complaints are about me but give him a king anyway now what do you mean give him a king yeah give him a king and let him know what a king's going to do because a king's going to tax them the king's going to take the best of their sons and the best of their daughters for his bed and he's going to take the best of their crops and the best of their herds and you're going to want him to be your junkyard dog to protect you from the philistines and it isn't gonna work and that's exactly the story of saul but then of course but then the lord picks a man after god's own heart but even with respect to these themes look at david david has david in some ways cozies up to the philistines and becomes a you know becomes a lieutenant in the philistine army and then there's a crisis in that late in the book but but david has david has wives from israel and wives from outside israel as does solomon solomon's gonna get dinged for it we don't hear anything from that from david who do you think bathsheba was um uriah the hittite was bathsheba an israelite woman we don't know um david's army his personal bodyguard that gets him out of a scrape again and again read the list of who they were these are not israelites and why does david have this kind of cosmopolitan personal army and how on earth does that fit into the broader conversations of israelite particularism again the bible is incredibly nuanced and all of these issues that we deal with should we build a wall are you know how do we regard people who come from shithole countries all of these issues are are dealt with in the bible and we've been having a long conversation with these for years and this is exactly why peterson is dead right and saying to people who are dismissive of religion as mere superstition well that's that's that's i understand why you say that but it's not it's not a very high resolution um it's not a very high resolution engagement of that reality now of course peterson and i'm going to get into these in other videos when i can after i've sufficiently digested this to get short on these things um these are these are the issues that that peterson is dealing with so so here in samuel no talk about balism and and and gentiles aren't even a problem now david and saul are you know they follow the lord they're not you know they're not creeping around with bales but then when we get to the book of kings the balism issue is back and and the um and the xenophobia if that's the way you want to call it the concern about foreigners is back and and so then you have in the book of kings solomon who on one hand is the is the image of exactly what an israelite king should be what is he corrupted by he's he's corrupted by his foreign wives and he's corrupted by the foreign gods and he's corrupted by empire and this if there's a theme in the bible that especially americans how we live in this imperial nation americans don't like to engage it's the ongoing critique of empire and the way that the bible manages this critique it's in fact throughout the bible and it begins in genesis one and it climaxes in many ways in the book of revelation but when you get to the book of kings the concern returns to the sin of jeroboam and that gets repeated again and again in the book of kings and then the prophets arise this this other institution arises to to keep the kings to to keep the kings in check now i'm going to pause here i had to pause to uh pick up this from my blog um ancient israelite oracles versus other ancient near-east oracles and this isn't from another book um on john waltz and uh ancient near-east thought and the old testament um introduction introducing the conceptual world of the hebrew bible well one of the things that you notice is that this israelite this israelite tradition israelite indictment oracles are far more common than ancient near-east oracles israelite oracles are more more often call for covenant faithfulness while ancient near-east oracles more often call for ritual faithfulness israelite prophets are covenant enforcers while ancient near-east prophet prophets are ritual enforcers judgment in the ancient near-east prophecy is nearly non-existent um and and so what you have in so what you have if i can find my powerpoint again um enable it there we go so what you have in in the ancient near-east are our prophets are an essentially yes men to the kings and the emperors while in israel prophets keep railing against the kings and saying you are failing to embody to put it in the the words of the video we just saw you're failing to be a good marduk you are failing to embody the lord you are failing to embody what god has called you to and and this has to do both with their exclusive devotion to their god loyalty and to their treatment of of the poor and the dispossessed which which gets into what you'll hear peterson talk again and again about the the big chimp now the big chimp is not the one who's the strongest who can just simply bully everyone the big chimp is not only strong but the big chimp looks out for the females and the young and and this again gets mirrored in the old testament well what is the you know what is the role of the king the king must do justice and what does justice require justice requires that the the the land is not just the strong taking the weak now i'm a little slow here um in terms of the video and i'm sorry the lip sync is off it's not just the strong taking the weak it's the it had there has to be justice in the land and that's where you get into rule of law and all those kinds of things now now what happens with israel is that she gets assimilated now when israel is when israel is okay when israel is an empire she's supposed to tolerate and welcome the stranger but um but even though there are distinctions and you can read this again in the law and deuteronomy or the law in exodus even though there are distinctions um you know the israelites are circumcised and there are others among them who are not um are not herews and israelites and they may not be circumcised but but the israelites even though there's distinctions and there's different laws for the different groups there's the israelites are supposed to be open-handed to the poor and open-handed to the stranger because and it's said many times so you must be open-handed to the stranger because you were a stranger in a strange land and egypt that empire was not open-handed towards you but now in comes the big empires and assyria comes and assyria has a every empire has a problem and the united states got a lesson in this when we said yeah you know we can beat saddam hussein and we can conquer iraq no big deal and the the armies of the united states you know went in there and and took them over and especially in the first gulf war i mean the iraqi soldiers couldn't you know couldn't surrender fast enough and and this demonstrates that what's at the heart of a strong nation is not a tyrant but it's it's belief system because you're not going to fight and die for a country you don't believe in and well maybe if the guy behind you has a gun to your head and says keep moving forward against the enemy or i'm going to shoot you well the first chance that person has to to get out of there they're going to do it so well assyria comes along and the problem of empire is that well you can conquer the people but then what are you going to do with all those people that you've conquered and so the u.s beats saddam hussein and kicks him out and controls iraq and what happens well pretty soon the iraqi start fighting with themselves and fighting with the occupiers and this happens again and again so assyria has the plan of divide and conquer so assyria decides the best way to deal with this is to send take people out of the northern kingdom and spread them throughout their empire and take other people from their empire and put them in where the israelites were and this is the beginning of the samaritans which is a you know an issue that you'll find then in jesus time but that's a that's a fairly smart way to go because assyria basically says if we can basically put the people in a blender we're going to start the clock they're not going to understand each other language-wise they're not going to be able to organize it's divide and conquer and that and that way we'll be able to maintain our empire now babalon comes along and they have a very different idea and you can hear some of you can hear the roots of this and a lot of what peterson talks about in terms of marduk and his his eyes around his head and his speech the babalonians were you know in many ways they were impressed with themselves and they were in love with themselves and their god was you know their god was the great god and so well how do you assimilate and create a stable empire well you take the brightest and the best from places like jerusalem and you bring them to babalon and you train them you enlighten them in in what they should be and what they should do now this is in many ways the assimilation strategy of imperial america we give we give scholarships to people all around the world and even this this current um this current immigration conversation that talks about shit hole countries well well beyond that is the idea that well we're going to take your the brightest and the best from all the world and we're going to bring them to american universities and they're going to get great degrees and then they're going to want to move to palo alto california and work for google isn't that the american dream or if you're a dominican you're you're going to want to you're going to play tapa with your ball and your stick and you're going to um make it big in the major leagues and when you visit the santa domingo the dominican republic where i lived and worked as a missionary you're going to come into the airport in santa domingo resplendent with gold and chains and show everybody that you've made it and so babalon's assimilation strategy was take the brightest and the best of israel and bring them into babalon and teach them our ways and and they will surely see that our way of life is better than that that backwater hebreu way of life down there in jerusalem and of course our our gods are greater and their god is some second-rate tribal god they they thought of the god of the bible kind of like the um you know the you know certain certain other groups think of or dismissively think of the god of the bible and so this is this is how we're going to deal with them we need to educate them and this obviously is the is the great if you listen to anyone on the left who says well the problem is racism well what do we need to do we need to educate people and as a calvinist i hear that and say people are not just heads on sticks people are embodied creatures they have hearts they have motivations they are they are chimps filled with snakes you don't educate someone out of racism you don't educate someone out of hate this is a problem of the heart and the heart is far more complex than your notion that well if we just give them better ideas then they'll see the light that is an extremely deficient anthropology and and again one of the things i i deeply appreciate about jordan peterson is that i think his his anthropology is is far more accurate and even as a calvinist i find his anthropology um much more in alignment to my own in terms of the suspicion that we have of people you don't educate people out of evil that is that is not what evil is and that is not within the capacity of education because our problem is not too little information our problem runs far deeper so anyway the idea of the babylonians was to we're going to bring everybody here and we're going to educate them and you can read in the book of daniel because the book of daniel basically chronicles this take the brightest and the best of israel to educate them but then of course the book of daniel in some ways flips the script and if you're interested in that and my over on the over on my church channel i did i think maybe 15 or 16 weeks on the book of daniel fun fun book if i were to do that again i think my treatment of it would be better because again i think um i think jordan peterson has been a terrific help in terms of me figuring out the bible and figuring out the issues and figuring out how all these narratives collect connect but then when we get to the persians after the babylonians which we're not really going to get into today the the the the the persians decide well you know what we've they're real spiritualists because the persians decide no no no it's not education it's you guys are forgetting your roots because the the spiritual is foundational and the physical is derivative so um you know you know let's not think about battle between all the gods let's have let's let a thousand flowers bloom so you israelites who got kind of stuck in babalon we're going to give you a bunch of money you go back to jerusalem and you build your temple and you make your god happy with us and then you go to um then you go to the book of isaiah and you read the most laudatory things about about cyrus and and cyrus and this is going to get into what we're about to get into cyrus is the servant of the lord and you think oh my what what what amazing things to say about an emperor but but read the book of daniel about you know take a careful look at nebuchadnezzar in that book and again you can go through my my sunday school class on daniel and i walked through a bunch of this stuff the characterization of nebuchadnezzar in the book of daniel is is fascinating so so the the the persians have have a very different approach to assimilation but we want to we want to focus a little bit on the babalonian assimilation and now also in my adult sunday school class i've been studying the book of ezekiel and and you might if you look at last week's lesson which were in early january um actually it was in the process of doing this lesson that a lot of these ideas came into place and i always often have that experience when i'm doing a sunday school class that you know i do my study in my office but when i get into the sunday school class and i start talking about things and my my sunday school class starts talking back and asking questions new lights come on and i start putting things together well the story of ezekiel is basically this ezekiel is a young man well he's not he's um he's he's less than 30 years old and and in the priestly class at the age of 30 you're going to be a servant in the temple and ezekiel is looking forward to this but ezekiel gets hauled up to babalon and their assimilation project and and ezekiel gets hauled up to babalon and and some people actually have might think that ezekiel might have um been schizophrenic and if you read star slate star codex he's got some real interesting things to talk about in terms of disruption immigration and schizophrenia but um but ezekiel his his world gets ripped up and he gets taken up to babalon and he starts doing these crazy things and he starts having these crazy visions and ezekiel was one of the last books that the that the hebrus you know invited and welcomed into their canon because the book is so strange and again if you want to dive into the book of ezekiel you can watch my adult sunday school class i'm going through it chapter by chapter and and so ezekiel gets hauled up to this refugee camp outside of babalon and his world's just been ripped up and then he has this crazy vision where where the lord with the cherubim and seraphim appear over by him and and ezekiel's like what are you doing here you're supposed to be in the temple and and no the lord moves what is this and and and then he gets these visions of how corrupted the temple is by other deities and and what's going on there and and so this develops and and then we get into the question how can the lord be conquered and what does that mean for its people because again you have the polytheistic religious marketplace and and so pretty much what you have um well maybe we'll hold off on that what you have what you have here is again the basic situation where the gods are at war and so the lord israel is the proxy of the lord and marduk is the proxy of babalon and israel and babalon go to war and babalon wins and what that means is that marduk is the high god and the lord the god of israel is the low god and so if the israelites are smart ancient near east consumers they're going to say oh gosh our god just you know didn't didn't do very well and so we should really you know worship the god of marduk and nebuchadnezzar tries to get the um daniel and shadrach mishak and abednego to do this he gives them different names he gives them babalonian names and they resist and now a good polytheist in the ancient world would say oh come on first first of all you don't have to resist the beauty about polytheism is that if your god gets bested by marduk as long as you give props to marduk and when the emperor calls you to serve marduk you bow down if you want to go home and continue to think about your little israelite god that's okay we'll look the other way everybody has their own little god and this is the this is the beauty of polytheism that hey if one god is good more god is better if you have a special god you can have your own little private world this is in a sense analogous to kind of the um bargain that secularism uh creates in the west for us but i don't want to get too lost into that right now so so here you have the polytheistic marketplace and the jews are up there but then this god shows up in babalon and he starts he starts changing the script and and then he says things like this the word of the lord came to me son of man set your face against jerusalem and preach against the sanctuary well why the sanctuary well that's the temple and again if you want to i go into this in a lot more depth in my adult sunday school class and i do have that on youtube and i'll put the link to that in this um in this in the notes here prophesy against the land of israel and say to her this is what the lord says i am against you i will draw my sword from a chief and cut and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked they say hey wait a minute you're supposed to be god you're supposed to be about righteousness and wickedness and abraham comes to the lord when he says i'm going to destroy saddam and gamora and abraham has the audacity to say will you will you wipe out the righteous with the wicked and that then sets up this this bartering bartering conversation that that they go into but now this is the reason that we watch jordan peterson because something happens when the israelites get defeated and they now have an existential choice to make they now have this this classic this classic confrontation that that many of you made when you know hey you grew up in church and you read the bible stories and you had adam and eve and you had the flood and you had all this and then you went to university and what did university say said it's all a lie it's there's there's evolution and there's darwin and there's there's all these things and your bible is you know your bible is superstitious made up by primitive people who didn't know any better god bless him but now we know and so so on and so forth and suddenly you have an existential crisis in your head and you have to ask yourself do we serve marduk or do we serve the lord and round and round and round and round we go and one of the things that drives people crazy when they start reading the bible is okay so we start we start these book this book of genesis and genesis is really cool and then we're into exodus and exodus is really cool and i'm really looking forward to see what happens with with peterson when he gets out of the once the israelites get out of egypt and they're they're in the desert and then the law comes down and that's where most people who decide well i'm going to read the bible so i'm going to read it straight through so i'm going to start i'm going to start in genesis this is a bible that a homeless guy left on my doorstep so i'm going to start in genesis and then you know exodus and that's cool with the the angel and but then oh man sinai yeah but materials for the tabernacle sabbath regulations um yeah the golden calf well that's kind of interesting but but oh and then and then you've got leviticus to look forward to and then that's where people are like oh i i can't i can't read this thing well if they manage to say okay we're going to skip leviticus some cool stories and numbers deuteronomy oh who's going to you know that's that's that that's the law all over again joshua oh there's some cool stuff at the beginning of joshua there's jericho and and ai and aiken and that's cool but oh then we just get into these silly battles and numbers and then judges well they're kind of cool and then uh ruth oh that's a wonderful book and and kings chronicles and then after you get past chronicles you're gonna get into that that that that that that esther nehemiah ezra a little dry jove the writings job is too long to read just read the first the beginning in the end psalms yeah i do that before i go to bed uh let's see uh but then you're gonna get into the prophets the prophets oh my and the prophets are a big chunk of your bible and people can't read them and why can't they read them oh gosh have you ever tried reading them what you find is that this kind of thing like we saw in ezekiel is repeated over and over and over and over and over again and this is the challenge that you know the my sunday school class says oh let's look at his ego say okay are you ready for this because i'll tell you there's a lot to it and it gets dark and it gets dark fast and it is like a kid watching for us it's like watching our kid watch that video that they watch 20 times a day and and so at some point you look at the video and say oh gosh i'm sick of looking at this video if my kid if my kid plays pinocchio one more time i'm gonna scream but then you ask yourself why is the kid playing pinocchio a thousand times and you say well he's working something out well what's he working out so in other words what in a sense we have to do is we have to look at these prophets and ask ourselves what are they working out well they're working out an enormous shift that is the reason why we're still talking and reading this book and we're not reading the annals of the kings of babalon so so we read this bible and say why why all these laws why is this god so angry why so much angry prophetic material and again if you read isaiah and yeah there's some there's some lovely little pieces in isaiah that we like to pick out and decorate hang on our walls at christmas but if you read the rest of isaiah it's like oh my goodness this goes on and on and on and there's isaiah and there's jeremiah and there's ezekiel and these are huge books and then you read the minor prophets and it's like i have no idea what's going on there but why does jordan peterson repeat himself so often when he's doing these videos he's doing what we're doing we're working this stuff out um why can't we get enough of his videos because we're all working this stuff out with him we're all doing the same thing and we're sitting there watching the kid watch pinocchio a thousand times so again this is about gods at war and you have israel versus babalon which is really marduk versus the lord and then but now pay attention this is marduk this is the lord why no picture the story would be better right if the lord was you know looking like maybe zeus and had a lightning bolt and was gonna do something and then israel loses well well what does that mean they need to do well well you know yeah marduk you know look at marduk he's he's cool and and look at this look at this um look at this snake bird lion thing that he's beating that's awesome and they've got and when you go to babalon and you go in their temple they have these these great pictures and they have these huge statues and you know when the um when the roman emperor came in and to finally destroy the the temple he was looking forward to going in the temple because you know temples are fun temples have pictures temples have they might even have hookers um temples are cool places and then he goes into the hebrew temple and he is ticked off because he walks into the holy of holies and what's in there nothing zero zip nada why well this is a word my friends this is an image what's going on and really what the prophets are doing and what ezekiel is doing and and and the reason they go over it again and again and again and again and again until we're just sick of it because that's not what we're going through is that what happens and you again if you read the prophets this is what they come to again and again and again one of the things that i really appreciate about peterson that's in that transliminal video is he talks about intelligence intelligence is really good it's really good to be smart but you know what you know to a certain degree you're only going to be as smart as your genetics allow you to be and that's that's kind of a bummer so you know most of us are not going to be anywhere near as smart as jordan peterson it's just not the genetics we were given it's not the it's not the cards we were dealt what a pagan saying that isn't christians use it all the time um it's not the cards we were dealt but peterson makes the point in that video yeah yeah yeah you know smarts but you want to know what is a real key to learn to learning and living pay attention pay attention you can learn a lot by watching and so when you see stuff happening and when you see repetition pause and say why am i bored with this why is this other person not bored with this what are they working out what's really going on so what happens to the hebra's what the hebra script what the hebra prophets begin saying is Babylon is the Lord's tool and what he's in a sense saying is well we're not going to talk about Marduk much because we're well the the the question about the question about old testament polytheism versus henotheism versus the the other the other realms who does God talk to at the beginning of the book of Job and they're Michael Heisner or something like that he's he's doing a lot of interesting videos on that and if you're not familiar with any of that stuff it's good stuff to watch but um you know the Lord is the great king he's the king over other gods well who are these other gods well he's the king over Marduk and and here's where the the question of conflict in Genesis 1 gets important because the Lord doesn't destroy the sea monster the Lord the sea monster is um serves the Lord and in fact if you look at the book of Job you know the this is you know hasatan the the Satan the accuser um Satan serves the Lord now now how does this work and now when you get into the new testament this conversation is going to get even more engaged and it's going to get even more engaged when you get into the book of revelation but you know even Satan is is is really no um no challenge to him this this god of the Hebrews is is the god of gods he's the lord of lords which was again a roman imperial title but he is he he has Marduk chasten Israel and and Israel must learn Marduk is a tool of the Lord as is chaos now again what I find so helpful with Peterson is I I find you know as a therapist he's used to dealing with people who are dealing with stuff and as a pastor I'm used to dealing with people who are dealing with stuff and he's found you know again following Jung that people's people's struggles are not just in their head and that's why you can't just give them a pill and then everything's fine um there's a man who used to sleep outside my door for about six years and he's bipolar he's in jail right now and he's a friend of mine and actually this is this is his bible he picked it out of a garbage can in the neighborhood and it's english and spanish so he left it here so he's my friend so I kept it but he's probably not going to get out of jail for a number of years for for what he did but where was I going with this um yeah so you deal with people and I Peterson's chaos imagery is is is in some ways pastoral care gold this is this is really helpful in terms of understanding what happens with people and I want to get into more of that in terms of the trans liminal video and and what is hell and and I'm also going to have to get in get into it at some point when we finally deal with Peterson and ontology because that's where a lot of this infer a lot of these conversations are going to get very very interesting and I know in terms of talking to people in the in the Facebook groups and and I do read on I do read on Reddit and read a lot of those conversations I'm I'm always grabbing signals because as Peterson say people are people are information herders so I'm grabbing this information and I'm and I'm asking questions about okay what does this mean how does this fit together so anyway Peterson's chaos theories are you know that these are pastoral gold because I see it all the time people descend into chaos people live in chaos and they're trying to bring order to their chaos and it and it isn't coming together well the Lord is the master of chaos well gosh what does that mean well well that that actually sets up the problem of evil which is a which is a huge challenge in Christianity and if you delve into Christianity you're going to see the problem of evil dealt with again and again that problem is only set up because the Hebrew God is such a high God and and you know I've had for example there's one dear woman who was a member of my church but she was you know her in terms of her background she was Pentecostal and she would say things like well God doesn't you know God doesn't let bad things come into my life that's the devil doing it oh okay and I she didn't have the she didn't have the philosophical she didn't have the interest in having a philosophical conversation with me about dualism that do you think Satan is kind of an adversary of the Lord do you think he's a match that that question gets really complicated in a lot of different ways but again the Bible is equipped to to talk about these things and the Bible gives us the language to talk about these things which is actually one of the points that David Brooks keeps trying to make in terms of his his questions about the United States and politics and so on and so forth but I'm not going to get into that so but this this idea of chaos this is this is pastoral gold but the Bible talks about chaos and deals with this conversation in a very interesting way and so now here Babylon is the Babylon is the bringer of chaos and what does that mean for Israel now normally what it would mean in terms of the polytheistic religious marketplace is that Israel now has to bow to Marduk Israel has to bow to the image and again you get into the book of Daniel and this is exactly what Nebuchadnezzar says when that when the band plays everyone must bow and Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego say nope ain't gonna do it and and Nebuchadnezzar says okay into the fiery furnace you go and they get into go into the fiery furnace and what happens there's four people in there well who's the fourth person and the one looks like the son of the gods well well what is that going on and then they're taken out of the fiery furnace and they don't even smell like smoke and their hair isn't isn't singed well well well what's what's going on in that story what is that story saying what is that story staying about chaos well the book of Genesis not the book of Genesis the book of Daniel is full of ordeals and again if you listen to my Sunday school series on Daniel I go through this the book of Daniel is all full of ordeals and what are ordeals you take something that is ordered and you throw it into chaos you take this supposed witch and you throw her into water and if she floats she's a witch and watch Monty Python on that but you take you take something that is ordered and you throw it into chaos you throw Daniel into a lion's den you throw Shadrach Meshach and Abednego into the fiery furnace you throw it into and you see what emerges out of chaos and Shadrach Meshach and Abednego emerge out of chaos unharmed why because their god is the god who masters chaos and Leviathan is his pet and Beomoth is his puppy and this is the god of the Hebrews and what does that mean in terms of pastoral care well you're going to have the problem of evil on one hand and you're going to have to say why is the lord allowing this chaos into my life well one answer is well you probably brought a lot of it on yourself and and that's why a good Calvinist usually begins okay what did I do not what did I do to deserve this but yeah I know I did a lot to deserve this okay but now what must I do and this is where religion gets its grit because now suddenly you have a savior who can engage chaos now just to bring things back into the modern realm it was very interesting for me during the gulf war when these pictures were coming out you know who did Saddam Hussein think he was he was Nebuchadnezzar he imagined and um how did that work out for him not terribly well and and what does that mean why why did he connect with that story why do we have to do that why do we connect with that story why do we connect with these stories why do we imagine that you know actually Saddam Hussein was a was a lousy Marduk and and in a sense you know Jordan Peterson we could say Jordan Peterson is a prophet and well it's actually after Saddam Hussein but he probably could have prophesied that Saddam Hussein was a terrible Marduk and um the the armies of chaos which were the United States blew in there and destroyed him but then um chaos descended upon the land and you know that history is is still unfolding so that's that's my treatment of I very much wanted to get into Ezekiel and I wanted to illustrate some of the ways that Peterson is helping me piece together the Bible not only how it works as a story but how the story connects with um connects with with the world and how it connects in my life and again as I had and I'll put the link of it I I had um last Sunday teaching my Sunday school class this epiphany why are the Hebrew prophets so repetitive well they are working out this dramatic upheaval which was well here's the funny thing whose story are we talking about is is Marduk how many temples does Marduk have in Sacramento how many how many people are worshiping Marduk in the world today well how many people are take the you know how many people are reading the Bible how many people are reading the Hebrew scriptures how many people are are looking at the Lord and saying the Lord he is God and so this this transformation that Israel does they should have simply adopted the polytheistic marketplace and said okay yeah we've been beaten we're the we're the under wolf and the mean wolf is over there and so okay yeah you beat me and and then the mean wolf again this is Peterson then the mean wolf says yeah yeah you're a you're a slob but you know we're Babylonians and we have the best culture anyway so come here and we'll educate you and this stuff doesn't change it just keeps happening again and again and again and again and we we look at this old book and we say oh we should dismiss it well no if you read this old book you might discover something about your life and it scales it it deals with politics it deals with metaphysics and it deals with your personal life and this is why I have absolutely no regrets that I've decided to spend my adult life and my career studying this book so thanks for watching leave a comment and hopefully one of these days I'll figure out enough to be able to make some short videos
