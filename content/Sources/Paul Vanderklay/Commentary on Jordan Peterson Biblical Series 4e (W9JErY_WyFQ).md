 Now some of you in my question about what you'd like to see me do expressed a real interest that I keep going with the commentary on the biblical series and I noticed that a lot of you in my video where I talked about you know whether you've kind of satiated with Jordan Peterson already, a number of you said well I'm waiting for the biblical series to continue so in some little snippets of time that I have and these I haven't done a lot of prep for I'm just going to let it run I sometimes wonder about why we like doing this and why you like the commentary and maybe part of me wonders if we don't just like not listening to this stuff alone and because I think probably many of us are listening to it alone and so well here we go let's listen to some more this is kind of an interesting section. Some other representations this one I like the one on the left that's paradise as a walled garden and that's what paradise means it's paradisa which is I don't remember the language it's it's it's a it's a these are these are really interesting images garden and why a walled garden well it goes back to the chaos order idea so this is where God puts man and woman after the creation in a walled garden well the walled garden. And I should note that you know why a walled garden this goes back to the chaos order idea what's what's been interesting about relistening to this now that I've been studying Jordan Peterson pretty intensively even before I started my videos but now especially after my videos you know this goes back to the the I they're in a walled garden because that expresses this thing that's that's in the world and again this comes up through us all is culture and order and the garden is nature and the idea is the proper human habitat is nature and culture in balance and so well we like gardens well why because well they're not completely covered with weeds and mosquitoes and black flies right and of course the definition of a weed is a plant that we don't want where it is so they're civilized a little bit but still within that civilization nature in its more benevolent guise is encouraged to flourish and people find that rejuvenating and I just finished I just finished in my CS Lewis track the video about nature versus supernature and so then you can ask the question of why what's our relationship with nature and and Peterson goes into this and I think this is one of things I really appreciate about it because he's quite honest about it we we have an interesting relationship with nature and and I was pondering this I was pondering this where on one hand you know we want organic food because we have the sense that we what our bodies need are what they were you see designed and then you're off into a designer what our bodies evolved for so on one hand we want natural foods or we want a paleo diet because you know we're hunter-gatherers and so we want you know green things that we could forage plus meat and then if we don't eat any of these processed grains or anything like that before the agricultural revolution then we will be natural then we will be healthy then somehow we will be optimal but yet I was I was thinking about one of the one of the debates this morning about our behavior and you say sociologically let's say men are aggressive all this was this was the thing about boys in trouble but you know we don't want toxic masculine masculinity okay well what do you mean by that it's interesting how kind of the organic conversation okay we should be and this is where our norms get involved we should be natural so therefore we ought to eat only these foods but our behavior should be natural it should be it should be like the chimps and this is where again Peterson talking about Jane Goodall and and you know kind of withholding some of that information because people wanted to believe kind of a romantic idea about chimps and if you go out on the internet and you look at people who have kept wild chimps or or raised chimps and part of the reason chimps are not domesticated animals when chimps attack people chimps attack people like they attack other chimps you know they will they will tend to you know attack the genitals they will tend to try and rip the face off and you know some some pretty horrendous stories but but right here we have the question well what is natural what is nature and what is why do we this is this this is the most puzzling thing here I said I was gonna let it run I wasn't gonna talk so much why on one hand do we feel ourselves a part of nature why on the other hand do we wish to transcend nature and again if we in fact mean that what on earth do we mean by that if there's nature and supernature so the idea that paradise the proper habitat of a human being is a is a walled garden is a good one and it's walled because well you want to keep things out right I mean raccoons for example you want to keep those things out man even though it's impossible and you know you don't you don't want there's got to be a story behind that raccoon reference well there's all sorts of things you don't want in your garden like snakes walls don't seem to be much use against them but the idea that paradise is a walled garden is is a an echo back to the chaos order idea walls culture right garden nature so the proper human habitat is a properly tended garden now the radical and again and proper proper always proper is within a frame of art so it's a it's a garden that we want it and so that garden is not natural that's that's proper to our desires left-leaning anti-theist environmentalists tend to make the case that the predations of the Western capitalist system are a consequence of the injunction that was delivered in Genesis by God to man to go out and dominate the earth David Suzuki has talked a lot about this by the way they believe that that statement has given rise to our inappropriate assumption that we have the right to exert control over the world and that that's what's turned us into these terrible predatory monsters sometimes described as cancers on the face of the earth or viruses that have inhabited the entire ecosystem who are doing nothing but one it wandering everywhere and wreaking havoc as rapidly as we possibly can which is another perspective on the essential element of humankind that I find absolutely deplorable I mean if you look at the historical record for example even casually you'll find out that as early as as late as the late 1800s 1895 thereabouts Thomas Huxley who was eldest Huxley's grandfather and a great defender of Darwin prepared a report for the British government on ocean sustainability and his conclusion was fish away guys man there's so many fish out there the oceans are so inexhaustible that no matter how hard humanity tried for for any number of years the probability that we could do more than put a dent in what was out there was zero now Huxley turned out to be wrong he didn't realize that our population was going to spike so dramatically partly because we got a little bit rich and our children stopped dying at the rate of like 60% before they were one years old and you know we actually managed to populate the you and of course who is killing our children nature and again Peterson we'll get into this and again I I think he does a good job of it earth with a few people but wasn't really until 1960 or so that we woke up to the fact that there were so many of us that we actually had to start paying attention to what we were doing to the planet and that's like what 50 years ago well we've just started to develop the technology of the wherewithal to understand that the whole world might be well considered a garden and we need to live inside the proper balance between culture and order or culture and and and chaos before that we were just trying not to die and usually very unsuccessfully so so I don't agree with that interpretation of the opening sections of Genesis I don't believe that it's given human being is the right to act as super predators on the planet I think that instead the proper environment for human beings is presented quite properly as a garden and that the role of people and that's explicitly stated in in the second story and Adam and Eve was to tend the garden and that means to make the proper decisions and to make sure that everything thrives and flourishes and so that it's good for the things that are living there that aren't just people but also good for the people too so fine I think we can we could least note that that's a slightly different take on the story than the than the ultimately cynical interpretation that's so commonly put forward today and I like I like Peterson's interpretation and it's it's really quite close to mine one of the things that I like to and if you watch some of my sermons and some of my teaching you'll notice that I get into this quite a bit because the the garden as I've spoken about in past visits in videos the garden is a royal garden and and for the Hebrews the garden is different from a field and and it's again it's it's a symbolic space and it's it's and I think Peterson you know it's a it's all it's a walled garden but it's the it's the royal palace for the great king and the gardener are the gardeners are there to tend the garden and properly would be defined as the owner of the garden would intend and so that again is why you have the the Genesis 1 representation that I you see I draw very regularly in my teaching you have the earth you have the firmament you have you know God's palace on top and and then the garden Eden which is this mountain Eden is the royal garden and Nebuchadnezzar if the gardeners came to Nebuchadnezzar and said you know we want to take this in a different direction Nebuchadnezzar wouldn't have you know if the Daniel version of Nebuchadnezzar is anywhere near what an ancient Near Eastern potentate would be and it seems to not be far off is that you know you don't just tell the king you want to take the garden in a new direction it's the king's garden and the king will destroy the gardener now now in this case the man and the woman are sent out into the field and and and what you have whereas before you had this alignment between the owner and the viceroy or the steward which is the man and the woman and then nature beneath now suddenly the man and the woman rebel against the owner and nature rebels against against its owner and you have this rebellion going on all up and down the chain of command now inside that walled garden is a couple of trees and Adam and Eve and some animals and all of that and unfortunately the tree happens to have a snake wrapped around it now that's an interesting thing we're going to talk about that a lot and the snake in both of these representations is no ordinary snake say it's got a human head and it's got a human head there too so whatever that snake is well let forget about that now it's helpful to also remind us that these pictures you say are these pictures in the Bible no does the snake in the Bible have a human head no these are these are representations of it for you know the particular artists for their time and place the the Genesis stories are extremely economical not a lot of details looking at this from a religious perspective like if you can just imagine that you're an anthropologist you've never seen this image before it's like what do you see well you see walls and you see something a fairly pleasant enclosure and then you see a tree and people are eating from the tree but the tree has a snake in it that has a human head and so then you might think well what's a snake with a human head and then you'd think well it's half snake and half human that's hardly revelatory it's just self-evident so whatever that snake is isn't just a snake it's snake and human or it's it's it's snake and partakes in whatever human beings are and that's very important so we'll continue we'll consider that later and you and and you know it's important also just to recognize here that that Peterson and his biblical series are dealing with the stories and he's not necessarily limiting himself to the biblical text but he's he's talking about the story as it goes through time and and in fact some of the interpretations of the stories see the same thing here and and you see in this particular version there's the head this one also has wings and so this is a winged snake sort of like a dragon and so it crawls on the ground like a reptile and it's got an aerial aspect or a spiritual aspect so here it's a snake which is like the lowest form of reptilian life say something that crawls on the ground it's something that's human and something that's spiritual at the same time and it inhabits the tree which look a lot like magic mushrooms by the way and you can look that up if you want that's quite an interesting little rabbit hole to wander down if you're curious about it but but there's an idea here too is that there was something in the garden at the beginning of time that was like a snake that was like a person that was like something that was winged it was something spiritual okay and again according to these pictures it's spiritual human and reptilian all at the same time and it's the animating spirit of the tree okay so keep that in mind and I'm not sure where that comes from thus the heavens and the earth were finished this is in relationship to Genesis 1 and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he read and again the the chapter the versification of the Bible comes far later and so the first occasion is is often in many places not ideal on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made that's wisdom in that one too I think the idea of the Sabbath you know because one of the things I've worked with a lot of people who were hyper conscientious and thing about hyper conscientious people is that they'll just work till they die and that's actually not very productive because then they're dead and they can't work and again the verses he just read are really from the first story they're from the Genesis one story not the two story but he just has a running commentary that's the style of these things and so what you have to do with hyper conscientious people is you have to say well I know you'd rather do nothing but work and maybe you're just as guilty as you can possibly be when you're not working but let's figure out what you're up to and what you're up to in all probability is the attempt to be productive in the least problematic longest sustaining possible manner and that might mean you have to take a rest and so one of the things I used to work with lawyers with people who had risen to the top of large law firms and they were hyper productive types and they're often you know trying to hit their impossible quota for yearly hours and and burning themselves to a frazzle as a consequence and one of the things that we used to do was they couldn't work fewer hours because that a day that just didn't work but what we did was we have them take more time off you know like a four-day weekend every two months or something that was plotted out into the future and then we track their billable hours which is their degree of productivity it would actually increase so that was so cool because you could take hard-working people and you could say look you know take a break why well because you'll be more productive if you take a break no that couldn't possibly be like I should just work flat out all the time it's like let's test that out you take a break now and then it's like well what happened was their productivity would increase often by 10% so there's a there's wisdom here too which is okay and this is alludes to the Adam and Eve story near the end well and this is an this is an interesting this is an interesting moment in terms of again I think why these why these why we're interested in why we're interested in these stories as wisdom and and this isn't just a Jordan Peterson thing a lot of Christians will look at these stories and say well this story is confirmed by science and yeah but that that you know you listen to that say oh we shouldn't work all the time and of course the number seven as I talked about in previous videos it's interesting that as opposed to the month they had a lunar month and they had the you know the solar year there's no there's no seven in nature that we find but here it comes in Genesis 1 and of course in the in the You just you yourself conscious you discover the future you have to work well then the question is how much should you work and one answer is you better bloody well work all the time because no matter how much work you do you're not solving your problems they're coming along man and you can stack up all the money you want you can stack up all the wealth you want it is not going to protect you in the final analysis so you better be hitting the ground running and you better run flat out all the time well what happens if you do that well then you die that's not a good solution so maybe you should rest and so how does that rest get instantiated well it's not easy to tell but one way to do it let's say conceptually is to say look even God had to rest one day a week and so you don't and again when I talked about rest rest is a in in terms of the the ancient Near East World we rest was a huge idea and an important idea and this is actually the fulfillment this is the climax of the Genesis one story and I treated this before but but it's also very interesting how I'll just keep it would have to be so presumptuous to assume that if God had to rest one day a week that maybe you know you are allowed to work non-stop without a break at all you know and I think our culture has slipped into that in quite a dangerous way because everything is open all the time and I mean I'm I find that just as convenient as the rest of you but you know it's so strange to talk to modern people because one of the things they always tell you we say well how are you and what do they always say they don't say good they don't say bad they say busy it's like yeah well okay this is where Genesis 2 starts and we finally got there these are the generations in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist and I'm surprised you didn't say anything about that verse that is a that is a fascinating verse because there you can see in that verse the the idea that that humans humanity's role is integral to the to the to the function of the environment and that's and that's interesting again because again I just did the video on nature and CS Lewis's chapter on nature the the second story begins here and it starts with that and you know there's there's nothing that well what do you mean things aren't growing some some have speculated that you know the Bible is a post agricultural revolution document in the sense that man Adam Adam is the gardener and he's a he's a farmer he's a man of the soil and Noah when you find him as a man of the soil and so I really wish Peterson hadn't just kind of jumped over that verse I'd really love to hear what he'd have to say about that from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul well you know there's some archaic thinking in there the breath is life right that's psyche that's spirit that's inspiration that's respiration that's that's all associates it's Pneuma like pneumatic tire it's it's breath and the reason that people associated life with breath well that's not so foolish you know I mean you're breathing man and something you do all the time and when you die you stop breathing and so the idea that there's something integral to life about breathing is a perfectly reasonable supposition and when you get into the Noah story what is saved is everything that has breath in it and that's what the Noah covenant is between it actually happens to be very true and no then to associate the act and I would have loved for him to talk about the the image here of of God making a man out of clay my name is Van der Kley we're of the clay and God breathes into it and and humanity is the the stuff of earth and the breath of God and that's just such a powerful image and I wish I wish Peterson had said it said something about that of creation with the act of first of all inspiration and respiration and and the breathing of life into something that was inanimate is is well what do you expect for a one-sentence description it's not a bad one-sentence description you know it's an incredible one-sentence description and say something about it so and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and Eden means well watered place and that's particularly relevant I suppose if you're a desert dweller right because the issue there is can you get I think Jonathan Peugeot does a does a nice job with it with the garden he goes into some of these things enough water to make things grow and so the the walled garden which is paradise is also Eden which is a well watered place and water has the element of chaos we already saw that in relationship to Genesis 1 where the underlying chaos was often assimilated symbolically to water and so the idea too is that a certain amount of chaos has to be brought into the order in order for it to be fruitful and you can see that in the form of of allowing in the water and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so two trees are marked out among the rest one is the tree of life and one is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now you know you know when you read something like that if you're thinking about it that you're in a metaphorical space now we've got to be careful about metaphors because you know I could say and did that the chaos order idea is a metaphor but then I also said well wait a second it's a metaphor but it's also what your brain is adapted to and so you know let's just not be pushing the idea that it's merely a metaphor too hard and the same thing is is here is happening here these are metaphors the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but that doesn't exactly mean that they're mere metaphors because sometimes as I mentioned before and if you have a set of things and you abstract out from them a common element you can make a strong case that the common element is more real than the set of things from which you abstracted it that's the whole utility of abstraction why would you bother with it otherwise if you can't take a set of things and say look there's something in common across this set of things that's more important than the differences between them then you wouldn't bother abstracting at all and so the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are abstractions now one of the questions is this is a tough one man I've been trying tried to figure out and you know I appreciate what Peterson says there because you know there's there's a lot of complaining about literalists with these stories and I understand the complaints but but here's here's something that's interesting sometimes not always sometimes literalists take the story more seriously than those who are working it as metaphor and that's that's not that's not a thing to miss in a conversation like this because the the intent of the story is for is for us to take it deadly seriously and and in fact what what the history of let's say the post modernist fundamentalist fight has been that literalists continue fundamentalist literalists continue to take this story very seriously and and modernists tend to over time walk away and I think that's again because modernist and fundamentalists what they have in common is an assumption about truth and history and reality and so when the when the modernists say well this is just metaphor then suddenly it's not history and they walk away from it whereas at least the literalists are staying with the story and so you know people give the literalists a hard time in this but hey the literalists are still taking the story seriously the modernists have walked away and I think for that reason you will see in some ways the enduring power of the literalists now whether or not they I think there are other issues with that camp I I don't think they're sufficiently thoughtful about the philosophy that they are assuming even in their protest but let's give them a little bit of credit because at least they're taking it seriously whereas all those people that say it's a metaphor the motivation behind saying it's a metaphor is often that well that's a metaphor we can walk away from this so then when you look at say pre-positivist church traditions like you know the reformation some of the reformational churches like mine or the really ancient churches like the the Roman Catholics and the and the Orthodox well they continue to be able to take the story seriously and yet can in some ways hold back the positivism and say you know that there's a mystery in terms of how we are to take this story but we are going to continue to find it authoritative for us even if you know the questions about literalism and history and symbolism are complicated. Figure out for a long time why a fruit and something you eat would be associated with the transformations of psychology because that's basically what happens in the Adam and Eve story. Why would it be something that you eat? Now Eric Neumann who was one of Jung's students had written a fair bit about this and got a fair ways with it and he said well you know we do have noted we've noticed forever that the act of eating especially if you're hungry especially if you're starving produces a rapid spiritual transformation right I mean some of you this is worth knowing you probably have a crabby partner or child because everyone does and one thing you might try is that if they get erratic during the day and you know get all volatile about nothing at all just give them something to eat really I'll tell you man this solves for I do this with my clinical clients all the time it's like they say well I fly off the handle at the littlest things it's like okay yeah just try this for a week when you're crabby and unreasonable eat a piece of cheese or eat a peanut butter sandwich eat something that's high protein high fat and then just wait 10 minutes and see if you're sane and you'll find out that you're saying after you eat so often that you just can't believe how crazy you are when you're hungry and if you watch some of these survival shows that are on TV you'll notice how people are eating what to us is the most disgusting stuff but then they'll be you know sometimes it'll taste bad but so they'll be just oh it's just amazed at how good it tastes well it's biology look here's it's really absolutely bloody remarkable so I'm telling you try this it'll it'll it'll it'll especially if you don't eat breakfast this will change your life and so here here's a practical bit of information for you too for all of you anti-social types who are going to end up in prison if you're in prison and you want to go on I just imagine prisoners watching Jordan Peterson I don't think they give them the internet parole okay so you have to go in front of the judge and tell them why you're not gonna do it again so here's the here's the deal doesn't really matter what you did and it doesn't really matter what you promise what matters is whether you see the judge before lunch or after lunch because if you see the judge after lunch the probability that you will get parole is 60% higher yeah right that is just like so never have an argument with your partner when you're hungry or when they're hungry especially if you want something from them it's like here's a sandwich they'll eat it then they'll be happy then you can manipulate them that's a good place to stop for me now because I've got to run and do some things but I wanted to at least put this in the can and because I know a lot number you said you know keep doing the biblical commentary so you know probably sometimes when I get some time and when he says something in particular that I want to do a deep dive on an excursus of sorts I'll do that but I'll also try and do some of these more running commentaries where I haven't I haven't done a lot of prep but I'm kind of listening to them I've listened to these things four or five times some of them already so I'm not unfamiliar with them but I don't have them memorized so let me know in the comments if if even just these kind of watching them with you is helpful
