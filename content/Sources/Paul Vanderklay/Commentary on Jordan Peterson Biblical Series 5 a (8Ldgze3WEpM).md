 Hi, this is Paul. It's been a while since I've done one of the biblical series. I was working through the Easter series Which is sort of like the biblical series But part of the reason I work this way as I'll explain is because of the learning process Will Schroeder I'm trying to remember his name Well Schroeder did an interesting video on how to remember everything you learn and I would argue that we don't really learn something if we Remember it and he goes into the point that right now we are inundated with information YouTube videos books audio books Stuff on TV movies we watch these things and then after we see them we say oh, yeah I know that but then five ten fifteen twenty minutes later We come back and we don't know it and the truth is you really don't know something until you can explain it to another person And he quotes Mortimer Adler the person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it Usually does not know what he thinks and this is true Just seeing something you have the illusory experience of imagining You know it but the test of whether you know it is can you articulate it yourself? Can you explain it to someone can you explain it to someone in simplified form so that they can understand it and pass it along? That's really the test and what we what we learn is that just reading a book once Probably won't get you there and just reading things again and again and again in serial succession Probably won't get you there one of the things I learned when I was in college was that a Lot of people would cram for tests I almost never crammed for tests because I figured out pretty quickly if I had had a good night's sleep I performed better on the test than if I crammed Part of that is because our Word I mean if you've watched my videos, we're not in control of ourselves We don't even know how the conscious mind works And so we have these mental minions this this Internal cloud of witnesses that is always watching and they absorb things and process things on their own and the conscious self that is Kind of in the foreground of our experience is is just one small part of the entire thing that is us And so learning is a process that often takes place over time And so if you really want to digest something Spend some time with it for a while then leave it alone and then come back to it and then leave it alone And then come back to it and leave it alone and what you begin to realize is that over time Within time you begin to integrate what you're learning into yourself now some of you might rightly say well This is going to limit what I can learn Yeah, but if you're not actually learning it you're you're really wasting your time now This is going to frustrate us because one of the things about human beings is that we The book of Ecclesiastes says God has placed eternity in our hearts We are in that sense hungry for eternity and we want to grasp everything but the truth is we are limited by time and space We are limited creatures We will only learn so much you only have access to so much and even especially now that we have Access to this amazing thing called the internet which is just brimming with information not all of it good obviously Which is brimming with information we imagine that well we can just learn and learn but the truth is most of the time We're not learning we are having this illusory experience of learning and I think will Schroeder's video goes into this quite well He has this little schema of short-term memory long-term memory and working memory and he notes That there seemed to be just a limited number of slots that we can walk around with in our heads with ideas and and there are Studies that talk that talk about this I remember one study I read you know they do these psychological Experiments where they would ask people they would give people like a seven-digit number and ask them to hold that in their head and then walk To another room and then give the person in the other room the seven-digit number But of course there's a little trick or a twist with a psychological experiment so they had a table set up in the hallway between there and They they had either a healthy snack like an apple or a less healthy snack like a cupcake or a piece of cake and The people that were holding things in their head Didn't have enough bandwidth to choose the healthy snack So they'd usually choose the unhealthy snack and and what that gets into the fact is that we are terribly bad multitaskers and what I mean by Multitasking is that we really can't focus on two things at once and that's a function of consciousness Well, we are our task switchers where we pause one task and we work to another and and that's where you have this working memory idea that they're just a certain number of Cubby holes in our brain where we can actually hold things and working memory and Be able to process them over time And so what's true if you really want to integrate something into your life is you have to walk around with it There are also studies that talk about how and I often do this when I go to the gym if I work on the stair thing I have something in my ears and Because I find that what I learn when I'm exercising goes in deeper than what I learn if I'm just sitting in my office Looking at a screen or reading a book So this is part of how we are embodied creatures and we're all knit together but this this this dynamic of working memory is really quite vital in terms of Asking yourself, you know, what would I like? Do I really want to learn that my? My one of my last physicals with my doctor He said, you know, we used to say you are what you eat now We say you are what you absorb which made the point that Even though our mental minions our internal cloud of witnesses is always observing and processing things that even our our conscious mind Doesn't have the capacity to capture or to recognize Because our conscious mind is always focused on that upon which we are conscious The working memory is in there, but that too is limited. We are limited creatures, which is why these powers of Communication these powers of community are and the powers of memory in terms of books and and Culture are really what make human beings so dramatically more powerful than Than any other creature in the world that we know we We grow as a community together So now recently a number of people have been asking me to you know Well Paul you have a YouTube channel and and people seem to be watching it and I found it And what if I want to do my own thing now? Some of you might think well don't tell people to do their own thing They're gonna be in competition with you. I think that is a long-term a counterproductive That is a counterproductive strategy for the human race. You might say well, it's it's it's very productive for me But I actually think that the more people that work on things if we're humble We can learn from each other because more minds are better than one mind So I do encourage people to start their own thing, but I give them a few guidelines It has to be something worth doing even if nobody else sees it a number of years ago when I started my blog I started it for multiple reasons one of which I wanted to have basically my pastor file cabinet on the internet So it was available to my phone So I could capture pictures So if I'm reading an article at home, I could throw it there instead of having What in the old days was a literal file cabinet where pastors would clip out news articles and file them under Subjects so that they could draw things for illustration if you've ever seen my blog leading church comm, you know It's a mess. I'm just I seem to be posting random things. Well, why well, it's my file cabinet And what I can do with a blog is I can search something and Hopefully find it and even then it's not a perfect thing because my my mind is a better my mind is still a better Capturer not in detail, but in in in small things than Then then even a then even a good search engine search engines are good But the mind the mind knows relevance and Google keeps track of it The mind knows relevance and Google keeps trying to get better and better at that but the mind does know relevance so What about biblical series get to the biblical series we will we will we will but my point is why I Work on a project and then I pause it and then I work on some other things and then I go back The biblical series. Okay. So my I just tracked myself, which is why I make PowerPoint So if you have something if you have something that's worth doing it's worth doing just for yourself and then you will keep doing it If your main goal of a thing is well, I want this to I want this to I want to make a career out of this. I want this to be my day job Okay, it's so go for it. But be warned there's just a limited number of slots out there for this kind of thing and you're competing in a pretty steep hierarchy and There's a lot of actors Working waitress jobs. It's just the way it is and there's a lot more people writing books than Than number one booksellers and Peterson makes this point about the Pareto distribution The odds for most of us is that we are not that exceptional and so we will not actually Rise above the bubble and be the lottery winners. We will probably work in And we will probably work in obscurity and Even even people who were great, you know, we might think of someone who had who did amazing things like Augustin or John Calvin or Martin Luther The Christian ones come to mind because I'm a pastor in their day, they weren't Augustin and John Calvin and Martin Luther they were Controversial pastors who got one degree of who got one degree of visibility But long after their death CS Lewis is the same way long after their death The value of their work became known and you may say well, that's not fair. I don't get to cash in on it Yeah, but that's the human condition. So do it for your own reasons It has to be something worth doing even if nobody else sees it Point to Multiproduce that's different from multitasking and what I mean by Multi-produces as much as possible kill two birds with one stone. So you might say well, you're making videos Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. That's not really a secret because I've said it a number of times I do videos because I'm learning Well Paul, why don't you do videos that would be more popular? Maybe I will maybe I'll play with some of those things Actually when I play with techniques to try to boost my subscribers It's usually because I want to learn if those techniques work. I Really don't believe this little project is going to displace my day job. I What two-thirds three-quarters through my career? I'm in my 50s, you know I've got another 10 15 20 years of ministry service had me so maybe I'm halfway 60% through my career. I Do this because I learn now you might say well, why would you learn sitting here talking to a microphone and a webcam? Because I do and I learned this back when I was blogging I spent years just writing and writing and writing and writing and hardly anybody read it And if you go to my blog, you'll find all kinds of first drafts of everything and I almost never edited anything I wrote just all first drafts because there's some people who are editors and some people who are drafters I'm a drafter. So I just wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote and it was tremendously helpful in terms of learning Because ultimately the thing that you have to steward most is yourself This is the the greatest gift you've been given and this is the gift again. I'm a Christian This is a gift that God has given me someday like the parable of the talents, I'm gonna stand before my God and Someone called me yesterday and Here's here's a little see this is how this is how you influenced me, right? And you know who I'm talking to doubt there in Arizona. You put that little bug in my head and my mental minions were listening but someday I will stand before my maker and be called to give an account for what I've done with my life and What my maker will say is I gave you talents What did you do with those talents and you don't want to be the steward who hid the talent? Because the steward who hid the talent gets tortured and killed And even his wealth is given to those who have more. This is the Pareto distribution This is what Peterson calls the the Matthew principle that if you've been given talents Invest them. Well, what does that mean? Well keep doing stuff So some of you who are watching my rough draft for Sunday or even going to my church channel and watching my sermons will note Your Peterson and your church stuff all is coming together And when the rebel wisdom guys were here Sunday, they saw that too there and if they had watched my Sunday school They would have even seen more of it because it's actually in my Sunday school lesson that I'm usually doing a lot of Processing and again, you might think well, well, aren't you there to serve your class? I am but here's the thing The better I am The better I can serve my church. Well, what does that mean? That means I need to keep learning and growing as a pastor and I'm gonna get back to the biblical series. Don't worry. I haven't abandoned it I do go off on tangents, but so does Jordan Peterson So if you don't like tangents, you're probably not interested in Jordan Peterson either. So If it's worth doing it's worth doing for yourself Multi produce always kill two birds with one stone if you can if you've got to do physical work and you're and you know It's that found time that Peterson talks about with audiobooks and YouTube's and podcasts. I'm always multi-producing now sometimes it's also important to have silence to to clear your head and to and to not have noise you have to You have to steward all these things because they all have their their places and their reasons and so Integrated into your day job if possible, that's Multi-producing two birds with one stone prioritize your growth and learning and that's the bottom line here because again Someday we'll be called to we all of us will okay. I'm a Christian. This is my narrative We will be called to give an account and they'll say Paul. What did you do with your life? Well, I played video games and I ate Cheetos and I I lived in my mother's basement. I Don't want to stand before I Don't want to stand before the maker of the universe and say yeah you gave me this life in this amazing time and place where we had relative food security and we had almost unlimited access to information and there were scholarships and faxes to go to school and where there were jobs where I could learn and grow and And all of this and I used all this for pure self-indulgence and I didn't pour into my neighbor and pour into myself and share Promiscuously whatever I'm learning with whoever is curious about listening So there's my youtube channel right there now you might say well Well, what does this have to do with the biblical series? I don't want to hear the same video twice Well, if you say that you haven't listened to anything that I've said already because the truth is Every time we listen to a video again, especially if it's separated by time, especially if we've been learning in between You're going to hear the video with different ears because there's the video there's the different life exerted circumstances I've been I've been thinking about some of my friends who have been complaining about Jordan Peterson's repetition that they they hear him talking about the same thing over and over again part of that dynamic is because he is expanding his audience and Like with just about everything in the in the world There's kind of a center of what we do and then we develop it there's theme and there's theme and variations and Those things work together in a rather important dynamic So Jordan Peterson when he goes out he'll be talking about the things that are most important to him And then as he imagines people are beginning to capture those things he will begin to expand This is what I do as a pastor There's kind of a center and then you grow in depth and you gain higher and higher resolution of knowledge as you as you learn and as you grow now so I'm gonna come back to the biblical series and actually, I was listening to some of biblical series one again last night because I was thinking and Noticing as I was thinking so I always watch myself when I'm learning to I was noticing as I was thinking how I Hear him differently now because when I first started listening to the biblical series, I just beginning I just begun listening to Jordan Peterson One of the things that is a struggle as a pastor especially a pastor in one pulpit for a long time My grandfather was kind of a typical CRC minister of his day Where he would stay at one church for four to six years and then it would go to another church and then another church and Pastors would sometimes talk about turning the barrel over in other words you have all of these ideas and you put them out there and Well, then you're done and I often have the case I I've been teaching a kind of a lay ministry group for quite a few years and people come into that group because they want To learn theology and they want to learn the Bible and many of them want to preach and so we'll do some Preparation and we'll all help them work on their first sermon and they'll get their first sermon done and they're like, oh And then the terror struck What am I gonna do for the next sermon and the reason is they've been sitting on this egg and it's just been growing and growing And growing and they preach it and they thought well, what do I have next? well, this is in many ways where the Bible comes in and where the Enduring stable nature of the Bible that I talked about in my last video the enduring stable nature of the Bible is really helpful because what the Bible gives you are a Baseline for conversations with millions of people over thousands of years and as Peterson notes Which is something that ever every good preacher notices the Bible is inexhaustible You go back to these stories again and again and again and sometimes especially certain stories like Palm Sunday Certain liturgical events you go back to them and it's like I got to preach on Palm Sunday again Oh, I need a new aspect on Palm Sunday Palm Sunday has depth but it is not the deepest thing It's easier to go back and do Easter again and again and again because Easter just keeps going down and there are many things like that in the Bible and this is part of the reason that Let's say so Jordan Peterson did 15 15 lectures on the book of Genesis He barely scratched the surface he could go back and do another 15 lectures on the book of Genesis But actually what he should do is kind of keep going and do Exodus after Exodus He could go back to Genesis He's gonna have to figure out what to do with the rest of the Pentateuch good luck buck. Oh Pentateuch is no small thing having to deal with those laws and the ceremonies and actually I'm very excited to see what Peterson does with it I'm I'm a little nervous that he'll dodge a lot of it because it's really really hard Number of years ago, I've been kind of preaching through the Bible serially I came up to Leviticus and I thought how on earth am I gonna deal with this book? I had to really dig in but it was more than fruitful to dig into the book of Leviticus because digging into that book afforded me a lot of the foundations that I have for Understanding the sacrificial system and understanding sacrifice, etc, etc. So The Bible is a really good The Bible is a really good book to just keep coming back to you might say Christians will say well die I read it every day. I read it for devotions I read the Psalms every day and monks have been doing this for years and Christians have been doing this for years you keep reading the Bible over and over and you keep seeing new things and you keep going deeper and This is why? Why is the Bible the most popular book in all of human history? Nothing even close to it why? Well, obviously because people have found it useful or what have they found it useful for they found it useful for all kinds of things so they keep going back to it and they keep reading it and they keep learning more and you might think well That will make you simplistic. Well, if you think that will make you simplistic you've obviously never done it because even if you have a fairly simplistic Christianity that has a lot of real clear answers to a very narrow set of questions You start reading that Bible and you start studying it carefully It's all gonna get way more complicated because the Bible is anything but simplistic now skeptics might say it's incoherent It's not incoherent thousands and thousands actually millions of people but thousands and thousands of scholars that have been studying this book for For two thousand plus years go back into the Old Testament and it has not been exhausted and every year You know, you know, these might look like a lot of books this is nothing Compared to what is out there on the Bible. Yeah, not all of it. Good. Absolutely a lot of it Contradictory and in conversation with each other. Absolutely, but that's the process That's the process by which we grow and learn and it is in many ways kind of an evolutionary process And that again as I said in my last video is why you need a stable baseline And then why you need more flexible layers above it that actually allow you to process that stable baseline so this is why I go back to the the biblical series and Let's jump into some of it You don't do dumb dumb nope, no start the beginning other people really I Says lecture five One-third of the way through I get a lot of mail And I don't know where I got this. I've been a lot of different places in the last week and this showed up He hasn't begun to go to different places yet See, this is the fun of doing it a year late because we know a lot of his life since then and yeah He hasn't begun going to different places. Yeah, look at his look at his book tour sometime And you know sometimes every night a different city going through the Midwest He hasn't begun to go to places at one of them and I'm going to read it to you I have no idea what to make of it It's written in a female hand So that's about all I can tell but there's no address or name on it This isn't a question, but a comment or more accurately perhaps a message I Spent this past weekend in an ayahuasca ceremony Which for those of you who don't know is a South American visionary plant medicine some of you may roll your eyes at this But ayahuasca brings you into direct contact with the archetypal realm of being users of this medicine Initiates I should say refer to ayahuasca as she Because the spirit of the plant is decidedly feminine an encounter with ayahuasca is an encounter with the great mother of creation The goddess the void from which all things come the feminine counterpart of logos Dr.. Peterson you appeared in one of my ayahuasca visions Might account for why I've been rather fatigued lately Dr.. Peterson you appeared in one of my ayahuasca visions, and I asked Asked her who is Jordan Peterson? What is he doing which is something? I'd really like to know as well and She responded with crystalline clarity quote Here he is here to invoke and initiate the divine masculine principle on earth at this time I have a friend who I really want to do a video with YouTube is a place for people with little to lose and my friend has a lot my friend is as a PhD in neuropsychology and He's got a lot of he's got a lot of pretty detailed and when I mentioned people on these videos You you know who you are because you come back to me say you were talking about me as a yeah was And I'd really I'd really like to do a video with him about the psychedelics The rebel wisdom guys They did a little tease of the video they're doing about me that's coming out soon, but most of the video was about psychedelics and This is an area. I know almost nothing about because I'm a Christian foreign minister for pete's sake. I don't do psychedelic drugs So Yeah, I then maybe I'll be able to do a video with my friend and he'll be be willing to talk about not only psychedelic drugs, but But drugs that are used for I have a couple of really interesting guys at my meetup Maybe I should do a video with the three of them that would be and yeah, you know, I don't mean Matt and Fresno I mean, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna Docs people but you know, um who always drives up to my my meetup from Fresno Maybe I should maybe the three of us should do a video and but here's the problem with YouTube Is that if you have some standing in a professional field? It might not be YouTube going on to YouTube and just blabbing your ideas about something is not a safe thing And the bigger my channel goes the more the more danger there is in For me about being accountable for the words that I say and sometimes I say things that I think They've said that here's the thing. It's on video. You can play it back. You can all kinds of things can happen again, Peterson is a testimony to this because Well again, if you look at my friend Matt from Fresno and he's Figuring out what he wants to do with his video with what Peterson Peterson let him use it I mean Peterson's more aware of the video than he is of the video And I'm learning this lesson too as I go So, yeah psychedelics a number of people write me and ask me about it I My main my main stance is caution That seems to be Peterson's I don't know enough about it I Don't know enough about it I'll leave it at that So I'm up here to thank you deeply and profoundly on behalf of the great mother herself the goddess the divine feminine principle who has been eagerly awaiting the awakening of the masculine principle into divinity and service My friend also did a lot of work in you so he would be fun with this too So so think about it, you know who you you hear me, you know what? I'm you know what I'm thinking about Let me know it's thanks. So You know get a letter like that every day Actually, I get a letter too like that every day So, you know what went through my head when I read this and this is of course a completely crazy parallel but You know one of the things I learned to do as a psychotherapist was just to tell people Who were talking to me what came into my head? It isn't what I'm thinking exactly because that's not exactly the same thing, you know What comes into your head is more like a dream. It comes unbidden. It's like your imagination. I Get this thinking there seems to be like a voluntary element of that right? I mean some of who This this I think is some of what Sam Harris talks about in terms of reason reasoning is thinking I think what Peterson is saying here and the the mental men the mental minions the the union internal cloud of witnesses, you know, I've Spun out a variety of names for this. I think it's more of what Peterson's talking about he knows how we think but it seems partly voluntary at least and Young thought about it Carl Jung thought about it like a dialogue between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind There was a constant continual dialogue But when things just pop into your mind, it's it's not much different than walking into a room having something there Which is an observation I also derived from Jung by the way Because he pointed out quite rightly that people don't really think that thoughts appear to them And that's a really important thought I think One of the things that Peterson has changed in me is that I've got a much deeper awareness for how mysterious my mind is and And I only made that you can think because you can take the thoughts that appear to you and then you can subject them to criticism and the lab and So and this is in a sense colonizing our thoughts That's what that's what reason does so on instead of just assuming that they're true right off the bat But people often don't do that. They just something just pops into their head and then they assume that it's true Anyways one of the things that I tend to do in psychotherapy is just to tell people what pops into my head because Well Well, you've been in psychotherapy with about a million people now, so because you're telling people what pops into your head why? Because then the person that is talking to me gets one person's untrammeled Opinion not even that reaction not opinion. It's not really an opinion I don't think an opinion maybe is what I think later, and there's this personal flavor to it what popped into my head Was the story about Socrates you know He had this when he was being put on trial by the Athenians for corrupting the nation's youth Some Now you'll notice if you're watching me in the little video which probably shouldn't I am I am multitasking I am which is really tasks switching. I've heard this video a number of times and so I'm Yeah, I'm doing what I tell you it do I Multi produce I've been accused of by the way Although it's not self-evident to me that it's me doing the corrupting He said that somebody had asked him once Had asked the Delphic Oracle once and the Delphic Oracle was this Retreat that you could go to if you were an ancient Greek citizen and you'd You'd be there, and you'd have a dream, and then you'd go ask the Delphic Oracle to interpret it And nobody really knows what was up with the Delphic Oracle Today how that worked exactly, but she would interpret your dream in any case And somebody once asked her who the wisest man in Greece was and The Delphic Oracle said it was Socrates because he knew he didn't know anything That's essentially the story not popped into my mind. It's a crazy comparison, but You know I have a crazy mind, so I guess that's how it works out Yes, you do Now one of the things I'm going to do today Which I haven't done before is I'm going to read the book Which I haven't done before is I'm going to read you a little bit of I told you I finished my book last week And I haven't read it read it to anyone And of course now we know the importance this book will have Because then we heard him talking about the book. This is kind of what's fun about time shifting I've given it to a couple of friends to review one person in particular Screenwriter named Greg Hurwitz has been unbelievably Helpful he's so fast and so sharp at this sort of thing and I can send him like a 20 page dense 20 page Manuscript and he'll rip it to shreds and send it back to me in like 90 minutes. It's just unbelievable He's so good at that. He's been very helpful, but I haven't No one else has seen it apart from my editor, and I haven't read it to anyone so but some of it seemed particularly appropriate for tonight's lecture So I thought I would start the lecture tonight by reading a little bit of it, and it's it's from a chapter It's on the issue of sacrifice as such this is Abraham and Isaac. This is a very strange Old Testament story, right? This is one of the stories Now sacrifice again. It's an important theme in the book And it's an important theme in his work and we'll talk more about that It's contained in the Old Testament that makes modern people think that maybe we should just not have that punch to do with the Old Testament per se and at all and especially with regards and maybe we shouldn't have anything to do with the God of the Old Testament Either because I mean as far as Abraham is concerned God tells him to sacrifice his own son now it turns out that God was just kidding So to speak you know I'm obviously being flippant, but you know it does raise the question And if you've followed my stuff recently been doing a lot more talking about human sacrifice and that came up in the Peterson Sam Harris Conversations in Vancouver that have yet to be released publicly, but you can find some bootleg versions What do you make of a divine being who would who would? require such thing such a thing or Conversely, what do you make of Abraham who would have such delusions either way? It's a little hard on the What would you call I? Don't know if we can critique Abraham in this given the fact that human sacrifice as I've said before was nearly ubiquitous And for the most part biblical characters are not exemplars they are if They are they are not exemplars as being way above us as much as they are exemplars as being us Modern believability and moral integrity of the Old Testament But these are very very strange stories, and they're not what they seem to be or they are but and they're more so We're going to talk a lot about sacrifice tonight, and here's some of the things that I've been thinking about sacrifice So this is from this book is called 12 rules for life an antidote for chaos and it's coming out in January Which I think I mentioned and this is from rule 7 which is do what is meaningful not what is expedient? And this will be the chapter that he reads in his Easter videos as well, and so here's here's some Over the writing I've been doing over the last three years on the on the motif of sacrifice. I'll start with just a brief Remember when I said do things even if you think no one will read them well he started this book before he knew obviously it was going to be a Tremendous seller, so if you don't do it if you don't start it that never happens before I read this It took me a long time to understand what was meant in the Old Testament by sacrifice Which is strange because once I figured it out it seemed bloody obvious it seemed like oh, yeah, obviously that's what it means but Lots of times if you figure something out correctly it seems self-evident as soon as you figured it out correctly Well we'll see how that goes, but you know it seemed to work for me anyways um I I knew that of course at least implicitly I knew of the modern usage of the idea of sacrifice everyone understands that motif is that if you want to make things better in the future then you start make sacrifices in the present and Maybe you even do that multi-generationally in fact you most definitely I would say that's really particularly typical of Immigrants right because immigrants Often come from terrible places and have to undergo terrible things to come to a new community where they get a rough Reception and have a hard time getting their life going and a big part of the reason that they do it is to make their lives of their children and Their children's lives and their children's lives And luckily when they come to Canada usually given where they came from that actually works because where they came from is worse And here is better even though no you know immigrants often have to struggle to to get on their feet Now this word sacrifice goes in some different directions and Again if you look at my video that I did on the sim the biblical symbolism of sacrifice I'd say that's going down this is sacrifice going out or coming up to us. This is the word sacrifice that has become abstracted In terms of our lives, so when we say I made a sacrifice we are using that in a sense as a metaphor because the literal understanding of that word is an Alternative meaning of the word sacrifice is a metaphor for the word sacrifice And it's a metaphor for the word sacrifice Because the literal understanding of that word is an altar and a fire and a you're acting out a relationship with a deity and This would obviously be the kind of thing that Sam Harris says we should knock out this part of the problem that Sam Harris has is that Are you going to lose the word sacrifice and all that it communicates For the sake of knocking out that acting that ancient acting out Drama of it now. He said no you can keep the word, but here's the problem Words connect us to the past Jeffrey quackin bush has been Writing me and I just got a note that he had written something else that someone else saw and he's been engaging Peterson in terms of this metaphorical truth thing and Jeff writes so Jeff if you're watching this Jeff Jeff writes Jeff's a really smart guy and He writes me emails that I sit and I read and I think oh this is This is hard to understand but sometimes sometimes people write something that's hard to understand because it's incoherent when I read his Emails it's like this isn't hard to understand because it's incoherent it's hard to understand because I don't know any of this and I have to learn this and and so there's a relationship between And I don't know if Peterson has has quite Mapped this all out. Well, yeah but if you go back through Peterson's things where first we act things out and that would be building the altar And there would be that would be building the altar and Setting the you know figuring out putting the fire in there and Killing the animal or the or whatever it is You're going to sacrifice and putting it on there and burning it having it create the smell again Peterson when he was in Sacramento Talked about the resurrection and talked about how one of his criteria for that which is real It has to be real. Let's say, you know to our five senses It has to be real in our relational universe and someone in the comment section mentioned the The great chain of being which I think is helpful in that conversation, but it's not exactly what I'm talking about It's it's real in the sense that So here's a here's a little wall hanging that one of my parishioners gave me before she moved back east That has a certain amount of reality to do with this poster Means means a lot to me because after I started making videos and you know who you are Because I know who watch this he shows up at my church after I started making videos and he gave me this poster and this is the first time he had ever been in church and That meant a lot to me. And so this this poster not only is kind of a fun joke about Jordan Peterson But it also and Peterson and Sam Harris go into this with the cup that maybe or maybe not Elton John drank out of so this poster has Reality and that I can see it. I can touch it. I can if I lick it It's kind of dusty because my office is very very dirty But this poster this poster is is real in the sense that Sam Harris says but it also has some realities attached to it This is what Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson talk about some realities that are attached to it that This has a relational reality because my friend gave it to me And so now this is now because he went out of his way to give me a gift this poster becomes a relational bond now, let's say and I don't think this is gonna happen because This is a tremendously nice guy and he really is dear to me But if let's say he and I would have a falling out then this poster would add layers of resonance so So this is where okay so you have a sacrifice you have the altar and you have the The the victim and you have the fire and you have the sacrifice and then that that gets Transmitted into mind and so other things get attached to sacrifice and so when when my friend's mother You know stays on top of him because he's a young black boy in Watts and and Make sure he gets good grades and make sure he doesn't get have the wrong friends and when she she Hounds him growing up and she sacrificed and she pinches pennies so that he can go to college Well that sacrifice as well as the altar is sacrifice And so now Peterson here is is isn't really laying out the connection there But again as we listen to Peterson if you take all of the different elements of Peterson and you put it together All of these connections are there. So now when we get to the conversation with Sam Harris When we get to the conversation with Sam Harris and Sam Harris says well we can keep the word sacrifice for My friend's mother sacrificing to put him through school because that's the kind of universe that Sam Harris doesn't think is is spooky or or Or spiritual or anything like that But we we're gonna get rid of this other archaic sacrifice, and you just have to ask Can you really pull this universe apart like that? in other words We all know what happens when words get disconnected from their histories because that that happens naturally the histories get forgotten and the word continues and and the word continues to live because in a sense Is a parasite that thrives off of its host and again The emails I get from people He's really get into my noodle and really twist my mind some of them So what are words and how do they work and and how do they relate to truth and how? What is this thing that we're doing called speaking and how does this relate to mind? I mean, this is this is enormously complex Yet it is something that two-year-olds and four-year-olds figure out how to do and so if you move the sacrifice and you just Have the word in it's a abstraction and you talk about my I always point over here because her picture is up on my bulletin board because because that's precious to me because again, it's from another friend and You know someone well, it's not the ring of Mordor. Okay, but it is precious to me Because he's my friend and he asked me to do the eulogy for his mother Because we've we've had a friendship for a long time so all of these things come together so that sacrifice versus the altar and the sacrifice and so all of this comes together and so Peterson is kind of working on the top level and part of the reason I did my video on the symbolism of sacrifice was because The abstraction Something of the historical physical relational is present in the abstraction and so that tie is not easily severed and maintains its importance because That tie lives within a host of other words which also have their ties And so even if one in the middle kind of gets disconnected The ties will continue to those other words and this is why we look at etymologies for words and why as As one of the one of my meetup friends came and gave me this book about words English synonyms because the the synonyms Tie these words together and you might say well, I'm going to Divorce the stone altar animal human sacrifice From my friend's mother sacrificing her life for the sake of her son now Peterson's going to go much more into the future because that's where he goes in this and he goes there in the Easter thing and he goes there and and 12 rules for life, but the synonyms connect that with all the other Words and in fact this whole thing just grows organically even as it arises from the The physical Grows abstractly and it all gets connected and then those things are on top and then they go down into the physical as They impact our lives and shape our hierarchies and as all of this stuff begins to fit together And the funny thing about these videos where I do commentary is that I always get comments like You keep interrupting him and it's not like you're interrupting him You keep interrupting him and it's like, you know, but a half a million people have seen the video and his video is primary Why would you watch my video if all you want to do is hear him? Skip my video unsubscribe from my channel because you're wasting your time. I Always found that hilarious with these commentary videos because people are like no he's a lot smarter than you so you should shut up Well, then don't watch my channel Anyway, sorry, dr Peterson you may continue to learn a new language and become inculturated and face the fact that they're not part of the mainstream culture And well, you know many of you know the whole story So the idea that you make sacrifices for the future and you make sacrifices for your children and that's Everyone understands that and it's part of being responsible and mature and shouldering the burden of being properly and you do that For yourself too, if you're disciplined in fact, that's almost what? Okay, so I'm doing to Peterson what he says he does to his clients. So so here's the thing. So Sam Harris would say this This this building the stone and putting the animal and killing it, you know Obviously that's a replacement for a human sacrifice and Peterson will talk about the race between the mother and child in terms of That's actually the language he uses in the book. He doesn't quite have that set yet by this point I don't think but so Sam Harris says well This is a this is an abomination that happens in the in the altar and this is all the kinds of stuff We have to get rid of and again, I'm not I'm not Suggesting we start building altars and when I put an animal on an altar It's called a barbecue and it's in its in its meat I enjoy eating and it is a fragrant offering to me. But here's the thing you can't just Disembodied this stuff and have it go away Sam It's not how we work you're not just going to lose This is Peterson's point in this whole effort that we get to this abstraction of the mother of Of the mother of this young black child in Watts and LA growing up in the he's a little older than I am late 50s early 60s That connects there and you're not going to sever that connection without loss and this is how in a sense we're tied to our ancestors and and actually what we're doing in church is Someone walks into church and says well, I don't understand what's all is going on now. That's right That's because thousands of years have been built into what we're doing You might say yeah, but yeah, there's a lot of old people in church, but nobody's thousands of years old But this is the mystery of human civilization where we are all doing this together And yes, we stand on the shoulders of past generations and on and on and on we go and in a sense What the materialists want to do is just kind of wipe out the bottom and say well, we don't need that anymore Is it that we don't need it or it's functioning differently as we continue to progress and this is this is actually What one vision of science is that I don't have to go back and prove all of the math and all of the theorems that Are are pretty solid because that gets constructed into a tower of sorts into a hierarchy and and off we go discipline means it discipline means that you're capable of making sacrifices because You're not disciplined if you just do something you want more rather than something that you're doing. That's not discipline Maybe that works and great if your life is working out that way great man, but that isn't that isn't discipline This is plain is when you want to do something right now and instead you think no I'm gonna forestall my Gratification maybe forever, but certainly for a very long period of time medium to long period of time And you concentrate on something that you think will bear fruit in the medium to long run and so you look into the future and you decide that and Sorry, dr. Peterson to interrupt you again, but that's why I do these videos the discipline of Sac and he's just you just might have noticed he said sacrifice something even indefinitely and The number of comments are say well you talk about the resurrection a lot. Yes, I do The book of Romans says Present yourselves as living sacrifices wholly unacceptable to God for this is your spiritual worship. What does that mean? Well, that's well, where does Paul get that idea gets it from Jesus Well, what did Jesus do Jesus gives his life and that's why what poor Peterson say this is archetypal You can't get beyond it. It's at the limit. Okay Why so other people have mentioned Rodney Stark and I have read some of Rodney Stark's books I've got some of them here probably Rodney Stark noted that part of the reason Christianity grew in the Roman Empire was because when a plague would hit a town everyone would leave but Christians would stay and care for the plague victims and Allah Sam Harris Christians would stay and care for the plague victims Christians don't say yeah, we're gonna stay and care for the plague victims and that means we're excluded from suffering now So Christians died with the plague victims, but some of those this is Darwin some of those victims survived And if your family abandoned you when you got sick to try and save themselves, you might say well, that's reasonable I can understand why they did it But someone did the unreasonable thing of coming and caring for you at the risk and even at the cost of their life If you survived the plague, how would you feel about that person? how would you feel about that person's beliefs and and this is where we get into the question of That which we act out is more real than what we say And this is where Christian hypocrisy comes because I can think I can imagine the really good I can articulate the very good less Well, then I can imagine it and I can act it out in my life less Well, then I can articulate it sometimes i'll do something and you'll you'll just Stumble across being good. You will have done something that It unintentionally was dramatically better than you could even articulate those kinds of things happen and praise god for those kind of things But well, I just probably offended some people. Sorry about that This is This is how this works and and so What the christian life actually is and again sam harris would be really upset by this is we say I'm going to be a living sacrifice and and this this you get a lot of pushback in the christian church, too because Sometimes the line between this and other important lines gets thin And so this is why we have each other and this is why You look for wise people to talk to to to help make decisions about about really hard things but We should give our lives for each other And we do this Daily we give our time for each other This is so I delay gratification now now It could be now peterson is right. There's could be lots of motives motives in me, but why not be a hedonist? Why not say you only live once yolo, why not say I need my best life now Well, if you believe in the resurrection and you believe the resurrection is the conscious The conscious endurance of the thing that is me Into a reembodied state into the age to come into a new life and a new world Well, I can sacrifice for that just like My friend's mother sacrificed so he could go to college and then his children the sacrifice of I don't know if I should out them the sacrifice of that dear saintly woman Sent his family on a trajectory in a sense we'll talk about human sacrifice my great-great-grandfather My great-grandfather In a sense risked his son my great-grandfather When he was 18 year olds and 18 year old 18 years old and he put him on a boat from rotterdam To ellis island I think about putting my 18 year old on a boat going halfway across the world to a land I don't know in a language. I don't know and I think well my wife would scream I might be more tempted but that's the father mother thing, but my wife would say I'm not letting my baby go This is where you get into jordan peterson a little bit later in this video where he talks about And that that's a powerful section in this video where mary offering her son. Well, why should you have a baby in this world? And see now what's interesting about these biblical series is that he starts out with all these things and they think these are Unconnected but they're not really unconnected because in his mental minions they are connected and so He's heading towards sacrifice and again for jordan peterson Sacrifice is is in some ways the closest he gets to the ontology of god so far in his materials because Why do we sacrifice because we're watching each other and we see that it works and of course for a pragmatist That's a really big deal by making today a little less impulsively pleasurable Shall we say you'll make tomorrow a little bit more secure and productive and then you actually do it too and that's Difficult, you know and we discussed last week Adam and eve's discovery of the future and And and the revelation of the possibility of the future including the possibility of tragedy and suffering in the future and and it's our knowledge of the possibility of tragedy and suffering in the future that motivates us to Sacrifice in the present so that we can reduce the unnecessary anxiety and uncertainty and pain that awaits us now That's a negative way of putting it We're also doing it so that you know We can have some joy and we can make life better in all of that and and that's not trivial but the the fundamental And make next generations better and for a christian make your life in the age to come better. So so yesterday I got a phone call from from someone who And now i'm not encouraging a lot of you to find my number and call me necessarily I got a couple of phone calls lately, which is fine because this week I because of my wife's schedule I actually had a little bit more time And I get calls and I can take them sometimes if my life gets busy I get overwhelmed and it's hard to write back on emails and to And to do that, but the two phone calls that one I just kind of went into my little Advice about just do it earlier and the other phone call was was from a christian and from a from a house church pastor who? Who actually has written a pretty popular song And so i'll encourage my my church to be very faithful It's ccli because we've sang his song for years in the in the church and he he called me from his home in arizona and he has a house church and he was And he was a little he's a little disturbed that I don't talk enough about judgment and judgment day and part of That's that's a very big conversation Part of what i'm doing with these videos is I am trying to talk to different audiences and one of the things that I have noted from my friends in the christian world is that they are telling me You are you are able to talk to people outside the church a lot better than The church is doing and that's something I praise god for But it comes at a cost the the shape of how christians talk to each other Are within a community Now when someone comes to our jordan peterson meetup and they've maybe watched There may be more into meetups than jordan peterson and they maybe watch just a little bit of his His stuff when they come to a meetup, they very quickly Realize that the people at our jordan peterson meetup are hardcore Some of the people in this meetup have literally watched every video he has made multiple times, okay? You know who you are To just walk into that The people in this group are speaking a different language. I mean they can quote jordan peterson youtube video and verse and So so now you have a bubble now what that bubble affords is a lot of really intense community and conversations You can go deep because you're all speaking the same language So you've got kind of the common tongue and then you've got all these little sub communities. Well Churches are very powerful sub communities And language and traditions and odds and norms all develop within them And so part of what is risky for me Is that i'm quite publicly talking to people like nathan because people will listen to what I say and they'll say You shouldn't talk that way And the truth is I wouldn't talk that way within a church probably But in order for me and nathan to have a productive conversation, I need to be able to speak another language And these languages unlike what everybody imagines that oh languages are just these Just these communication techniques that allow people from different rooms to talk no no Just like I said with sacrifice there's stuff that gets connected way down deep and so if I say something to Nathan in a way that violates something that We tend to have in a christian context I can get in trouble because I am under vows I'm a christian minister in the christian reform church What that means is that I am accountable to an extended community of a quarter million people in the united states and canada So maybe I shouldn't be making youtube videos well Maybe i'll get in trouble for some of the things I say on youtube. That's possibility But I risk that why do I risk that? Well because And this is the this is the difference between a religion and an ideology religion has is multifaceted developed over Over very long periods of time that much better incorporates the tremendously complex world that we live within so not only do I have not only do I have a Not only do I have an obligation to the christians within their subset I also have obligations to Because of the missional nature of christianity I have obligations to the rest of the world And that impacts the way I talk and i'm strategic about the way I talk Now christians might listen to this and say there are certain themes that are very prominent within especially my little christian circle that aren't necessarily prominent within yours and that's part of the it's partly because Not only is christianity and the church one big group But there are all these tiny little subsets within it and all of these subsets within it reflect the competing the competing natures of all the language between them and so armenians not armenians armenians might hear what I say and say he's too calvinist Some calvinists will listen to me and say he's too armenian Someone just pointed out a video that's done by a guy in texas that has a lot of beard and he's wearing a cap Probably because he's bald and I guess I could I could represent here John calvin calvin college calvin college grand rapids michigan calvin calvin sing we all to the He was very much trying to kind of take apart the intellectual dark web in terms of well he was Judging them according to the standards of his subgroup Well, this is natural for all of us. We all judge This is natural for all of us. We all judge each other according to the standards of our subgroup even the subgroup of our our mental minions so But in order to have conversations broadly You're going to have to Take some risks with one thing in order to reach someone else. I've been continuing to read through and he writes Really wonderful biography of the apostle paul. I'm really enjoying that book But paul got himself into trouble with The judiizers as paul calls them christianity was trying to figure out how jewish How much of how to modulate the old testament? That's really what that conversation was about do people need to be circumcised do Gentile converts need to follow dietary laws so In other words, so this I got a call from from someone yesterday and he was concerned that I wasn't Forefronting enough Something that I talked about a little bit earlier in this video which was the the need to The need to keep in the forefront of our minds The accountability that god will call us to and as I mentioned in my video yesterday and as I mentioned to this person it's very interesting when you read the new testament because Jesus talks about hell more than anybody else Jesus talks about hell more than anybody else and if you listen to my sermon hell, gehanna, hades That's a complicated conversation But jesus talks about judgment more than anybody else now. This is really interesting Jesus is very archetypal because on the other hand it's these discordant excellencies that jesus has he is at one hand Seemingly the most tolerant person and on the other hand seeming the most seemingly the most judgmental and he's that in the same time Well, how do you do that because usually we find a person who's simply judgmental and we find a person who's simply accepting Jesus manages to do both. Well, how does he manage to integrate that? Well, that's why he's the greatest human being that ever lived as says dallas willard He's the greatest human being that ever lived. He is the archetypal human being so george peterson says He is fully integrated in terms of all of these things now About the bible is the word of god. It's the revelation of jesus christ to us When I see him face to face that will be greater revelation even than My reading the bible now because now i'm reading the bible now That's here in the midst of the age of decay My mental millions get confused I have my biases my sin creates a filter through which I am unable to see it See now i'm using all these christian terms and i'm Hopefully fairly bilingual hopefully I can talk to christians and hopefully I can talk to non-christians and as I do this project part of the way that i've really been growing is as I continue to talk to People who are not christians, you know my capacity to speak that language Increases just like when I went to the Dominican Republic my capacity to speak Spanish increased the more I the more I spoke Spanish So final judgment is an important thing but That thing is dependent i'm not saying it's ontologically dependent but In terms of how it functions in my life. It depends upon the reality of whether or not I believe it now, obviously if it's ontologically significant It's it's not dissimilar to saying to someone You should plan for your death No, i'm not going to plan for my death because I don't want to die Nobody here doubts death Few of us doubt suffering so Judgment is important now sacrifice in terms of how it functions in the christian life Maybe you see something that you want This gets into my conversation about the Is christianity best described in terms of law or relationship? That's an ongoing conversation within the christian community Number of years ago. There was a saying That was quite popular on a lot of bumper stickers Christianity isn't a religion. It's a relationship and that That is a layer in terms of the long Long Story of american evangelicalism and I mentioned Chuck colson's born again book chuck colson was a christian in a formal way, but then he became born again This was this whole wave of Evangelicalism that really hit the nation In the in the 70s and 80s neo-evangelicalism billy graham so on and so forth What's happening in all this is this is modulating now If you're if you're really deep into one set of this and we all are deep into sets of different things We cannot live without being deep into something So if you're deep into one set of this and if I say christianity Isn't a religion. It's a relationship. You'll say yes pastor. That's exactly right because what christianity is is my relationship with jesus and when Matt who had that conversation jordan peterson releases this video. We'll see what happens with that That was a very important part of his story in his life And that actually was a very important part of my story in my life when I went to college When I went to college, I was born and raised crc at college Calvin college I Met some evangelicals and that then began to tweak my christian reformed upbringing and then I was into more pentecostal stuff and that tweaked again my christian reformed upbringing And then I was into some of the you know Meditation and monastic stuff and that tweaked it again And so I just had these series of tweaks that go and I already had an extremely rich upbringing because of my father's ministry In paterson and the african-american community and so so what I had is just all of this richness that kept getting built into my christian life And what that allowed me to do is just be able to speak different languages within christianity But if you're deep within one group and you hear someone talking another language Well, is it a matter of translation? Is it a matter of them violating your The premises of your narrative. Is it a matter of them violating your ontology? And that's why you get all these little desktops between the different christian groups. So But but but sacrifice so so someone so so this individual called me and said for my christian life Holding accountable to the final judgment is really important and i'm adding words to his mouth helpful in not sinning Now again, if you're if you don't buy any of this narrative you'd say Sin is a function of the narrative True. It's a function of the relationship You might say well, I know sin isn't real No, that's your little subgroup and his little subgroup sin is real Who's to say sin isn't real well, then what we try to do is get above the two subgroups and say well i'm outside the subgroups Here's the thing about christian here's not about christianity. Here's the thing about human beings. We are never outside a subgroup And this is the part of the observation of post-modernity. We are never outside of a subgroup What you will often have is when you listen to say delahunty and harris They will say well these christians they're in this little subgroup and what they need to do is get outside into the The bright sunlight of reason Uh, no, you're just in another little subgroup you by virtue of how you grow your subgroup grows around you by virtue of the experiences that you have and the beliefs that you have and the You're all within your different subgroups. You say well i'm in the christian subgroup. Okay Well, I would recommend that you read historical christianity read primary sources because if I read a book about augustin Written today What that book does is translates augustin into My little subgroup and speaks to me And he writes a book about paul translates paul into terms that I can understand and appropriate and teaches me something about that subgroup there But when I read paul in the new testament and this is the this is the challenge I tend to read it through my own filters The better I know the world in which paul lives the better I can actually translate Functionally how that might match up my dyslexia. I get confused with words right left on the screen I can best translate into my subgroups because how something is functioning in that world Will probably help me know how something is functioning in this world I I just read I just there was just a tweet about basically henotheism polytheism and monotheism because often the old testament talks about god is above all other gods and Michael not michael schermer. He's the atheist michael. I can't remember his name He does stuff for for logos and he has he writes about this When abraham made a sacrifice Knowing what we know about that period of time when abraham began following the lord Abraham probably believed there were a lot of other gods and so this god he was picking as his special god And so what kind of happens is god is is kind of making his way through the pack in the minds Of the people that he's dealing with now you might say Yeah, but I want to know things at that level. Oh you want a monarchical vision Oh, you want to see things you want to see things without human eyes Oh, you want to see things without biases. Oh, you want to know the truth Now i'm not a skeptic or a relativist but We cannot possibly take something in Without And peterson makes this point again and again without the construct of being able to grasp it Now that's a tremendous challenge for god I don't know if it's a challenge for him. I don't know if god has to do it though. It all gets very complicated We try to speak the truth as best we can We Only have ourselves within our culture within our language to do so and say well the bible is true. Yes, the bible is Is John calvin talks about this god condescends to communicate to us. So so this individual says, you know judgment is really functional in terms of me living the christian life That's what helps me to not do things that would be destructive Now what's um I don't think that's hard for even those who are not christian to understand because consequences Keep probably keep you from doing things that you're tempted to do so It's just whether god is the ultimate consequence and of course god is the ultimate everything so Can't get bigger than that I'm gonna have to decide at some point how long to go with this mental issue Especially once you have small children this fundamental issue is to stave the suffering the hell off, right? That's what you want to do. That's your primary moral obligation. If you're a person who has Any if your eyes are open at all, that's your primary obligation and so you make the sacrifices that are necessary and you set up the future and Well, the the the motif of sacrifice Is there in the old testament? But it's more it's so concrete That it's difficult to draw a parallel between the two at least for me. They didn't align Self-evidently and I don't remember in my rather limited Religious education as a child in the united church because I went to the united church till I was about 13 I don't ever remember anybody pointing out that like the sacrifices that Cain and abel were making or the sacrifice that Abraham was supposed to make or sacrifices that people were making to god Were the were the precursors. Let's say the dramatic Precursors to the psychological idea of sacrifice That we all hold as civilized People in the modern world So although it seems obvious as I said once you lay it out I don't remember that ever being explained to me but and then well and then let me read this so now that I've sort Of introduced it. Here's what happened as humanity developed First were the endless tens or hundreds of thousands of years prior to the emergence Of written history and drama the twin practices of delay and exchange Began to emerge slowly and painfully. So here's a cool psychological study So it's called the marshmallow test And maybe it's even a reliable study I'm gonna zip through this because I want to hear what he has to say about it the other thing But he's gonna talk about the marshmallow test that many even know what that is and if you don't know what it is We're at so you take we're at many 13 in the video Think the experiment is 10 minutes Then you can have two marshmallows And so that puts the top that now distract themselves course they're eyeing that marshmallow like a squirrel eyeing a nut and and trying to Restrain themselves and you know what I see in that is that the child's Prefrontal cortex the higher cortical systems are warring with the underlying Motivational systems more primordial motivational systems that govern such things as hunger the hunger system Hypothalamic system says there's something sweet and fat right sitting there right bloody now grab that thing and stuff it down now And I'm sure many of you have a constant battle with your hypothalamus with regards to sweet and fat things and often lose So you can feel But and the hypothalamus has these tremendously powerful tendrils upward into the brain into the parts that we would associate more with voluntary control and the voluntary control Centers have these little weak ribbons going down to control So now he's speaking to the scientific Hypothalamus since it's pretty obvious if you know something about neuroanatomy What part is actually in charge when the chips are down and it's not easy for children to learn to regulate those underlying? Primordial impulses the ones that are wired in the ones that we share with animals But they do it and and and the cool thing is this is what Walter Michelle found He's the guy who did the study was that? the long-term Outcome for the children who can delay gratification in the marshmallow test is much more positive Than it is for the children that are impulsive and eat the marshmallow Instantly it's delay of gratification now. It's likely that that's associated with trait conscientiousness although that Specifically hasn't that specific connection has not yet been established, but they seem conceptually very very similar So so anyways This emerges in children Probably between the ages of two and four something like that They should have it in place by four because it's very difficult for them to really interact well with other children without having that delay of gratification in place because you can't delay gratification other kids don't like you because You're you want everything your way And you want it now and you're like you're liable to temper tantrums and that sort of thing you haven't got the kind of self-control Necessary to make you fun to play with So you can see that emerging in children, and it's pretty it's pretty interesting and and not only that if it emerges it predicts positive Long term outcomes just like trait conscientiousness does by the way because trait conscientiousness is the second best predictor of long-term success Over the lifespan in Western cultures It's second after intelligence and so in our societies The people who do best across time are the people who have high IQs and who work hard and I would say that's a pretty decent What would you call it? It's a validation in some sense that our cultures are working properly because what you would want I would say if the system is working meritocratically Like it should and if you're trying to extract resources from those who can contribute at a higher Meritocracy is its own bubble too. I think it's pretty good bubble, but If you really want to go deep into Our sense of justice These are really really deep things Look at meritocracy and then ask yourself well How does meritocracy play out in the Bible? Well, it does well look at well, he's gonna be talking about K and an able so There's meritocracy at the bottom of that story and that is a really small It's gonna say murky story and we're not gonna get there in this video And I'm only 17 minutes into it I'm only 17 minutes into his video Anyway rate then what you would want to have happen is that the hard-working smart people do better Hopefully if that's the case, then everyone does better hopefully Anyways So you can see keep reading that First were the endless tens or hundreds of thousands of years prior to the emergence of written history and drama The twin practices of delay and exchange began to emerge slowly and painfully then they became represented in metaphorical abstraction as rituals and tales of sacrifice It's as if there's a powerful figure in the sky who's judging you you better keep him happy or look the hell out We've been watching ourselves deal with him for a long time. He seems to like it when you give up something you value so Practice sharing and sacrificing until you get good at it No one actually said any of this so long ago, although they said Something very similar, but it was implicit in the practice and then in the stories action comes first Implicit comes first people watched the successful succeed and the unsuccessful fail For thousands and thousands of years and we thought it over and we drew a conclusion the successful among us sacrifice the successful among us delay gratification The successful among us bargain with the future and then a great idea begins to emerge in ever more articulated form That idea is the point of a long and profound story It's the moral of this story and I'm going to engage in some foreshadowing here What's the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful the successful sacrifice? And things get better as the successful practice their sacrifices the question becomes increasingly precise and simultaneously broader What is the greatest possible sacrifice for the greatest possible good? You know if you if you push a question in a direction perhaps there comes a time when you can't formulate it anymore precisely and broadly and and Now I want to say before he goes into this that I Listened to this a year ago and I I Maybe I don't remember whether I found it found but what he just read there because I have been exposed to it multiple times Sinks a lot deeper into me than what I recall when I saw it the first time I Probably saw it the first time I thought huh, that's curious and now it is integrated and connected into My understanding I understand how this plays in his system in a way that I didn't understand now You might say well, maybe you should have made those early videos And I could feel that too because I didn't know anything but get back to where we started making this This is a learning process for me and you might say well, why did I waste my time watching your early videos? Well, I don't know. You'll have to decide for yourself whether or not it was a waste Maybe you were learning with me. Maybe we actually learned together. Maybe we're learning with Peterson Maybe this is how civilization works. Maybe this is how we all learn together Maybe this is how we contribute to the future of humanity. Maybe this is how we grow. Maybe this is how Maybe this is how we ought to live And I might say well Peterson out there yeah, here's the thing this is what church does This is what we do every Sunday might just be a few people in there might be a lot of people in there hopefully We are growing and learning and here's the thing about here's the thing about church Peterson has a congregation of millions now You're gonna get a chance to see the guy I Mentioned to someone yet people find me because they can't talk to Peterson I'm Humble I don't have a problem with it And then you know they'll say yeah, but you're gonna climb up the hierarchy then we're gonna need somebody else And well if that happens, so be it But this is this is how life works and this is hopefully how we work together and maybe a system like this will be profitable so I'm gonna draw this to a close now, I'm in about 20 25 and Because it's 11 o'clock and I have some other things I need to do But one of the things I'm working on right now for my patrons I as many of you know, I've been struggling with the the patron patreon thing the church just got Electronic giving up and so soon I will have that up on the church website and I'll start to include that link into The show notes regularly with the other regular links that I have for those of you who would like to support my church Now some of you don't want to support my church, which is fine But you want to support me and not my church you can give to patreon if you want to support the church You can give to the church now if you're in the United States You get the added benefit of that which you donate to the church You will get a obviously a tax deduction because they're donating to a church you say well that seems kind of well, here's the thing What when you donate to the church you don't donate directly to me Which is absolutely fine because the church supports me and pays my salary people the church like it because you help keep the lights on And me preaching on Sunday and me being their pastor and you know doing all the other things that pastors do for them But the church is also in a sense sharing me with you as I do these videos and I've been Trying to help the church understand Why these videos are important for the most part everyone in the church has been supportive of it They're a little surprised last week when a this film crew shows up and is why are they Why are who are these people and why are they doing this to our pastor and we'll see when when rebel wisdom? Puts out what they produce so so that's coming on board One of the things I'm thinking about doing with my patrons is I've been playing with rabbit which is a way of watching video as an online community and Maybe doing some watching some of the biblical series with a group of people in a room and I've been trying Yeah, I don't like pay-for-play which is part of the reason I was really reluctant to do patreon to begin with because I don't as a pastor Here's the thing as a pastor. I spend a lot of time with people who will never make a Significant or even any financial contribution to this church That's how churches work. There are certain individuals that give Sacrificially, there's the word they give sacrificially to the church and because they donate sacrificially other people Deserving or not get my time unlike let's say a therapist where I would say, okay well, I can be your therapist and you can sit in my office and we can talk for an hour and a half and You're gonna pay 150 or $200 for the benefit of talking to me I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that model. That's not a church model and I Don't want finances to stand in the way of people getting what they need. So That that's some of the difficulties I have with pay-for-play in those kind of structures. However those who give deserve to be thanked and I So I'm trying to find ways of thanking the patrons So one of the things I'm thinking about doing is doing little biblical series commentaries in a room with patrons and I don't know if I'm gonna tear that up with respect to levels because if someone is supporting me at ten dollars or twenty dollars Or or fifty dollars a month in them anyways, they deserve more and And I know Peterson for a while had if you support him at a certain level then you can have your half-hour patreon Patreon conversation with him and I'm not at that level of the hierarchy. I'm not that hard to find I I still talk to people for free as does Jordan Peterson I'm sorry soon too, but the difficulty is the more and more people want to talk to you. You need to find ways to Because my time is limited you need to find ways to find how you can best steward that time with respect to all of those people and and an Aspect of patreon isn't bad in which the most motivated rise to the top and that is expressed in money The problem is that not if money isn't distributed evenly to everyone Time is distributed more or less evenly to everyone on the short scale. We each have 24 hours So I'm working through all of these things that I'm thinking through all of these things So one of the things that I'm looking at I'm actually gonna test this the day after my next meetup Probably with some people from my meetup is that I'm gonna do spend an hour or a half hour in one of these rabbit rooms Watching a Jordan Peterson video and I'm trying to figure out how basically how we can have a conversation together Because part of what I figured out when I started doing these commentary series is that It's not only cool to listen to him and to learn but you know if we're going to actually learn and grow from this We're gonna have to talk about this. Well, how can we talk about this? Well, the meetup is one way that we've been doing it. So my meetup group talks about these things But as the meetup group grows, then I have again questions of scale So and again in church life we deal with this all the time On Sunday mornings when I give a sermon I give it to a room full of people who are just listening to me That's one way to have kind of a one-sided conversation in my Sunday school class that I have at 930 at church People come and it's a smaller group and so we have more of a conversation and again part of People look at me and say Paul your church is so small Yeah, it's a small group. So we have a conversation Yeah, it's it's Dicey that way in terms of finances of course a bigger church would mean more financial stability and we could hire staff and have You know other people do things which is free me up to do things. That's that's all about scale but what's beautiful about small is I Have these away amazing wonderful conversations with people that I might not get a chance to have conversations with not because the people are of high status, but because the people are of low status and Jordan Peterson's rule basically treat people like you have something to learn is an excellent rule because Whether or not someone has high status or low status You can learn from them and again I'd been doing the Freddie and Paul show long before I started this Jordan Peterson stuff and when the Jordan Peterson stuff came Along and my subscribers grew I really had a crisis whether or not I Should keep the Freddie and Paul show on the same channel because I didn't want people being mean to Freddie basically But I learned from Freddie and you might say well Paul don't you have a higher IQ than Freddie probably Isn't my life in some ways sorted out better than Freddie's I'm able to maintain a job I have a job with some responsibility so on and so forth Freddie's on disability. Yeah Freddie and I have different struggles, but Every time I sit down with Freddie I learned something The Bible says The Bible basically says Be with people of low status That's an admonition and The reason the Bible says that is because as we go up the hierarchy we tend to filter out the people of low status We do that at our peril Because there are things to learn from people that are at low status hierarchies bind and blind And so once you get to a certain level in the hierarchy What becomes implicit in terms of your tiny little bubble is all of you now have some? Commonalities that are filtering out the low status people and then very quickly you lose things like humility You lose things like teachability And this is a natural part of the process and so actually if you're climbing in a hierarchy the wise find ways to limit the the problems of being high status and Some of that is naturally the friends they had before they were high status Can be treasured because what happens is the higher status you go the more mercenary the relationships can tend to be So the people who knew you and loved you when there was nothing in it for them Well in a sense they knew you and love you for who you are and not for what they can get out of you And that's part of the game about status So so I'm working with all these ideas when it comes to patreon and some people say well We should obviously do this or you should not obviously do that well none of it's obvious to me because I'm thinking through all of these issues as I do it and as I Experiment with things and I try things and sometimes I I fail with some things and sometimes things go better. So That's all that I'm doing in this in this in this whole experiment of my Jordan Peterson videos So Yeah, let me know I again as I try and keep up in the comment section I'm trying to figure out this is the first time I've been doing this during summer Subscriptions have kind of slowed down which is interesting I would read that and and then I've got to deal with the greedy self in terms of my own heart Because I would lie to you if I didn't say oh the attention is pleasurable. Of course, the attention is pleasurable Oh the the possibility of money is exciting. Of course, it's exciting all those things have their grip on me But yeah, on the other hand I have my you know Christianity also has a grip on me with lots of admonitions about the love of money is the source of all sorts of evil You got to watch that The desire for fame is a very dangerous Is a very dangerous thing got to watch that So Trying to be a little transparent about who I am and what's going on It's a flattering thing to have people call me and want to talk to me who don't know anything. I don't know anything about them That that feeds certain parts of the ego But but you really got to keep those parts of your ego in check Because we all see examples of what happens when when those things get out of line. So There's just a little bit of transparency it's a bit of a hodgepodge of a video, but I think there are themes that kind of go through it and I'm gonna post it. So I got to be done now because I have other things I got to do in my day job Thanks for watching and and give me some feedback on the rabbit thing and and patreon and I'd like to know more of your thoughts on that because I'm I've got my own hangups obviously my wife always says we got hangups about money and but she doesn't like the hangups about money because my hangups are very much The Stan and Barb hangups, which I am. I'm very suspicious of money and my wife says you should be more open to money So these are all the kinds of hangups I have. So anyway There's today's video
