 Okay, so I'm going through Jordan Peterson's resurrection, death and resurrection of Christ in five parts video. I did a part, did a video on part one. Part one he's pretty much into prolegomena. He reads from maps of meaning. He talks about the nested world between the material world of objects and the platform of being where there are, I'll just pull up my usual slide for that, the platform of being where we see tools, where story governs stuff, where there's hierarchies in play. Didn't talk about hierarchies actually, but this is the this realm of action and we don't have, he talks about the fact that we don't have the boundary line between these worlds despite my hard black line, but of the boundary line between these worlds sufficiently figured out and that that partly gets into this drawing which I've used before where you know you have the revenge of the materialist, the material say ah but your being is standing upon material and so Peterson would say yeah we don't know the boundaries of this and so this is part of our difficulty and the difficult, another piece of the difficulty is that the religious and the material have been divorced and we don't know how to put them together and part of the problem with this is that the stories that we are dependent on come from before the divorce and we're not going to simply go back before the divorce because we can't not see what we see now and we can't not know what we know now. So we're up to the the second part of his five-part series, some axioms of the Christian revolutionary story. Now again if you go just behind he introduced the in a sense drawing out and mapping out in a sense the hero story where you descend into chaos and then you come out a new person and and I mentioned that okay I could I can I can go with him that the resurrection story is you can understand the resurrection story as a story of that type but does that exhaust the resurrection story? Now I think he would say no it doesn't but okay well how? Well let's see at the danger of me redoing my last video let's just jump in here. Two, some axioms of the Christian revolutionary story. Number one, to decide that and then enact the proposition that being is good despite its tragedy and malevolence. Number two, to work in consequence for the continual and eternal improvement of that being and to know that as love. Okay now these are really important points for Peterson and I know this frustrates some of you. All these videos for me are me thinking out loud I'm trying to process this stuff and I'm reading also reading Alan Jacobs book How to Think and Peterson and Jacobs make a lot of parallel points in a lot of ways because you know what is thinking? Thinking is in the sense having a conversation within our head well part of what I'm doing on YouTube is having a conversation with all you and you're writing comments and so on and so forth so we're having this conversation together and I just actually thought of the fact that every time as a society we have this habit of saying we need to have a conversation about this. In a sense what we're saying is we need to think about this. Unfortunately a lot of the things that people say we need to have a conversation about this they don't really mean we need to have a conversation about this we mean I need to tell you what you should do so anyway but these first two points are really important for Peterson because when you get into his talking about the guys who shot up Columbine High School and that whole group you know the group of people that decide that being isn't good and I think as a Christian you get into Genesis 1 and God creates order out of chaos and it is good it is good it is good it is very good and being is good and so life life is pain but life is worth the living to work in consequence for the continual and eternal improvement of that being and to know that it and to know that as love some people have said to me you know it's kind of missing in Peterson is love and that's a that's an important observation as Christians because for Christianity the if the cardinal if the cardinal sin is pride the cardinal virtue is is charity or love and and the reason at least in old English they prefer charity to love is his charity tends to have within it the aspect of agape of self-giving love and people sometimes complain to me that Peterson doesn't have enough love in his message there's there's more duty there to work in consequence for the continual and eternal improvement of that being and to know that it is love it's very similar to his Melbourne address where he he tries to get into some of this too so it's interesting that love is back in it number three to do such work in truth now again remember Peterson's concept of truth is not simply material verification which tends to be a materialist definition of truth Peterson's definition of truth is bigger now it's hard to know just with this because his his his definition of truth sometimes includes the pragmatism but if you listen to enough Peterson you know just he's a human being just like the rest of us and words are hard what do you mean by truth it's an important word here number four to let everything inadequate burn off in that pursuit and to welcome its replacement by what is better okay and that maybe helps contextualize the truth because now we're more into this Peterson's idea of say lying pastors of the fact that we use language manipulative manipulatively we and so then he has this other theme that he engages often where you know we need to be this our stuff needs to be burned away to reveal in a sense to reveal who we truly are and or better yet to let truth out to get rid of the crust so that we can let's say if we're using a metaphor like that we can move in freedom the scabs fall off number five to know that as the sacred imitation of Christ well now we're getting somewhere because now we're very much into all this stuff is so hard we're very much into the imitation of Christ in what way because there's a moral layer to that and and and in a sense you ask well which part of Christ story art I ought I to imitate it well you say well the whole story okay I can't do the incarnation necessarily well I suppose you can we have incarnational ministry it's a term that we use in Christian missions this boy this is complicated to know it that is the sacred imitation of Christ and sometimes so after my conversation with Peterson a bunch of people jumped on Peterson's use of the divine individual now one of when I when people ask me about that I'll often say well you have to understand that if you are deep within the Christian tradition you're very careful about how you use that word divine if you're not deep within the Christian tradition you're not necessarily that careful about how you use the word divine Christians and and I would assume Jews and Muslims will be use the word divine in vernacular contemporary speech people are quite incautious and how they use the word divine so we're knocking on that door and number five but again if you look at Peterson's part one of this the prolegomena we're in the realm of being we're in the realm of action we're within which material is nested now this is going to get important as we try to answer the questions how many within how many frames is the resurrection active how far down does it go let's keep going number six to understand that although Christ's sacrifice redeemed us all the work still has to be done and again if you go back and you watch Ron darts latest on Peterson I think dart handles this quite well in in my tradition and those of you who watch my sermons know that I conclude most of my sermons with misery deliverance gratitude and this is the framework of the Heideberg catechism and and I do so because part of what we all wrestle with is this relationship between God's action and our action and and I think the best way to frame it is misery this is that this is our fallen broken insufficient state deliverance that the the action that God does on our behalf and then gratitude what we must do Tim Keller uses an old an old clergy phrase we are you know faith that saves us is not alone the Heideberg catechism talks about that once God's grace works upon us it can't help but bear fruit and and all of this is an attempt to to language the relationship between God's action and our action and and even if you get into CS Lewis's mere Christianity they often can't find that section in mere Christianity where Lewis talks about this but that's a that's a tremendously difficult thing for us to talk about I think partly because of the constraints of what consciousness is consciousness consciousness is in itself its own monarchical vision we have a very difficult time holding two things together in our heads we have a even an early impossible time holding three or more things and together inside our heads at two we can with this idea of tension or paradox or or balance you know these are all words that we try to do to to hold two things at once but but God's action and our action and so now Peterson is not a theologian and that's important to remember in this because theologians spend all their time trying to get the language right and then a whole tradition arises around theology to try to get the language right and that's why when a friend of mine who is a I'm a pastor not really a theologian I do theology but I'm a pastor we're we're practitioners so when I was talking to a friend of mine who's a who's a very legitimate well-established theologian and he watched my interview with Peterson the first thing out of his mouth was this divine individual I didn't like that well of course you didn't like that you're a theologian you're a you're a theologian in the Christian Reformed Church you're a you're a Reformed theologian you put those words together it's like magnets no they don't go together yeah Jesus is the divine well see if you say Jesus is the divine individual then you run into Trinitarian language so theologians are keeping all of this up to date now if I were to talk to Jordan Peterson about psychology me as a pastor I would say something in a inappropriate I would say something that a a PhD and in in psychology would bristle at I'd never say it that way now he's also a practitioner so he'd probably mask his bristling and say well I'd probably say it this way or and this is what pastors do people come into the people come in and they say things that are theologically way off base and and the wise pastor doesn't jump down their throat correct them but says well I might say something a little different so you got to give them some slack so to understand that although Christ sacrifice redeems us all the work still has to be done and even that redeems us all you have some of the universalistic texts of the Bible that you know theology has dealt with this is all hard stuff number seven to accept that work as the sacred meaning of life now that might be the most Christian thing in this list that's pretty dramatic he doesn't say to accept that work as a sacred meaning of life but as the sacred meaning of life that's pretty monarchical number eight to strive toward the heavenly city on the hill in that manner so the Winthrop City on a hill yeah a lot of hills a lot of cities on the hill Jerusalem is the highest mountain in you know in the Bible even though Jerusalem is 2300 feet tall you have to understand how symbolic language works the heavenly city and and again as a theologian you look at this language say okay let's let's let's play let's play part three oh that's see that's pretty quick so I have to decide if I want to wrap it up here at part two maybe just for the sense of order I will but those those that list is a is a really important list that list he has here is is pretty important to decide that and then in then in that and then enact the proposition that being as good this is a really interesting list I'm gonna have to do a lot more thinking about this list because I don't know that I've seen this list before and and so this this list might actually be the newest and most significant thing in this video and it's only it's it's less than a minute I'm gonna have to do a lot more thinking about this because I think actually this list is pretty important and and I think this list might be in some ways the clearest articulation of Peterson's theology that we've seen in such a succinct format now there's eight points should be seven or ten yeah so maybe I will leave it at there and just because I have to think a lot more about this
