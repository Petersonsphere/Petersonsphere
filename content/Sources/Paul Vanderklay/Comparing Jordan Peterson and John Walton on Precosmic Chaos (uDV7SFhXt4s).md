 Hi, this is Paul and I'm continuing my sub-series which is nested in my bigger series on the on a commentary on the biblical series done by Dr. Jordan Peterson. I have this, oops, I'm dyslexic, I was getting, see I can't even get the right shoulder. Okay, I have this poster which was a wonderful gift from from someone who showed up at my church and it's I thought it was hilarious and I love it and so I'm putting it up here in the video but his his Jordan Peterson's biblical series on and this was on this the second of his biblical series on Genesis and chaos which is a huge theme in Jordan Peterson and so this is a little sub-series I'm doing on chaos and Genesis 1. Now in my last video I'll leave the link to it in the in the comments on my last video I talked about how Jordan Peterson has resensitized me to the material in the Bible that connects the ancient Israelites to the broader mythological context of their what biblical scholars call seats and laban their their their situation in life their their cultural context and so will be I looked at that in my last video and this time I want to in a sense host a virtual conversation between Jordan Peterson and Dr. John Walton now now the reason the reason I picked Dr. John Walton is because he is on one hand a scholar who has specialized in the ancient Near East context if you look him up on Amazon or YouTube you will find a lot of information about him and this context and he's also a someone with solid evangelical credentials he has I believe he's retired now but a longtime teacher and lecturer at Wheaton College he's widely published and so I here I'm going to start with a section from a YouTube from the Veritas Forum now Veritas Forum if you're not aware of it is in my opinion one of the treasures on YouTube because Veritas Forum hosts conversations between Christian intellectuals and and academics usually on a college campus and the conversations in my opinion are are measured there they produce more light than heat and and you can actually learn a ton from these conversations and they have they have conversations that talk about creation and science or Genesis the Bible and science is a very common topic they talk about ethics morality believability of the Bible so there's there's a lot on the the Veritas Forum that's that's well worth that's well worth listening to but let's let's take a peek at whoops I almost unsubscribed from the Veritas Forum let's take a peek at how John Walton begins his conversation good evening so glad you all came out I'm just gonna make a few opening remarks so that you have a little bit of an understanding of where I'm coming from and some of the things that frame what our conversation will be about tonight as Felipe said I teach at Wheaton College and therefore I come from a confessional context now now this word confessional is is an important word in Protestant circles because what happened in the context of the Protestant Reformation and I've speak about spoken about this in some of my past videos is is the Bible is you know this this this conflict between let's say sola scriptura which is a much later way of phrasing the conflict and then the Roman Catholic position where they had much more emphasis on tradition and and what you know Luther's idea was that well once we you know once once we all read the Bible then all Christians will be united on what we find in the Bible but what happened in the church was was quite the opposite in that in fact the church in a sense fractured wide open and and there were huge disagreements and debates with respect to the Bible and so what what came out of that is this history of confessions and the Christian Reformed Church for example is a confessional church which means that we have doctrinal statements that we work and we hold each other to sometimes more in theory than in practice but but this process of confessions is important because in a sense what confessions help us do are lay our presuppositional cards on the table and say this is what I think the Bible is this is where I think we should position the Bible so this is these are these are my beliefs and the thing is once you put your beliefs on the table and you say this is what I believe well now we can actually have a reasonable conversation you know I like your beliefs because of these reasons I don't like your beliefs because of those reasons I think your beliefs are wrong because of these reasons I think your beliefs are are wrong because of those reasons so so confessional when when John Walton here talks about himself in a in a confessional context he's talking about himself as a believer who is held to if he teaches at Wheaton College he's held to certain doctrinal statements and he's accountable to them and so that frames his conversation but but it's also important because again as I mentioned in my last video what happens in the Protestant Reformation is that that the Bible then becomes this the Bible then becomes this test bed and and doctrinal doctrinal statements can move and change and morph and and this is this is really important sometimes people talk about a bounded set and a center set well when I think about bounded and center set I I don't think there are actually two worlds I think they're one world in in kind of a dynamic relationship because what tends to happen is that the movement of the center set rearranges the boundaries and that's a living thing and what confessions do is give statements throughout history that the church can kind of watch these boundary markers and and work their dogmas so what you really want now again when we get into the question of dogmas dogmas need to be flexible they need to be rigid enough to hold us but they need to be flexible enough to be corrected over time but they need to be durable enough so that we're not always moving them because then they have no purpose so so when he says from a confessional position this is the kind of thing he's talking about that's a pretty overt issue at Wheaton we are very interested in integrating our faith with our academics I would typically be identified as an evangelical and I don't have any hesitation to self identify that way other than the fact that sometimes evangelicals or ones called that can yeah do some silly things but at any rate and and this right now I'm recording at the end of December 2017 this this topic about the label evangelical is about as heated as it's ever been and and my take on that someone might ask me I the Christian as a Christian reform minister I've I've always had an uncomfortable relationship with that word because in a sense our tradition is different from this neo evangelical tradition that really grew up in the United States I think the I evangelical term is more of a political term and I think there's an interesting relationship between evangelicalism and and the market which is very tied to American culture so but but again part of the reason I picked John Walton here is because he self identifies as an evangelical probably so he teaches at Wheaton and what he's trying to do is again work this Protestant position that says hey if this is in the Bible if I can demonstrate that that my views are biblical I am making a case to challenge certain positions of other Christians with respect to their reading of the Bible right I also say that with the caution that evangelicalism even in terms of the scholarship of evangelicalism can cover a fairly broad swath that is it's not just all one in the same and we're going to see some of that tonight maybe some of you identify in that same category and we're going to find perhaps that there are some differences in how even evangelicals might think but beyond that I enjoy the conversation with those who don't self identify as evangelicals and so we're having some interesting discussion tonight now one of the things that's going to be a major focus for our discussions this evening is sort of what the Bible is how we think about the Bible how we got the Bible and some of those questions some of which are unanswerable others which we only answer from a perspective of faith and now I personally always get a little irritated with that that phrase from the perspective of faith because I think especially in some of the conversations between Christians and atheists faith faith is sometimes defined as this thing that we believe without reason and and and Walton's about to mention that a little bit but I think it's important here and I want to include some of his preliminary comments here in a sense of prolegomena for his speech because I think he helps frame you know I think my positions are quite close to his and and he's taught me a ton in terms of in terms of what the Bible is and how it speaks and obviously we're going to get into that more in this video in many ways lots of the things that I hold most dear about the Bible are not things that I can prove not things that I would even try to prove but yet there are things that I hold by faith and I consider that to be okay that doesn't mean that my faith is without any rational foundation and there are some things that we can talk about from a rational standpoint that will help us to understand what beliefs we may have or not have about scripture but sometimes even when we come at scripture with a very strong faith perspective we might not have thought through lots of the different issues now in my book lost world of scripture now now here it's important I mentioned in my past video that in a sense Jordan Peterson is is always looking over his left shoulder which means he's he's he's concerned about what his scientific cohort he's professionally he's a he's a psychologist he's in the world of psychology he's in academia and so he's gonna he's gonna get blows usually from the left now now Walton is used to getting blows from the right he's used to getting blows from fundamentalists and evangelicals that don't share his ideas about the Bible don't share some of his perspectives and so when you listen to a guy like John Walton it's important to hear his comments understanding where he thinks he's going to be you know which side he really thinks he needs to address so scripture which was already mentioned yeah I've got a GPS now so they're not lost so much anymore but anyway I'm with the comedy is hard and and all of the the discussions about kind of how we got the Bible lots of times we fail to bring an ancient Near Eastern perspective in our world with books and authors copyright and plagiarism and authors rights and royalties I had some come to the door I'm a local pastor people come to my door people got to talk to me so I paused and forget exactly where I was at John Walton was rational standpoint that will help us to understand what beliefs we may have or not have about scripture but sometimes even when we come at scripture with a very strong faith perspective we might not have thought through lots of the different issues now in my book lost world of scripture which was already I've got a GPS now so yeah there's the bad joke but anyway I'm with the and and all of the the discussions about kind of how we got the Bible lots of times we fail to bring an ancient Near Eastern perspective into that question we think about the ancient world as if it were somehow the same as as our world with books and authors copyright and plagiarism and authors rights and royalties and who knows what but when you really think about it that's really not how the ancient world worked at all there were really no such things as authors in the ancient world the way that we know them and this is a really important point something that I hadn't you know really thought about a lot until I saw this video I you knew it but again it's like watching the Jordan Peters stuff you kind of know this stuff but then when he says it you're like oh yeah that's absolutely right and this this very much impacts what we mean when we talk about the Torah as the books of Moses I mean we and our cultural filter imagine when Moses sat down and wrote these things well it's it's well he'll go on to say it's it's the authority that the person has who brought these books There aren't anything like books in the ancient world and yet so often we start the conversation by talking about which authors wrote which books and we really don't have that kind of scenario in the ancient world we're more likely to have authority figures because the ancient world is a hearing dominant world not a text dominant world sometimes we might call ourselves people of the book we wouldn't be the first ones to do that but the fact is the book part is a later development in a hearing dominant culture people receive their information orally they beyond the question of literacy they didn't have a great need to be literate in the ancient world because that's not how information was spread or understood now this is an important point and I I'm going to pause it here if you're interested in this video by all means watch the whole thing but this this actually gets into some of my questions about discovering YouTube because I think in some ways YouTube is bringing us back to this ancient world in the sense that this is auditory and again in my conversations and my discussions about about Neil Postman the literate world versus the pre-literate world and and and we're really in a sense a post-literate world and and so that's that's that's where you know that's where this this YouTube conversation is going now let's jump back to the PowerPoint here so so Walton and I'm I'm gonna I'm not gonna play more of that Walton video but Walton basically has two books which are germane to this conversation one book is more academic Genesis 1 as as ancient cosmology and so if you're if you're interested in the deep dive in terms of the the sources and reading more of the primary sources and where the sources come from and the academic and and the the academic discipline with respect to those questions from John Walton's point of view then that book is is probably the one you want to look at if if you're a lay person and you want something especially if you're a lay person and and and and an evangelical the lost world of Genesis 1 his lost world series is a series for lay people you don't need any technical expertise you don't need any background in Hebrew or the ancient world or ancient languages it's very accessible and it's a it's a great book and so I'm going to actually do some reading from quote from both books as I go through this in in the lost world of Genesis 1 I think Walton very well talks about how to talk about the cultural matrix in this as a result we are not looking to ancient literature to try to decide whether Israel borrowed from some of the literature that was known to them and again often in conversations I've had with in apologetic type conversations with people they say well Israel borrowed and and Walton is right now this isn't a question of borrowing it is it is expected that the Israelites held many concepts and perspectives in common with the rest of the ancient world this is far different from just suggested literature that barred that was borrowed or copied this is not even a case of Israel being influenced by the people around them rather we simply recognize the common conceptual worldview that existed in ancient times we should therefore not speak of Israel being influenced by that world they were part of that world to illustrate the idea we must think of ways in which we are products of our own culture and I've talked quite a bit about these kind of cultural issues in previous videos for example we do not borrow the idea of consumerism nor are we influenced by it we are consumers because we live in a capitalist society that is built on consumerism we don't have to think about it or read about it even if we wanted to reject its principles we could find it difficult to identify all of its different aspects and devise different ways of thinking one could make similar observations about Aristotelian Cartesian or Baconian forms of thought we could speak of capitalism and the value of liberty we could consider self-determination and individualism we could analyze our sense of personal rights and the nature of democracy these are ideas and ways of thinking that make us who we are in the United States where did we learn the principle or Canada where did we learn the principles of naturalism or the nature or the nature of the universe we are they are simply absorbed through the culture in which we live now now I've talked quite a bit about organic inspiration of scripture and and actually if you if you take a look at here here are a couple of links one let's see if if it if it pulls up there we go one one website post-party and he has some nice quotes from from from John Calvin on Genesis 1 and he basically you know John Calvin when he's when he's talking about Genesis 1 where it talks about God made two great lights the great light to rule the day and the lesser light by night John Calvin made the comment that it must be remembered that Moses does not speak with philosophical acuteness on occult mysteries but relates to those which are everywhere observed even by the uncultivated and which are of common use but since it is manifest that Moses does not depart from the ordinary custom of men I deceased from conversation basically Calvin is making the point that that similar to what Walton makes in his book that and again now when Calvin is talking about Moses he's talking it very much in in what John Walton talked about in terms of the authority of Moses the first five books of the Torah carry the authority of Moses and so he says Moses does not hear subtly dissent as a philosopher on the secrets of nature now bear in mind John Calvin is writing in the 17th century and 16th century 17th century and 16th end of the 16th century and John Calvin is is making the point that while philosophers were getting into this was the area of philosophy in that day science hadn't really come up like it did now and so when John Calvin talks about philosophers he's in a sense talking about proto-scientists Moses made two great luminaries but astronomers prove by conclusive reason that the star of Saturn which on account of its great distance appears least of all is greater than the moon so in other words by John Calvin's date there were um there were you know they understood that Saturn was larger than the moon and Calvin accepts that based on you know based on the science of his day but but proceeds to say but you know that don't knock Moses or the Bible or Genesis for that because the the purpose of it wasn't in fact to um to go into that now you can find for those of you who are interested in in ancient sources um the Christian Classic Ethereal Library ccel.org is um just a storehouse full of tons of ancient uh literature that's in the public domain and ccel they used to be hosted by Calvin College which again is my alma mater I don't know if they still are but um they're a they're a wonderful resource on the web for for all kinds of things so now this this in my mind connects very much with this this idea of the organic inspiration of scripture in the post-enlightenment western world this is again from John Walton the framework of cosmic ontology has become strictly material that is the cosmos is perceived to exist because it has material properties that can be detected by the senses again this is where we are in our scientific journey and our philosophical journey the function of the cosmos is consequently understood as resulting from its material properties and its origins are described in material terms and and again this is why the the dominant origin story in our cultural is currently written by physicists because of the philosophical frame and assumption that the the material strata is the primary strata and the story strata is derivative in a material ontology something is created when it is given or otherwise gains its material property in material ontology there is great interest in investigating and understanding the physical nature of reality especially in terms of its building blocks from the smallest constituents constituents including molecules atoms cells quarks and so on the constituent parts to the largest agglomerations of constituents including planets solar systems and galaxies and material ontology material origins are of ultimate importance and central concern now now he's going to go on to to say and this very much mirrors what Jordan Peterson is saying well what is the question what is real by asking three questions I will establish what the ancients believed was required for something to exist and again this is a this is a this is an always an interesting conversation for me because in my in my experience what drives people more than necessarily the stuff of life even though I'm not in any way trying to diminish the the layer of physical reality but but the relate the relational reality drives people and and so then is are we piano keys Dostoevsky asks CS Lewis engages the question of are we are we merely the sum of our physics and this obviously gets into questions of of determinism but but Peterson and Walton are asking the questions well what does it mean for something to be real for example is love real because love is fundamentally a relationship in fact most of the things that matter in our world are fundamentally relational more than physical and and so this is where this is where Walton goes I will establish that the ancients believe the ancients believed I will establish what the ancients believed was required for something to exist what did they consider to constitute non-existence what activities do they describe as bringing something into existence and what are the situations before and after these acts and how did the ancients describe the existing cosmos that they perceived with their senses that is the elements that they considered to be foundational building blocks of the cosmos for example now we're going to go back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia where all of these myths come out of and and and what did they consider to be most real I would suggest that cosmic ontology in the ancient world was functional ontology and this is Walton's big axe to grind really in both books that is everything existed by virtue of its having been assigned a function having been assigned a function and given a role in the ordered cosmos now we get into Egypt Egyptian literature addresses most directly the categories of what can be considered to exist in contrast to what does not exist using very clear terminology e horning who Peterson is one of the sources for Peterson's work here and someone he's in conversation with in terms of the the science e horning at first appears to affirm the material nature of the existence in Egyptian thinking when he notes that the absence of matter is included in what Egyptian sects classify as non-existence nevertheless he follows this comment immediately with the observation that which is nameless does not exist in the Egyptian in the ancient Egyptian mind now think about that which is nameless does not exist now that some of you who are paying attention to Genesis 2 and 3 will say well why is it such a big deal that Adam names the animals well that which is nameless does not exist why does God tell Adam to name the animals well we're going to get into that later in in Genesis 1 implying that material properties are not the criteria for the distinction in fact he admits that everywhere in the landscape we would come across the non-existent especially in the desert which contains fabulous animals that do not exist if you remember my last video I talked about the fact that here you have this this verbal link between sea monsters and jackals and and for the and for the Hebrews the desert was a land of Tohu Wavohu was the land of chaos just as much as the sea was the land of chaos and and this gets into this this very curious this very curious tidbit that when you look at the desert wanderings I'm jumping jumping ahead to the book of Joshua when the Israelites leave the desert and a generation has died in the wilderness that generation had never been circumcised now you'd say whoa these are descendants of Abraham circumcision was was central to their identity why didn't why weren't they circumcised in the desert and this is a point that's debated among biblical scholars and I think the reason is because the desert was no place the desert was a place of non-existence and so when Israel comes back into the land they are entering back into existence and therefore circumcision has to take place now this is a similar thing that happens when Moses for example is heading back into Egypt from spending his years in the wilderness after he had killed the Egyptian and and then God calls him and sends him back and he's going back into Egypt and then there's this really strange story where he gets this dream and the Lord's about to you know the Lord is about to do violence against him and his I'm trying to remember the story off the top of his head you know his his you know they quickly circumcise his sons before they go back into Egypt and again they didn't need to be circumcised in the wilderness because the wilderness is chaos and Egypt is productive land so let's keep going with Walton he maintains that the existence and the non-existence together compose the totality of that which is conceivable with this distinction being the existence of non-existence in mind we see that for the Egyptians creation did not involve transformation of the non-existent into the existent which is what most moderns would easily consider to be the definition of creation in other words even our definition of creation even our definition of existence even if you look at physics and the singularity and the big bang well and Peterson mentions this actually in one of his videos he says well what was when he's asked this question about miracles he says well what was before the big bang well that we have no reference in physical science to address that question but but yet beneath us is our assumption that again I'll read the sentence he maintains that the existence and the non-existence together compose a totality of all that is conceivable with this distinction in mind between existence and non-existence we see that for the Egyptians creation did not involve transforming of the non-existent into the existent which is implicitly and I've and Walton I think is that incorrect here I never hear this addressed in conversations about the beginning well here the Egyptians were thinking about this instead space is created for the existence as non-existence is pushed behind boundaries or beyond limits while yet remaining alongside that which is existent now this is really helpful for me when I get to questions later on in this video about what I wrestled with you know as a child reading the Genesis story for the world of creation the elements from which the state before creation is constituted primeval flood primeval darkness weariness negation are present in two ways they are the final limit or the realm beyond all boundaries which is and which is encountered when one reaches outside the limited world of being and they also present in our midst within the order of creation in other words and this you know as I'm processing Peterson and trying to get a trying to analyze and calibrate and evaluate what he's saying about chaos and logos and order which are foundational things for Peterson I'm trying to ask this question okay is Peterson right about his reading in the ancient world this is an important question to answer and and how am I going to answer this question but to read other people thus living beings may encounter the non-existence in a variety of ways when a pharaoh such as ramses the second is said to make rebellious foreign lands non-existent he does not mean that he annihilates them or sends them into oblivion but what he relate what he drives them out of but that he drives them out of the realm of the existence beyond the boundaries into the realm of non-existence horning offers the fine the summary conclusion for Egyptians non-existence is the inexhaustible unrealized primal matter now think about the phrase you're dead to me well you're it's you're not really killing someone you're not killing someone and burning their body and scattering the ashes what you're saying is that you are relationally dead to me you are dead to my story world even if materially you continue to exist but it basically means that you will now be outside my frame of reference this Egyptian view of non-existence is not found throughout the ancient world and thus constitutes a unique element of the Egyptian cognitive landscape now this is important too because we have a very low resolution picture of the ancient world and what we would expect to find in the ancient world is something analogous to what we find here where well you know maybe someone I used to some people said well tell more stories well when I was when I was a missionary in the Dominican Republic learning Spanish we would go out into the street I'd go onto the street with my Spanish teacher I'd pick up conversations so on and so forth and one day we went to the colonial district of Santo Domingo the capital city and there were all these tourists coming in tourists from Europe tourists from Canada tourists from the United States you know everybody looking very European kind of like me and I'd sit there with my Dominican teacher and just by watching them I'd say that's an American that's a Canadian that's they're from Europe and my teacher was just mystified well how how can just by looking at them you tell the difference well I could tell the difference because I'm embedded in the culture and I know that there are slight differences in dress in accent in style and interest between white Americans and Canadians and Europeans and if you're within the culture you're very tuned into those clues but for someone outside the culture like a Dominican they have a very low resolution picture of these other in groups just like if a European or an American or a Canadian would come to the Dominican come to the Dominican Republic they might see Dominicans and Haitians side by side and say well you know I can't quite tell the difference but if you're in that culture well the difference is immediately apparent so so this this view is a let's say theme and variation this is a variation of some of the the larger commonalities we're going to find but now yet a word to to very conservative Christians if you regard the first five books of the Bible as say being from Moses and if you regard the historical the biblical story as historical where did Moses get his education even in the biblical story Moses gets his education where in Egypt so what does that mean that means that and I think this is generally true of Genesis 1 that that that Genesis 1 is dialoguing with Egyptian cosmology and Egyptian mythology and Babylonian cosmology and Babylonian mythology just as in a sense we're doing today when we talk thinking about who's over our left shoulder who's over our right shoulder we're in conversation with all of the other people that are debating similar issues today but the Inchoate nature of this non-productive non-diversified non-functional pre-cosmic state is evidenced more widely and in a variety of forms as can be discerned by evaluation of the literature left by other ancient cultures in reference to Mesopotamia I'm jumping through the book obviously in reference to Mesopotamia Clifford observes the cosmogones now a cosmogony is an account excuse me for the birth of the cosmos and we're going to get into this word cosmos a little bit later the cosmogones do not express non-existence abstractly as nothingness but as a period when essential institutions did not yet exist and now that that word institutions is important because of course we're not talking about buildings and things but in John in John Walton's book about the the lost world of Genesis 1 he makes the makes the point that we can use this word create with respect to a business when you create a business what exactly do you create you're you're not your business might not have a building your business might not have physical assets your build this your business might not have employees your business well there might be a record of your business on paper but your business doesn't really exist on that paper that that paper is testimony and evidence of the business well what exactly is the business or what exactly is the corporation well it's an idea it's it's a thing that that may or may not have a relationship to a material stratum but it yet is a powerful thing in in this world for example what is apple what is apple computers well they've got tons of physical property and they make hardware even but they are really an idea and and for that matter what is money money money is an idea money is the most successful human story ever told because it keeps working and i'm not going to get into the gold standard conversation but but but this is but this is the interesting thing so cosmogony's do not express non-existence abstractly as nothingness but as a period when essential institutions did not exist in other words these institutions are vital for understanding in the ancient mind what the cosmos is in the past the pre-cosmic condition was often labeled chaos and this terminology often included a personification or characterization of this condition as evil and this is when you get into peterson talking about tiamat and for example in the Babylonian mythology and in other mythological stories creation involves violence between these forces and marduk in a sense goes to war against tiamat and by violence who is also his mother in a sense and and and then uses the remains of marduk to split the primordial sea and out of that he makes the world now walton makes the point that well this this we've often called chaos well this is in fact what what peterson is causing calling chaos now we're going to get a little broader in the classical world chaos in hesiod's theogony and virgil's annead is personified as the primal state in which earth sky and sea were all merged and and this is another this is another big theme in ancient mythology that in the beginning everything is well in hebrew it's tohu wavohu but everything is mixed together and and what happens is separation and differentiation and and that's that's the that's the creative move more generally chaos is the opposite of cosmos which refers to the ordered whole it is this latter juxtaposition that is particularly evident in the ancient near east egyptian philosophers conceived of the pre-creation state as the opposite of the created state in mesopotamia views of the pre-cosmic condition chaos is personified only secondarily in the conflict myths in which the created order was considered to be at risk now now that's a key feature and that that's something that i think we would um you know we would i would love to see peterson and walton talk about because walton i think has a little higher resolution of it and he and he makes the observation that the the the divine conflict the divine conflict motifs of let's say marduk and tiamat as they are as they are battling it out what what walton is saying is that these in the ancient in ancient mythology conflict between them only happens when the um when the world is threatened and so for example as peterson says when when marduk continues to hold at bay the forces of chaos well there's that that's functioning at a lot of different levels and when we get actually in the next video i'm going to talk a lot more about temple with respect to the function of chaos and order but the the picture we have here of genesis one which nicely sets up genesis three um the picture we have here of genesis one is is one where god sets up the cosmos sets up the ordered creation and it is good and in fact in genesis one the picture we get is very much stability genesis one is not a story where we find yaw way you know holding back chaos you know kind of like you know dutch the dutch dike holds back the chaos of the sea but it's a picture of he sets this up and it's stable and it's good now when we get into genesis three we're going to find the instability come and we're going to find the man and the woman in a sense sent out out of the garden which is you know a walled garden into the field where they're going to have to contends with thorns and thistles and and the woman is going to have to contend with actually in in hebrew the language in genesis three of the curse um that of thorns and thistles and the curse of the woman's womb are parallel and they're both both it's a language of frustration and struggle but in genesis one the world is set up by the logos again you're we're pouring john one into it let's remember that we're doing that where the word um you know word um you know speaks order into into being okay the conflict myth is a secondary development a personification of these primary creation met um metaphors of separation and differentiation when the term chaos is appropriate as a label for the pre-creation states depends naturally on how it is defined and used one option is to define it as the opposite of order and functionality it is that which is unproductive and that's going to be a really key word here in this definition chaos is neither a gaping void nor personified enemy of order in other words and this is where and this is where as i looked at a little bit some of the language in the scriptures about chaos part of the reason christianity is not a dualism where where it's you know an angel of light and an angel of darkness part of the reason why and some people have asked questions about certain christian sects like the jehovah's witnesses um part of the part of the reason why orthodox christianity and i mean that small orthodox not look tight at large o referring to the family of churches out of um the eastern christian world um small orthodox christianity never sees jesus and satan as equals and i think that's a very important theme for example especially in the gospel of mark where the the picture is of you know of the the god of the christians and the jews and the muslims that there's no you know there's no rival to him he is challenged he is defied he is rebelled against but when he sets up the world finally there's there's no equal to him and the old testament says this again and again and the old testament represents that when you know for example a subtitle for this video might be how the lord makes leviathan who is the sea creature his pet where where you know for example in daniel seven which is a vitally important passage for the new testament period where where the ancient of days sets up his throne and you know the sea monsters cannot stand against him even if the sea monsters the these these great empires that come out of the sea challenge him there there there simply is no contest between between the lord and those who would those who would stand against him so so chaos is appropriate as a label for the pre-creation state depends naturally on how it is defined and used one option is to define it as the opposite of order and functionality it is which is that which is unproductive in this definition chaos is neither a gaping void nor personified enemy of order in the ancient near east creation involves bringing order and organization to the cosmos and again this is where this is where logos comes in in modern discussions of this topic this sometimes threatening disorder is often labeled chaos and we can retain the terminology as long as this is as this careful definition is maintained it is better however to avoid the multivalent senses that chaos has now obviously peterson disagrees with this because chaos is a foundational interpretive principle for jordan peterson's theology and for his philosophy and he uses the word you know regularly to avoid the multivalent sense that chaos has and instead to use the pre-cosmic condition greek cosmos and the pre-cosmic condition as our term in order to avoid misunderstanding the various uses of chaos in the ancient near east the pre-cosmic condition is therefore neither an abstraction nor a personified adversary the primordial c now obviously again there are examples of its use in that way but but walton says only in this sense and i think just in terms of a layman's understanding of what's happening why does jordan peterson use chaos so frequently and why does why does john walton so reticent i think part of this is an academic and professional proclivity for for when you when you listen to jordan peterson talk about his area of expertise which is scientific psychology you know i i've you know so i've you know i watched this stuff on big five and so then i start talking to my family about things like trait neuroticism and my family's like neuroticism you know and and why do you say trait trait neuroticism trait openness well i'm i you know i'm aping in a sense because i don't have the technical um i'm not a professional psychologist like jordan peterson but i'm in a sense aping him because i've i've heard him saying these things and i'm trying to appropriate that domain that that domain of language and so i'm just like a child mimicking but at the same time when when jordan peterson speaks about these things he's got this entire academic conversation behind him so when he's talking about this era he can be very particular about his words now when he's talking about cosmology this is not his area of professional expertise so he's going to use words more loosely and so chaos is is what he uses now now walton is going to say whoa i'm going to be real careful about how i appropriate chaos to this circumstance because i want to have my definitions very specific and small and sharp so the primordial c which is the principal element of the pre-pre-creation condition is personified as namu in sumer and as nun in egypt now okay well let's let's jump into peterson and hear peterson use this associated with this notion of endless deep potential so for example the words that are used to represent without form and void are something like well one is to i'm going to get this partly wrong tohu waabohu and another one is ta'om and it's important to know this because those words are associated with an early mess earlier messapitanian word which is ta'am at and time out was a dragon like creature who represented the salt water and and time out had a husband named apsu and time out at apsu were sort of locked together and kind of a sexual embrace and it was that locking together of time out and apsu and i would say that's potential and order something like that or chaos in order they were locked together and it was that union of chaos in order that gave rise in the old messapitanian myth which is the anu me lish to the to the to being to the old gods first and then eventually as as creation progressed to human beings themselves and so there's this idea lurking underneath this these initial lines that god is akin to that which confronts the unknown and carves it into pieces and makes the world out of its pieces and the thing that it confronts is something like a well it's something like a predatory reptile or it's now here again um peterson is working in a lot of different peterson is doing something different than john walton here john walton is in his professional academic discipline is trying to get extremely to get to an extremely high resolution state on the historical record and what's going on peterson is in some ways acting like a preacher because well how do preachers and academics um relate now i'm a i'm a preacher and so i i work with the bible i work with academics and but i stand on the shoulder of academics someone like john walton and i try to figure out now how can i take these concepts and bring them into the present world and make them helpful for regular people now and in a sense so that's that's kind of what peterson is doing with these things now now one of the things that we're going to see is like i said before genesis one is in conversation with the myths of babalon um there's a you know many many biblical scholars think that a lot a good number of these old testament books reached the form in which we have them today around the period of the babalonian exile and when the temple is destroyed there was a a tremendous need to um get this stuff into writing now if you go back to where i started with john walton and john walton reminds us that what we have in the old testament is secondarily in book form it was primarily spoken word and that spoken word was rehearsed and and we believe that there were documents before the the bible that we have now and and that in fact again via organic inspiration there was a long period of inscripturation through which this stuff developed and and as a christian again as a confessional christian i would say that the holy spirit and this is where we get into biblical theology or systematic theology about providence the holy spirit worked through that history you see the christian god is a god of history and and and where we say that the christian god is is involved in the world he's he's um he is not a function of the world he is separate from the world in that the world is stands upon that god the world is created by that god and the world is sustained by that god but um but god is distinct from his creation that's that's central in christian thought so so so what um now where this gets all involved in terms of what's happening with peterson here is is this question of chaos and and so what i really wanted to do with this video and kind of work with what peterson is going in and with what john walton is is in a sense where do we locate chaos as peterson is calling it because peterson is using chaos as something that continues to live within this created order and and so part of what's critical about genesis one through three is in a sense and actually the entire old testament deals with this regularly and the new testament deals with it as well it's not just limited to genesis one through three but this but but figuring out what is the relationship between logos and chaos what is between order and chaos what is chaos is it evil sometimes um but yeah here in this world which in genesis one is ordered and good well we're going to get into this does chaos remain in this world something like a dragon or it's something like a serpent and i think part of the reason for that and this this is this is a very deep and ancient idea is that this is where it gets so complicated to do the translation is partly that is how human beings created our world like we went out beyond the confines of our safe spaces let's say our space our safe space is defined by by the tree or defined by the fire and we actively voyaged outward to the places that we were afraid of and didn't understand and and conquered and conquered and encountered things out there like like literally animals like mammoths and snakes and predators of all sorts and it was a as a consequence of that active brave engagement with the domain of what we did not understand the terrifying domain of what we did not understand that the world in fact was generated and that idea lurks deeply inside the the opening lines of of genesis and it's a it's a profound idea in my estimation and i think now now here again you'd have to go back and watch some of my previous videos because what energizes this conversation is because on one hand you've got a christian community with a tradition that has represented the origins of the bible as revelation and on the other side we have peterson saying i am trying to develop an account within um within the sec the iron box of secularism i'm trying to develop an account that not only um that not not only gives us an origin story for scripture but legitimizes scripture in the present public conversation and and right there this is why he's energizing the christian atheist line because this right here is the line and and so for for many who are watching this and a lot of the questions i'm getting is well i you know i i can't believe in revelation i i feel that revelation has been dismissed and dispelled because the material strata i think is original and are foundational and the story strata derivative and and so now okay let's take that for as it is and let's say okay that's let's let's assume let's declare that now this is an einstein move i've been also doing an audio course on on science um this is an einstein move by saying okay let's let's take this position this cultural position that says i believe that the material strata is is foundational and or base reality and the story strata is derivative let's assume that to be a cultural group okay how might god however he is imagined impact this cultural group well um if you're living within this cultural group and you're living within this box and you find by other means that the biblical story not only the biblical story has evolutionary roots i didn't unplug my phone i'm back um one one of the things that peterson that's key for peterson that that i really want to engage with is this idea of chaos and potential because that's i i don't know i i think that has to be carefully framed when when you look at the relationship in the bible to to chaos and again you know remember john walton's reticence about using the word chaos in in this context so so in a sense when when peterson is using chaos he's connecting it to the sea monsters he's connecting it to tiamat and tiamat is in a sense you know if you were to take tiamat and translate tiamat into the biblical realm she would be a sea monster she would be one of these monsters of chaos and and so i think this is foundational when you think about what the hebrew scholars and and what the hebrew scriptures are saying about chaos in in the function of genesis one and creation now um now i'm gonna i'm gonna switch over to some stuff in logos and again now i'm also going to follow john walton was the editor of a very i think it's an excellent um commentary series put out by zondervans called the zondervan illustrated bible comment uh backgrounds commentary and and for those of you who are interested in this jordan peterson stuff um who are interested in the ancient world um this this commentary series is for you in that um john walton and other scholars go through some of the other materials from the ancient world that is connected with um which is connected with the um the bible and so for example this is again my logos um my logos bible software and part of so let's talk about tohu avohu formless and void um i'm pretty sure walton himself wrote the wrote the genesis part waltz and also walton also has an niv application a commentary on the book of genesis in the niv application series and the niv application commentary series is geared towards lay persons um it's a commentaries run the gamut of um commentaries run the gamut of technical versus lay and so the niv application one by zondervan as well is um is geared towards lay persons you don't need a background in greek and hebrew uh peter ends has the commentary on exodus and i think both i i've looked into the exodus commentary more and i enjoyed what peter ends did with it um but i think um i haven't really looked at uh john walton's commentary on genesis but it's probably also quite good so formless and empty prior to the creation of the egyptian tech prior to creation the egyptian texts talk about non-existence and they're thinking this non-existent realm continues to be present in the sea in the dark night sky and in the desert places without role or function now again this is this is interesting because now now walton talking about this in this context is going to be a little different than walton dealing with it in a technical um academic book but but notice how again walton says that the the the chaotic elements continue within the creation in the existent myth and we're gonna in the egyptian myth in the egyptian pre-creation state of non-existence see he's not using chaos just like he said he wouldn't there are two elements primeval waters and total darkness in hebrew formless tohu is also referred to the desert and part of the nice thing about logo so i can put it over and see the deuteronomy text in the desert land he found him this is he speaking about israel in a barren and howling waste he shelt he shielded him and cared for him he guarded him as the apple of his eye in general it designates a situation in which the positive values such as purpose and worth are lacking okay now we're connecting up with meaning here and again this is an interesting key between walton and peterson as a result it is more appropriate to translate without function rather than without form and this is getting into walton's point that the genesis one story is about creating a functional anthology not as much the material level the material and tall ontology so it should be without function rather than without form and can be seen in similar ways in the in egyptian non-existence this is also apparent in jenna in jeremiah 4 23 i looked at the earth and it was formless and empty and and the heavens and their light was gone now now notice this again in in the jeremiah passage now if you look at the context of jeremiah 4 and three of four three if we scroll up and again this is um this is this is some of what some pastors do in their when they're studying um so so the context of jara of see the problem is that everything switched um the context of jeremiah oh i've lost it um oh my anguish my anguish i writhe in pain oh the agony of my heart my heart pounded within me i cannot keep silent for i have heard the sound of trumpet i have heard the battle cry disaster follows disaster the whole land lies in ruin in an instant my tensor destroyed my shelter in a moment how long must i see the battle standard and hear the sound of trumpet my people are fools they do not know me this is the lord lamenting the relationship he has with his chosen people israel they are senseless children they have no understanding they are skilled in doing evil they do not know how to do good i looked at the earth and it was formless and empty this is tohu wavohu i looked at the earth and it was formless and empty at the heavens and their light was gone i looked at the mountains and they were quaking and all the hills were swaying now what you see here and what you will see in the new testament and again and again in scripture is this these are representations of uncreation in other words the disorder of humanity the rebellion of humanity brings disorder in and in my next video when i i'm going to deep dive into genesis 1 and temple and law and order because all of these themes are connected now peterson doesn't go anywhere with this and probably well this isn't his area of expertise but but this is there's a lot of key links in here with temple and law and order and then on in christian terms with christ and new creation and the book of revelation but but you can see right here here in the book of here in the book of jeremiah the the lord is lamenting the state that the moral state of israel and the state of israel in relation to himself and he's basically saying i am going to bring in chaos and that chaos is going to be the form of nebuchadnezzar and his army and and if you remember from my last video i connected you know nebuchadnezzar and and chaos now we're using the word in a way john waltz and doesn't like to use it but this is the way jordan peterson is using it and and so chaos is going to manifest itself in nebuchadnezzar and his army and they are going to take apart the nation now now the lord in in through the prophet jeremiah speaks and now again remember john waltz comments earlier in the video that that this is uncreation for the children of israel this is tohu of ohu let's get back to genesis 1 okay so jeremiah 4 3 where the same pair of hebrew terms is used they refer to to the return to a non-functional non-productive state and the text further describes the situation by delineating the various areas of cosmos that are all non-functional where there is order and where order and productivity or productivity are threatened all of this fits nicely with the explanation given in previous in the previous comment the text will soon describe god's activity in bringing the cosmos into existence understood in terms of function not form thus the account begins with a non-functional condition and thus similar to egyptian thinking and then walton will go into some background in the cosmic world we're going to come back to this representation a little bit later we're going to talk about the great fight between marduk and his his victory over tiama and then we'll talk about the deep tiom which which peterson talked about the deep hebrew tiom refers to the primordial or primeval sea in pre-creation in the pre-creation period it covered everything in creation you got a little footnote and again you can um let's see the previous note in creation it is pushed to the edges of the cosmos now remember the conversation about egypt and chaos and ramses and the armies that he defeated there it is identified as cosmic waters of chaos that can be brought back at any moment and we'll see this in the flood story if deity requires its services now again this is different from and imagine you know dykes holding back the the the waters of the north sea for the dutch where a deity is always struggling against it rather chaos is in a sense a tool that the lord has that he can call upon and in fact what genesis 6 through 9 the flood stories are about is that in fact the lord calls upon the waters of chaos to fill the sea and in a sense if you read genesis 5 the lord laments his creation he regrets it because in a sense humanity is chaos and this is a big theme in the bible that that this is a theme in romans 1 that if you want chaos in your life open the door let it in and you'll have it and and this is i think in a sense why jordan peterson says clean your room you know begin eliminating chaos from the from the everyday places of your life get your life in order sort yourself oops sort yourself out and and so so here we have you know an application of chaos in this context and and whereas god can call the deep he calls to the deep and so he flushes the world that people have turned into chaos with chaos and at the end of that chaos he will once again restore order it is and again here we have john waltons it is simply used to describe pre-cosmic condition pre-cosmic is appropriate for the greek word cosmos implies order it is also more neutral description than chaos in other words peterson or or walton is is is conscious of the nuances of the word chaos and and sensitive to some of those conversations and he talks about control and again very useful very useful tool in terms of getting at some of this stuff okay back to the powerpoint so so you look at tohu avohu and we talked about this and we talked about the fact that this word has a has a pretty broad semantic range and we saw its use in the book of deuteronomy and we saw its use in the book of jeremiah and and so i think what is important here is that the lord frames chaos what you have in the picture of genesis one is how of the lord speaks order into chaos and again this ties in with john one and the logos how how logos orders chaos and at my sermon a couple of weeks ago where i talked about john one this is this is kind of the idea of the light bulb and and why we have all this metaphor about illuminating conversations and this also helps so so part of what i wrestled with is is why are chaotic elements why do chaotic elements persist within the order alongside their opposites and this gets into the the question i always had as a child with respect of these stories why does god let the snake in the garden um why and and now understanding the the symbolic the symbolic payload of the sea and darkness and and you find that it's it's interesting in the creation story where the lord orders creation and and this is where you know we want to think about john waltz caution with the word chaos chaotic elements are allowed to continue within the creation and yet the creation is called good and and you get the sense that good is a function of the fact that even chaos even leviathan now is is under the control of the word of the lord even leviathan himself must even leviathan himself must bow to the king of kings and i talked about this in in some of the last video and and this is important john waltz and sense of chaos is something that the lord can call upon at his service to address rebellion in his creation now i think paul picks up this idea in romans chapter one where where in a sense paul says you know the the chaos in in the pagan world is they are in denial about the ordered god now he goes on to critique the um the chosen people the people of the lord in in in romans chapter two and of course gets to his summary in romans chapter three where he says none are righteous the pagans and the non-pagans the um the the people of the lord and the people who are far from the lord none are righteous and so christ comes to address all of these people but but again this vision that so so what happens in in the story of israel and you can see this in in the old testament is that what what what happens this is why i'll get into temple in the next thing what happens when when temple is destroyed there's a relationship between the destruction of the temple and the coming of chaos now in a sense what the old testament prophets say is that the the the um the people of god the people of jerusalem the people of juda the people of israel in a sense destroyed the temple before the building was destroyed and and what that does when that when they when the temple no longer functions among their people and we'll have to talk about temple and law when the temple no longer functions among their people um chaos comes in and and so what in a sense so then the they had to the jews had to wrestle with the question why would god let why would the lord let the armies of chaos meaning babalon come in and destroy the temple and and in a sense a good bit of the hebrew scriptures answer that question and the answer is given idolatry and injustice you you have not cared for the poor and lived out the law in that way and you have not followed the law the first law i am the lord your god who brought you out of the land of egypt you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself a graven image of heaven above or the earth below or the waters under the earth or what's in the waters under the earth you'll not make a graven image of the serpent and worship it now this gets riffed on in the desert wanderings with the snake on the pole this gets picked up in the new testament so on and so forth so all of these things are linked and all of these conversations go but but this is where this comes into being that chaos is not in the biblical picture and this again is what i think reformed theology gets right chaos is not the the lord can use chaos to achieve his ends now what do we think about that well that's complicated because we and i think this is in some ways where the christian church in american culture has gone wrong because the christian church has sometimes tried to have have a dualism where it's evil versus good and the biblical picture is not that the biblical picture is this god who is in complete command this is where we get the ideas of providence this god who is in complete command orchestrating history now now because the christian god is so large and and it is not a dualism because the christian god is so large this sets us up for the questions of the problem of evil and and the questions of well well why would god allow this to happen why would god allow rebellion to go forward and and sets us up to ask questions about what are god's motivations now the difficulty we have is that we can't answer these questions we can barely answer these questions for another person we always think we know what motivates someone else but most of the time we're wrong and most of the time our picture of that other person is far too low resolution because we don't know what they're really thinking we don't know the yumi and cloud of witnesses in the back of their head we don't know their childhood well do we think we can possibly know the motives of god and again this is another theme that comes out in the hebrew scriptures that um this is you know you can't go toe to toe with with with this being and i always tell people do not play chicken with god you you simply have to blink this is part of the message of the book of job and you'll find no other book in in the in the hebrew scriptures that deals with all of these issues of chaos and sea monsters and and the far breadth of creation more than the book of job so so here in the creation in genesis one um what he does in the first three days is he establishes functions what he does in days four through six is he establishes functionaries and day one separates light from darkness and day two creates the firmament now it's it's interesting to look at um to look at the firmament because i was just noting because this um this this is such a hot topic in terms of concordism scientific concordism with respect to christians if you go back to the niv 84 and you look at the firmament let there be an expanse and i think the the editors and of the niv in 1984 were looking for a word that that wouldn't force christians into the the the difficulty of recognizing that genesis one is a representation that depicts a firmament and the the word that's used a firmament here is is a word used essentially of a bronze bowl and and this is what you know this is what walton is talking about that and what john calvin is talking about that the genesis one representation is one that the ancient world would look at and it's one that's phenomenologically correct in terms of what we look at today so the niv 84 tends to punt uh let there be an expanse the english standard version which is a favorite version of a lot of reformed um conservatives also goes with expanse but i think that's punting so the niv 2011 the niv's continued to be updated they said vault now vault for those of us in english is a is a far more solid idea the new revised standard version um has you know let there be a dome um the lexem english bible which is which is an interesting translation used by um used by this particular bible software which is fun for tracking certain words they say let there be a vaulted dome the the net bible which is a particularly good one with a lot of good notes and if you um if you're looking for online sources the net bible the new english translation is is really an excellent option because they offer they offer good notes they go with expanse but now um refers to an expanse of air pressure between the surface of the world world and the clouds i i think that's i don't think that does us i don't think that does us any good um so this is this is what you deal with with biblical translations because biblical translations are all trying to deal with you know how to communicate this to an audience and all of these audiences for different bibles have market realities and so you know the niv when they you get to gender inclusive language not really getting into pronouns at all here i mean the world of translations is this whole other world so let me get back to okay where i was before so there we go so what you see in the first three days and john walton goes through this nicely in his book about the lost world of genesis one is he establishes the functions and what he goes through in days four through six is he establishes the functionaries now that's why you have the the the sun and the moon and the stars parallel to the first day because it's one through three four through six and they're parallel and and the sun and the moon are functionaries in the sky and in the in the fifth day you have the animals and the animals have their function to be fruitful and multiply and that's where you get the sea monster and create which i mentioned in the last video and and so you get fruitful and multiply and and what's interesting is that when you get to the animals and then to the sixth day and you have the man and the woman in the image of god and this is why i think there's a ton of debate throughout christian history about the image of god and probably it's not a yuna it's not a don't apply occam's razor to the to the image of god because an extremely broad category but but one thing that shouldn't be dismissed is the functional view of the image of god that the man and the woman function within creation functionally and i think this gets fleshed out in genesis 2 where in a sense they're gardeners and and you see at the beginning of genesis 2 this curious phrase that you know plants hadn't happened because there was no man to till the soil now that gets a lot into the question of what kind of plants are we talking about and i think that actually gets into the um the third day where the focus is on cultivation and and some people have have made the comment that this is in a sense the the genesis story is post agricultural revolution again i i mentioned jarrod diamonds guns germs and steel which was a fascinating book um but but so that you have this you have this agricultural revolution that happens and that's that's built into the story here now and this is where i'm going to set up the next video because this is something jordan peterson completely missed now there's there's lots of things lots of things he couldn't go into but one of the things he completely missed is that genesis one is a temple text without hesitation the ancient reader would conclude that this is a temple text and that the day seven is the most important of the seven days in a material account of set of in a material account day seven would have little role but in a functional account as we see it it is the true climax without which nothing else would make any sense or have any meaning how could reactions be so different the difference is the piece of information that everyone knew in the ancient world and to which most modern readers are totally oblivious if you watch that bio not the bio logos if you watch the veritas video that i started with john walt and he goes on to make the point that he lives in chicago and if you're commuting in chicago you turn on the radio and every 10 minutes you get a traffic update and they're telling you where there are accidents and and and some of the places that they're describing you can't even find on google maps but because you're on the ground locally you see things that say if you listen to an archival footage of traffic reports from the 1970s in chicago's it would sound completely crazy and not completely crazy because it's within our frame of reference but but walted makes the point that in a sense the bible well what he says a little bit later in the bible as a christian is written for us but it isn't written to us and the point that walted is making here is that ancient readers and this is what scholars do they try to get into this ancient mind ancient readers would read genesis 1 and say this is a temple text now you might say well what do you mean it's a temple text there's no temple in genesis 1 well that's exactly right but you have to understand it by the function and as we go through and next time i'm going to go through the relationship between chaos and order and temple and law and then jesus and then the book of revelation temple is critical if you wonder want to understand the functioning of the cosmos and and this again is going to get us right on this energized boundary line that jordan peterson is energizing because the in a sense that the the common thing that jordan peterson is energizing in his debates is well you know if if the if it is essential if we disregard i need a drink if we disregard the bible and its function in our history at our peril what should we do should we go to church should we pray jordan peterson says act as if this is true all right well what does that mean do i act as if i'm praying do i act as if i'm a christian do i go to church and take the lord's supper or the eucharist do i what does it and peterson again asked again and again what does it mean to believe this stuff well does it what does it mean to believe this stuff and and peterson is a pragmatist so he'll say to believe this stuff means to act on it and to act within this world okay what does it mean to act within this world now what you're going to wind up with is the question of worship which is within the secular frame of reference probably the craziest things christians do now again john walton makes a little point to evangelicals that behave badly some of them behave atrociously some of them behave immorally i'd say because they're human beings they all do i'm a calvinist we we i subscribe to a doctrine that is probably not best entitled total depravity i i think um it should better be described as pervasive depravity that that all of our life is tainted by sin and and all of our motives are impure and and the the evil in our hearts contaminates um the things that we do and we are constantly and i love that jordan peterson gets um the the etymology of the word sin everything that we do every everything that we do i can't even speak well as as one of my favorite commenters continues to remind me everything that we do misses the mark okay so so so the craziest thing that christians do i think is worship we get into a room and we we we say things to you know someone that doesn't seem to be there um we praise god from whom all blessings flow we give gifts and offerings that that go into the church and pay my salary and provide the electricity that i'm i'm currently using to to make these videos we um we we sing songs to god and and i think in the secular world i don't think we've paid enough attention this is the craziest thing we do yeah you know we've all done it and this is where again i really appreciate jordan peterson's perspective as a very pragmatic psychologist this these practices we do and like putting up a christmas tree the the connections to to german paganism are long gone but we still do it and then you know as you know christian missionaries and pagan germany did we take a symbol and we move it into and refill it with christian meaning well that's an interesting move um but but but in worship we you know we we go to church and we listen to someone teach the bible and we sing songs and well this is this is just this is just kind of this is just kind of crazy isn't it these kinds of things that we're doing well if yeah i can understand why it does sound crazy but if temple is at the center and now you're gonna then we're gonna have to deal with in the next video the relationship between temple and synagogue and the relationship between the body of christ which now the name of my church is living stones and if you look at the book of first peter and you look at chapter two i am a living stone following the living stone who is christ and the church is built it's a temple built from living stones and when the church gathers we say this is the body of christ now now how does this connect up with chaos and order well in many ways it connects up relationally for me the the church um the church is accountability the church says no to me on things and and i often tell people i you know without the accountability of the church who god only knows i love how peterson uses that uses that god only knows what i would become without the accountability of the church and and my and my atheist friends always say skeptical things say no paul you're a moral person and and and okay so maybe i would be a moral atheist but but god not only god knows i know the darkness in my heart and again one of the things that that continues that that that really persuaded me that i should listen to peterson and i know my christian friends well he doesn't treat the bible like he should and well he doesn't have a clear he doesn't have a clear profession of faith the kind that we would like to hear him and he he says well i don't want you putting me in that box blah blah blah blah when when he goes to auschwitz and he sees the ovens he doesn't say gosh those evil people we should deal with all those evil people he says and and again he broke down during that glenn beck show and that that really touched me he says i am capable of this you know when we get to so we're just we're just leaving we left the advent season we're in the christmas season in terms of the liturgical calendar we're going to eventually get to advent and and one of the moves of advent is that we are responsible for jesus death we took an innocent man and and we take innocent people all the time and and they are ground up by this world this is me i i can't separate myself from me i bring chaos into the world by letting chaos into my life and and you know the god of the bible uses chaos to basically he says you want chaos i'll give you what you ask for so genesis one is a temple text how could it how could reactions be so different the difference is that piece of information that everyone knew in the ancient world and to which modern reader readers are totally oblivious deity rests in a temple and only in a temple this is what temples were built for we might even say that this is what a temple is a place for divine rest perhaps even more significant in some texts the construction of a temple is associated with cosmic creation now again if you look at the ancient world and the ancient world egypt okay consider the level of poverty that was in egypt think about what percentage of their gross domestic product they devoted to building temples and pyramids and obelisks and monuments why would they devote something so much why would they devote so many of their resources to building that and go throughout the ancient world and say why did these ancient civilizations invest everything in building these now i'm i'm not a big computer gamer but there's one computer game that can lose me for hours and that game is civilization and if you play i'm playing civilization six now and enjoying it but civilization is a long game and one of the things you build in civilization are wonders and in the ancient world you build wonders now we get to the modern world the contemporary world we're not devoting you know what our what are our gods in the modern world well follow the money what do we spend our money on where does our money go money tells the tale and so in the ancient world they built temples why because it was they believed part of their national existence now this is going to get into some really interesting conversations for us about this debate between um between brett weinstein and jordan peterson about what is the top level story what is that what is base reality is it the physical level or is it the story level so well what does divine rest entail most of us think that rest is a disengagement from cares worries and tasks of life what comes to mind is sleeping or taking a nap but in the ancient world rest is the result of and i didn't put in the next page of the divine having a completed his work and so this is why at the end of the story god looks and says it is very good and then he rests from his labors and in a sense what that means is he it is complete now this is going to become interesting when you get to the new testament and jesus is wrangling with the religious leaders of his day over sabbath observance because the conversation over sabbath observance has everything to do with rest and the reason jesus heals on the sabbath is because he is restoring creation now if you look at the dominant themes of let's say my camp of reform theology we have creation i'd like to say it this way we have um we have creation rebellion restitution and it's creation fall redemption renewal so but i i think fall fall is too passive uh c.s lewis is more right that we are rebels who have to lay down our arms it is creation rebellion redemption restoration that is one way to understand the story of the bible and and here in at the end of genesis 1 and into genesis 2 this is a temple text and so in my next video i'm going to get into the question of temple but that is going to really lead us into this question of um well what then is the relationship between the physical world and the story world does the story world dominate what what what does the word spiritual mean and you know and you just look at i'll talk about more of that later oh one of the things that we're going to get into is representations and now this is an artistic representation of um the cosmos as imagined as represented by genesis chapter 1 and so you have the you have the firmament you have the stars the sun the moon and the stars governing it you have the separation between the waters and the dry land you see the uh the tannin the sea monsters under there the leviathan you see shiel the world below you see the pillars you see the firmament you see the great sea above and on top of that is the temple now um if if we are clueless to the if to the fact that genesis 1 is a temple text we are also clueless to the question which which occurred to me about a year or so ago why is there no altar in the garden why is there no temple in the garden because in a sense and the clue is in the word garden because a garden is not a field if you think about the gardens of versailles if you think about the hanging gardens of babalon the garden of eden is in a sense the lord's hanging gardens of nebuchadnezzar and in the next one we're going to talk about the rivalry between empire and the kingdom of god because this is a major theme in the scripture but but this here is a representation of the world for the hebra's now it's important that we remember that this is a representation because every representation is a map of what it is we're looking for and this gets into and i think peterson again has been extremely helpful in helping us realize some of the phenomenology about representations and maps of meaning this right here is a map of meaning of genesis 1 and i believe you cannot really understand the story of the bible unless you understand this representation this map of meaning because this map will orient the entire story of the bible and as i talked about in some of my earlier videos i think this is part of the reason that you know i know some people who are reconverting to a flat earth and they're doing it for religious reasons now i personally do not believe in a flat earth but if they are really trying to inhabit this world in a sense what they are doing by what they are doing by embracing a flat earth representationally are they are saying i am trying to live into this fandom of the bible now here are some representations if you google do an image search of goal of solar system on google now here are representations and and you very quickly look at this and say yeah yeah this is this is it you've got the sun and you've got the planets but but i want you to pay attention here to all of these different representations and some of these representations they are um oh i can maybe i'll leave the cursor thing out and some of these representations they are trying to show the size of the sun relative to the size of the planets in some of these representations they are trying to give a sense of orbit but um anyone who knows anything about the solar system knows that this representation is not in any way accurate to the let's say the size of these orbits these orbits are enormous um and and so each of these representations in order to illustrate something has to it has to prioritize certain aspects in order to illustrate all representations suffer from this and and it's a factor of a lot of the psychology that jordan peterson goes through in his classes if you want to communicate you fundamentally have to prioritize and if you are prioritizing you are likely distorting because you cannot actually create a representation of the solar system besides the solar system well in a sense you would have to duplicate it but now you have the problem of human beings in that you can't duplicate it in your head everything in your head is a representation in other words you have to figure out how to take the real thing and get it into your brain and that's going to involve reduction and prioritization and representations and this is why i say this is a representation and this is a representation and you'd better understand what representations are and so here on this one you have relative size of the planets here on this one you have okay now we have orbits this one is trying to show orbits but obviously the the scope of representation where you stand in the representation also impacts the representation and the scale here's here's another interesting one and here's another interesting one and here's another interesting one so so what you see is that representations in order for them to work must prioritize aspects and illuminate aspects at the expense of others this illuminates aspects of the biblical story at the expense of others each of these representations illuminate aspects with at the expense of others when i hopefully someday i'll get into cs lewis's miracles book because cs lewis gets into this in a vitally important way to help us understand the nature of logos and language what is nature where are we and and and here's the thing from our eyeballs what does going to space look like it looks like stuff like this you know if you are going up into orbit you're going to be looking out a little window or looking out through a spacesuit so the representations of this actually if you'd ask say an astronaut what does it look like to go into space well i get up in the morning and i brush my teeth and i i drive to work and i go through all the process that they get me ready and then i walk through this gang plate and i get in this rocket and off we go and then i look out this little window and then we take pictures as human beings and and this again why in this ongoing debate between the story which level is higher the physical story see see and this is why i say we cannot appropriate the physical world and i think this is what peterson shows us with respect to cont and one of the big points that peterson makes you might we recognize that there's an objective world out there and we recognize that all of our experience with that objective physical world is in many ways dependent on that world but what peterson is also saying is that we cannot appropriate and and by what by that i mean we cannot talk about it we cannot engage it we cannot deal with it without storifying it in some ways and in some ways when i'm thinking about logos and chaos and peterson and jonathan pageau let's see if i get his name right i had a thing on this too that i listened to last night we cannot appropriate this physical world without the story world it is it is simply it is it is like saying i cannot do math without numbers it is not it is like saying i cannot think philosophy without language now you might say well math exists without numbers and perhaps theoretically so but i can't engage with it without numbers and i can't engage with philosophy without language and i can't engage within this physical world without the story world and and i think that's the point of this entire endeavor so how much has changed the future is up there i was thinking about this with respect to the you know the the great that this jordan peterson likes to talk about the um you know the great works of art and why the great works of art and why you know millions of people go to the sistine chapel and um look at the sistine chapel and millions of people go to the great museums in the getty or new york city and ponder well i that's a really important point but follow the money um millions and billions of dollars are going into the avengers and superman and and star wars how much has changed in a sense something deep within us still fundamentally believes that chaos is coming from above you know watch the the avengers movie um chaos is coming from above look at the look at the storyline of the marvel world you've got guardians of the galaxy you've got all of this going on this is a this is a this is a cosmic story and now now we might imagine a hebrew saying yeah out there there's ocean uh again a fascinating book that i've been reading 1493 you know europe imagined itself surrounded by ocean and you know they did really know that the world was round they thought it was kind of pear-shaped but you know they go out and well after we conquered the ocean well the final frontier star trek it's space so and what is space it is uninhabitable now my questions are going to be about peterson's use of potential and i'm still thinking about that i'm not thinking about that in terms of his use of the word chaos i'm thinking about how well that necessarily lines up with the biblical use and and i think i can accept that if i understand it within the genesis one framework where in a sense what genesis one says is that the lord creates the cosmos by his word by the logos and um and it is it is the ordered cosmos that has potential because by nature the definition of the the pre cosmic state as john walton likes to say is that it is fundamentally unproductive and the definition of unproductive basically is impotent and impotent essentially means without potential now the bible is going to riff on this because you'll notice that you know you know the man and the woman are kicked out of the garden and they go into the field now the field is kind of a twilight zone it's not fully wilderness but it's not a garden and so now in a sense the function of the man is going to be his um is going to be the function he was created to do he must be fruitful and multiply and he will continue to do so but he will do so by the sweat of his brow and and the woman will continue to be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth with humanity but she will do so at the threat of her life and and and through great pain and great turmoil and then of course we set up the great genesis three um the curses and then the prophecy to the woman that the serpent will always be attacking her and and and she will have a son and who is that son going to be and and the serpent will then the son the son will crush the head of the serpent well what does that mean but but but the serpent will bruise his heel what does that mean in the chaos symbolic representation now we're gonna have to get into that later with again there's chaos and order and temple and law and then christ so that is what i've got for today and i'll post it this evening at some point thanks for watching again i've got on my head to try and do some shorter things but i i think i'll be able to do shorter things when i have things more sorted out um i i'm still processing peterson he's he's not easy to process i'm peterson in a sense processes a lot of what he's doing is processing out loud which means he doesn't finish sentences he doesn't finish his points and as someone who is trying to organize my thoughts and travel through his biblical series every he's always jumping around which is exactly what i do um but uh there's a benefit to that because i can keep it interesting because we're always hitting different points but the liability to that is getting uh getting a focused thought which is why i think in some ways the transliminal interviews are really helpful because what what jordan levin is essentially doing is framing it he's adding logos to the chaos of peterson and he's framing him and he's making peterson follow a track and that's really helpful for us and it's i'm sure it's also helpful for jordan peterson too because and this is again kind of the difference between that i talked about in my last video biblical theology and systematic theology to systematize it we put it all together so again thanks for watching thanks for your comments and have a great day
