 computer. Oh okay this is Paul and I'm having a conversation this evening with a friend of mine that I have been in a strange way pen pals with for almost 20 years but we've never actually met in person and his name is is Reverend David Snapper and I just want to appreciate you David for being willing to come on and talk this evening and why don't you tell us Paul why don't you tell a little bit about yourself I know a lot of a lot of the people who watch my channel are curious about church and ministry and some of these things how did how did when did you first decide you wanted to become a pastor I Paul I was teaching school in Montana I was a young man I taught school two years I was a math and physics student taught chemistry and then I was in the school and I loved the kids and working with kids and decided that I'd heard a call to spend more of my time working on the spiritual life of the kids more than physics and geometry okay so I went to school and became a pastor and you you did some you did some prison ministry in Grand Rapids or something like that that's right I went to school for five years in Michigan and during that time I spent about three years as a chaplain to a jail in the county I was coerced by the sheriff in charge of the of the jail he cornered me with several deputies and and and their guns persuaded me that I needed to be their chaplain that conversation so for about three years I and another close friend were chaplains to a group of young men who had sentences less than a year and so they've been convicted of a either a serious misdemeanor or minor felonies I forget the exact details of it but in those days marijuana was a serious crime and and so they would come their nonviolent offenders for sentence less than a year and my friend and I had the opportunity to speak to hundreds of these young people as they move through the jail system and and what so that was a huge part of this and and what what kind of takeaway did you have from that experience well I think one of the most dramatic moments of my life at that point was one of the prisoners came up to me afterwards and he said you know we prayed the Lord's Prayer and it begins our father which art in heaven in those days I was King James so it went in that language and the kid said you know I have kind of hard time with that because my dad he's an alcoholic my mom is kind of heavy on drugs but she buys me beer and then my dad beats me because I'm drinking beer like he does it's hard for me to think God in heaven is a good idea and I realized we had an incredible communications gap that we really needed to to cross these young people needed some kind of hope and encouragement and wisdom and leadership and they weren't finding it so that was one of those moments that really defined my growing and then you you went on and you planted a church up in Washington State what was that like well it was four years in Minnesota that was like cold and then we did come to Washington State in 1984 and we came to a small town called Silverdale Washington which is the home of the West Coast Trident submarine fleet and then naval shipyard of Bremerton and so we were surrounded by Navy people coming and going young families in the military coming and going we did plan to church in 1984 and I served as the pastor for 30 years Wow yeah I retired in 2014 and since then I've been employed just variously just enjoying a variety of things okay okay now one of the one of the things you did in the in the last number of recent years as you have you wrote a study on forgiveness and a you know a whole course on forgiveness what now that obviously was after you'd been a church plant for quite a while and after your experience with with prison many what ministry what motivated you to want to write about forgiveness well I'd like to tell you a great story but the fact is I'll just tell you the truth instead the truth is that nobody had taught me how to forgive I've been told I need to forgive ought to forgive should forgive I was told I'll feel better if I forget but no one told me and I found myself three or four times in my life from my youth on up to to that time hurt in very deep way that one time or another and I and I didn't know what to do to undo the hurts that I've experienced so the forgiveness workshop came about first of all as my own need to figure out how to get past my past and then as I told my friends in the congregation what happened to me they said well tell us and so I told them and they said well let's tell some more people one thing led to another and I've been sharing this wonderful strategy and so it's a great gift of how to forgive everywhere everywhere I had the chance okay so that's what brings me here okay um did you find in your ministry that there are a lot of people who had issues with forgiveness or were bound or imprisoned by bitterness of one sort or another you know I have said this and sometimes I think people don't hear this very well but I really think it's true that when people harbor a hurt they stop trusting people and they stop believing people and they stop taking people seriously they're always looking for how somebody's trying to gain them or trick them or to get an advantage of them and so imagine that you have an elder or a deacon or a leader of any sort and they don't trust their pastor and they just carry resentment in her or the pastor doesn't trust his leadership team because he was in a church where the leadership team cheated him well it makes it just for impossible relations if we don't trust each other so yeah I do I believe it's a very significant factor in the in the well-being and the relationships in churches and really everywhere of course okay so so what's your so what's your what's your thing here I think you're exactly right I think you hear tell you we tell people to forgive but I think you're exactly right I think well why do you think forgiveness is so hard for people okay I'm I didn't hear that very well Paul okay why why do you why is forgiveness so difficult people people say oh you should forgive I mean CS Lewis had this great line that everybody thinks forgiveness is idea is a great idea they actually have something to forgive so why is letting go so hard well I I tell you why I think it's so hard because when we're hurt when we're really hurt then we become confused we I say it this way hurt is anything that comes into my life that changes my view about myself my view of the rules of the world from realistic to unrealistic and it's that unrealistic part that makes it so difficult to deal with forgiveness I will say have you ever heard someone say my computer hates me yeah yeah well that's unrealistic there's some people from Microsoft that think that way but but we say this car doesn't like me or so and so it doesn't like me and we we start to create a fantasy world based on our our hurts and our fantasy world is designed in our minds to support our hurt view of the world and so for people that forgive they almost have to step outside of their own thinking for a while to to reconsider are the things that I believed really true or not and that has been the most difficult starting point in in the in the area for forgiveness people just so lock on to their emotion and the the events that they have to to underlying those motions it's difficult to unwrap that that's the challenge but now for you know for example of the the person that you met in prison who talked about you know how his father was an alcoholic and his mother you know was a drug user and his father would beat him I mean that's a that's a real hurt and and you know when that takes up residence especially when you're young and especially if you've lived in that for years that's that's a pretty significant thing and you know I can understand how how how someone who has had that experience now you know let alone being able to trust a heavenly father but but but deal with people all around them why why would they want to trust people and not I think is precisely the problem once you've lost your trust in the rules of the world that the rules are fair the rules are reasonable that you'll get a fair shake in this world once you lose that confidence your mind your imagination can take you anywhere you can create any kind of fantasy world you want and that I think is the hardest part about forgiving but but you're a Calvinist pastor right and and doesn't don't Calvinists believe that people in the world do hurt us and and aren't fair and break rules you know maybe they're maybe their fear is rational because isn't this how people are well that's true right the world is full of hurt but they come to this they come to this problem or they believe that they're innocent because they know they didn't this young man didn't cause this problem but his parents did his parents have told him all along they're right and he's wrong and he can't sort all that out as a child I think my first experience when I was in sixth grade I was brand new kid in the school I moved several times because my father's career in the Marine Corps I was plunked down into a sixth grade class in the middle of the year five minutes later the teacher dragged me out of the class by the back of the neck and yelled at me up one side and down the other outside the hallway brought me back to class tears running down my face and I didn't know how to assimilate that kind of experience my brain at age 12 couldn't figure that out so I told people and I said this wasn't right and they would say to me no it's okay it's okay just consider the source let bygones be bygones get over it well it took me 17 years to get over that kind of hurt and it created a lot of trouble for me in my life okay so so what did you do what did you do what did I do yeah well that was not a good one because it took me a long time and I went a lot of places I shouldn't have gone isn't that isn't that what everyone does I mean well it is yes it is it is that I mean right so I think my story is typical I don't think my story is atypical and I got into a lot of trouble I think it was the cause for me being kicked out of school a time or two and doing poorly at school and wait I thought pastors were perfect people and never did anything wrong and that's why you get up you're allowed to be a pastor now you're telling me something different you're a troublemaker that's exactly right yes I was I did suffer I had I say it was like the the events steal a part of your life and my belief that my teacher loved me and trusted me and was looking out for any believe me all of that belief about the rules of the world was changed in an instant my belief about myself that I was an okay little kid just a normal little Calvinist kid doing fine and God was looking out for me and my mom and dad were looking out for me everybody was on my side that was gone in ten seconds Wow and I believed five minutes later that I would never have a friend again I was so humiliated and embarrassed that I thought it would be impossible to get past that event and like I say it took me 17 years I was 29 when we got through it and and and this is you know and you know again a lot of people think that pastors live lives wrapped in bubble wrap and we're somehow unaware of the bad things that happen in the world and they don't understand that people drag themselves into our office and vomit the the most painful worst things of their lives you know onto the table in front of us and say here pastor you sort this out and I mean in your story I don't want to minimize I don't want to minimize your story but you and I have both heard stories of you know the kind of pain that is that is just unimaginable and and it's commonly out there my story I tell it right sometimes I do this in a workshop and I tell my story and I tell it because it's so small I mean really my sixth grade teacher yelled at me unfairly I mean really come on get over it's pretty small pretty small potatoes compared to what happens to some people but for me it it destroyed my belief and convictions about myself in the world and once I learned how to get through this I decided I wanted to help other people who are in a similar kind of situation that might not know how to get through this because I told a lot of people and I was asking for help and people just didn't take it seriously and it was it was painful I wanted to do what I could do to to show someone else how to get through it okay okay so is this where the bucket comes in tell me about the bucket because you said you know it's a forgiveness thing but it has to do with a bucket and I thought well that must be some bucket to deal with hurts and those kind of things well let me give you a little story first okay Linda Ronstadt sang a song silver threads and golden needles cannot mend this heart of mine I remember and she sang about the tragedies of her love life and and she could have this wonderful mansion on a hill but if her heart was broken nothing else was good enough and so even silver thread with a golden needle couldn't fix the terror in her heart so that was true for for me and it's been true for for many of us so let me give you a story here I'm sitting in my office now 10 12 years later ago from now and a young girl came in a high school girl I supervised community service all through my career girl came into my office and when she said I have community service to do appointed by the court by my by my parole officer he sent me over here to do community service and I said great how many hours do you have to do and she said well I have 60 hours worth of work to do I said great what'd you do she said well I was shoplifting and I said 60 hours for shoplifting would you shoplift it's just well well that junk jewelry you know from Coles and I said that's a lot of hours she said well it's the third time I said oh why did you shoplift what were you thinking she said I hate my mother I said hey your mother she says why do you hate your mother she says she drove my father away and I said he drove your father away what do you mean she says my father and mother had a fight and my father went to live with his girlfriend in Arizona and he loves his girlfriend more than he loves me so I hate my mother the only way I can fill up the empty space in my life is to steal stuff and I tell you the first time I heard that sort of thing I was just absolutely blown away and I had a bucket I'm back to the bucket now and you can see it here I hope yeah there's nothing magical about the bucket you got it in here well what I found was was that people carry this bucket and it's full of things I'm not gonna try to tip it over but my bucket is full of the time I didn't measure up and I carry that and I go down the street and people dock and if you've been to a jail everybody's been framed and people carry these things and somebody else here see I don't know if you can see my my cheesy little props here but people give me the brush off you know you all have a career as a as a White House um you know press agent or something with all the props although that guy's out of work now so what I don't go yeah well I've got a box I've got a box full of these things here the latest one of them is I was in a church yesterday or two days ago preaching and I stole one of their mugs by accident and now it's in my bucket and I'm feeling guilty about it well here's the deal people get hurt and they lose their dad or they lose their mom they lose their job instead of this grand landscape of the way their life should have been there's a hole right where their job should have been or their daddy should have been or the mommy should have been or or whatever they lost there's a big hole and I use this bucket to symbolize that and what we'll do is fill this empty spot in our lives with anything bad man hurts we'll try to put money in there we'll try to put girlfriends in their boyfriends in there we'll try to put jobs in there we'll do whatever we can do but this bucket gets heavy and we carry around with us for years I mean I'm the you know the poster child for mismanagement here but for 17 years I carried my bucket full of hurt with me and I don't know if you can see the padding here that represents how we try to pad the weight so it doesn't cut into our fingers and we give classes on anger management and coping skills and I'm saying how dumb is that why do we manage our anger we're not trying to make it go away that's a way better way to deal with our hurt so the first time I use my bucket I'm in the jail and I give it to a young man I'm gonna start filling it up with heavy weights pretty soon this guy's straining and I know I'm gonna beat him because I tell him I'm a preacher and I can preach forever and he can't hold it as long as I can talk the chapel and there's all these young men watching this great big man holding this bucket and his finger or his hands start trembling and his fingers leave twirls and he holds it over shoulders back and I realize that one more rock and he's gonna fall down or he's gonna drop it and I can't because I can go home and that man's gonna have to face everybody else if he's weak and what I learned over 40 some odd years with a bucket no one has ever put the bucket down no one has ever gotten up from the audience to help the guy who's struggling and no one holding the bucket has asked for help we will let our arms fall out of our sockets but we won't ask for help and we won't help somebody in pain it's a crazy thing now I know people do help I'm exaggerating but the concept I've watched mothers with tears running down their faces as their child's holding the bucket in desperate pain and mom will sit there and not get up and help her child. Okay so there's okay and that's what hurt does to us and we need to empty that bucket out and fill it with something better instead of something awful. So so how do you so okay let me let me see if I get this straight so the bucket represents so when when someone hurts us it creates kind of a hole in us and we feel that emptiness we feel that hole and so then we try to stuff it with things and and we and and I we usually stuff it with we stuff it with things that we think are gonna be meaningful to us we maybe stuff it with things that are gonna distract us we maybe stuff it with things that are gonna give us short-term pleasures but we try to fill that hole and we we keep putting stuff in it it gets heavier and heavier and and it gets harder and harder to manage in your life and and so what I guess I hear you saying is well I would I would extrapolate on this a little bit that you know that I bet you if you have somebody holding that bucket in the jail you try and talk to them and the longer they hold that bucket the crankier they get and the you know because they're all they're doing is thinking about that darn bucket and so people around them become more and more irritating to them and it starts to I mean I could imagine that starts to take out their life so they've got they've got all this stuff in the bucket and and they well they don't even know they I mean they have a hurt but they probably don't connect that hurt with the whole or the stuff that they put in it right well that's one of the real problems of it it confuses us remember that first definition is hurt confuses us okay and you're right they they don't make all the connections and pretty soon the whole world is hurt the whole world is unfair and they spend their whole life getting ahead getting rich getting back getting even but there's adrenaline there's power there's dynamic some people love to feel like victims and other people like to feel like they're aggressors and it takes a hundred shapes and forms but one way or another a lot of us spend our time trying to fill up that empty spot to compensate for what we lost so so what brings people to want to deal with this bucket and to actually even see the bucket what what what causes that well sometimes there's some what causes them to to be willing to look in their own bucket yeah sometimes it gets so heavy they break they their arms just fall off holding the bucket or their kid runs away from home and gets in trouble and they say what have I done wrong well there's 101 things that will bring the person to that point and because I had a huge interest in helping myself and then secondly helping other people once I figured it out I realized how long the process it is you can't just walk up to someone and say hey I think we're gonna dump out your bucket life's gonna be good you know have a nice life you know they've spent 20 years filling this bucket and nurturing and caring for their life becomes built around this hurt and so I mean I'm sitting at a table with a woman who is older than I am she was probably 80 and she said to me after the end of a workshop she said I've never told this to anybody before but at age 10 I was molested and I've carried that in my bucket for 70 years or whatever the exact time was and it's just been way down on the bottom and everywhere I go it's there when I get up in the morning when I go to bed at night I know what happened I don't tell anybody and nobody knows and I said we have to empty that out and get that out of there and I'm glad to tell you that that's exactly what happened that day because she was able to tell about it for the first time and stop being afraid of it and she started the process of emptying the hurt out of her bucket so Ternier the great the great does Swiss psychiatrist would say that hurt is the emotion that doesn't self heal if you're happy if you go to bed happy at night you're there's no guarantee you'll wake up just laughing and giggling in the morning you can wake up cranky in the morning but if you go to bed cranky chance are you gonna wake up cranky because cranky doesn't go away sits in the bottom of the bucket will stay there a long time so so okay so how do you get the hurt out now this this woman she had to talk about she had to talk about what had happened to her when she was a child what you mean because you've got a church full of people I mean are you you kind of play therapist to these people or how does this work well it's it's it you want to be careful about this of course because you can't you can't spend your time being the junior therapist but I do workshop and that helps okay so here so I go through four steps okay and would you like to hear the four steps yes please okay so number one and so for everyone who's listening I hope you give this a try my goal was to make the Betty Crocker version of forgiveness it's not a wedding cake it's not a the birthday cake it's just any old cake but it's going to work to the best of my ability and that's my absolute conviction and commitment is I want everybody to have a chance to forgive it's the best gift that you can have so I'm gonna put my bucket down for a minute here number one what am I angry about in ten words or less what makes me mad what did I lose what did someone steal from me so if I don't use the bucket I can use the image of the Grand Canyon you're standing there looking at the landscape and all of a sudden there's this gigantic hole somebody took all that dirt away where did it go and that's what I'd like to ask everybody if you're one of the hurt people in the world what did you lose can you say it in ten words or less your innocence your naivete your job your spouse your money your whatever it is what can you say is what you lost the secondly what have you put into your bucket to compensate for what you've lost busyness jobs activity clothes shopping abusing people letting people abuse you you do something to compensate for what you have lost now that's the first step what it is that you lost and what did you do to replace it with something else it was a substitute number two what's it worth to you what you lost the grammar that wasn't very good but I think the concept what was the value of what you lost from your life if a child was stolen from you that's an enormous loss you lost a job that could be an enormous lost for me in sixth grade I lost my dignity and my pride it wasn't very much in one sense but it was the only dignity and pride I had that was that I was I was done I was done at age 12 my life was over I had decided so so the second question I want to ask you your ask you this what is the value of what you lost now people say I tried to forgive but it didn't work well I want you to take the risk and do something that's very very difficult put a dollar amount on what you lost now Peterson says we need these old Bible accounts because they're part of our cultural evolutionary Jordan Jordan yes and you're talking about Jordan yes yes yeah and so from the little I know that what you've said he says we need these well one of those that comes to us it's nearly 3,500 years old goes like this from the book of Exodus chapter 22 it says if I steal your cow I owe you five cows if I steal your sheep I owe you four sheep God wasn't afraid to put a price tag on her five cows I steal your cow and I have your cow for dinner five cows makes us good four sheep makes us good no why four sheep and five cows I don't know that's just the way it was right who knows but that's the way it was when another character in the Bible decided to repent of his sins he told Jesus his name is the keyist he said I'll take everything I have half of it I'll give away because this guy was a crook he was a Roman tax collector and corrupt and dishonest he says every half of what I own I'll give away of everything that I've stolen I'll give back four times to the people I stole it from and Jesus says today salvation has come to this house because this is the son of Abraham well what's going on there is that this man is coming back and saying I'm wrong I need to repent and I need to be forgiven and the way God says to forgive is to give back four times everything I stole and Jesus says good enough because you have to know the value of what you lost it's really hard to forgive if you don't know what it is okay so here's what I do I do this a couple ways and in workshop we've got an hour to work on this so it's a little more fun but if you're watching here try this what would you give if you're standing in front of the judge of a court and the judge says okay what would you like in order to compensate you for all your claims that for the damages done to you and you take this amount I'll give you whatever you want and then you'll drop your charges against the person who hurt you what would that amount be would you sell for a hundred bucks or a thousand or five thousand or ten thousand what number would you take that's what we're talking about here how much is your life worth how much was your view of yourself and your view of the world that was twisted around by that event worth to you here's another way to count what it's worth because I really believe that because I came from math and physics the counting really matters and Exodus tells us it does matter five cows four sheep numbers matter I say how many hours have you thought about your hurt in the past 30 years and if it's a really hurt person they'll tell you I don't ever stop thinking about it I wake up in the morning and I get in the shower and I look around the shower and I look for who's there I get in my car and I wonder who's there to hurt me rules of the worldview of myself I'm weak and I'm unable I can't stop this I'm gonna be hurt no matter what I do because people know me as a victim whatever I do I'm gonna fail okay what's your time worth mmm $20 an hour let's just say because I can multiply 20 pretty easily times 10 hours a day that I'm awake so $200 a day is my loss times 300 days a year seven thousand some odd dollars a year 10 is 30 years now I've lost the numbers in my head now we're gonna multiply times four now what is that hurt worth and you're gonna come out with a huge number people object and say oh you can't do that because you can't put a price on that and I say well what would you give to make it so it never happened and then we'll say I would give everything I own to undo the hurt that happened to me right that's what hurt is now not everybody's hurt like that but that's the people I want to talk to and here's what I want to say you'll never be able to fill that hole with synthetic replacements with money cars you name it pity whatever you try it won't be enough you will spend your whole life trying to fix what can't be broken and that gives us to point number three remember the bucket and I I'm saying this guy's holding the bucket his fingers are about to come out of the sockets here's my bucket back on screen you have to pay this guy union wages I don't know Isaiah in one of those great stories that it formed our cultural heritage says there will come someone who will carry our infirmities he will take up our infirmities and carry our sorrows nobody ever puts the bucket down nobody asks for help and nobody gets up and helps fill in the Grand Canyon or help carry the bucket but what if somebody came along who was good enough that they would carry the bucket with you or take it from you that's the only way to get rid of this kind of bucket you can't hold it forever it would just wear you out you're ruining your life but if somebody takes it from you then you have a chance so I'm a Christian pastor and I I've talked to so many kids in jail and adults and and people and and it just doesn't occur to us very quickly we don't have to carry all this and we aren't going to get compensated work the person who hurt you once will hurt you again they're not going to give you the ten million dollars that you deserve because they went off to Arizona and live with her girlfriend they're not going to come back and make your life right they didn't care the first time they're not going to come back short of America what you can do is forgive and forgiveness means that I will bulldoze all the bad memories and the bad behaviors out of my life and I'll send them far away from me I'll make a decision to stop doing the self destructive things that happen and again I I'm seeing your lobster behind you and remembering Jordan Peterson and and if I understand right he's talking to people who are living in the basements of the moms homes you think you've got to get up and you got to do stuff right you got to clean your room clean your room bucko yeah go clean your room right that's it gives one need to start there in your room start start with something you can manage start with a room okay so clean your room and when you've done that then let's address all those hurts that paralyze us they just stop us from going forward because we're we're believe we're unable to stop the hurts so let me go back to sixth grade why did it take me so long to forgive my sixth grade teacher I thought I was mad at him I wasn't mad at him I thought I was mad at my mother and father I wasn't mad at him I thought I was mad at the school the principal the principal of the school I wasn't mad at the principal I was devastated to realize that I was so insignificant but I couldn't stop them from treating me badly and that was a hard thing to come to terms with but I am not as strong and smart and powerful and capable as I would like to think I have to have the courage to do things that are frightening and difficult and that I will fail at but the one thing I can start with to clean my room to clean my spiritual room and empty my bucket and say I'm not going to go back there and live anymore I mean I bulldoze that life and I'm gonna fill it with something good and pure to replace what I lost with something good and pure so if this is now number four so number three is I'm gonna stop focusing on my heart I'm just gonna I'm gonna stop making it the center of my life it is the son of my solar system and it happens so fast it happened to me five minutes I'm gonna make that Sun go away and I'm gonna replace my that old Sun with something pure and true and lovely and I'm gonna let that be the center of my life and fill my bucket so number three is get rid of my focus on my hurts and then number four it is to replace that hurt with something lovely and true and good so as a Christian pastor I think if I've lost a brother my brother's treated me badly could it be that there's a brother who's perfect and good and could come in and fill that place in my life that role in my life is there somebody who could be a new father to me is there somebody who could come in and give me a new spirit in my life and I'm saying that's the Christian message that there's a God who doesn't just love us and think nice thoughts about us and send us hallmark cards but he really came down to die because when you really hurt the only thing that's good enough for the price to pay the price of the hurt this hurt only hurt can pay for hurt and he came to die for us to carry our hurt to carry our bucket and to find that empty spot in our life and fix it and to fill it with his own goodness and so the fourth stage of hurt is to fill the empty spot with the good things of God that don't ruin us and wear us out it's not perfect I wish I wish it had never happened in sixth grade you know it took a lot from me in my life to have that happen on the other hand I wouldn't undo it at this point because it made me the character that I am and I can help somebody else and I can find the peace and the healing that I've looked for not the way I wanted it not the way I wanted it to happen but it's good enough in a broken world and we are Calvinist and it is a broken world it's not it's not just not quite as good as it ought to be it's broken but there in that brokenness I found reconciliation and restoration so if in your experience of doing this seminar what what kinds of things have people told you about what have they what have they learned in this and what what new things have they done because you mentioned you've got to fill it with something and you know that the the difficulty is that you know nature of whores a vacuum and so if you just decide well here's this here's this negative stuff that I'm doing I'm not gonna play computer games ten hours a day I'm you know what does that look like well the first thing that people ask and this is you know you hear things after a while you realize it's it's it's common I say what will you do they say I don't know what I'll do with all my spare time though hmm they they literally are suddenly aware that they have been investing a great deal of their time in fussing about what's gone wrong complaining whining fighting arguing just filling theirself with a motion filled adrenaline filled events to keep them from seeing what's really bothering them and take all that away it's like a whole new life comes in front of them they have to repopulate their their world I wish I'd spend in the times I've done this this workshop more time on step four hmm is it it's harder than it looks to rebuild the world because if you really believe that you're broken and the rules of the world are broken and you have an unreal view of the world it's really hard to straighten that back out and suddenly everything's okay because you're you you if you've been relying on alcohol for 20 years you think that way and it takes a long time to rebuild a realistic view of the world so that's what I would do I tell you my favorite one was a guy had cost he had lost about a hundred thousand dollars in a legal battle that he probably was innocent of and so he came to the end of this and he looked at me and he says you know I'm gonna forgive him but could I kill him first that was one of my very favorites but what that means is people can joke about it it's now okay emotional level has gone down the drama has gone down the way to the bucket and they're okay do you think people need to hear permission to let go of these claims and grievances that they have even for people who are who are dead I mean is I mean that's see there seems to be something to that that there's people people imagine that you know somehow they're holding justice together in the universe last a little bit of your voice there do they need my permission well it sounds like they need someone to give them permission to let go of their claim because they could you try that again I lost it seems like it's I think I think people seem to need have someone give them permission to let go of their claim that they imagine that the justice of the universe is dependent upon them to hold the these claims against people even people who are long dead you know I in the in the workshop that I did I have a little little action step on that area I tell you I'm deeply concerned for that exact question because many people believe they must not forgive because then justice would be subverted the world would come to an end as we know it and they would lose terribly because the other person got away with and I just can't tell you how much I disagree with that I just think that is so wrong when you forgive you will find yourself if your experience is at all like mine my several experiences you will find yourself doing the very thing that God did when he forgave us right he didn't forgive us because we were perfect he forgave us when we couldn't figure it out on our own when we wouldn't we're running in rebellious he forgives us so just imagine a little imagination game is God sitting up there in heaven and saying oh there's there's Dave snapper well I'm just gonna have so much fun I'm gonna crush that sucker I'm gonna find him one day and I'm gonna make him hurt so bad is gonna be so good and just will be sir mm-hmm no no that's that's monstrous right if we forgive we experience the greatest gift of the world that I am so confident in my relationship to God that I don't need to hurt somebody else or get justice to revenge in order to be okay now justice happens that you know this passage from Exodus we read earlier the village gets justice that's why we have county sheriffs and if the county sheriffs and the city sheriffs don't get it together then God's gonna have justice what we do in forgiving and say I am NOT going to try to be God and I'm gonna let the other people do their job and I will forgive and go on my way because I know I'm okay with God I I'm sorry for people who feel like they need to keep going after justice I think they are pushing it too hard and they hurt themselves in the process Miroslav Wolf who lived through the you know the dissolution of the old Yugoslavia you know has written quite a few interesting books and one of the points that he made is that you know if there is no God then suddenly you or us collectively but in this world suddenly we are kind of like justice's backstop and and so I wonder you know I wonder how that works mentally for people if there is no God then and then I have to hold this against my father even if my father is dead or or he gets away with it but if there's a God you can say you know what I I am NOT God and what was done to me was wrong I am incapable of of making them pay the thousands or millions of dollars that they owe me but it is also completely counterproductive they they they win twice if I hold on to this but if there is a God nicely if there is a God then actually there can be justice someday I don't know I totally agree if I hold on to it I lose twice yeah and that's why the definition is so important at the start of this hurt is anything that changes my view of myself and the rules of the world from realistic to unrealistic when I stop believing that there is a realistic world out there when there are rules when there's right and wrong then anything goes I can become a lot of myself I can be become chaotic I can be random self-destructive like anything goes but if I know that there's a God and there are rules to the world suddenly everything else can fall into place and I can be at peace so me that was huge in my life yeah well and I think that that gets that goes along with a lot of Jordan Peterson stuff too because even though you know I have some I'm still trying to figure out I think Jordan Peterson is still trying to figure out exactly the con the contours of his God if you don't have if we don't have that layer above us then we're it and we do we this is too much to hold we we don't do this well and and it screws us up and I I see you know again in my ministry I'll see people try to try to manage this stuff and I watch them and I just want to say you know just just let it go just let it go but they can't and and they literally kill themselves you know I have you know a lot of homeless people and you know a lot of them have substance abuse issues and I I I watch them drink themselves to death and it's such a waste with alcohol you can at least see it yeah but with hurt it comes wrapped so piously I'm such an innocent victim and everything I do is good and everything everybody else does in the whole world is bad and I alone am innocent you know it's it's an addiction too it's as powerful as any other addiction because it lives on the on the hormones of the body that race through our bloodstream and make us feel excited and right and superior and forgiving takes away the fear of facing the world and it means that I can look at my world honestly and truly and not be afraid that's that's beautiful so you've done a whole course on this and I can put in the notes now Dave and I are from the same denomination and they've talked about this and then he worked with some people at the denomination and you actually this thing is actually packaged and pastors can run it in churches and people can do it by themselves too or how does that work how does that package work that's correct it is available from faith alive resources and if you look up I happen to be looking at the only copy I have of kind I feel like one of those cheesy infomercials I'm gonna give you a set of ginsu steak knives it says it won't photograph well because the the colors are so shiny oh it's called unhurt the healing power of forgiveness it's got a little bucket on it and then my name David snapper and you can get that from faith alive and if you work at it sometimes you can get it from Amazon okay okay there it is or you can put the information on or they can email me whatever you'd like I'm just very committed to helping people to forgive okay now David is retired now and I am not so if you want to get David's email address email me and I'll shoot it to him and he's got all the time in the world to answer all of your questions right fill my bucket well David I really appreciate this at some point in the future I'm going to do some more videos like a lot of my videos now been around about Jordan Peterson I'm also gonna do some more videos about stuff in my denomination and David and I have some other conversations we want to do about that but we're gonna do that in a different video at some point but I really appreciate David your your willingness to your willingness to talk about this and to share yourself and to and to share your stories it's it's it's I really appreciate it I am so grateful for the opportunity and again it's my hope that there's somebody out there who is struggling as much as I was that this will give them some kind of hope and direction that there is a way out of the out of the great hurt of losing okay all right well thank you and just stay right there David I'm gonna end the recording right now
