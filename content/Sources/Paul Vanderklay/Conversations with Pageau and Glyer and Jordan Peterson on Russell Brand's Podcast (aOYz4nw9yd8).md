 Hi, this is Paul. Just wanted to do a couple little program notes. First, earlier this week in case you haven't seen it, I did a conversation with Jonathan Peugeot. We had a great time, had a great talk, went on for a little over an hour. I'll put the link to that below if you haven't seen it yet. Also today, I did a conversation with Greg Glyer who has a non-profit called Donor C. We talked a little bit about Jordan Peterson. We also talked about poverty and Christianity quite a bit. That was a great conversation. I'll put the link to that below too. Also, I just wanted to make sure that everyone is checking out Russell Brand and Jordan Peterson's conversation that went down. The stuff I knew about Russell Brand didn't make me want to watch his show at all, but I thought this was one of the best interviews I've seen, one of the best conversations I've seen Jordan Peterson with. It was just tremendous. I really appreciated Brand. I'm going to have to spend more time digging into that interview because there's so much interesting stuff there. Make sure you get a chance to see it. So there's the conversation I had with Jonathan Peugeot and the conversation I had with Gret and then the conversation between Russell Brand and Jordan Peterson. So catch them all.
