 Hi, this is Paul. Part of the reason I think yesterday's video took me so many tries to make was the usual problem with just about any singular message sermon too many disconnected thoughts. Now having a lot of disconnected thoughts is not necessarily a bad thing if you can overcome the challenge and connect the disconnected thoughts because somewhere in the back of my mind I believe these thoughts are in one way or another connected. The challenge is always to show the connections between them. In the end the decision that I made was separate some of these thoughts and do multiple videos instead of just one. Part of that has to do with the limited amount of time I have every day to make videos. Another part of that has to do with the fact that sometimes it's better to have them segmented off even if it's an hour or an hour and a half as one video. What I want to get into is question of evil and gender and God. Now that's some pretty big stuff especially when I'm going to approach it with the critical drinker. Now as is has become my practice after I do a video where I had a bunch of new thoughts and differentiated thoughts I needed to write a little something for Twitter and if I'm writing a little something for Twitter that's more than one or two entries I formulated onto my sub stack and for those of you who as would be true of any normal human being with real responsibility don't have enough time to watch all of my videos unless your life has a particular kind of job or you're retired or for some other reason where you can really catch them all sort of like a Pokemon. The sub stack is sort of a good way to keep up with things for me because it's fairly short. I did the Egregore video. I did something about weddings that was an anticipation of a sermon. I did the Babylon Bee thing. I did the Tom Holland thing. So the sub stack is a pretty good way to sort of keep up with things and the sub stack is never simply a summary of the video because I usually do it the next morning and I've had a night to sleep on it and so it's usually a summary plus a little bit more. So maybe I'll start with maybe I'll start with the sub stack. Last week I opened up a new vein of exploration on another youtuber the critical drinker. Today I released the second video in that series on his angry profanity lace tirade about what he sees as the corruption of Hollywood storytelling. I haven't seen a video of mine do what the first in this series did so I started when I started commenting on Jordan Peterson. Those of you obviously don't have access regular access to all the analytics that Google feeds me on my channel but if you just go to the first video critical drinker Peugeot Jordan Peterson religion and the hero's journey that video has taken off and it's been out for shoot it was out on the fourth so almost a week now and usually what happens with my videos is they sort of start peak at the height when the whole bunch of people those of you who watch most of them sort of jump on and then they sort of tail off and then there's just out there forgotten into the world. Well this video just keeps living and every now and then I'll check it and there'll be another several hundred views in 60 minutes and on and on and on so now it's over 20,000 views which is a pretty remarkable thing for my little channel so obviously stuff is going on I don't really understand what we'll see. I'm better prepared now though for the kind of thing that I experienced when I first started my channel if you go back to some of my first videos you'll see me like I think 2,000 subscribers is enough for this channel and well that didn't happen to be but we have an estuary now and it sort of reminds me of when my Protestant colleague spoke with his Orthodox friend out there in Roseville and the Orthodox friend basically said well we're not ready to do evangelism yet we haven't set up our cathedrals or our monasteries yet oh well we've got an estuary now so that if there are hundreds more people who start flooding into the channel there's some place for them to go and I think the estuary is built up sufficiently now that they have strong walls and good culture so that newcomers can in fact perhaps find a niche and positive conversation. The critical drinker is both popular and easy to dismiss for the same reasons. One, he's hitting on current popular culture war tropes, the sort of dynamic that will boost your YouTube analytics as Megan Damm and David Wilson, David Fuller talked about. He sticks mostly to major blockbuster movies and area film criticism that often serious critics turn away from because they are the joy of the rabble. Three, there's no doubt in my mind that many who follow him are indulging in the common guilty pleasure of nursing a favorite tribal grudge fueled at least in part by the mix of nostalgia and resentment. The critical drinker however doesn't doesn't really play this straight. Like many other channels I could point to he adopts a now some people said yeah but this that's really how Scotsmen are it's like well I guess I don't know a lot of Scotsmen It's an exaggerated character and the exaggeration is intentional and I think it's enormously shrewd because people want to simply dismiss him as a drunken angry nostalgic resentful person. He's like I'll show you drunken angry nostalgic resentful. I'll see it and I'll double it there and there's a lot of that in the culture war between the elites and the deplorables who of course took that word on as a badge of their own courage. The man behind the character is some self-successful writer so if you can get past the fast-cut populism the videos are thick with and often I've sort of taken to just listening to them instead of watching them. Not that there's a problem with watching them but when I watch them well there's a little I find a problem with watching them he unlike something like like stories of old where he's gently slowly crafting intentionally taking every image the critical drinker is just pop pop pop pop pop pop pop and sometimes you get the section the the idea that he's just throwing images into it that he's grabbed from a trailer or something else that the language the words are the message he's a writer much more than the visual he's not a director he's a writer anyway he is addressing something serious and real the state of religious story in the West if Peugeot and Peterson are playing it straight to a middle brow and sometimes high brow audience the critical drinker is D is in deep cover there's zero association with overt religion the cussing alone should keep the pastor out of the bar this level of Hollywood has long been the heart of folk religion in the West archetypes that used to be communicated by superstition fairy tales mythology and folklore now live in popcorn movies and their future is in peril movie theaters are temples but now the message has moved into the religious altars of the gods set and the pocket Bibles replaced by smartphones and if you want to understand my reference to the to the gods set watch the clip I made of might not recognize it as set but I want to read you something a few months before I was born my dad met a stranger who was new to our small Tennessee town from the beginning dad was fascinated with his enchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live with our family the stranger was quickly accepted and was around to welcome me into the world a few months later as I grew up I never questioned his place in our family mom taught me to love the word of God dad taught me to obey it but the stranger was our storyteller he could weave the most fascinating tales adventures mysteries and comedies were daily conversations he could hold our whole family spellbound for hours each evening he was like a friend to the whole family he took dad bailing me to our first major league baseball game he was always encouraging us to see the movies and he even made arrangements to introduce us to several movie stars the stranger was an incessant talker dad didn't seem to mind but sometimes mom would quietly get up while the rest of us were enthralled with one of his stories of faraway places and go to her room read her Bible and pray I wonder now if she ever prayed at the stranger would leave you see my dad ruled our house our household with certain moral convictions but the stranger never felt an obligation to honor them profanity for example was not allowed in our house not from us from our friends or adults our longtime visitor however used occasional four little word four letter words that burned my ears and made dad squirm to my knowledge the stranger was never confronted my dad was a teetotaler who didn't permit alcohol in his home not even for cooking but the stranger felt he needed exposure and enlightened us to other ways of life he offered us beer and other alcoholic beverages often he made cigarettes look tasty cigars manly and pipes distinguished he talked freely too much too freely about sex his comments were sometimes blatant sometimes suggestive and generally embarrassing I know now that my early concepts of the man-woman relationship were influenced by the stranger as I look back I believe it was the grace of God that the stranger did not influence us more time after time he opposed the values of my parents yet he was seldom rebuked and never asked to leave more than 30 years have passed since the stranger moved in with the young family on Morningside Drive but if I were to walk into my parents den today you would still see him over in a corner waiting for someone to listen to him talk and watch him draw his pictures his name we always called him set television set said I love that video the critical drinkers angry drunken mission is to preserve the craft of storytelling and rescue it from the message that seeks to destroy a Western religion for the masses from the inside the way it has happened in the church and here I reference a very interesting video why Christian movies are bad the problem with Christian media for this reason the critical drinker is in many ways parallel to Jordan Peterson and Jonathan but Jonathan Peugeot not simply because they are appealing to a similar audience but because the critical drinker satisfying storytelling is a gyroscope which can fallibly guide secularists to the transcendentals he's doing so however from a far deep from far deeper cover he will revel in his deplorable status I think of him as the Diogenes of this little corner so prepare to be offended and it wasn't till the end and this is again why I do videos and why I write that in a sense the image of the critical drinker as Diogenes of the trailer park really sort of hit home and if you don't know who Diogenes is he's the the father of the school of cynics and there are many interesting stories about Diogenes and he's not far from the critical drinker now the movie or the video I very much wanted to integrate was this question about villains because it gets into evil something is going on with respect to evil that I think needs attention now I don't remember if I introduced Carolina in the last video or not I'd made so many takes of that video and through so many takes away I don't always remember what's in them and Adam she and I had a conversation in 2019 it wasn't published again about a third of my conversations aren't published but she has made a video and all the usual bridgers are or many of the usual bridges are there in the comment section encouraging her and supporting her that's exactly what a community should do and for a first effort for a video very well done it seems to me that we no longer have a notion of good and evil as a society as a culture we have lost the ability to name good and evil to use those words especially in big cities especially in liberal countries but basically everywhere in large metropolitan areas around the world good and evil and love as well love which is dismissed as being sentimental good and evil dismissed as being superstitious and old-fashioned these are words that represent something about the real the real of life and whether we can whether we have the words for it or not it doesn't change the fact that they do exist and that perhaps that they are the most important aspects of life and not being able to name them is actually dangerous because when you don't recognize something when you don't have the words for it you can't integrate it into your symbolic understanding of the world so then it's pushed away and if you can't recognize evil then it is hidden in the unconscious now what she does here in the beginning of this video I think hits a number of points that are important and again one of the slides that I don't even remember if it came to light has to do with nominalism and again John Verveckis definition of nominalism is that nominalism asserts that there are no real relations in there are no real relations what does that mean it means that all of our relations are projection what's the implication of that good and evil are relations and now this complaint about no reality of evil has sort of been a trope from the right for a long time it's not a trope without justification but if it's not presented properly or explored properly it's too easy a trope and so her point here which I think she made very well is part of the reason we use language is because as in our conversation with Egregores as in our conversations with Jesus demands the name of Legion sometimes things need to be named so they can fit into our cognitive space and once they are named and revealed well then at least we have a better chance of understanding of seeing what they are and figuring out how exactly we must respond and deal with them and this is where I get to the critical drinker video about villains allow me to regale you with a story dear viewer back when I was about 13 I mean back when I just reached the legal drinking age in Scotland one of my mates challenged me to drink a half bottle of Chinese moonshine now I'd never tried this stuff before and as I found out later neither had he but anyway I duly popped the cork which was secured with duct tape for some reason and got fired in about it now I've consumed some unpleasant beverages in my time let me tell you but this stuff tasted like liquify decomposing dog but a challenge is a challenge and only a fucking pussy backs down from something like that so a few minutes later I duly raised the empty bottle in triumph then I promptly threw up pissed myself and passed out next to a dumpster behind Tesco the point here is that without overcoming the challenge of that shitty drink I never would have become the witty intoxicated raconteur you see before you because when you get right down to it every hero needs a good What would Superman be without Lex Luthor? What would Batman be without the Joker? What would Captain Marvel be without Brie Larson? Is that like a personal attack or something? The antagonist of a story is actually a pretty interesting thing from a writing point of view they can come in all different shapes and sizes from physical powerhouses to calculating intellectuals from honorable warriors to evil murderers but whatever form they take they all serve the same basic purpose they're an obstacle for the protagonist to overcome something that can challenge them to become better and stronger than they were before they're basically the driving force behind the hero's journey but it's more than just that a good villain can challenge the very nature of who and what a hero is and what the audience believes them to be they can have justifiable motivations and complex personalities all of their own the best ones can even make the audience question just who exactly the real villain is in fact the villains are often cooler and more memorable than the hero themselves why because unlike the hero writers don't have to worry about making their villains likable and relatable so they can afford to take risks with them they can indulge their wildest writing fantasies creating the most despicable psychopaths terrifying monsters evil dictators or cunning criminals imaginable the more evil they are the bigger the threat they pose or the harder they test the protagonist the more satisfying is when the hero finally prevails the problem is that good villains seem to be a dying breed these days the awesome antagonists that used to dominate the screen and push our heroes to the very limits of their endurance are gradually being replaced by weak flaccid forgettable imitations with none of the power and menace of their predecessors and because they no longer present a challenge there's no real payoff when they get defeated now explaining how and why this is happening is gonna take a bit of time so strap in and prepare yourself for the drinkers writing workshop first up okay so well we'll pause him there that's a good introduction to it and I don't know if I'll play the whole video but I wanted especially because of yesterday's villain video to again contextualize this with respect to the hero's journey and all that we talked about yesterday in terms of the hero's journey is sort of an individualized piece and what we're actually looking at is is a strong said that niche is actually correct better than niche so I'll take strong's word for it because he looks these kinds of things up on places like Wikipedia and internet dictionaries but the niches see I always think of snitches and something out of dr. Seuss if I say niches but the there's a there's a this is an integral function in terms of the story shape that we've been looking at so if this is our successive heroes journey that are sort of that sort of brought into much larger story structures at each point what's going to provoke the action of the hero or the action of at least the heroic elements of the community is going to be the villain spelling there we go is going to be the villain it's going to be the adversary that comes in and gets the drama going and of course Jess I have to look up the video Jess and Sherry did a video on the u-shape story I suspect it's in randos united so if just let send me a message because I know you're probably following this quite closely because this is very much in the area that you and Sherry and others have worked on and the bridges of meaning discord server and in that community so so the villain actually plays a vitally important role and the quality of the villain is going to be important for the quality of the story and minor villains of course are easily dealt with major villains are difficult to deal with and Peter kreeft actually made a point about this when he was highlighting the success of the lie in the witch in the wardrobe CS Lewis's line the witch in the wardrobe because often writers have an easier time writing villains as the critical drinker just noted rather than writing heroes heroes are tougher to write and I think it's for that reason that we've had a variety of inverted heroes let's say like Tony soprano Northrop Fye in fact makes this very point when he's talking about the biblical series you find that a situation is presented in front of you which gradually becomes more ominous and threatening and foreboding of disaster to the to the characters that you are sympathetic with but then there's a kind of gimmick or sudden shift in the plot and eventually it moves towards a happy ending where everybody gets married and the hero and heroines real life is assumed to begin after the play is over which is why the heroes and heroines of so many comedies are in fact rather dull people and the main character interest is thrown on the blocking characters like the parents who forbid them to marry or something of that kind so the blocking characters as he said are often the most interesting now as I mentioned before part of what's happening here whereas in almost all of these secular conversation about the hero's journey the focus is on David or Samson or Moses or Joshua one of the earthly heroes as I've mentioned before predominantly in the story the hero is the Lord it is the Lord that is actually transforming the community but the Lord is doing so through his agent and that might be David or Moses and and in that way I think in terms of biblical literature you can have very interesting contextualized heroes because they are in fact flawed and in many ways I think that's part of the genius of biblical literature because some of the inherent weaknesses in the you say in the u-shape structure with the heroes is addressed already by virtue of the structure of biblical storytelling where finally fundamentally the Lord is the agent that brings transformation to the community through the interaction with the obstacles but as I also mentioned yesterday part of the issue with this is especially in the Old Testament Hassatan which the accuser in the book of Job is very present and very very functional in that the villains in the Old Testament are in fact a little bit different they are human now part of part of oh where's where's my copy where's my copy I found it my precious part of Kaufman's insight is that unlike many other mythical texts where the God has to do battle with other gods now some of that is beneath some of the text and we talk about that in Genesis 1 but it's it's very much sublimated because the God is confronting all sorts of other evil and so what happens in the biblical narrative is that let's say the Babylonians are on one hand evil and understood to be evil on the other hand they are sent and used by God and it's a very delicate narrative dance to have that pay off and it's done so not quite directly and packaged as a movie or a story like you would find in a movie but through basically the epigenetic layer of the Bible for us which is usually the stories that we are lifting from the text and telling each other reading the text is not such a simple thing there's the text that we appropriate from the text so if the text is here we have to fit this text into a schema that includes all of our story our history the language the things we inherit the status hierarchies that are that are going on and on and so that then impacts the text we see and it's sort of like an epigenetic layer because it's it's on top and that's sort of our interpretive hash I remember when I was dating the woman who would become my wife her mother was a fundamentalist Baptist her father had been a Lutheran minister before he died and Leo Peters in Grand Rapids Michigan at that time in the 80s was taking out full page ads in the Grand Rapids press complaining about Calvin College and Howard Vintil and the biology department etc etc so that war was going on and my my future mother-in-law and her fundamentalist Baptist family were all of course sided against Calvin College but she her daughter was going to Calvin College and her son and her future son-in-law was going to Calvin Seminary and so conversations about Genesis 1 progressed and I had done a little bit of work on Genesis 1 and so I challenged her one day to take out her King James version of the Bible and just read it as such and fortunately for me she was using the King James version of the Bible not a number of other more modern translations that tend to cover over some of the inconvenient angularities left in the King James version and so I was I was going through the Bible I noticed that in pencil she had been correcting it and I said um you're not really supposed to do that oh but I think it's wrong right here in other words she was reading the text that was in her mind a product of all her filters and when I pointed her to pieces in the text itself well this is how this is sense making this is how we make sense of the world so we're always dealing with these multiple texts as we're trying to make sense of the world trying to integrate the Bible into our filters and frames all that leads to the question of who is the actor in the Bible who are the villains and in fact where does evil come from and how does it work I'm going to give you an example of a well-written antagonist that everyone knows and where better to start than Darth Vader he's basically the quintessential movie villain right from the first moment he strides onto that rebel ship surrounded by dead bodies you know this guy isn't fucking around in fact George Lucas played just about every trick in the book to make you afraid of this guy he's huge and powerful he's dressed all in black armor his face is hidden behind an inhuman mask so you've got no idea what he actually looks like and he speaks with a deep booming voice that just seems to radiate power and menace shit man he can even throw people around like ragdolls physically he's big and intimidating but he's also intelligent and ruthlessly efficient making smart logical decisions based on the information he has and almost never losing his cool for example he uses his force powers to punish subordinates who fail or disrespect him but it's never done out of anger or malice he's either proven a point to men who doubt his power or removing ineffective commanders who compromise the success of his mission when Vader acts it's always in service of a higher goal and never because he's lost control of himself the okay and now part of what he's showing us here is that evil always needs some good Vader wants fealty loyalty from his subordinates he doesn't want them to lie he wants them to tell the truth and so what a well-written character and a good evil character will do is in fact have this mixture that well is present within us and we have to figure out well this is the complexity of real life now again remember the critical drinker is in many respects operating on the level of folk religion and when I think about other characters that I've seen let's say Negan I remember when Negan first stepped onto the stage of the walking dead that that night when he had some of the heroes of the story in the circle and he was going to take two of them out I thought wow this character relates evil but here's the question what is evil and where is it located now I'm not going to be able to offer you a definitive answer to of this in this film and and this is part of why storytelling is so important because most of the time we can't simply codify these things into language as such as as sort of Carolina was saying to take them up and to grasp them and to contain them many times the best way to communicate these things is with story why because actually the story is much more is a better representation of the 4p ways of knowing a story has the depth to have the perspectival the participatory and and all of those elements to it in fact film is quite capable of relating this kind of thing in this video about about Christian movies he actually let's see I should I gotta pop it in the ads he goes through at one point a scene which is which is really well done let's see if I can find it this is all right he goes through this scene and he and he just shows how the camera turns oh come on and and he makes the point that even if you take away the take away the take away the sound you can have a sense of what's happening with these two characters and what's happening between them relationally perspectively and all of those elements and and it's it's partly that reason that film is such a powerful storyteller they have there's so many things see notice pull back the emotions are different their faces are different now you add dialogue you add music you add all of that into this scene and it's much it's just much a much broader palette so we're going to have to talk about evil and talk about broad palettes and talk about the arenic and the agentic with respect to the valence of good and evil and masculinity and femininity now the drinker has just laid out especially at a folk religion level a well crafted character and he's going to show us and again this these are sort of tells down below of things up above the overall effect here is to create a villain that you absolutely would not want to fuck with a man who basically dominates every situation and plows through every opponent over three movies right until the final act when look at last manages to overpower him but even that counts as a kind of victory for vader whose objective was never to beat luke anyway but to provoke his rage and anger and well that's exactly what he does the point and you get a sense of again the ephesians text about principalities and powers ephesians six we battle died against flesh and blood and in a well-crafted story you actually have the ability to understand at a deeper level even if you can't put it into words that there is evil and it is moving vader and the conflict between luke and vader is not simply something that will be resolved with lightsabers and won't be resolved with the death of one or the victory of the other and the movie actually affords a window into some deeper levels at heart the conflict is spiritual well what do i mean by that it's the forces that are moving the physical people and arranging them that there's real relation between them and that relation has moral valence good and evil here is that george lucas managed to create a villain that was smart powerful dominant ruthless interesting and extremely well written a character that maintains his air of duty and a very powerful character that maintains his air of danger and menace almost until his final moments before redeeming himself and sacrificing his own life to save his son damn no okay so yeah and of course some of them i remember when my my children were going to secular high school i'll refrain from certain comments about some of the education they received but even in a secular high school christ figure christ figure christ figure the christian story has so deeply impacted storytelling since then you get a sense of the of the neutron bomb that was jesus christ all the stuff is standing but the spirits had to go this is the triumphal procession of the principalities and powers that over 2000 years jesus has been moving and if you're looking at all these labels christian non-christian had a wonderful conversation about that today actually we'll see if that one gets shared too the neutron bomb and for those of you who don't know it back in the 80s the the american arms industry developed it and this was something important that was believed could stop the fear of the soviet advance because the neutron bomb was mostly radiation and so it would kill all the people but leave the stuff standing that's in some ways the power of the exorcism that christ does in his work that wipes out the spirits and leaves the stuff standing now now the stuff is going to have to be filled with a new spirit because as jesus says in his parable clean out the house and if you don't fill it with something right and something new seven more spirits worse than the first will come and inhabit it so there's some vivid imagery about what's happening and story here good story is again sort of like a gyroscope for the transcendentials truth beauty goodness and if story is well crafted even if it doesn't have the title of christian on it in fact some stories that have the label of christian on it are done so poorly they don't function well this is the power of story and this is in a sense part of the natural revelation and glory of god that is built into creation that one way or another we can't avoid it for for darth vader to be a successful villain he needs to demand the goodness from the arena and the agents within the arena to pursue his evil purposes one of the real interesting tricks of cs lewis's screw tape letters is that you have to figure out how to represent demons without making them leverage good into over to way no wonder he's so iconic now let's take a moment to consider his modern day counterpart kylo ren i mean superficially the similarities are there they both wear masks and black armor they both make their entrance in the middle of a battle they both use lightsabers and they're both strong with the force and for the first few seconds everything's going pretty well for kylo ren he strides out of his ship he kills an old guy that looks like he should be important and he stops a fucking blaster bolt in midair damn even darth vader couldn't do that then it all starts to go wrong when he tries to interrogate pole so who talks first you talk first i talk first your man gave it to you this is very hard to understand you and if you look at less yesterday's video this is what he means by lack of respect because okay we're in a we're on a strange planet we've got blasters we've got spaceships we've got all of this stuff going on we can suspend that disbelief but the real relation if you break that and again it's it's if you if you sit down and try to peel apart the layers of what is believable what isn't believable you can't do it but we actually manage to to manage these things in stories it's an astounding capacity that we have you don't catch your dog or your cat telling you a story we do this and we do it with so much subtlety that we put these stories in hierarchies and look at the the the recent conversation between peterson and kraus i mean this is part of what peterson is is saying to the new atheist is that you know you're not really paying attention because if you look at this stuff we have a sense of what's true and real and it's it's to it's to the grace of god that we can play with these things but given the fact that we're allowed to play with these things we're also allowed to make some messes and you know what achievements are achievements and the reason that they stand out is because they're really hard to do what the fuck is this if you want us to take this guy seriously you really shouldn't have people throwing snarky comments at him unchallenged it's like the script is like now now let's give the hollywood writers their due what are they probably attempting to do they are trying to show probably that evil villains in history are not necessarily archetypal hitler screwed up many times stalin screwed up many times they were full of pettiness and all of these things but here's the problem movies are abstractions that we're pulling out of things and so it's it's vitally important if you want to set up a good story that you're dealing with archetypes and and that's why based on a true story it's always based on a true story but once it's brought into film certain transformations have to happen they're demanded by the medium in order to achieve the goal of the medium now we have the same issue with biblical narrative we we it's it's just all there for poetry of course but we let it go by because it's poetry and that gets back to again what norther fry begins the second lecture with by saying we can't tell especially with the bible we don't know how to manage the split where's the split there's the split we don't know how to manage this split and again this split is between upper and lower registers and there's going to have to be a split and as a as a donned on me at one point today enchantment is the space where upper and lower register meet right there is the zone of enchantment and the problem with these movies is that if you don't get it right you lose the enchantment and we can all see it actively making fun of him and encouraging us to laugh along with them and it only gets worse from there whereas vader was cold and efficient kylo frequently loses his temper and lashes out in childish rage he makes dumb illogical command decisions and pursues his mission in the least efficient way possible he brutally punishes people for asking completely logical questions this fleet what is it a gift what is he asking for in return does in fact the only reason he even catches up to our heroes is because just about everyone in the galaxy seems to be a fucking snitch he regularly takes his mask off destroying the mystery of what lies behind it he's openly conflicted about the path he wants to take hesitating at crucial moments and endlessly brooding over his choices worst of all every single time he goes up against the hero he loses first he fails to probe her mind with the force then he gets his fucking ass kicked in a fight and it's only sheer dumb luck that stops him from getting killed from that moment on any threat or danger he might have posed is completely annihilated because if your antagonist starts out weaker than the hero then what the fuck is there left to strive the impression you get from kylo ren is that he's a weak immature conflicted man child desperately pretending to be something he isn't exploding with childish displays of emotion whenever things don't go his way and unable to commit to a course of action a man who can't even master himself never mind those around him and consistently loses every time he tests himself against the hero and okay let me let him short he's a villain without teeth never mind though at least snook has a bit of potential oh well there's always hucks he started out pretty ruthless and supremely oh you see how the script doesn't even have the decency to produce competent villains not only are these guys evil but they're evil and inept you're not supposed to fear them you're supposed to laugh at them okay now let's again talk a little bit about biblical narrative with respect to this issue because it's if you look at history you'll find that many people who are villains through history possess all of these different flawed traits now the problem is what do we do with this so so let's imagine you have a more complex world than strictly a materialist world you've got the hero's journey you've got a narrative arc that you've got a u-shaped story here and the hero is is doing this but of course the lord through the spirits coming at it from both ways are in fact participating in the drama what does that mean it means that whether it's the hero or the villain and aptitudes all sorts of things good fortune all sorts of things are functioning in terms of the overall working of the story working of the story it's not just all up to the hero and it's not just star wars that has this problem either consider jan rog from captain marvel a man who loses his first fight against her then does basically nothing for the rest of the movie until she finally gets bored and zaps him with absolutely no efforts because i have nothing to prove to you at no point in this movie does he ever present the slightest threat to her so why the fuck should we care when she beats him or how about roman cyonis from birds of prey a sadistic nightclub owner who pouts and cries and screams his way through the movie and needs constant emotional validation and reassurance from his henchmen a man who comes across as insecure unstable needy and generally kind of pathetic now birds of prey was a lousy movie i saw it in the theater movie pass and i watched it in theater and it was like boy there was two hours i'm not going to get back and and and partly for exactly the reason that he's pointing out here but i didn't when i was watching the movie i didn't appreciate the point he was making and that's why he's helpful once i saw the critique it was like yeah well but let's ask ourselves why are the villains falling apart now it will have something to do as it gets to the end of the of the video with the message and we're going to get into gender and masculinity and femininity especially with respect to heroes and villains boy i'm running out of time this stuff is this stuff is hard to make your way through part i think of the agenda of contemporary storytelling is they want to try to account for the evil in the characters and they don't have this much world to play with and so they do something different as a culture right now we have two stories going on one is that of heroes heroes must be from the realm not of privilege again part of this is because of the message they can't be part of the privileged they must come from the oppressed they must come from the underdog now you can see this in movies all the time and it's not a problem at all david is the youngest of the brothers moses is also a younger brother who has a speech problem and so this is often i mean all of this comes from christianity all of this comes from the bible and it's just a matter of heresy versus not heresy so god often takes the lowly of the world and raises them up look at mary's song but again it's always god who does this so the heroes come from the lowly the oppressed the underdog and they have compassion because they know suffering but it's also true that hurt people hurt people and so villains also now this has come about in the movies now they also come from somewhere well where does their evil come from well their evil comes from some tragic thing in other words it's not their fault now that's not a bad thing because again if you have a worldview that looks more like this well you can account for evil in a way but if you don't have this worldview what you wind up with is a conflict where we don't really know why some people the same the christians actually have all these cliches that talk about this the same sun that hardens clay melts wax and this is something that again it's at the at the at the point between the registers if you can if you could go into that question you find something and you you find enchantment and you and you actually hold the tension and you and you look at actually a lot of this is is where calvinism is from because in many respects you just say we can't account for it so god that's in some ways part of what's beneath calvinism and never gets to present an actual threat to the hero or what about max lord from wonder woman 1984 a shady businessman desperate to hide his failures behind a veneer of ballsy 1980s arrogance now again in looking at this movie the um the the female villain sidekick was more she was quite a bit more she was more to deal with than he was ballsy 1980s arrogance who revels in the idea of power and success but crumbles like a wet paper bag the moment his life is put at risk and who is never able to threaten wonder woman in any way and of course let's not forget about rowan from ghostbusters 2016 a sad middle-aged socially inept loser with a superiority complex that's angry because everyone in the world looks down on him or how about bosley from charlie's angels played by a frail actor in his late 70s whose plan gets easily uncovered and foiled by people who are clearly far more intelligent than him before knocking him out with a single punch the point i'm making here is that all of these characters make for shitty villains either because they lack the self-control fighting ability intelligence or sheer physical strength to be genuinely intimidating now part of this gets to why we want movies i said on many occasions a deep problematic aspect of our culture is that for commercial purposes we have attempted to brainwash generations that life should be easy and successful if you just follow a few simple rules that's simply a lie about life in this world and part of the reason jordan peterson i think was so successful is he presented a much more augustinian view of the world that says we are evil life is hard you'd better take that into account when you think about what this world will be now we live in a tremendously affluent society that has been tremendously successful and there are in fact people who have had fairly easy lives for good long stretches of their lives and it tends to make them weak and soft now there are others who have had very difficult lives and it tends to make them bitter and frankly in some ways evil this whole dynamic that i was pointing to before and then there are others for whom the hardness of their life has turned them into saints and that then leads us to the question of transformations and the degree to which we can participate in them either from the inside or the outside they never present a tangible threat to the hero in fact they're basically treated as weak pathetic straw men that can be easily brushed aside once the script decides it's time for them to lose the writers in this case lack the one thing that every creator should have for their antagonist and that's respect for their creations darth vader hans gruber hannibal lector the terminator the list goes on and on but and so you see from the video i played yesterday this this theme for him of respect comes in and well what do we mean by respect because we have respect between people no it's to one degree or another the storyteller needs to really believe in their creation and they need to take it seriously throughout the story but the thing that ties all these characters together is respect the writers were smart enough to build their antagonists up so they became a genuine threat for the hero to overcome instead of trying to break them down and belittle them right from the beginning now the thing you might rightly be wondering is why why is this happening what exactly has changed well quite a bit as it happens see the real problem here is that there are pretty strict rules around what you can and can't show in mainstream movies and i'm not talking about boobs and violence like in the old days i'm talking about the unwritten rules behind the scenes that basically exist to make sure their movies don't incur the wrath of journalists the new now he's going to get into the message here and that is a fair point but there are also more structural rules about the real relations of our world that these elements fit into and that's why the message destroys stories and sometimes in the same way that the christian message remember to eugene peterson his his paraphrase of the bible is called the message destroys christian movies that it takes it it it creates a world that to us we look at and we say that's unreal and sometimes it's a fantasy world and we want to live into it and both christians and wokesters suffer from the same kinds of delusions in that sense sometime but this is where in fact good storytelling is durable and these durable things therefore are tells and signs and clues of the deeper realities underneath all the physicality that we're watching news media or the endless twitter mobs just waiting for the next thing to get offended about in this case one of the golden rules is that women are never allowed to lose to men at anything for any reason whether it's a physical fight a test of skill or intelligence or even a simple argument pick basically any scenario where a woman gets pitted against a man and i can pretty much guarantee you the woman will come out on top now peugeot one of his most popular videos was of course about this directly the important aspects of interpreting symbolism in culture is the capacity to discern patterns not only within stories but also across them the capacity to notice these patterns will help us see when certain directions certain deep movements and changes are taking form in culture it will give us the capacity to let's say read the signs of the times sometimes an understanding of symbolism can be used for purposes of propaganda and to push certain social agendas this trope is the replacing of the masculine hero by a feminine one we see this pattern not only in the fact of certain replacements but it often appears as a pattern within the stories themselves asper her it wasn't really ghostbusters material so it's not just that there are more lead feminine characters in stories which could have been you know an opportunity and again for those of you who don't know the ghostbuster canon bill murray was one of the original ghostbusters and so the idea again as i played before the video before from peugeot is replacement unity for good storytelling but it is the very act of supplanting and replacing which is often shown as a story trope and this trope becomes boldly apparent especially when we see this pattern appear across several movies the pattern can now remember we we not only lift our stories up from watching real life we also lift our expectations and our filters up from watching these things over stories and the movies are the most powerful religious formation one of the most powerful one of the most powerful religious formation devices especially at the folk religion level in our culture in our culture and take a variety of forms it can appear as a strange play on the masculine virtue of wanting to save others though now the male character sacrifices himself in order to make way for a feminine character which replaces him we see this for example in the movie logan well wolverine sacrifices himself to make way for his female clone there is also k in blade runner 2049 giving up his place as the son to make room for the daughter you imagined it was you oh rule useless our plan captain not commander right wasn't it leah's last official act to demote you for your dreadnought plan but there are several occasions where the masculine character will willingly get out of the way to make place for a feminine replacement in the final scene of the movie mad max fury road after tossing the dead body of the tyrannical father max presents the female lead to the people who clamor for her and max then gets off this escalating elevator in order to let all the feminine characters ascend to replace the toppled authority now the masculine and the feminine are not arbitrary but and and she's wise because she doesn't fall for the status markers and he's completely non-plussed by this because he's he's talking about beauty and the beast you know he's devoted his whole life to just developing the status markers and so i think it's beauty and the beast is is there's a hero's journey in that that's that's very deep and you know these very some of these fairy tales some of them have been traced back like 12 to 13 000 years and so you know if it's that old it's like a hundred thousand years right right but this actually goes uh to a point that you and i have been dancing around forever jordan which is the point about to which level to what level are these very ancient things effectively timeless and to what level are these things in need of change because we now face an environment for which they were not built and so the hero's journey i would argue just painting with a broad brush the hero's journey is timeless what does the hero's journey look like well it can look like odysseus or it can look like the fellowship of the ring right those are very different versions of the hero's journey and in fact at the moment one of the things that we need are stories that are not built by the market to fill some need but that actually reflect the transition in what males and females do in the world that in some sense one of the positive now now this is a really interesting point that brett is making because he's now you have to understand brett is a he's he's he's pure idw what it means is that he's a he's a wokesters have committed domicide against his home he is no longer at evergreen evergreen and i won't call it a junior college nate don't worry i've learned my lesson he's no longer at evergreen but there are many pieces of the code that he wants to keep in so now well what we need to do is we need to in fact do this replacement that reflects the the changes to our world we need to have representation and so that is obviously behind the dynamics that peugeot was just pointing out that has flown from from birth control is that women because they can now uh engage in family planning that works are freed to compete with men in every realm that isn't physical yeah well one question we're wrestling with is well are women just men then they are not right since the birth control pill well that's that well but they are in some way which is just what you said they're way more like men than they were before 1950 we have free because they have control yes exactly and so part of what we are trying to sort out in our culture is well you know to what degree are they just men or better men even i mean look what's happening to university enrollment for example and so we don't know and that that are that issue of universality so a student once asked me in one of my classes at harvard it's like well if these stories are archetypal why don't we just tell the same story over and over like exactly the same story and i thought that's a really good question and then i thought well there's actually an answer to that in christian symbolism so one of the things that's really strange about christian thinking is well there's god you know so he's the sum of all good very abstract though maybe he's a father but he's way out there and who knows what to do with him but he's really abstract well you have to take that abstraction make concrete you have to make it embodied right you have to make it incarnated and so i'm speaking psychologically about the story not religiously so to bridge that gap between the the ideal image which is archetypal and universal and the particularity the way the christian imagination solved that problem was to say well that ideal was embodied in a particular time and place which seems extremely arbitrary but that's us right because we are arbitrary embodiments of that whatever that abstract humanity is and we have to particularize the universal to our time and place and that's why we need new storytellers all the time now he's embodied in a male is that arbitrary this is i'm running out of time right now so i'm going to have to do another video but this is where we have to go now i want to go back to the critical drinker because the end of this video is is pretty important when it comes to this issue of gender now we now we just again heard that part of what has happened is we're no longer living in a context where this sexual dimorphism which they talk about which has you know men we're larger we're physically stronger we have a variety of other attributes women have other strengths in many ways women are more robust than men they don't get as sick as we do they live longer than we do so you know there's all these balances but they're not the same and so when peterson says well are men and women the same now isn't this exactly what we're trying to figure out but well let's let the drinker talk a little more do either outsmart the man in a battle of wits or get the last word in an argument or kick his ass in a fight regardless of their relative size and strength whatever it might be the rules dictate that no man can beat a woman in a balanced engagement because the natural implication would be that men are smarter or stronger or generally better than women and we certainly can't have that now this is all well and good but it creates a very obvious problem when you're it creates a lot of problems because to the degree that women are going to buy this propaganda they're going to have a problem because there is in fact a reality out there and we're bumping into that in a whole variety of ways in the culture now your hero happens to be female and your villain male traditional storytelling requires the antagonist to start out stronger and more dangerous than the hero forcing them to grow and improve themselves in some way before okay let's slow this down because what he does right here is really important when it comes into the question of male and female but it creates a very obvious problem when your hero happens to be female and your villain male traditional storytelling requires the antagonist to start out stronger and more dangerous than the hero forcing them to grow and improve themselves in some way before there's the you say the philistines i mean just read read the book of samuel the philistines they have a monopoly on iron working they are they are in a sense they are a regional power they are you know from the sea peoples or the greeks the phineas i mean they are they are in this area they are something to be contended with israel is outmatched and what you see again and again in the biblical story israel versus egypt they're slaves in the land they are outmatched and again and again israel is outmatched that story where they have to keep moses hands in the air the point is israel is constantly outmatched they are outmatched against egyptians they are outmatched against babalonians they are outmatched against assyrians they are outmatched against philistines the only way israel has a chance is god now again you all hear that with a whole lot of framing that has gone on god number two but we're gonna have to get into god number one and god number two masculine and feminine good and evil because the lord masculine his intervention to rescue israel is at the heart of the story which sets up israel's inability to keep the covenant which sets up the entrance of masculine jesus into the space now i know i'm gonna run out of time so i'm not gonna be able to finish this story in this video i'll have to come back to it and i hope i do because sometimes these things get lost but i know this is sensitive territory that we're dealing with here because very quickly a whole bunch of things are rushing into a lot of our imaginations say well pastor then men and women rules should they should they what they can do what they can't do lay all of that set aside let's deal with the masculine the feminine the structure of this stuff before we deal with any of those other questions and you know i i've got i'm a christian reform minister who has um who has trained encouraged and worked with the development of women clergy and i know right there i just rubbed a whole bunch of you the wrong way and a whole bunch of the some of the rest of you are like yeah but vanderkley ever since you got on this jordan peterson thing you just just can't trust you yeah well there you go we all have our problems don't we but this issue that the critical drinker puts his finger on is critical in terms of storytelling finally injuries male but it creates a very obvious problem when your hero happens to be female and your villain male traditional storytelling requires the antagonist to start out stronger and more dangerous than the hero forcing them to grow and improve themselves in some way before finally prevailing at the end forcing the lord to set up these narratives and develop israel into have israel grow up to be his son but naturally this process requires the man to be dominant in the early stages and as we've already discussed that's not allowed to happen anymore even if it's just a temporary thing so how exactly so in other words this one agenda that well we have we need new stories that show women show women as what as masculine many masculine women we've all known that it's not a matter of male and female it's a matter of masculine and feminine and what peugeot has pointed out a number of times is that feminine power has been driven from the screen masculine and feminine are not disconnected from male and female the relationship is complex but they're not disconnected and again i've got a bunch of clips that i want to go into to talk about that and i'm not going to get a chance to get into them but what the critical drinker just pointed out here in terms of storytelling that lifts up things for us to sort of deal with things like caro carolina said you know evil i mean she's polish so she's dealing in a second language to make a video it's very impressive um especially to american we're so monolingual but evil this is the level that we're dealing with these stories clearly to get around it well if you happen to write for disney marvel dc or lucas film you don't instead you're forced to make your villains weak and pathetic either unfairly elevated beyond their abilities or jealous and envious of the hero's success so this is another so this is another reason why villains are deprecated and well what's what's the problem with them being deprecated well we're losing stories and the stories aren't believable because almost all of us face adversaries in our life we cannot oh we cannot overcome look at the balrog the bridge of kaza doom fly you fools this foe is again this foe is this foe is beyond any of you swords are no use we all face foes like that regularly and now you have no heroes and the villains aren't up to it because the villains in my life the forces of evil that i contend with of all around me that that i have no ability to overcome where can my help come from these folk stories offer nothing they can't even set up the story properly and well so then why brett is talking about the marketplace the marketplace is speaking and again i'm not one to say that the marketplace my the image i have of the potential for evil in the marketplace and agentic evil is far richer and thicker than brett weinstein's this is a problem and this is what the critical drinker is bringing forward it's basically a form of projection allowing the writers to vent their frustrations about imagined enemies and rivals it's deeper than just frustrations onto a weak straw man that can be easily swept aside by an all-conquering heroine unfortunately this whole mindset creates more problems than it solves weak villains make for weak stories because they rub the narrative of its tension and drama even worse it actually undermines the hero themselves because if they're never really tested by a worthy opponent then they haven't really achieved anything a hero is only ever as strong as the villain they defeat and what's really interesting is that the problem still exists even if you reverse the roles take thor ragnarok for example the villain in that movie is a woman which is perfectly fine at the beginning when she gets to kick thor's ass but it becomes a real problem near the finale when it's time for him to win you definitely can't show thor hammering a woman into the ground because that brings up all kinds of unpleasant accusations of glorifying violence against women pause it does doesn't it do you want that so it brings him to win you definitely can't show thor hammering a woman into the ground because that brings up all kinds of unpleasant accusations of glorifying violence against women so instead the movie takes the best alternative and has a third party step in to win the battle for him no okay and and that's not alternative and has a third party step in to win the battle for him no okay and and that's not necessarily a bad move but this it doesn't really get away from the problem that he's just pointed out that if in fact the female threat had used feminine power to to own thor and to to to beat him well then in but then that would be perfectly okay the difficulty is well there are limits in terms of story to tell to show feminine power is something that it seems people are completely oblivious to partly because of the way that the message has been generated in our realm that's how they carefully managed to sidestep the uncomfortable issue of thor defeating her in a fair fight just a little something to think about there the point i'm making and he should pause just a little something to think about there because these aspects are not incidental is that the reason people didn't warm to characters like ray or captain marvel isn't because of their gender it's because everything's made so fucking easy for them that it's basically impossible to feel any empathy it's the same exact problem with and if you're using a feminine a female why not give her feminine power well we don't know what that is do you believe and are you asserting to the world that masculine power always triumphs over feminine power well we don't know what feminine power is we can't generate a story about this where what where might we find stories about this you can find stories in the bible of women exercising masculine power you know a um a spike through the skull you want to see a story in the bible about feminine power why don't you look at ester why don't you look at ruth there are stories in the bible of feminine power there's also stories in the bible of feminine evil let's finish it off the ghostbusters or harley quinn or charlie's angels if your heroes do nothing but plow their way through a collection of unthreatening neutered enemies then you'll never get your audience to care about their struggle because they don't fucking have one and if they don't have a struggle your audience basically isn't able to use the movie for basically to meet their religious needs so what exactly is the solution here well ironically enough the solution is equality and i mean real equality not the bullshit hollywood version that makes one side artificially weaker just to make the other look superficially strong if you want your female heroes to be respected equally then you have to put them through equal struggles against worthy enemies you need to stop nerfing your villains in a vain attempt to avoid offending people on social media because honestly the more you try to appease them the more you compromise your ability to tell a decent fucking story if you want kick-ass heroes that people can look up to then you need to give them kick-ass antagonists they can be afraid of in short you need to give your villains their fucking balls back anyway that's all i've got for today go away now okay i'm out of time i'm gonna give a little teaser here we're gonna have to talk about good and evil and we can use that up and down for that in terms of a y-axis but for an x-axis we're gonna have to talk about now i'm not there's no there's no axis in here but we're gonna have to talk about the relationship between the masculine the agentic and therefore god number two and the feminine the arenic which then ties us into god number one so i'm going to be playing with these ideas this scares some of you this scares me but i think we have to explore it and ask questions about okay how does this work because we seem to be knocking on this door when we're dealing with the structure of story and do these things tell us anything so that's it for today you don't have to go away just leave a comment and let me know what you think because this is going to get interesting
