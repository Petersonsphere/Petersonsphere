 Hi, this is Paul. I want to do something a little bit different now. I want to talk about a show that I watched, Daisy Jones and the Six. Now this might seem like a strange show for me to watch, but I watched the whole miniseries, all ten episodes. It was on Amazon Prime and I really enjoyed it. Why did I enjoy it? I, now the show is about a young band that gets together and they follow a few streams. There's a, like the guy over here on the left, he's the good looking guy who grows up in the town and his brother isn't quite as good looking, but he's got a few friends and they're playing a little bit in the garage and they're putting a band together and they basically get him into it and they play some things. Some people have noted the relationships between Daisy Jones and the Six and some of the drama that Fleetwood Mac. So this guy, they get the band together, they don't really go anywhere, they move out to California. He takes his girlfriend that he got connected with out east in Pittsburgh, they come out of Pittsburgh and this is his girlfriend and they all go out to California and she's going to be the photographer. Now there's spoilers in this, so beware. And of course, they play in little bands and you can see her there, she's the photographer and they're able to get this other woman in the band and his brother has a crush on her and so that's one of the little dramas and she's the dude's wife who isn't in the band but is a photographer. She'll get pregnant and then they'll have a baby and he gets to go into rehab and you have all of that but then you've got this other character, Daisy Jones, who is neglected by her mother and she has this love of music and she has this natural talent and it comes that they basically meet the same record producer and they come together and their music is amazing. Now right away there is tension because of course you've got the rock star dude and the rock star woman and their chemistry is amazing. First they fight and then they find that they're sort of mere opposites of each other. They're soulmates but he of course is married to this woman and he has a child with her and he was such a mess first time around that he was in rehab when their baby was born and so he basically vowed undying love and commitment to his wife and to his daughter and but then she, the wife and mother, sees what amazing music these two are making together and they're like she has to be part of the band and of course they have this time where they write music together and it's amazing because he comes in there he's got all these love songs for his wife where he's just basically always pleading forgiveness because he's been such a jerk because he was in rehab when his daughter was being born and this other woman comes in just full of chaos and together they write some songs that just go way up to the top of the chart. Again there's some there's some relationship to Fleetwood Mac and this and you can look up YouTubes about that and of course the record producer. Here he is he sees it and understands it and their chemistry is just off the charts. That sets up there's a few sub dramas that are going in there but sort of the main drama is a bunch of these questions about well I think the question that this thing really focuses on is the question that Jordan Peterson and the infamous Vice video can men and women work together because what basically happens is that the rock star the two Daisy Jones and Billy Dunn will you know they basically fall in love with each other but so there's sort of a chivalric not really chivalric but he he's in love with two women what's he going to do one is let's say what one is his wife and the mother of his child and will he keep his commitment to them and the other is this woman that is basically his mirror image their soulmates their opposites when they come together and and that tension which is mostly towards the end of the series takes a long time to sort of build up to this this real question can man and women work together and in many ways Peterson is sort of right because I don't know and and what I liked about the series is I think I won't give you all the spoilers but in the end they sort of cheat to sort of make sure that there's kind of a happy ending and he gets to love them both and it isn't it isn't polygamy where they answer this because that would just not be on the American menu but it's the question and and you can see the country struggle with this because on one hand so much romance in the movies is all about your soulmate and this one true other person and there's all this gnosticism beneath it that's very much tied to the idea of the secret sacred self people who are ardent materialists suddenly become you know hopelessly gnostic or fatalistic when it comes to questions of romantic love or at least a lot of the women in the deep depths of commitment to romance basically keep it there now in my last few videos I've talked about narrative a little bit we saw Nehama's video about you know narrative basically leaking out of us and and all of that and that reminded me again I was I have all of these videos that are in the back of my head and when something sort of aligns and pings it I have to sit there and think where what video was that who talked about that who was who was going on about narrative as a sandbox and it was Benjamin Boyce now this video isn't you know many of you know on YouTube you can go to a video a creator's page and you can see videos that they've released but then you can also in a different thing see the live streams and this video is in his live streams there's something about this particular piece that is in a sense not a culmination but kind of an outpouring of a lot of the work that I did in literature to try to prove and this is partially why I went to evergreen to try to prove that mythology and fiction and narrative in general can operate as a sandbox for ideology right so with regard to the critique of wokeism right people call it a cult they call it a religion and then they point to all these different religious aspects to it but that critique is so shallow that's like saying well you're that's just classifying it as theology and then trying to undermine it with reason or to prove that this theology this ideology is functionally a religion okay well what does that mean and that somehow being a religion submits it to critique of reason that's not exactly how religion works though religion critiques life through narrative not through reason you can have characters within a narrative reasoning through a problem and what you get with the first batch of philosophy that's still the foundation of the western canon with regard i mean to the platonic dialogues or the socratic dialogues what you have is this character and these other characters talking about life one-to-one and dialogue the philosophy was in dialogue and it was encapsulated in a narrative and the narrative is very loose but it is kind of the narrative of socrates and athens at that time and so there's reasoning that people do to construct different ideologies or opinions of the world or truth-seeking mechanisms so on and so forth but the narrative itself that which is but but every single thinking reasoning rational creature is nested not in rationality but in narrative right we live our lives as narrative creatures and within our narrative then we give rise to these other forms of processing reality like reason and and i think he's exactly right this gets into some of the stuff that in the recent videos i've had from the chris green paul and lightner thing and what i think is is really happening with with daisy jones and the six is they are working out all of these questions of well romantic love can men and women work together can relationships be stable can um can people find can this can this be our spiritual home can people find true happiness are we are we bound to to somehow this is where the the wife sees in the distance her husband and daisy jones and they're fighting and she says we used to fight like that and she and and so she has these moments where she realizes and she's the one who put them together you know i've i wanted i wanted him to be a rock star i wanted him to be a rock star because i knew you know that was that was what he wanted and he would you know he was going to sacrifice that for they were going to go back to pittsburgh and he was going to get a uh a job in construction or something is going to sacrifice all of that for his family she's like no i want you to live your dream so we have all these high-minded ideas about go live your dream go do this and so she puts them together and she sees i've been the creator of my own disaster and so their relationship is going back and forth and he doesn't know what to do and of course um daisy jones she'll she'll she'll run off to italy and find some irish semi-royalty and marry him but that will be a disaster and you know so you have all of the rock and roll memes where you've got drug addiction and rehab and and all of these things and they all come together but this is narrative working through in our collective consciousness all of these issues that are deep in the result of elevating romantic love above everything else and what you can actually do with it so billy dunn does not want to sacrifice his daughter um he does not want to i mean it's all of the tensions there and i thought it was all the way up until the end they held the tension they they they weren't going to let the main characters have easy outs and again it worked all the way up until the end but i won't spoil it completely in the end someone needed to die to resolve the whole thing fascinating anyway i don't know if any of you will like it it's i don't know that it's the cup of tea for a lot of this little corner of the internet it's kind of you know there's lots of rock and roll rehab movies there's lots of rock and roll disaster movies you know in in the in a way it sort of reminded me of the monkeys that other famous um tv first band so this is a tv first band and you can listen to the music that they make and it's not bad music and the the the stars i mean it's just amazing just how much talent some people have all in one package to be both tremendously charismatic and tremendously good-looking and uh be a tremendous vocalist and still not be famous for any of those things yeah uh in what way are we created equal certainly not in that way but i want to do a little bit of video about it was just kind of churning up in me and um i really enjoyed it so let me know what you think leave a comment
