 face with a name too and and to get a little story I was just I've had computer problems this morning so but I think I've got them okay put it out now so we should be good to go yeah great I'll just say that this is like this is very exciting for me yeah I've been watching you for like a year now I guess I was I just graduated from undergrad uh-huh and so and I got into Peterson when I was a freshman but then I had kind of a lull being when he first you know blew up in 2016 and then I kind of had a lull of interest and then because of whatever was going on I watched a couple Peterson videos and I saw someone's comment have you seen Paul Vanderklae's commentary on Jordan Peterson and then I just and then I just fell down that and I've watched like almost every video since for like oh my thank you thank you well why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself we'll start there at least sure um yeah I guess like I said I just I just finished undergrad but I've seen these videos so you have to start with like where I went to church and stuff but there's a culture that's developed yeah exactly I'm even wearing the pineapple shirt today a dude a dude did a little sketch of me and he had the pineapple shirt in anyway but um yeah I guess I grew up in Pennsylvania around Philadelphia my dad is a statistician my mom is a physicist and we went to like an evangelical church in the area it's a very old church actually it's like a hundred non-denominational evangelical and it's um and relatively Baptist and so I was more or less I I'm half Armenian as well so up until I was 10 I went to a Armenian Catholic school which is 80% Orthodox so Armenians are mostly Orthodox but they were all going to a Catholic school because only the Armenian Catholic groups have the money to fund that properly but then I was a Protestant who's only half Armenian and I was there wow that's cool I love it there's a big mix of people but um and I remember when I was like seven eight I didn't call myself Protestant I called myself anti-catholic like specifically wow that was my that was my religious consciousness at the time like I am when they would do Hail Mary I would just mouth the words and I wouldn't say it out loud so that I wouldn't get caught or anything like that and yeah but then and then after the school went up to eighth grade but because of other problems with the school my mom started homeschooling us when I was in sixth grade and and I met a lot of other I met a lot of other people who actually who were also Catholic but we became really close I became really close friends with the homeschooling community in the area and we yeah and so I got that's when I got into more I guess around ninth grade I got started to get really into like politics and political philosophy and my dad has been a libertarian since like the libertarian party started and that's I guess that's how I got into it and that's kind of the niche I stuck in and had kind of stuck in for a while and so and then at some point in high school I got really into economics and so that's that's when I that's when I decided on economics as sort of a career path and then in college I started going to George Mason University for economics which I don't know if you know the the reputation of George Mason it's I'd say somewhat infamous because we're the number one school that Charles Koch donates to for his programs and stuff like that so I am branded like that with the Koch stamp so that's something to watch out for but and so yeah but then I guess when I was a senior in high school I was in an AP European history class and most of the other people in the student were most of the other students in the class were liberals or non-Christians or you know of that crowd and so or atheists or something like that including some of my really good friends but um and so that that's when I got to the point where not only did I have to defend my like free market capitalism but also my faith right because we were going through the canon of Western civilization ending with like Marx and modern times and Sartre and all these things and so that's when I had to really start getting getting into that stuff and I just kind of like found myself like read justifying everything and I had a conversation with Matthew Allison that he put up on his channel yeah and and this is some of what I talked about there and I and I said like for some reason I just found a ten minute video on Leibniz's cosmological argument I watched that and then I was like that's it that's the foundation of everything and then I just started justifying things up from there and then I went off to college and I had a foundation for everything so there's not much to learn after that but um and but then very soon like two three months into college that foundation collapsed I didn't believe in the argument anymore and exactly at that time those videos of Peterson the first free speech things started to show up and and it didn't I remember I just watched it because I was watching those whatever SJW fail compilations that were floating around at the time and Peterson was like a main character in those and and then I watched his Joe Rogan podcast and in that one he said something like I'm deeply religious and I remember now that I think back on it I was actually cleaning my room while listening to that podcast and then he said something like I'm deeply religious and then I like bought full sale into that and I went like okay this is something and it was it wasn't well it wasn't really I didn't really buy full sale into that yet but over the next few months I I kind of got more and more out of faith and more and more depressed but at the same time I was listening to more Peterson and at some point at the bottom there was like an inflection point like my second derivative of my soul or whatever hit zero and then started to go back up somewhere around winter break of freshman year so wow you had a very brief meaning crisis then you were already you were already sipping the you were already sipping the elixir as you were as the as the illness was taking hold and so fascinating very good timing on that one fascinating and then I guess I don't want to a lot of stuff happened over college obviously I have to ask if you're in your mother's basement I am yes I am you have any Cheetos no I'm allergic to milk that's out of the question for me but I do play Minecraft so there's that yeah I'm sorry keep going I should not interrupt no no no yeah it's a good background kind of thing yeah and so a bunch of stuff happened over you know the past four years at college but um Peterson was like a weird rock throughout the whole time and so me and my friends started to go I was I was a big member of um in a varsity Christian fellowship and I was a small group leader for them for the last three years and some of my friends through there we started to go to a Anglican church in the area and I started to get more into more liturgical kinds of things more liturgical kinds of churches and then this past fall for other more complicated reasons that I don't understand probably I was having like a different kind of faith crisis where it wasn't so much leaning towards atheism but more towards like I remember when when I first got over that first hurdle of the meaning crisis I went okay there's two kinds of atheism there's the Bertrand Russell kind of oh it's not logical we don't have the evidence for it kind of atheism and then there's the Nietzsche kind of you know whatever I'm gonna be like a pagan and just try to defeat God myself kind of atheism and then I remember thinking okay I defeated the Bertrand Russell type but I haven't defeated the Nietzsche type so this past fall was the Nietzsche Nietzsche type kind of coming around to bite me and and I'm not exactly sure what caused it or what made me think of it but around November me and some friends all real we just start we're talking one day and we all realized that we had started getting into Eastern Orthodoxy all of us like from we were all in a small group together with inner varsity and our small group leader had graduated the year before so we just kind of would loosely hang out and we had a semi small group but almost all of us independently had been researching into Eastern Orthodoxy and then we just found it all we found out that we had all converged on that point together so and then yeah and then we started to go to a an Orthodox Church but it's not the kind of thing I what kind of what I appreciated about it is it's not the kind of thing that you just get to go okay well I'm Orthodox now like okay I go to this church now because that's kind of what I didn't like beforehand is you just can say okay I'm an inquirer I'm peeking my head in the door but you when you say these things you're not making any declarations of faith yet you know and and the the stuff in economics that I'm interested in is like church history and economic history related to religion and and from the literature that I've been reading most of it has to do with Catholic and Protestant fights in Europe but there's almost nothing in the literature on the economic history the Orthodox Church yeah or the political relationships with Orthodox Church so yeah and that's and then you can see the the Armenian stuff from way early on there was that Orthodox there was the I hadn't kind of the glimpse of it but I had no idea what it was and then it's kind of reached all the way around I would imagine that's a huge because I mean the the West you know that in the Catholic world the just such prolific recorders of stuff and and and and so to to be in that world you are in many ways sort of encased in this silo and what's been happening for a lot of reasons is that the rest of the world is sort of coming online and so it'll be interesting to see it'll be interesting to see what comes of what what from because you have the sense from the orthodox side of things that there's a tremendously rich history out there it's just it's new to us it's not new but it's new to us so fascinating I the one of the first videos that I had watched on orthodoxy was by this guy Josiah Trenum who is a father out in California somewhere yeah yeah I seen a couple of his videos he came out with a video or he came out with a book that they did some videos on called rock and sand where he's claiming the Orthodox Church is built on the rock and the Protestant Church is built on the sand he used to be he used to be he used to be English Calvinist I got different Dutch Calvinist from English Calvinist so yes and but what one thing that he said was like when Luther started the Reformation they were sending letters he sent a letter to the Orthodox Church to say like oh maybe we're gonna commune with you like they really didn't know what they were gonna do and then just the letter didn't reach them in time and now we have this whole like huge divergence between Lutherans and Orthodox too that would have been a very interesting relationship between Luther and the Orthodox because oh wow you know because I think now you know with the help of you know some fun scholars like Brett Sockel we're getting a you know I don't know why booksellers you know they should they should sponsor my channel booksellers I'm always holding up books but they only hold up books I want to hold up that's probably why they don't and Brett doesn't have any money because he's got seven children but if you started doing that then your channel would be less authentic that's true my channel is very authentic that's you know that's why I wear the pineapple bomb shirt to yeah to the authentic the authenticity thing rises but his you know boy that's just it that would make that would make a fun religious novel for some theological wonk to write if if Luther's missive to the Orthodox you know found fruit that would be fascinating because Luther is just such a you know it was so interesting because when I first saw Peterson and began to understand what he was doing I thought you know there's a there's a there's sort of a Lutheran quality to Jordan you know Luther kind of wants starts so than academic argument in the Roman Catholic Church because of other politics it's like let's burn them out the stake and so most people say I'll just keep it academic you know cut a deal at have a sign of NDA Jordan Peterson isn't gonna sign an NDA yeah yeah I don't know and I do hope he comes back soon because I know he has been posting whatever his little tweets but yeah it's unclear whether or not it's him and the stuff that's going on now I I kind of I would almost be scared to see what he thinks because he might I don't know if I'd like it necessarily actually sometimes got like he might have one of his angry tweets which made me kind of cringe back in the day which Jordan will emerge well it's a good question and given you know given the hell the poor guy went through and you know verveky on a so now there's the verveky discord and John's doing question and answer there and he dropped whenever anybody says something that's kind of associated my work people are very generous and they send it to me but you know all of us have all of us have ambitions for Jordan's work and of course Jordan is gonna do what Jordan will do but I I really hope he doesn't get back into that trap that he really got into he can be of so much use but well they Jordan Jordan's gonna be Jordan who are who are we to you know if I if I had Jordan's brilliance maybe I'd have two million YouTube subscribers instead of 13,000 so yeah and I'd certainly wouldn't want a lot of the the other things that came his way so in in some ways like all of Peterson's followers kind of I feel like there's definitely some that see him a very different way than we see him they see him as a conservative pundit right and that's somewhat his fault I think too for allying with those people or maybe naively allying with them but he was really I don't think he knew he didn't plan to you know rise to fame or anything like that so well I think he planned on it but again it's one thing to have a plan in your head what actually happens the whole different thing yeah yeah yeah and but I almost feel like that though whoever the group that's kind of coalesced around like this our discord and stuff like that I that's what I always saw in Peterson that many people maybe didn't see and I think one problem too is he got caught with a lot of catchphrases like people associate him with clean your room or with I don't know just some strain they just think he is against trans people or that's all they really know about him and like but and particularly the phrase postmodern neo-marxism people stick that right on him is that on that post bloody postmodern cultural Marxism identity politics more relativism ontological crisis existential dread and that made me remember one of one of my professors at George Mason Dan Klein he wrote he was interested in Peterson maybe two three years ago and then he wrote a short article that got pretty popular on SSRN which is the it's a social science research sort of website that people can put articles out before they're published it was a short article on on Jordan Peterson's use of the word postmodern so it's my professor saying Peterson I agree with you but I think you're misusing the word postmodern and he called it pomo bashing is not that's the strategy you should be taking in fact the some of the earlier postmodern thinkers would probably be much more allied with him like William James is in some ways a postmodern thinker and I mean a lot of people it's a weird word and he probably hurt himself by using it too strongly well there's there's a thing that there's a there's an element in reality that post modernity elevates and illuminates and that has been elevated and illuminated before I mean to what degree were the were the sophists postmodern there's a you you can very much understand an element of post modernity in pragmatism because what's there's a there's a you know beneath post modernity is a deep skepticism and the fact that that skepticism today is so powerful how wouldn't post modernity emerge with the strength that it has the difficulty about being a thorough going skeptic or a cynic is it's not very comfortable living that way and so people people check out to find ways that are more comfortable and and pleasing to live yeah and I think what you just said is is sums up what Peterson's real thoughts on postmodern neo-marxism are but he stuck himself to this very specific phrase that if somebody isn't is a is a postmodern or Marxist academic they know what's wrong with that and they pick it apart immediately and he looks silly yeah yeah yeah and and he didn't help his cause when he went to the the Zizek debate you know sporting the communist manifesto and Zizek's like that old thing you know nobody believes that tell me Marxist is really and it's not even just like current Marxists don't even use the communist manifesto Marx didn't even really use the communist manifesto it's just kind of a thing they he when he started that party it's just on a thing they made him right and he just kind of wrote it and then they flopped it around but so and that Jordan none of us are none of us are none of us are well read enough to not make mistakes like this it's an innocent mistake but at this level his critics rightly will point to it and say no in all fairness in the Zizek debate I thought he's a quick thinker and he's quick on his feet and he was able to pivot and I think partly to the generosity of Zizek I thought they had a productive conversation so you know good on them they just never got the live stream I paid for the live stream and had to watch a bootleg version on YouTube it's like dude I'm trying to help you out here yeah you know at least get the live stream right but you know and I don't know much about Zizek but he's like he's like hilarious actually I think and he's so fascinating and he did another he did another talk with Tyler Cowan who's a a professor at George Mason as well and and and Cowan called him out and called him he said um I think like you're a conservative and like that's what he said to Zizek like relative to all these other kinds of leftists and then Zizek well I don't know I don't remember his answer but it was yeah Zizek is always fun to listen to I think and his and that when they got into religion it was I did not expect that but it was awesome yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah starts pulling out Chesterton it's like well there's a turn I didn't see coming I didn't know anything about Zizek and I still don't know much about him but that was fascinating he has these two movies that are like film criticism yeah which is very strange what is a perverts guide to ideology or something yeah I watched one of them yeah it's very it's all Freudian analysis of different movies the thing about Zizek is I just I wonder to what degree the whole thing is just trolling I mean that's when I listen to him it's like is there any there there with you Zizek what what really is your game or is is this the theater of the absurd because you you really are a post you're a thoroughgoing post modernist and so theater of the observe is of the of the absurd is the most authentic thing you can perform you know so it's just it's it's fine it's fine yeah um there is one thing specifically that I wanted to talk about okay I think I don't know if you got I sent you an email maybe last night with the phrase in it I for the past two on discord Q&A is I've tried to get this one on but I always ask my question too late but um me is an excellent way to get your question in yeah exactly I think I did it in the middle of one of the Q&A is I signed up for this but I I've been reading William James's varieties of religious experience on my channel with a friend Caleb and and we found this phrase and we've been watching your videos and it is just perfect especially in the the conversations that you've had with Brett Weinstein about adaptation and like which environment are you in so I guess well let me pull it up myself it's from the chapter called the value of saintliness where he first goes in the chapter before he goes through and he talks about all the different qualities that saints have like these magnanimous characteristics of what he calls a saint what it means to be a saint but the next chapter he starts to evaluate okay are these saints any good if you're you know starving yourself all the time is is this like a positive human achievement but that so I'll just I'll just read the first little part here he goes how is success to be absolutely measured when there are so many environments and so many ways of looking at the adaptation it cannot be measured absolutely the verdict will vary according to the point of view adopted from the biological point of view st. Paul was a failure because he was beheaded yet he was magnificently adapted to the larger environment of history and so far as any Saints example is 11 of righteousness in the world and draws it in the direction of a more prevalent habits of saintliness he is a success no matter what his immediate bad fortune may be and I thought that's exactly what your commentary on Weinstein's things are where he understands that religion has adaptive success beyond the biological but he's not willing to claim that there is an environment beyond the biological I don't know if that's fair to Brett I think he you know with kind of his two-track thing I think he more than most biologists acknowledges the cultural track which is his beef against Richard Dawkins that Dawkins came up with the idea but hasn't fully run it through which is very much Peterson has said very similar things the the I just finished a conversation with a rule which I'm sure he'll let me post it was a great conversation I spoiled it by doing too much preaching but because he kept asking me preacher questions and don't ask preacher questions unless you want to sermon so maybe you've already failed but you're that's a great quote because it's exactly right because the question is well what game are you playing and the so on the way so I if I have time to make a video today or tomorrow I'll probably make it about game B which rebel wisdom just did a video which probably YouTube algorithm served it up to you which explained a lot to me about what Brett is where Brett is coming from for this stuff the you know it's what these guys are doing is sort of like deciding you're going to found Tesla but deciding you're going to never study anything by Henry Ford right and what this quote makes obvious is that so Brett so Brett's big thing is humanity is endangered civilization needs a new operating system and it's like okay I understand the threats that's not new do you do you even have a conception of the thing it is you're trying to save humanity what is that you know and and so that's that's exactly where yeah he's a magnificently adaptive to a larger environment of the history and so you know the Apostle Paul and I know Jacob is just going to be I mentioned Jacob in the last video too you know the Apostle Jesus he was really cool he was like this this this Messiah figure but the Apostle Paul puzzle ball was a fraud and it's like yeah but that dude is a fraud totally took a variant of Judaism and colonized the Roman Empire and built it on Jesus work and said that Jesus was doing it through him and and as Tom Holland you know laid out in Dominion and it sort of seems to be conquering the world in one form or another and so when I listen to these game be guys it's like I'm not sure you're even taking any steps away from taking too many steps away from the secular ish version of Christendom that you're trying to preserve which has been a game of philosophers and theologians for the last 200 years so no that's a great quote thank you for that I I actually picked up I read varieties of religious experience when I was in seminary not for seminary but I was just too interested in the book that if I needed extra books to read when I was in seminary but I read it then and it was deeply fascinated by the book and and really should it'll to me it'll be a whole different book because even you know I've been I've been rereading Dr. King's Bearing the Cross and I haven't about 15 years ago I read a whole bunch of King biographies I tend to go in a little obsessive in that way mm-hmm and I'm rereading it again and it's like all different things pop out at me now maybe they say it sometimes the same thing so I have the same book and I underlined it once sometimes I see the underlying oh yeah that struck me then too but sometimes it's like wow my life has changed and this is salient so I I that was one of the main I didn't describe exactly how what parts of Peterson really resonated with me when I first found him but one of the actually biggest ones was William James and the pragmatists and so like after that I really I really have not read Peterson's books very deeply I watched one of the maps of meaning courses but but what really impressed me was William James because I had only heard of the pragmatists once before that and all I heard was something like well they believed it's true if it works and then I went that's stupid and then moved on and then now but now like I'm full that that's what I bit full sail was pragmatism and I don't know how much you've looked into William James other stuff or about his ideas about the in what one thing that I've been doing too is I've been making lectures on this book which is the will to believe when it's a it's a collection of William James essays including his most famous one is probably the will to believe and they in the preface to that book he says this book well people think it's about philosophy but really in a sense it's about religion and what I'm sure what he was trying to do was turn religion away from this totally backward-looking either he would say either logical or strictly rooted in the Bible and he'd probably thought of that as Catholics and Protestants as Protestants are these people who just read the Bible and believe it and that's what it means to leave the truth or Catholics are these people that do you know high philosophy and all the to mystic kind of stuff and that's the truth and he said he wants to turn away from roots to fruits that's one of the ways that he sums up pragmatism is instead of the truth being in the root of an idea where it comes from it's rather in the fruit where it leads to and so that that's the varieties of religious experience is pragmatism in practice in that way because it's not about he's not worried so much about whether or not God put this idea in someone or if they just believe it themselves he's saying it's an event that happened that they believe does religion make people's lives better and better is of course he admits that's a weird weak term but that's also developing alongside this our concept of better yeah yeah yeah and so and he ends that preface with saying so what I'm cut he he comes up with he says I'm an empiricist but I'm not just an empiricist I'm a radical empiricist so he says by empiricist I mean that all my beliefs I hold as hypotheses or as rules for action so when I say I believe something it means I live by it and if my belief is leading me you know to trip over a root or to fall off a cliff then I should cut out the belief because of what it makes me do so all of my beliefs even like deep held religious finding beliefs these are hypotheses that we're moving forward so and then when he says I'm a radical empiricist he says you can be you can have empirical opinions about the belief in God himself because not because you saw God or you heard God like you see a rock or something like that but because your belief in God made you act in a way which you can see the effects of in the world so a radical empiricist is someone who holds everything empirically but is willing to like is willing to hold anything empirically even the belief in God or something like that so he says so what I'm calling for is to have a science of religion so we should have a basic sphere of action where we'll respect each other's beliefs but we should let people fully live their religion as they see fit not so that everyone can have their own little window of you know meaning but rather so that everyone can participate in the grand laboratory of religion different people believing different things that's good stuff and that's very Petersonian and that's that's wow you're just you're colonizing me hard man that's a good thing and I think from watching you the past year that's the one major thinker that's an influence on Peterson that I think that you've not touched enough is William James I think you're exactly right so what's your YouTube channels name the econ playground be econ yeah like econ short for economics like econ playground yeah all right let's see yeah and so I've been doing since COVID hit I put your put a link to it in the chat a minute now okay sure I'll be able to sure I since since COVID hit I've gotten more involved with the discord channel and I made a video like kind of a semi humorous video saying something like oh you know Fairfax County where I live in Virginia the officially says that all playgrounds are closed but not this playground and it's actually wide open anyone can come in so I've been doing conversations similar to your style and some lectures similar to you too cool all right I'm sub 43 all right very good very cool no I you're you know part of the difficulty with Peterson is that okay I need to I need to master maps of meaning yeah this is a tortured book it's a good book but it's a tortured book I need to know more young I need to know Nietzsche I need to know Kant I need to know Hegel and yeah I'm not gonna do but I need to know the pragmatists and so you know I've I've dabbled in the metaphysical club and found that a very helpful book yeah yeah that's I'm very sensitive whenever you bring up the pragmatists and every time you pull out this book yeah because I and again I read William James years ago I mean I was in seminary in the 80s and you weren't even born yet and it had a there's a weird thing about growing old in that and my mother has this saying about when you grow old you don't change you just grow more so and the older I get the more I think my mom is right on that score because I look at the kinds of stuff I was wrestling with even in college and seminary you know it's not an accident that Peterson and I are only one year age different sure you know there's all these layers and they're all and you would think well here's here are the here's the little box that that layer is in no it's a layer but there's just so many of them so you know it's not an accident that that Jordan colonized me and and that I was I was deeply fascinated by James at a very formative part of my life my friend Caleb who I mentioned he has a hypothesis he's calling the Canadian psychology hypothesis which is so we have economics professors here and they say well you know I was growing up in the 70s when there was you know gas lines and shortages and all these different problems and it made me think like what's causing these problems you know high crime rates what what's causing these social problems and then they turn to economics and found the answers in economics and so Caleb's hypothesis is is that our generation because of social media and because of the meaning crisis and higher suicide rates and higher depression rates is going to be it's going to be the same thing for psychology what's causing this crisis and so where the previous generation were more economists the next generation might be more psychologists or sociologists or something like that yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true that's a hypothesis yeah yeah oh it's true it's really helpful I'm gonna have to check out your channel because be part of what technology is afford I mean I've been able to read since the you know young years but I'm dyslexic so I've always had issues with reading and then when you know more material was out in audio format that just made me voracious in some ways because I figured out in school that if a professor just gave us a book and said read it and you'll be tested on it I did poorly but if the professor anything that the professor would say that was relevant would stick in my head and if I had to recall it for an exam I could you know so so once you know more stuff came in audible form it was like oh wow my life just got easier and so I'll have to it's really helpful that that you're because the other thing that I've learned in this crazy two and a half years that I've been doing this is what a tremendous help to talk to people like you because you're thinking along with me you're working on your own projects but you're listening to my stuff it's like oh yeah this fits in and then to get to be able to get that from you is like well that's super helpful because you have I mean here's this quote if you just said well read varieties of religious experience again oh yeah yeah yeah yeah here's a quote oh you have a quote that matches up so it's super helpful that's really the dynamic of like an academic department too because I'm so I'm gonna begin the PhD in the fall at George Mason as well but for the past couple years I've worked at the Mercatus Center which is the where a lot of PhD students get funding so I've been in a more academic environment and watched the way the professors interact with each other and with students and that is really kind of the when everyone is working on something like in close proximity that like stuff spills all over each other so and the the fault lines of where people disagree they become much more pronounced yeah so putting a bunch of thinkers in a box or on a discord server it's it's it's just a catalyst for thought so it makes it doesn't necessarily sometimes there's their own you know you know problems that arise from you know the social dynamics and stuff like that like who's cooler who's gets more citations whatever who's got chest lettuce yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm not aware of the phrase that's Luke okay the red the randos notice that when Luke when Luke is on they get more viewers it's those those it's those 15 women of a thousand in the discord that watch when Luke watches and maybe the other five percent gays I don't know but anyway yeah and I haven't done too much on the discord but I've been lurking on the orthodoxy thread and and I've tried to be in there's a group doing a Lilith book club I tried to go as often as I can even though I'm very behind on the reading but that's Luke's favorite book Luke's favorite book that's probably why they're doing Lilith and right I don't think he's been in the group oh that's typical of Luke he gets something started and he loses interest and walks away well that's I mean the personal and the personalities are always just another layer of it and it's the same in academia that you know so a favorite professor well why is he a favorite well part of its personality it's not just the the imagined platonic purity of the ideas or it's it's I mean humanity is is astoundingly glorious in in its in its manifold diversity and and splendor and one of the professors that at George Mason that I we did an interview for him for our Economic Society podcast on campus and he's one of the most fascinating guys ever met and he's very funny tells very funny stories but in high school he had no interest in academics whatsoever and he was like a basketball star and he got you know a scholarship to do basketball and then at some point he I think he injured his knee or something like that and then he had to drop out was very disappointed and then he started going to Grove City College actually and and then he met a professor there and then he fell all into economics and that's a whole nother story of how he got interested in that but now he really he kind of takes the dynamic of basketball and like coaching and like a sports team into the academic environment and so it's very he and he's an incredible personality Pete Becky yeah that so I I I lurk on discord more than I talk and I I like playing so I jumped into an empty portal voice an empty voice chat room on the portal discord just to see what happened I put my full name out I thought let's see if anybody jumps in and how it goes one person was talking about you know what what are the odds that Brett Weinstein would have a background in bat biology and now is somehow a you know podcast youtuber in a cove it virus that you know might have come from bats and so on and so forth another person made the point in that discord they said you know but there's a and they'd seen a video on something else basically this there's this funny thing that this mix of history is so huge that you know I as a Christian would say well that's providential but you know that that somewhere out there there's this kid who loved basketball and was good at it and was his life was going in a totally different thing and they got a knee injury and now is a lecture of economics it's just it's just glorious it's just this is amazing yeah yeah yeah and I you never know how you end up here like I'm here because of a somebody's comment somebody's YouTube comment yeah yeah you're in your mother's basement yeah it's just for the summer of course of course in the temporary situation whenever I visit my mother I always think I should make a podcast from her basement I really should yeah making a podcast from my mother's basement so you can sympathize with the right I'll hold up a bag of Cheetos I'll play some Civilization because it's the only computer game I play so yeah we got a few minutes the time is yours my friend I guess the the other the other guru that I subscribe to is Adam Smith right economist he's a big guy for us right and not just an economist he's a he's a yeah the moralist yeah this is uh I've read this full book the theory of moral sentiments which is his first book and I have not well in Wealth of Nations is much much much longer but I've read I've read parts of it but this is the one that I've actually studied more tell me about it because I what I know from Adam Smith a number of years ago one of these great courses series on basically thoughts about capitalism because it's like everybody's critiquing capitalism I know nothing about capitalism I don't know much economics so I listened to that and the chapter and Adam Smith was like wow that and not the economic side the moral side it was like oh yeah economics is kind of a side it's kind of a expression of the the the moral cultural points he was making Wow and well and his his footnote became a whole discipline yes yeah but so I guess one interesting thing is in the later 19th century there were some German scholars who would debate about Adam Smith and they had this thing they called Das Adam Smith problem which was okay well Adam Smith wrote this book on theory of moral sentiments and he's talking about everybody needs to sympathize with one another and and have fellow feeling and you know love each other and care about each other it's more complicated than that but that's the more the feeling of this book and then the wealth of nations it is not from the benevolence that the butcher the baker and the brewer give you your bread but out of regard for their own self-interest and so they go well there's this guy over here and there's this guy over here and it says the same name so I don't know if it's different authors right and so their whole problem was how do you reconcile these two halves of Adam Smith and he didn't he didn't apparently see a problem it's some somewhere down the line theory of moral sentiments got really pushed to the side as the main focus of what who Adam Smith was as a as a thinker and he became Adam Smith the economist not Adam Smith the moral philosopher which is what his title was yeah yeah and but I guess a couple simple things from this book is the first couple parts are on he thinks that all moral approval moral simply the same root word as mores it just means the way that people behave morals just means the way people behave so the theory of moral sentiments is people's opinions or feelings about other people's behavior do I approve of or disapprove of your behavior and he goes yeah well we can say something this is not as simple as just like do you do things that I like or things that I don't like it's when I observe you do I approve of your conduct do you do I think that you you are truly good or truly bad so we have this it's it's somewhat like a conscience right and he thinks that all of these are in some way related to sympathy so our ability to step into your shoes and this is not just when you feel bad I feel bad but it's my ability to understand your situation or sort of to mix our our well to stand in your shoes to feel what you're feeling yeah and and this runs counter to a lot of the strict individualism that happens in economics or people call it atomic individualism which I realized is kind of a redundant phrase because Adam means indivisible so saying an atomic individual means an indivisible individual we say it it's like the Hebrew we say it twice for emphasis we just use two different words because we'd get bored halfway through the phrase yeah and when people mean like a specific thing by it which yeah more complicated probably but but so I mean he kind of goes from there and this sense of we both we sympathize we kind of develop sentiments about each other and then he he says even when you're alone how do you how do you sort of come up with opinions about yourself and he says well there's kind of another person involved inside yourself that he calls the man within the breast and so you're kind of having a conversation with the man within the breast while you're thinking about your own behavior right so the the individual actually is composed of kind of different selves right and that and that got me thinking about the word individual it doesn't so much mean that there's only one straight consciousness going on here that I can completely control and understand it just means that the multiple personalities that are going on here they can't be separated from one another they're kind of locked in a room together and they've got to deal with each other whether that means that there's internal strife or internal harmony right and all that an individual means is these people can it's like to like a married people that do not have the option of being divorced that's the two halves of you yep yeah yeah so a married couple to the extent that they are a union of two people they become one flesh there become one flesh there there are individuals that don't have that do have the they're kind of an individual that does have the option of divorcing right so it creates a little bit of a different dynamic but so the character that he kind of he adds another character called the impartial spectator right so when we do really want to understand and give ourselves he doesn't call it objective we would use the word objective today but I kind of don't really like the word it's we have to imagine let's say like there's two the two of us talking and there's somebody watching our conversation right I you know have opinions about what I'm saying you have opinions about what you're saying sometimes I agree sometimes you agree disagree but somebody that's watching is neither of us and they're impartial with respect to me or you maybe they are maybe they know you better because they've watched your videos so they're partial to you or something like that but the more distant someone gets from the situation the more impartial they are but in real life the more distant someone gets from a situation at the same time the less they know about the situation so I talked about this in one of the William James videos I did because I think this is related to William James stuff a little bit is I don't know if you ever did those magic eye pictures yeah it was never see him yeah it was a well yeah sometimes you got to get the trick right but it's a if you look at it from far away it looks like all this fuzzy stuff right if you look at it up close and then you pull it away it becomes a more integrated picture right somehow you have to straddle these two things of being intimately familiar with something but also far enough away that you can be intimately familiar with everything to the point that you can integrate them into one picture one more beautiful picture so he said the real goal is to not sympathize with everyone else but rather to sympathize with the impartial spectator who is impartial to the whole of reality in some way and it's hard to figure out how to do that and so we have to come up with sort of rules to guide us this way or that way with respect to generally what what would an impartial spectator approve of he also splits us over time and to do different people so he talks about the virtue of thrift what did how does the impartial spectator look at the virtue of thrift well I could spend all my money today on candy or whatever or I could save it for my future and my children's future and their children's future so me today is the person in charge of spending it though right so me today has to sympathize with me tomorrow and if I properly do that then I save money right so thrift is a virtue because the impartial spectator cares about me today and future me equally whereas me today without the impartial spectator just cares about me and so this can happen across time for an individual and across space between individuals to the extent that we and I think your Voltron video was great yesterday because I really think that's that's very much what's going on is the ability to sympathize and to incorporate to go into to become one body become one body yep is is like a real driving important force I don't I don't have all the words for it yet but well that's already I was starting to think this way when when I was a freshman sophomore and kind of leaving more hardcore brutalist libertarian circles and entering more like softer ones for lack of a better term so well that's you know Peterson got at that through Piaget right yeah yes I've noticed that same thing because that's what you how you laid it out is exactly how Peterson laid out Piaget's equilibrate itself where there's you know there's it's got to work for me it's I think it's probably a pragmat pragmatic approach to Piaget because you know people accuse me often quite correctly of misquoting people I read and I'm misquoting them according to the biases that I have and I'm projecting my I'm projecting my reading of heresy under Alastair McGrath and might think it's a improvement I might think it's a corruption but no I that's really helpful because I remember I remember listening to that lecture on Adam Smith thinking wow this is brilliant stuff and all that came down to me was the invisible hand and and the invisible hand is is a very important part and he actually there when you say the invisible hand there's three times that he uses the phrase one of them is in this book and he says he gives an example of there's a rich man who has a bunch of wealth a lot of it that he cannot or he has a bunch of food let's say that he cannot eat all himself right so since he has all these servants around him he just gives them food as if by an invisible hand he's led towards benevolence it's very in which and then in the in in the wealth of nations it's different it's all these speculators speculating on corn and whether or not you know it's a good investment to buy corn in the plenty years to sell it for higher prices in the lean years as if by an invisible hand they equalize the price and make sure there's no shortage of corn which has been evident for everybody but those people were selfish and the invisible hand is is both selfish and non selfish Wow so yeah the professor that I mentioned Dan Klein he he thinks the 18th century Adam Smith David Hume they were a peak and we've gone down downhill since then on some on some maybe in economics at least yeah yeah yeah ha that's really cool that's well I look forward to poking around in your channel sure because keep keep you know I don't care if I don't care if you only have 43 subscribers keep doing it yeah everybody had 43 at one point everybody had 43 at one point I you know I didn't even have 43 when I was doing the Freddie and Paul show I had 15 yeah and and when when I have students they're gonna get extra credit for subscribing so that's right oh dude come on you got to get in the book game you know oh here's here's my here are all my books they're all required reading go spend 50 bucks a pop for them yeah yeah I know I'm familiar yeah well Marcus this this has been this has been so thank you so much for signing up for a slot and I'm sorry that they're I'm sorry that they're limited and I know that they're people get frustrated and but I'm trying to I was convinced for many months that the system was just broken and then you didn't put up it or you didn't put up any slides I do put up slots and it's it's just that and and I do it because I do it for exactly what I've enjoyed with this conversation is that if I were in charge of my schedule we might never have this conversation and you couldn't have shared that quote with me about William James and Adam Smith and here you have done me the the tremendous favor and generosity of listening to me and working through my stuff and even though it feels like the opposite it feels like I'm giving you something in many ways you're really giving me something because my stuff is out there and you can take it or leave it but what you gave me is something apart from my agency so it's an invisible hand at work well as an economist I'll just say it's mutually mutually beneficial exchange mutually beneficial exchange so yeah well I've got more exchanges on the line today so but this this yeah can I I just by the nature of the conversation is something that you'd let me share on my channel yeah yeah almost definitely good good because I'd love I'd love for more people to find your YouTube channel and you know you're not gonna get a big bump from this right but you know again if if your goal for that little I always tell people I say look do it if it's worth doing it for you that should be the criteria because I need you keep doing it it certainly is so yeah I will keep I mean I did it for four years just on my website I would just make these little like articles about econ or whatever so yeah no it's good it's good well thank you Marcus and I I know I'll bump into you on Twitter this discord server or wherever but what's really nice is having had a conversation with you now now I at least I know who I'm talking to yeah oh and we didn't even talk about Tolkien this time gosh a conversation without Tolkien that's like that's like a day without sunshine you know well very good thank you Marcus all right bye bye bye bye
