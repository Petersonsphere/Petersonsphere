 Hi, this is Paul, and I wanted to make a video on choosing beliefs. Peter Boghossian, who is now famous for his hoax papers, along with James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose, teaches philosophy at Portland State University. I believe he's also famous for being a celebrity atheist, and he wrote a manual for creating atheists, and so he works in this area of belief. I noted that he tweeted, and then he actually tagged me in it, a conversation he's starting with another philosopher surrounding the question of choosing beliefs. I saw that and I thought, I'd really like to make a little video about this because it's a topic that interests me considerably, partly because this is very much a pastor's job. What do pastors do? Pastors try to convince people to believe, which we'll talk about as conscious subscription, to a set of beliefs that are usually represented by doctrines. Pastors also try to encourage people to conform their behavior to a set of behavioral norms, usually represented by standards or laws or rules. Pastors try to do this in the context of community and try to do this with multiple people at the same time, often with one touch a week or two touches a week. What I mean by that is they might hear a sermon, they might meet with me in my office, I might visit them in their home, they might discuss a problem, it might be a casual conversation after a worship service, but all of this is happening in this context and so pastors very much are involved in the practice of stewarding, shepherding, pastoring people's beliefs. Pastors as much as anyone know how difficult and often futile these efforts are. On the last video I made, I had both John Vervecky, who is a professor of psychology at University of Toronto and has been doing a series on the meaning crisis. In episode 13, he talked about the relationship between belief and behavior. I had a clip from Tim Keller, who is vice president of the Gospel Coalition, a celebrity pastor, founder of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, who is teaching a course at the Gospel Coalition on how to change people's hearts in the seats through preaching. He also talked about the difference between conscious, subscribed beliefs and behaviors or motivations or things in the heart. As I said before, pastors deal with this all the time. I dealt with both of these videos in the context of Jordan Peterson and his now very famous refusal to say the words, I believe in God, because people out there won't fully appreciate what it means to believe something or necessarily he doesn't want his definition of God syncing up with their preconceived notions of God. So I dealt with that in the last two videos I made. Just last night, Peterson dropped his April question and answer. I love his question and answer videos. They're very, very interesting. But here in this video, he had a tiny little section on, I believe it was the question of if he had a chance to talk to Nietzsche, what would he talk about? But Peterson goes into the question of how we are mysteries to ourselves, how in many ways the things that are moving are, and I describe them, the things that are inside of us are black boxes to us. We come up with ideas and we do things that we think, well, why did I do that? That was counterproductive. That was self-destructive. Why did I say that? Now the Bible talks about this kind of thing a lot. Romans 7 in particular, where Paul talks about the good that I would do, I don't do, and the evil that I don't want to do, I do. The book of James talks about the tongue. Who can tame the tongue? The tongue lights a field on fire and that's what we do with our lives. And so Peterson very famously tries to govern his speech and not lie and do all of these things in order to, in a sense, manage himself because most of us have the experience of being poor managers of ourselves and as a pastor I have a degree of responsibility for stewarding a flock and helping them in their desire of self-mastery. But even that idea is so fraught because what is the self that is trying to control the person who master this other thing? And so there have been various conceptions of this. One of my favorite ones is Jonathan hates the rider. Jonathan heights the rider and the elephant where the human being is conceived of, you can find this in his book, The Happiness Hypothesis, the human being is conceived of as a rider and an elephant and we'll talk a little bit more about that. But Peterson talks about these kinds of things in a very engaging way I'll say and this is just a pretty standard clip of him doing that. You learn to kind of watch yourself like you're watching a stranger but you have to adopt a position, it's a position of radical humility I would say, both humility in two senses. So one sense would be the humility of recognizing your ignorance so you have to understand that you don't know who you are and that's not easy to understand because you think you know but then you know you remember you can't control yourself very well, you're not very disciplined, you're full of flaws, maybe you don't know yourself as well as you think but it's hard to get low enough to understand how deeply it is the case that you are ignorant about who you are. Now there's an upside to that too which also is that you're also ignorant about who you could be and so the discovery of that you know is some reward for the horror of determining who you actually are and then I would say well then you watch yourself you know and you attend to your conscience and you see, you watch yourself like you're watching a stranger, you watch what you say and you listen. And this capacity for split self is very interesting when it comes to beliefs because we would say well I believe these things and in a sense we take out an identity, we say I am this thing and then as Peterson is describing here we discover that this I, let's use the rider and the elephant, this rider that in a sense takes ownership of this discovers that the elephant that greatly outweighs and out muscles the rider isn't necessarily going to listen and so you have this back and forth, this to and fro but then you have the realization that I am in many ways multiple people and I've described this before as kind of my consciousness Congress and I imagine it's sort of like a body politic because there are factions and there are motivations and there are, there's all this stuff and it's not necessarily, it's definitely not transparent to me and but yeah it's in me and it's, and Jonathan Pacheau was good with this stuff, it forms up into a hierarchy of sorts and this again is where when you get into Peterson's book the question of a, the world conceived of as a space of objects or a form for action, time and action demand that the conscious act and so things come and the conscious self of me that has all of these subscribed beliefs violates its own tenets and we see that all the time. What sort of person would say that and how am I reacting emotionally when I'm communicating in that manner? Is that making me feel stronger, weaker, is it filling me with shame, is it helping my confidence, am I laying out a lie, am I deceiving myself and other people, am I adopting this personality at parties that is designed to impress and to amuse and it comes across as nothing but self-centered narcissism, what are my dark fantasies, what are my aggressive fantasies, what is it that I'm willing to do, what am I interested in so that I'll spontaneously pursue it, what do I procrastinate about and why, what am I unwilling to do, what do I think is good, what do I congratulate myself for accomplishing and what do I berate myself for failing to confront and to implement. Those are all incredibly complicated questions and you don't know the answers to them. So that's a start and then in terms of potential, well you'll discover a little bit more about your potential as you discover who you are, especially the darker parts of yourself because then you discover your potential for mayhem, there's some real utility in that, discovery that you're dangerous, it's such a useful discovery, it's actually something that strengthens you because the first thing that a realization like that can in fact produce is the ambition to incorporate that danger into a higher order personality, that dangerousness into a higher order. Okay, now when he's talking about incorporating and integrating, we're talking about basically setting up a hierarchy but it's a disciplined functional hierarchy and so when he's talking about integrating or incorporating, it's really more than, I mean the metaphor makes it sort of sound like moving around boxes on an organizational chart but as we get into this video, that's really what you're doing is training and that's the rider training the elephant and it's the rider in a sense who is the conscious rational part of the entire organism which is the rider and the elephant where they're both, this is where actually the rider actually begins to be able to learn how to control the elephant and make the whole thing work together but now obviously that's within a communal context and a social context. Order of personality and that can make you implacable, that can make you someone who can say no when you need to say no, that can make you someone who won't avoid necessary conflict and so that's unbelievably useful. In the ancient world, riders and elephants were really super weapons if you could train the elephant and so that's a big part of this but Peterson I think rightfully, Peterson just does great riffs on these kinds of things, that's part of the reason he's so popular and he's got great lists when he goes through them. Now conscious, subconscious, unconscious, this is just what Google scraped but it's not bad, many people use unconscious or subconscious interchangeably as a noun, if a person has fallen asleep or been knocked out they are unconscious, not subconscious, if a person is alert but doesn't realize they are thinking or doing something the thought or action is subconscious not unconscious and I'm not a psychologist, Vervecky or Peterson or many who know psychology could probably go into this better but what this recognizes is that we have all of these forces working within us that impact this thing we call belief. Now we're going to have to do a little bit of defining here because I think what we really have here are two competing ideas that we are using the same word for which is belief and part of this is what goes on with Jordan Peterson when he you know, Kvetch is about having to answer the question whether he believes in God. One thing that we talk about beliefs are statements to which you consciously and often communally subscribe, they are often aspirational, you know I believe in God and again pastors know this and this is common stuff that comes out in sermons, we admonish people to act up to their beliefs and live up to their professions and live up to the communal standards that their religious community or their political community we're having a lot of these conversations now with respect to lying and truth telling and corruption I just read David Brooks take on the Mueller report so you know there's just all of these things and so we admonish people to live up to their beliefs and they say well I believe in God, I trust in God, well then trust in God but trusting and acting is a funny thing so they're often religious there's often accountability involved there are often statements about ideas and statements worldview statements about how we think the world is there's their resolutions about behavior and these are all this that's all located in a sense in this in this conscious realm that we possess but as as we know in terms of who we are that's just a tiny part of us that's just this this conscious self and you can think about it as sort of a subcommittee in your consciousness Congress and and different groups are going to be coming in there and taking hold of the wheel sometime so then there's these other beliefs and so when when Peterson says well I don't I don't listen to what people say they believe I see what they do and so these are these axioms and they're sort of like laws of physics and that we we watch for patterns and this is where Peterson says watch yourself as if you're a stranger kind of do this third party this third person disassociation and and start tracking yourself and so so my wife is you know you know sometimes people keep a little food record now you know everything that you put in but when you kind of keep a food diary you begin to notice well here's here's what I've been eating or keep a keep a journal or or keep a diary and you take like this third person thing and you start to this third person posture and you start to analyze yourself and and and then you begin to realize that you have this other set of beliefs underneath that are disconnected from your conscious beliefs but now is belief the right word for that or or we're using I think we're using the word beliefs on both ends because it's a very helpful tool to say well this is what I say I believe but this is what I often do and so if you listen to David Nasser and Jordan Peterson's conversation and one more question that's exactly what Nasser is doing and this is in fact exactly what religions do and organized religions do because we say okay these are the things that are supposed to subscribe describe how we intend to live and if we take a third person if we take a third person perspective on ourselves these are the things we are actually doing and and actually we watch each other very carefully with respect to this and in the happiness hypothesis Jonathan Hyde actually has a very good section on gossip where he talks about you know gossip generally speaking in religious communities has a bad connotation but it's it's often a critical it's a critical aspect of human community by which we hold each other accountable and as a pastor I know it's always easier to see the sins of others than to see my own sin and Jesus talks about that with respect to first take the log out of your own eye before you try to take the speck out of the eye of your neighbor and and Jesus has incorporated into this little word picture the the biases the self-serving biases that make us such bad judges of ourselves and so that's part of the reason we take these axioms and we use the same word of we use the same word belief for them so we can kind of line them up and and Jordan Peterson and others see these as your true beliefs and that's why we use the same word so we can line them up and then they down vote the conscious rider talk well you say you're a Christian but you don't blah blah blah blah and and this is where hypocrisy becomes such a vital and powerful social tool because we can we we all strive to be persons of integrity what does integrity mean which means everything is integrated within us but we are not people of integrity because the chattering rider says here are the beliefs I subscribe to and the rest of us are watching and we're saying I can discern your true beliefs I can discern the the things that are really governing your heart and again if you go back and watch the Tim Keller video on preaching to the heart this is what he describes with the 15 year old girl that says yeah I know I'm a Christian but none of the boys like me and so now you have the idea coming into of idolatry that you say well I worship the Lord but money really has my heart and what Tim Keller is using in that clip is that heart is kind of the center of the human motivational system this goes all the way back to Augustine who will say you are what you love and and James K. Smith a philosopher at Calvin College he's been he's been moving that he's been working that part of the field for for a few years now so so so they they they down vote the conscious rider talk and they up vote the third person observation and that's why Peterson says watch yourself because people are going to be doing to this to you anyway so if you actually want to improve and be a more integrated human being and have more integrity do that process ahead of them and again religious communities community is so helpful for things like this and it because it happens automatically in community with respect to status and gossip and performance and duplicity and hypocrisy and sacrificial goodness all of these things are at play and so if you actually have a conscious community that says these are the beliefs we ascribe to well then then you've actually got something that you can work with to to improve yourself and this is why having and you know this is why churches have and religious religious groups if you really want to improve a person you have to do it communally and AA has has known that for years do we choose our beliefs well we we we sort of choose these we we we choose these statements to which we consciously and communally subscribe and they are often aspirational and so when we're asking the question do we choose our beliefs i would have to ask which what do you mean by beliefs so that's all i'm pulling a peterson here these statements about ideas these resolutions about behavior the beliefs of the elephant the elephant is going to go his own way because those these beliefs that we discern these beliefs that we then label on other people well well those are the beliefs that we're seeing from a from a third party perspective and and basically we'd say we choose one set of beliefs but but not another which set is most true well again it depends on what you mean what frame of reference you're you're trying to look at so now and again beliefs is too undifferentiated a word now now it's important for our own physical survival that we don't choose our beliefs because i believe i see a truck driving down the road on florin road and so i'm not going to walk in front of it it's it's it's very important for us just in terms of our survival that we say seeing is believing because we are wired to in fact for self-preservation i choose um if i choose not to see the truck that's barreling down florin road i won't live long um you flinch or you duck or you jump you're brewing your brain perceives a threat and i've mentioned in older videos that if i were to walk into my office and open the door and there was a snake a western rattlesnake in the middle of my office my brain is not going to the consciousness congress is not going to send a command to the cut the guy who's and i love inside out the little movie with the little control center it's not going to sense i oh paul there's a snake in your office i'm going to jump back before the conscious part of my brain has any notion of what's going on and now there are all sorts of examples like this that you can hear from jordan peterson or john vervecky or all kinds of the brain books that have been coming out for a while and and those brain books show us that we are that that the me this autobiography this story that i live through is not all of me and again as a augustin knew this the apostle paul knew this uh the author of the book of james knew this who many think is james the just the brother of jesus jesus knew this anybody who has watched human beings closely throughout the ages knows this that that we are disconnected from ourselves and but then you have the question well well exactly who or what is trying to get in in touch with yourself and this is so we're getting to the question of the psyche or the soul or the story and and what actually am i and is there actually a me that is working on this stuff and so beliefs just as one word is too undifferentiated a word for what we're talking about and so i'm going to split it into conscious subscriptions those are the the beliefs that we attempt to profess usually aspirationally and axiomatic presuppositions now these are absorbed from our environment these are the kinds of things that i forget what um what roman catholic monastic said give me a child until they're six and i'll have them for the rest of their life and the point is that you train that young elephant and even when the elephant becomes large and great and strong a lot of that stuff is built in and and so this is this is where we get some of these interesting these interesting questions about you know ideas about religious beliefs they get very you know if you know i grew up in a christian household and i had wonderful christian parents and i've had tremendous um experiences in church with religious people all my life at a very deep level i trust dutch calvinists i trust black folks i i trust certain groups of people because of where i was raised and how i grew up other people who had far more trauma in their childhood who had bad experiences with religious communities are they going to have a whole different set and these will play off on their beliefs but but there's there's some of this stuff that's that's just simply baked in i so i had a conversation with tim york who who has this amazing relationship with violin playing well i started playing the violin when i was a first grader and i played violin through high school and then a few years ago we didn't have any instruments in church because my small struggling church is a small struggling church and and so i pulled out my old student violin and i played it but this violin isn't that good but what i what what everyone was in shock was at least for those i was playing with was that i could play anything not anything um any of the kind of music we play in church which is usually a simple melody line i can just play it by ear i don't need any music well why don't i need any music because from first grade to 10th grade every day i played this instrument and so even picking it up 40 years later well even though my body's a lot bigger than i was then um i can i can do it and i can do it by ear it's you know swimming riding a bike muscle memory all of this stuff it's not just muscle stuff it's also how i feel it's it's it's been built into me you know we talk about brain plasticity well so much of that stuff is set i am i am going to believe and so now in the jordan peterson conversations with people who are who are not necessarily raised religious that they have a sense of well i don't feel god well it's easy for me to feel god well what exactly are you thinking and what is god and what are these beliefs i mean all of this stuff comes in and it's to me it's very very interesting but but some of this stuff is just built into me and we can understand this from a scientific perspective from a medical perspective from a psychological perspective so those are those these axiomatic um presuppositions and they're coming to us from culture and and they're held communally and again one of my i haven't played it for a while because every time i play at veritas forum has it monetized and i always get a little i don't get a little ding on my account but it always annoys me i like to have my videos free of those kind of things and so but dallas willard talks about the fact that we pick up our world views basically by by picking up all the subtle cues of status oh nobody in my environment talks about god i'm going to become i'm not going to talk about god oh i'm in a religious context everybody talks about god in this way i'm going to talk about god in that way stuff just comes into us the elephant is very much a herd animal and the elephant is always watching the other elephants and the riders are up there chattering but the elephants are watching each other out each other's elephant and that's the old thing don't you know they eat such and so and so is a liar because their lips are moving watch what they do not what they say and we learn this as herd animals and then there's the the firmware survival responses are these beliefs that's that's really an interesting question and so again jonathan hite's the rider and the elephant the rider is the conscious agent who has status aspirations and and and so there's probably a hierarchy of beliefs that are happening there and and things move around according to what the elephant sees the herd doing the elephant has deeply herd formed axiomatic responses and so then if the rider wants to train the elephant the rider really has to choose the herd that the elephant's going to be in but you know there's that gets complex because if they're raised in a different herd and then they move to another herd there's going to be influences going back and forth or as jonathan hite makes the point in his book the happiness hypothesis attend to the path if you want to change the elephant change his environment because the elephant just absorbs things and this in fact is the is part of the the deep psychology behind church church as you have a you have it in in in christianity and judaism and islam and also in other religions you have a deep a deep commitment to a community and that community then shapes you and and so there are there are parts of me that are dutch calvinist that will be there until the day i die there are parts of me that are connected to white society there are parts of me that are connected to black society and i don't even know that so again jordan peterson's watch yourself as if you're watching a stranger is a is a helpful admonition in terms of trying to figure out who you are because in many ways you can't if what is the part of you that wants to change who you are when you want to change who you are that's that's to be the brett weinstein story because he's always saying well we've got this assassin program and we we have to transcend the assassin programming and every time i hear that i thought well well well well who did the pro bet programming for that part that wants to well who did the pro bet programming for that part that wants to change the assassin robot programming that's the you know this this is where this stuff gets really weird like you know setting up a couple of mirrors you just keep looking back into it dallas willard was great on this stuff and again we i really oh man i wish i had dallas willard around for for a bunch of this stuff he's just such a he was a professor of philosophy at usc did his did his work on husserl phenomenology but but he you know he was an important voice in in evangelical christianity in in north america and deeply impacted john ortberg who is a pastor in menlo park presbyterian near here who was pastor at willow creek and is a is a celebrity pastor and a book writing pastor but dallas willard often often emphasized training training not trying and when i when i read jonathan heights the writer or the um the happiness hypothesis that was you know very much the same way and and and uh revaki talks about that too the the practices of your of your religious discipline these practices shape you and and so you're shaping the elephant and these are always in a sense for the rider to try to get a handle on the elephant and and as peterson says once the once the rider and the elephant are truly in sync and if the rider really has mastery over the elephant well now you've got a war machine now you've got something powerful because you have the the reason of the rider and the and the wisdom in a sense of the elephant because that's really what the elephant has is a lot of wisdom and and so you can sort of try to put the the total package together now obviously we get to the question of beliefs and truth-seeking we assume that there's a world outside the conscious self that impinges upon it that's why in fact my body is very determined not to let me override the belief system that there's a truck barreling down flooring road and i should not step in its path that truck is real and my physical body is real even though i think in many ways a better description of of me is that i'm a story even though i have a physical body and these two things are deeply intertwined we get that in the hebrew word nephesh conscious subscription and axiomatic presuppositions are necessary and unavoidable for human activity we all have them we all form them and and in fact the axiomatic presuppositions are with us but people almost always take on conscious subscriptions they might be bad they might be good but that's a natural part of what we do and i think it's a natural part of this this capacity we have for going third person on ourselves to to watch ourselves as strangers and and so and and we have this necessity to take it's it's sort of like sal sauron's ring we have this capacity to take a part of ourselves and put it outside of ourselves so that you know that's a tremendously helpful tool so that we can begin to say okay this is what i'm doing this is what i'd like to do and this gets into augustin too we are what we love because what i'd like to do is a function of my desires and and usually we we're in a community as a as a as the elephants that are watching ourselves and this gets into some renais gerard uh mimetic stuff because all the elephants are paying attention to this one thing and that must be that must be the thing i should pay attention to that must that should be the thing that i i should i should aspire to become and and off we go in that so so all this stuff is unavoidable conscious subscriptions axiomatic presuppositions are necessary and unavoidable for human activities and they must be stewarded and again the idea is well well who exactly is doing the stewarding and this is where you know with jonathan peugeot you get into the the conversation of principalities and powers and and you get into like i've been doing a lot in my sunday school class and i'm behind and posting my sunday school class but i should make some videos for my normal channel on this too things like school spirit well well a change of principle um a change of principle can change school spirit we don't really know what we're talking about when we're talking about that but we kind of know but but it's hard to put it into words well there's a principality and power these are ancient words new testament ways of talking about it that that in a sense there's a there's there's something that governs a community and and and in the same way that i in a sense am multiple inside we are multiple and and religious communities christianity it's the obviously the tradition i know best talks about this all the time in that we are the body of christ what do you mean by that well well altogether we are one body well what is required for that well it's not dissimilar to saying well these are my aspirational beliefs and these are the axiomatic presuppositions that are that that we're working out and and the nice thing about having them in words is that we can we have at least a tool that and it's a it's a very imperfect tool and we're always working on it we have this tool by which we hopefully can can reach our aspirations and again if you listen to peterson long enough he'll say set a goal it might be a bad goal it might be a stupid goal but but even the task of setting a goal builds into you the capacity of pursuing a goal which means you might actually get somewhere and arrive at something and that's a that's a good good thing and in fact it's all these kinds of ways that humanity has as a culture been able to we would say progress and we use again this a b differentiation and testing within the iron box of secularism and say yeah yeah eating is better than hunger and so that's good and and and being able to go to work and support your family is better than being a drunk so so that's good and and those are good little kind of gyroscopic guides which which do in peterson-esque thinking point outside of the iron box of secularism but you know these things these things work pretty good and they work good enough and and good enough it always has its limits that's that's the difficulty with pragmatism is that it's a it's a very valid it's a very valid observation within a limited framework and because we're human beings we're always limited but it it you have difficulties with scale which is why newtonian mechanics is good for small things but you get very large and very small and newtonian mechanics breaks down and so we keep pushing the edges and usually when we find as we keep pushing the edges we find things that are helpful so conscious subscription axiomatic presuppositions are necessary and unavoidable for human activity which must be stewarded and then we have the problem of the watch self which i already mentioned every time brett weinstein talks about transcending our programming i think exactly what program is transcending the other program because that's the question to ask and if you read c.s lewis's the abolition of man that's the question that has those three rather brief essays really touch on and it's i highly recommend it now in order to do this speech diversity is helpful and this is a war that's being waged we we need to be able to talk and we have a problem when we prematurely science are ostracized and and as a pastor this is something that i know when i have a small group when i have a small group meeting i usually tell people that no you know no honest expression is out of bounds here if you hate god or want to cuss him out well cussing that might just be a little bit more self-indulgent than necessarily helpful for group participation but but you need belief diversity in order to that's the whole order chaos thing you need belief diversity in order to actually be able to weigh and test the beliefs there might be some things you you haven't thought of and even the process from old testament to new testament from going from um whatever you want to call old testament religion to to christianity i mean the i mean jesus tremendously stretches some aspects of the old covenant and and then you have the question well that kind of tension is what makes the sound beautiful in a violin string i'll say it that way free speech is important and and i think peterson is is dead on right about idea death it's better for our ideas to die than us to die so free speech is actually important and a lot of things that we enjoy in western democracy free speech diversity diversity of opinion um representative democracy these these are all in a sense pragmatic solutions to enduring problems in humanity and we might get a number of things terribly wrong but at least there's the possibility for improvement and so you know these are not bad systems and these systems have worked out worked out fairly well um all of this depends however on a culture replete with communal consciousness subscriptions and communal axiomatic presuppositions and when david brooks was was writing today about you know corruption and and moral brooks has a new book out i haven't read it yet i saw the i saw the um i saw the piece on pbs i mean some there's there's fiber to all this and this is where we get into to the principalities and the principalities of our culture that cultures have sets of values in hierarchies and they're acted out and they're acted out axiomatically and then there are these conscious subscriptions to them and so in american culture we have all of these um all men are created equal there's a conscious subscription um no one is no one is above the law there's a conscious subscription we have all of these conscious subscriptions and then we have these axiomatic presuppositions and all of this is in play for us as a body politic and again this is in many ways something inherited from christian language with respect to the body of christ so all of this stuff is working so do we choose our beliefs well yes and no it depends on what you mean by beliefs i think this was my last slide yeah it was so there's a oh 40 minutes that's not too bad for me there's a there's a there's a little video hopefully contribute to the conversation about beliefs because again as a pastor pastors have a lot of experience with this area of beliefs beliefs and individuals beliefs and communities beliefs and in bodies and i hope it's helpful
