 Hi, this is Paul and someone commented that I should do the questions on the Peterson Dilla Hunte conversation And I did question one a couple of days ago I got quite a bit of response question two is really good and this is gonna be kind of a long video and I know I don't make short ones, but this this is actually quite quite interesting so I'm going to let question two play through and then I'm gonna then I'm gonna go back and Comment on it and there's a lot to say and I'll bring in a lot of other stuff with this Hey there, so my question is about something that Matt said, but I actually like to get dr. Peterson to address it first if that's okay So Matt you said that some people are not willing to put in the work of developing sort of their own moral system and they Like turn to religion to free them from the burden of that thought But it doesn't it make sense on some level to view religion as like like an archival system that holds truth Like and I'm sorry about the low sound quality It's just in a place where everyone is forced to invent their own morality For themselves throughout their life and then like a baby born has to try to achieve that again like that That seems like from an operative level just just an impossible system to set up that would ever get you anywhere So I'm just wondering how you resolve that conflict that was Nietzsche's critique essentially Well, I'm not I'm not trying to set up the system. I think the system is already set up. So My goal is not to rid the world of religion. That's just a fortunate side effect from my goals My goal is to have the best understanding of reality that I can and for other people to do so as well Now when I talk about Religion there are things within religious histories within religious teachings that are passed down which are true and good and useful and there's no reason to think that any of those things would go away if we stopped believing in a God because they are true and good and useful whether there is a God or not if if the thing that we're worried about is and I've asked people before and I Apologize if anybody is bothered by this, but there are people who are like Oh if you don't believe in a God what keeps you from running around raping and killing people and I was like so if you became convinced today That your belief in God was unfounded and you were forced by reason to give it up would you run around and start doing that and there are people who will say yes and I I Hopefully optimistically don't believe them But we know that there are people who do that But the truth about what is good and useful is true whether a particular religion survives or not And we don't lose that because children Aren't born with an understanding of morality. They learn that they are educated by their parents. They are taught they explore the world everybody does in fact go through the effort of Creating and understanding their own morality It's just that we adopt things from figures around us who show evidence that they are smarter and understand this better as a shorthand We we ride on the shoulders of Giants. The curious question is and I asked this for people Essentially who are Christian who believe in both a God and a devil is How did you decide that God was the good one and the devil was the evil one? Because the model is that well God wrote his moral code on it on your heart and that's how you tell But if that's the case Then whether or not if if the devil had written his moral code on your heart You would be saying he was the good one. The truth is you are using your internal personal subjective assessments to determine that God is the good one or This religion is the right one or the first Baptist Church got it right or the second Baptist Church got it right or this is The preacher we should hire this is what we do and I don't see much value in Worrying about oh is it all gonna go away when it's clear it doesn't because secular individuals are no more Immoral or criminal minded than anybody else. In fact, there may be some cases to show that we're less but in this society They are no more criminally minded like we have a religious foundation, right? Like we don't go I would be around like raping and pillaging if I abandoned God But there were societies that did when they didn't have that structure. So that sure resolved that I'm not saying I'm not saying that Religious authorities haven't been useful. It's just that what I hear from some people is that we should keep this Because of that particular usefulness because they fear what will happen otherwise because what they've seen in the past and I don't buy that because that boils down to saying I may not really need religion But you people do and that is far too arrogant for me to ever adopt as a position Done Okay Well, I have a quick comment on riding around on the shoulders of Giants Which was a central theme in Matt's answer We ride around on the shoulder of Giants and the meta giant is God That's a very good way of thinking about it except that I can I don't know that is we can think about that as I don't care about the Metaphysical implications of that I don't have to care about that at the moment But if you look at the evolution of the idea of God for example and I think this is particularly true with the evolution of the idea of Christ is that We do ride around on the shoulders of Giants and the figure of Christ Psychologically speaking is the giant among Giants It's a meta giant and it's a ritual model for emulation and the ritual model is something like Pick up your damn suffering and bear it nobly Which is a met which is a metaphysical statement in some sense that lies at the bottom of the ethic even that Matt is presenting and so it is Deeply embedded in a religious substructure and that's the metaphorical substructure that I was talking about that necessarily underlies these Self-evident axiomatic rules which are not by any means as you point out self-evident in the least There's plenty of cultures that train their young men to be absolutely barbaric Monsters right warriors killers rapists right bloodthirsty right to the core perfectly viable mode of being Arguably speaking from the perspective of generating a set of axiomatic rules Why is it not better to have 10,000 women than one? There's an evolutionary question for you. Well reasonable people wouldn't do that. Oh, yeah Right reasonable people Yeah Thank you Brigard So if it's not clear I can I can point to the Giants I can't point to the mega giant and it's because it's an abstraction Sure, but when you hold Christ up as a particular figure The only information that I have about Jesus comes from the Bible and rather than going through all of it again Because there's lots of people questions if you go to iron chariots org You will find a verse by verse deconstruction under the sermon on the mount where I point out that Jesus gave some good advice And some crappy advice and some questionable advice and that's not enough and there's not a secular humanist Organization or country on the planet that has ever produced as a good thing an intentional good thing rapists and murderers So well, that's dip. That's highly debated That's highly debated actually one of the absolutely true because there's never been a Secular humanist government on the planet. I don't know. I think the Soviets were pretty sad. No they Then I know with all with all due apologies You do not know the first thing about what secular humanism is you should read the secular humanist manifestos Because what happened in Russia in communist countries was an institution of a religious like structure surrounded around Centered around an individual and forced atheism none of which is consistent with humanism None of it and and we can talk about this later and I'll be happy to point you to this because you can say That it was an atheist thing That went awry, but you can't call it secular humanism. It's just not there. There's no humanism in what was done there That was interesting that was really interesting So we got to go back and we got to we get to talk about this We got to talk about this as we go Let's see if I hit it Question is about something that Matt's okay. So let's let's let's slow it down now and and go back Okay, so let's let's let's slow it down now and and Go back and chop it up. Thank you Hey there, so my question is about something that Matt said but I actually like to get dr. Peterson to address it first if that's okay So Matt you said that some people are not willing to put in the work of developing sort of their own moral system and they Like turn to religion to free them from the burden of that thought But it doesn't it make sense on some level to view religion as like like an archival system that holds truth Like if we abandon that are we not then just in a place where everyone is forced to? Invent their own morality for themselves throughout their life and then like a baby born has to try to achieve that again like that That seems like from an operative level just just an impossible system to set up that would ever get you anywhere So I'm just wondering how you resolve that conflict. That was Nietzsche's critique essentially. Well, I'm not okay Let's look at the question first because it's again. It's an excellent question There are really good questions in this and so I really appreciate My Facebook friend who said hey, you should go back and do the questions because because he was right so let's look at the question first Matt Delahunty said people are not willing to put in the work so they turn to religion and I Don't want to presume ill I don't want to presume condescension in that because later, of course Delahunty will say that he doesn't mean any condescension. So let's take him at his word We don't want to presume condescension in that but we'll just say that as a matter of fact people don't want to put in the work so they default to religion and I think there's there's a lot of truth to that your People aren't hatched people are raised and they're raised by parents and parents already have Fully formed belief systems good bad right or wrong Because you need them in order to operate in this world and those they pass those down to their kids To to a great degree absorb sometimes react against and reject later in life But again, none of us are hatched. All of us are born. All of us are raised by someone somewhere something Something human we cannot be a human being without having other humans imprint things upon us. Okay Doesn't this make sense because who can generate their own system of ethics? Absolutely None of us can it just it's not how humans work isn't religion an archival system that holds truth Now if you go back to Jordan Peterson, Brett Weinstein talking about religious religious things in the Joel Rogan podcast when you talk about Brett Weinstein talking about Poetic truth or metaphoric truth of porcupines throwing their quills Yeah, so Religion Brett Weinstein says in that quote religion is this great archive of stored truth now Brett Weinstein says that that truth is Obsolete or at least a good bit of is it obsolete and we need to sort through it now and take out the good and the bad And again in a few minutes Matt de la hunta will say something similar to that. So Isn't the in an impossible system it's an impossible expectation that people will be able to basically Self-construct and that's where Peterson is about to talk about Nietzsche, but Delante cuts him off because This is very interesting And and again the the question was directed to Peterson But Peterson at least in the first round doesn't get much of a chance to answer it Delahunty very much wants to come in and answer this and I can see why because it it's there's a There's a desired revolution at stake in the Atheist in the celebrity atheist agenda and that revolution is to unseat Widespread broadly embraced religiosity, even if only nominally embraced in the culture I Didn't bring the book over here reach No wrong book the other books too far a Book that was popular a number of years ago written by George Gallup the pollster the Saints Among Us and and and He basically said that there are certain super saints as he called them who? Who actually are responsible for a lot of the charitable giving a lot of the religious work? So so you have in the country you have you know a little group of people who are are You know They will respond to a poll and say I don't believe in God Then you'll have other groups that by virtue of their actions their practices And that's what pollsters often try to to get into will be doing a lot of things they go to church regularly they They give they they they they perform all these different religious practices Then you have the broad span of people who are kind of nominal and they've got some religious beliefs They don't particularly go to church. They don't they don't necessarily side with anything they're just kind of that mass of people kind of floating along with the rest of the stream and so well Basically what so where this goes so so in listening to this question and these answers and I've been through this about four or five times now And trying so Dilla hunty is gonna give an answer. It's gonna be all over the map. Oh, what does that say? Well number one, let's be generous to him and say that it's really hard on stage to field questions like this and to do so well and This is a really difficult question and a hard problem if you're trying to construct a new society well maybe that's saying too much if you are trying to root out a a very determined root system underneath all of The societies of almost all the societies of the world for all of human history, which is religious belief What they might in less generous moments call superstition And so what's really behind this question is the is the practical need for authority? You see that the weakness in the movie-watching model is that that people need to work and to act to live? Life is complicated and what is remarkable about human beings is how much we have to learn and how willing we are to teach and if you look at if you look at Documentaries about us and chimps what one of the things that human beings do is we are teachers I mean, why did I make these videos that I was I hoping for a grand financial success with this? No Thank you. Everyone who's supporting me on patreon. I really appreciate it, but The amount of money I get from patreon isn't anywhere near to what I need to support my family I'm supported by the church And so that's why I always say if you want to support my ministry By all means give to the church and if you're an American citizen, you'll get a nice tax You'll get a nice tax deduction for it, but Human beings need to learn so much in order to live and we are such teachers We love to teach and so what's what's at the heart of Dilla hunty's project here? Is he is he really in this to make money or to be famous? Well, he gets some of those things from it, too but I dare bet he would do it without the money because he loves to teach we We love to share what we found what makes us excited and so we love to teach but there's this need for Authority because none of us can learn enough. And so every time I walk into an airplane I don't sit there and try to think oh did did they construct all of this right and before I drive on any bridge? I don't think oh my did were the engineers who made this bridge competent or before I get into my car Do I think owed are the are the makers of my car? Did they figure everything out? Why do we act like this? Well, first of all, we do watch other people do it but we also believe in authorities and and we trust in authorities and in fact if You listen to what how we defend things most of the time we defer to authority And this is why I call BS on Steve Jobs Famous Stanford address where he tells these students don't buy dogma think everything out for yourself Now again go back to Alan Jacobs book on how to think and go back to the question of we don't really think for ourselves We think in communities and and we think in communities because we rely on Authorities and when Steve Jobs says don't believe their dogma. He's resting on the authority and That has been deferred to him by having been a successful businessman who has produced Apple products that many in the world enjoy and so his his Admonition that he gives and his famous address is self-referentially bogus because we are leaning on his authority to respect and Embrace his dogma about rejecting dogmas and this is why whenever I hear someone giving some speech don't buy dogmas I think you're just giving us another one. It's just how human beings work. We must have Authority we defer to authorities we refer to authorities We we bring authorities into the conversation the only reason we're sitting here listening to Jordan Peterson and Matt Dillahunty is because we respect them as Authorities and part of the reason they we do so is perhaps like Jordan Peterson. He has a PhD So we respect that he's taught at Harvard and University of Toronto. So we respect that we also crowd-source authority We see a lot of people looking at them We think well how many hundred thousand subscribers on on YouTube can't be wrong That's an element of authority. So really this whole conversation is about is authority Okay, so and this is where the again the in a sense the celebrity Atheists and modernist kind of this modernist posture is that of sitting and watching a movie? It's a very visual it's very third person whereas Jordan Peterson is very much very much reality is a form for action and beliefs are secondary our Conscious beliefs are secondary to action truer beliefs are revealed by action Okay So life is complicated and that is it's remarkable human about human beings is how much we we have to learn and are willing to Teach each other this is only this is only getting greater as their society gets increasingly complex This is why more and more people are spending more and more time in school again someone in one of my meetups made the point that in our culture now We don't let people be responsible for much Until they are 21 or 24 and have gone through years and years and years and years and years of education Whereas in prior societies in a more agrarian context You know you might be 12 years old and dad might say you have to tend this part of the garden or you have to keep This animal alive and if you don't keep this animal alive our whole family will suffer and so this is on you And so we're gonna put reads we're gonna put responsibility on your little 12 year old shoulders in our society We're like we're not gonna make you responsible for anything until you get out of school And then you're gonna say I don't know used to responsibility Well, that's because we haven't given you any and and this is a this is a problem in our society now the question of authority stalks the dereligionist project and I think for some very good reasons be because part of their project addressing this vast group of nominal people is to is To suggest to them think for yourself and what kind of they're saying is think like me Use reason to deconstruct the world around you And if you do that you will cast off the dogmas and the religiosity And the superstitions of the past and you will now emerge into this brave new world and often I realize that that when I listen to I Hear this both within religious communities and between religious communities and between religious communities and secular communities that it's there's almost always an implicit Narrative that religion is like this covering remember Jesse Ventura religion is crutches For for weak people that that stalks this and so it's it's the brave new world where the atheist kind of Comes out like like it's not Caitlyn Jenner It's more like the younger Jenner girl who did the Pepsi commercial that got pulled, you know She's she's liberated now. She's woke. She sees with new eyes I I now see the world clearly that my religious my religiosity and the the chains given to me by my parents or my culture have been shed and I now determine for myself Well, yeah, not really you're now with this with this whole other group of people who are determining for yourselves and just go into any high school And look at all of those individuals who are all being authentic and unique and creative And they're all doing exactly the same thing wearing the same clothes making the same sounds Buying into the same religious packages. There is no outside or inside. There are only multiple insides So the question of authority stalks this just like it does with Steve Jobs and his his Stanford Dogma, so, okay. Let's get in. Let's get into Dilla. Hunties initial answer I'm not trying to set up the system. I think the system is already set up. So my goal is not to Read the world of religion. That's just a fortunate side effect from my goals My goal is to have the best understanding of reality that I can and for other people to do so as well Okay This is fascinating I'm not trying to set up the system. I think the system is already set up I'm not quite sure what he means by that. I think what he means by that is We already Have we already know what's right and wrong And and I think you know listen to Sam Harris says very similar things We already know what's right and wrong now this of course if you go back and some of the other videos about this conversation This is where Peterson jumps on him and says yeah, because you've just simply embraced All of the fruits of the Christian conversation up until this point and you tweak a few things around the edges And you say ta-da This is reason and Peterson says you're not You're not owning your axioms. All right, so I'm not trying to set up the system. I think the system is already set up. Okay. What do you mean by that? I think that's okay the main point there's gonna be another main point later on which I think is actually More disclosing because I think what Dilla Honti is doing here in all fairness is similar to what I'm doing here We're thinking out loud and so this is different from writing Hopefully where we have Have a little bit of distance between us and the product we're thinking out loud and we're processing. Let's let's be fair My goal is not to rid the world of religion Well, that's interesting That's just a fortunate side effect of the goal and he chuckles my goal is to have the best understanding of reality So that I can and other people can do so as well. And again, this is where The modernist framework is really a very third person framework where we're sitting back and we want to know we want to see Knowledge is this third person thing out there belief is a thing separated from me And again when you get into Peterson's pragmatism Peterson will when he's asked if he believes in God and if you go back through all the videos I've made about this one conversation Peterson will very quickly say well, I don't think belief is this thing out here and the the conversation Dilla Honti wants to have is do you believe in God God's this thing out there God is this other object in a world of objects and again Peterson frames reality that being as a form in which we act so you kind of have the third person versus the first person in terms of Dilla Honti's belief in God And that's at play here and so so note again the predominantly visual mental noetic focus of his of his philosophy so he is trying to be a teacher He is presenting himself as an authority now. I'm not I'm not criticizing him for that. We all implicitly do this by making videos. I am presenting myself as an authority now in America We have issues with authority so then we play all these other games where we say well i'm just sharing and i'm just one of you and a little bit later we're going to see his American culture egalitarian side he doesn't want to be an elitist you know i'm just one human sharing with another human and i'm making these videos and i'm debating these Christians and i'm trying to root out these issues with authority But for the most part the system is good now now here we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some common commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two of us and we will see some commonalities between the two nowui spe saya car was, butскan kita已 memarah點, tadi yang harus disibut ring Lie pr علي saya yang benar kipas dan sekarang kita memulihkan瑞 aging yang keseluruhan. kipas dan sekarang kita memulihkan� cost spelling orgasm agak-agak dan segara activate New World is bold sunlight of eyeball of an eyebrow of reason and what we can know and what we can know and how we see things clearly it's setteral at setteralρPodsosa okay now and we need to see demandt. qaran ta dis lane tha kankaracek k kare translates true and good and useful. And there's no reason to think that any of those things would go away if we stopped believing in a God, because they are true and good and useful whether there is a God or not. If the thing that we're worried about is, and I've asked people before, and I apologize if anybody is bothered by this, but there are people who are like, oh, if you don't believe in a God, what keeps you from running around raping and killing people? And I was like, so if you became convinced today that your belief in God was unfounded and you were forced by reason to give it up, would you run around and start doing that? And there are people who will say yes, and I hopefully, optimistically, don't believe them, but we know that there are people who do that. Okay, another really interesting point, and again, a very common one. There are things that are good and true and useful, and there's no reason to think that those things will go away if we stop believing in God. They are true and good and useful, whether or not there is a God. Now, this is a really interesting point, partly because of their whole project, because part of what gives the momentum to the celebrity atheists and from their community is, I don't think it's implied, it's stated that, well, it's stated by the new atheists that God is not good, religion is a mind virus, religion is a big problem in the world, and if we would only get rid of religion, then the world would be better, and again, go back to unbelievable. Richard Dawkins on unbelievable, he's talking with an evangelical Christian and a Jewish rabbi, and Dawkins says to these guys, well, you're the reasonable kind of, you're the reasonable kind of Christians. I'm really only trying to fight against those Christians who are in Kansas trying to not teach evolution, so now we're back into the question of, can we believe whatever we want in the light of the celebrity atheists? And the celebrity atheist mission seems to be, people would be better if they just give up these religious ideas, and what do you mean by these religious ideas? Clearly, they don't mean the fruit of religious ideas up until this point as it has arrived on the scene in terms of a common American ethnic, or not ethnic, ethical system to the degree that that's ethnic, that's a real debatable thing right now, but this, in other words, the package they're fine with, and here's what's really interesting, because then he goes on to say, even if you become, if I decide, okay, I don't believe in God anymore, you're probably gonna be fine, you're gonna be just like you were before, so again, there's real contradictions in here in terms of, well, how important is this project about rooting out my religiosity? Aren't you really just trying to make political statements against anti-evolutionists who are trying to get evolution kicked out of the classroom and promote creation science? Is that your big fight? And if that's your big fight, then why bother the Catholics and Protestants and many, many Christians out there who are fine with evolution? Why engage in this particular subset of the culture battle that is always wanting to talk about evolution? What do you care if churches are out there worshiping God? Yeah, maybe you're a little annoyed that they, that church contributions are tax deductible, but you're not annoyed at the tax deductibility of how many nonprofit organizations out there that are also trying to do good. So there's a real inconsistency right here in the middle as to whether this group is or isn't against religion and what in religion are or aren't they against? Now, I just had a conversation with someone who is pursuing Buddhism, and one of the things that he mentioned, I think he's exactly right, is that we have within us a certain prejudice, and Rupert Sheldrake in his conversation on rebel wisdom said, you know, there's ABC, anything but Christian. And I think this comes out of the long history, secularism grows out of Christianity in the West. And so there's this fight that keeps getting carried on in it. And so it's really interesting to have Dillahunty say, in a sense, he says to Christians what Jordan Peterson just finished saying to him, which Dillahunty really didn't like. Jordan Peterson basically said to him, you act like a Christian and you don't know it. That's how you act. Now Dillahunty turns the tables here in a sense says to all the Christians, you act like an atheist, you just don't know it. Why don't you give up the God part and just keep on being moral? This is an incredible little moment where these realities are all lined up. Peterson says to Dillahunty, you're a Christian and you don't know it. Dillahunty says to the Christians, you're all atheists and you don't know it based on what we really care about, which is what you bring into the public sphere in terms of your actions. And so this is a really interesting layer of this conversation that I see often that Dillahunty just kind of serves right up and says to me as a Christian, you can give up God, you'll be good, I know you will. Well, why will you be good? Now the questioner's gonna get into this in a moment, but here's the question. There are things that are good and useful and there's no reason to think that those things will go away if we stop believing in a God. They're good and true and useful whether there's a God or not. Okay, who's gonna sort this out? Now we're getting back into the authority question. Who will be the authority that societies defer to? Now another thing that you'll hear even in this own conversation, you'll get to a point where atheists will start complaining about pastors preaching in churches. And they'll complain that pastors are, let's say the atheist is a Democrat, someone like Sam Harris. Pastors are teaching republicanism in your churches. We need the Johnson Amendment. Now anybody who knows me knows that in fact I've had people leave my church because I don't preach republicanism. I don't preach the Democratic Party either. I in fact, I will use politics in my illustrations all the time, but I always want to separate Christianity from the two political parties in the United States because I think we're having a culture where many believe that Christianity is the Republican Party at prayer and others believe that Christianity is the Democratic Party at prayer. And I don't believe either of them. I think Christianity is something that affords us the ability to critique both political sides in some asymmetric ways. But who will be the authority that society defers to? The vision of the celebrity atheists, as far as I can discern it, is that they really want to say each of us will be an authority upon ourselves and if each of us uses reason, we will all know the truth. Okay. I've got some real pessimism about your project based on what I see as normative in human behavior, which is that even embedded into this entire conversation we're having with, let's say you're a follower of Matt Dillahunty, you believe him to be an authority. Why do you believe so? It is not a power structure. Nobody is forcing you to watch Dillahunty videos. It is a competency structure. You like watching Dillahunty. You like watching Jordan Peterson. You like listening to Sam Harris. You like listening to, well, if you're a Christian, you like listening to Pope Francis, or maybe you hate him, or maybe you don't like him like Rustu thought. This authority business is one of the deep conversations we're having right now in American society. And it goes way back into the founding fathers of the American society, because in a sense, from Thomas Jefferson on, there's this idea that together we're smarter than we are alone. And I think there's certainly a lot of good evidence for that. And so the mass of people together will figure things out and we'll work this out together. And that may be true, but there are times when the mass of people do bad things. And we know that to be true too. So this is all in this crisis of authority that if you go back through my other videos, you'll see I deal with quite a bit. Now, this idea that individual, when individual Christians say, and I've said similar things in the past, if I were to not believe in God, some of my actions would change. And I think a lot of people would see those actions as being less ethical than I am now. Now, some of this, this is really hard to talk about and it's because I don't think any of us are consistent with this kind of stuff. Often there's a sense of the threat of divine accountability, that if I no longer feared God, if I no longer tried to fulfill the law out of gratitude as a good Calvinist, or if I was less of a Calvinist, if I started violating the law and was afraid of divine retribution, well, this is something that religious people feel. And secular people feel it. Very often I'll have secularish people feel it. I'll have people come into my church and they don't go to church and they'll start talking to me and they'll start dropping F bombs and S bombs. And then they realize they're in a church and they'll say, oh, well, they have a sense of sacred space more than even a lot of Protestants I know. So what's going on here? Well, this anti-religious people also have mixed feelings about that. And there's this really interesting question about if you're stuck someplace and you fly into a foreign country that you don't know and you're getting a cabbie and you don't know the language well and you don't know the culture and you don't know there's tipping, and if you don't know, what signs do you look at for safety? And the question is, if you see a cabbie with a fish or a Bible or a cross or something like that, then you say, well, I'll at least start with him rather than the atheist cabbie. And a lot of people feel that. Now, there's limits to that conversation because quite frankly, there's these little Christian business directories and people put up the little fish and stuff. And my experience is that actually I often avoid people who wear their religiosity too much on their lapel because sometimes I hear that, I see that, and I think, maybe you're trying to snow me. Maybe I'll go with the person who isn't saying anything about their religiosity. And that gets into a lot of subsets in religious communities too, because I know a lot of Christians that will get that little Christian religious business directory and always look for the little fish and so on and so forth. I'm kind of on the other end of that. But, so this whole thing is very complicated. But, okay, so if I were to become religious or irreligious tomorrow, how would that change me? Well, actually, I think it would change me. Now, I am friends with many moral atheists and they are deeply moral and good people. In fact, a lot of my friends that are atheists, I would trust more than some Christian people I know, and especially more than some pastors I know. This is why I was not offended when Jordan Peterson talks about lying pastors, because I've got my own list. I'm not gonna give it to you. But there are some pastors that I would not trust with anything, and there are some atheists that I would trust my life with. And that's just reality, that's just people. And so in that sense, Dillahunty's right. That there's a lot going on here. At the same time, we're wondering about time and systems here. How do time and atheist versus religious systems compare? Now, this is something that there is data on, and that's what we're gonna get into, and that's gonna lead to the blow up here. How is human behavior shaped over the long term by group systems, and how does religion impact those group systems? Now, as a pastor, I can tell you that we are formed. And if you go to church every week, this is why part of the reason my parents who never come to church send their kids to vacation Bible school and to Sunday school, or at least they used to, that's on the down, that's waning now as the popular moral conception of Christianity changes. I've spoken about that in other videos. But at the same time, people are formed and constructed. There's this phrase, give me a child until he's seven and I will show you the man. Sometimes that saying is attributed to Aristotle. Sometimes that saying is attributed to Ignatius of Loyola, the leader of a Roman Catholic monastic order. Sometimes to Hitler, sometimes to Staten. There's a lot of truth to it. People are formed and were formed very early and were formed very young. And this gets into public education. My wife is a public school teacher. And I often remark, they have all these systems of trying to improve scores, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This has been around for a long time. If you want to construct a school with high performing students, even if you could construct it, a very reliable IQ test to give to prenatal infants or toddlers, the easiest way to construct a high performing school is to choose the parents. If schools were fantasy football teams, choose the parents and you will choose the students. And there's genetic reasons for that. There are sociological reasons for that. And there are, well, if parents, again, it's not a perfect science, but if parents have their life in order, they are going to instill that order in their children. And once the kids get to school at five or six or seven or eight, a lot has been built in. And any school teacher will tell you if a child, and this happens fairly commonly, if the marriage of the parents are falling apart while the child is in school, that drives a truck through that child's emotional world, and it will impact them. And we know this deeply, and this is something that's very serious. So, well, what happens in those communities where divorce rates are quite a bit lower? Well, why are their divorce rates lower? There's a lot of pieces to that. Some is economic, a lot of it's moral, and sometimes it's religious. And that's where you get into studies like this, and you begin to look at, well, how does religious devotion shape communities? And it does shape communities. We know this, I can attest to this. So, then you have the question of authority again. What forms the formers? Is this really a communal, this is really a communal multigenerational experiment? And what that means is that, here I am at the age of 20, 30, 40 something, deciding I'm going to free myself from the shackles of my supposed belief, and I'm gonna walk out into the brave new world of whatever it might be. You might be walking into religion. You might be walking out of religion. You might be walking into, you might be getting red-pilled. You might be getting bread-pilled. You might be getting pilled in how many different places? Well, baby, let me tell you something. This process of changing yourself is a very different thing when you're 40 or 25 than when you were two. Because when you were two, you didn't even have a self that you were distant enough to be willing to change, and you were absorbing all kinds of things from your community, and almost everyone is aware and will admit to sociology of knowledge. And this gets, again, in favor of Dilla Huntie's point that people are formed and shaped in just this moment, that transition won't change much. But what will that transition change over generations? I suspect sometime in the middle of the 19th century, my Jewish great-great-grandfather had a break with his Jewish community. I suspect it was because he didn't marry a Jewish girl. And I suspect what that did was cause a rift between him and his brothers and sisters, because my genealogy goes far enough back that I can see my ancestors staying within the Jewish community, being butchers and rabbis mostly. And in the Jewish communities, butchers and rabbis, they're pretty close to the knitting here. And so at some point, my great-great-grandfather had a breakdown with his community. And what he did was send his 18-year-old son on a boat to get to Western Michigan, where the whole bunch of other Dutch immigrants were congregating and said, go over there, establish yourself a little bit and we'll all follow. And my great-grandfather and his wife, then his son who came first, who was my great-grandfather, and couple of sisters and a brother, they all moved to Western Michigan and apparently they all dropped ties to the family that they left in the Netherlands. Well, why? Well, when they got to Western Michigan, what did they do? They joined the Christian Reformed Church. Well, that's interesting. They joined the Christian Reformed Church. And so they were subject to its teaching. And then my great-grandfather, his second son, who originally had been giving one of the patronomic Hebrew names when the courthouse burned down, gave him an American-ish name. And what did he become when he got to be 14 or 15? He was going into the ministry and he became a minister. And he pastored churches in the Midwest and Canada. And his oldest son, Stan, he became a minister and he pastored a church in Patterson, New Jersey. And his oldest son, Paul, became a minister. Whatever break happened in the Netherlands, in the middle of the 19th century, set my family on a path and set me on a path. So to say, oh, just get rid of God, what does it matter? Yeah, kinda sorta, for you who have already formed, but there's going to be a cumulative generational impact that is not only gonna be about you, but gonna be about everyone that you touch. And now we kinda get into this butterfly effect thing, where in a sense, because of whatever Hartog decided way, way back in the Netherlands, that he broke ranks with the rest of the family, which caused them to emigrate, which quite frankly saved their lives, because by the 1940s, all of the relatives that he left behind in the Netherlands, you know what happened to them? Off to the Nazi death camps. I don't have, in that segment of my family, they're gone. And we didn't know this until someone began to say, why are all these Vanderklazen Holocaust records? Where did this name come from? And then suddenly we realize this deconversion of probably my great-great-grandfather from Judaism, now what motivated him to become Christian Reformed or Dutch Reformed? Well, probably economics. He wanted to fit into the community. He needed to fit into the community. You need a community. So then he brings his children up in the church and they all pass for Dutch and they assimilate into the Dutch community. And then two generations before, my grandfather would likely have been a rabbi perhaps, maybe my religiosity has a biological connection. Now, suddenly this is connected with Christian Reformed church. And so my grandfather pastors half a dozen churches throughout the Midwest and Canada in the middle of the 20th century and lots of people are impacted by his faith. My father is impacted by his faith and he practices and impacts many people by his faith. Now, I'm impacting many people by my faith. All this because my great-great-grandfather switched religious position. So you might say, well, my great-great-grandfather probably didn't stop being a Jew very much by switching from his whatever Jewish faith he had. Was it fervent? Was it nominal? I don't know. My guess it was fervent. His fervent Judaism became fervent Dutch reformist. And that got passed on to his kids all the way down to me. And guess what? Ta-da! His decision is impacting you if you're still watching this video. So these little tiny changes, we don't know where these changes go. All right, let's let him talk some more. But the truth about what is good and useful is true whether a particular religion survives or not. And we don't lose that because children aren't born with an understanding of morality. They learn that. They are educated by their parents. They are taught. They explore the world. Everybody does in fact go through the effort of creating and understanding their own morality. It's just that we adopt things from figures around us who show evidence that they are smarter and understand this better as a shorthand. We ride on the shoulders of giants. The curious question is, and I ask this for people ostensibly who are Christian, who believe in both a God and a devil, is how did you decide that God was the good one and the devil was the evil one? Because the model is that, well, God wrote his moral code on your heart and that's how you tell. But if that's the case, then whether or not, if the devil had written his moral code on your heart, you would be saying he was the good one. The truth is you are using your internal, personal, subjective assessments to determine that God is the good one or this religion is the right one or the first Baptist church got it right or the second Baptist church got it right or this is the preacher we should hire. This is what we do. And I. Okay. Listen to that and look for the circularity. Children, he almost begins by saying, children are tabula rasa, that russo. They are these blank slates and they learn religiosity from their parents. Okay. Now, Christians say, and this is wrong. I'm sure some Christians say Christians are a big band. Well, let's, we ride on the soldiers of giants. Okay. Now, wait a minute. He's acknowledging the choice involved. And so there's a, again, there's a circularity. Your children are tabula rasa. They learn from their parents. Well, what's that? That's authority. Okay. How do you know if God is going to be the good one or the evil one? How do you know if God is good and the devil is bad? Well, given the first bit of your answer, they've learned it from their parents. So are they choosing or are they not choosing? And at this point, you might want to say, now, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. What are we? We're the lawnmower, remember? We are built, this stuff is built into us. And now Peterson will say, well, there's evolutionary stuff. And in fact, the entire project of Sam Harris is to say, we can derive our ethics from our science. Okay. But Delante just basically said, we're talking nature nurture here. He just threw everything on nurture. Well, what happened to nature? Well, I'm not sure. So how do we decide between God and the devil? God wrote his moral code on your heart. It's arbitrary. Well, you're using your internal moral subjective assessments. Is it nature? Is it nurture? At this point, there's so much circularity happening. I'm not sure what he's trying to say. And I'm not sure he's quite sure what he's trying to say. Now, not much worry about it all going away when it's clear it doesn't. Again, and this is what I just finished talking about. On an individual level, deconversion will not be morally consequential for you. Well, if you didn't think either the religious beliefs you're throwing away or the unreligious beliefs you're grabbing onto are of consequence, why make the transition at all? And you could argue the vast majority of nominal people just keep all of that fairly flexible and non-specific intellectually so that they can keep it very malleable and do whatever they think is best at the moment. And that's how a lot of people live. Deconversion will not be morally consequential for your children. As I just said, at some point, my great-great-grandfather's deconversion from Judaism and conversion into Christianity was enormously consequential for generations of Vanderclays that are to come. Here's a bigger question. Societal deconversion will not be morally consequential for the society? Well, now we're asking to run a really big social experiment here. And I would argue we've been running this social experiment for quite a while now in the West. What's happening in the Islamic world? They're also running a big social experiment. If you read, I don't have it handy here, Philip Jenkins' work on the history of the First World War. When the Ottoman Empire fell, Islam, a lot of people thought Islam was done. A lot of people thought Islam isn't gonna survive. Well, because the Islamic world reached its height, the caliphate had been slowly declining, decaying, decaying, down there to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire was on the wrong side of the war in World War I. It gets defeated. Well, what happens to Islam? Well, in the 20th century, boom, huge revival of Islam. And so these individual conversions on mass scales have significant impacts in the world. In fact, this entire view of the world that assumes religion to be a minor aspect of life. And again, it's hard to know which way Dilla Hunty wants to have it here, because why be a celebrity atheist if it's no big deal? And then why when your celebrity atheists say, well, you can deconvert and that won't be a big deal. With every one single human being, it might not be a big deal now, but it gets compounded. And yeah, you might look back at history and see all of it as a geopolitical story, but you can also look back at history and see it as a religious story. And in fact, the reason even this conversation gets a lot of traction is because somewhere we know these religious stories are really important and really foundational. And this is why in a way this 19th century assumption that we've outgrown religion has never borne fruit, especially if you get out of the West and live somewhere else. It's just not even tenable. Experiments in conversion and deconversion. Now, is there a social science evidence that religiosity impacts moral behavior? There is tons of it. Now, I gotta remember where I am. You know, I'm gonna pause here. I'm gonna make this a two-part thing so I can render this video. And because this is gonna, like I said, this is gonna be a long one. I've got a lot of material I still wanna cover. So I'm gonna pause now and I'm gonna render this and I'm gonna pick it up.
