 Hi, this is Paul and this is Rough Draft for Sunday where I run through the current version of my Sunday sermon. We've been making our way through the Sermon on the Mount and this is Jesus World Changing World Rescuing Game A and U. Now this is a diagram of the Sermon on the Mount on one side and then a list of some of the subjects on the other and one of the things that I wanted us to see early on with the structure is that there's some parallelism going on and the Lord's Prayer stands at the center of the sermon and then this righteousness before God that we've looked at for the last three weeks is kind of a three-part thing righteousness before God in terms of not giving your money away for people to see not praying in a way for people to see not fasting or or submitting yourself or or disciplining yourself in a way for people to see and so we've done that center of it now we move back out again and this part of the sermon has the parallel of what this particular commenter calls the antithesis it's when Jesus says you have heard it said but I tell you that part of the sermon and That part of the sermon begins with this conversation about righteousness do not think that I've come to abolish the law and the prophets That's the Old Testament. I've not come to abolish them but to fulfill them For I tell you until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter Not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do Accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven But those who practice and teach these commandments will be called great in the kingdom of heaven for I tell you unless your righteousness Surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law You will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven and from there Jesus goes into a section where he treats Select elements of the law and in a very special way Jesus in a sense Instructs your self-salvation strategy for saving your soul It basically says that you cannot save your soul by external conformity To the law. Are you avoiding murder? Good for you. How's your anger? Are you avoiding adultery? Good for you Talk to me about your lust Or do you keep your sexual life legal? Good for you. What about your marriage? Do you only hit back well good for you, why are you hitting back? See he gets any digs into these things at a deeper level and he of course concludes this section with Be perfect like your heavenly be perfect like your heavenly father Who causes it to rain and the sun to shine on the just and the unjust his perfection is in his generosity Now Jesus lays out that moral law there, but some of you will say but I don't believe in the law Some of you will say but I don't believe in an afterlife. I believe that when I die I'm done and so But that doesn't mean I'm immoral. I still don't murder. I still don't lie I still don't commit adultery or if I do these things They have some good justification at least in my own eyes or in the eyes of the opinions of the people that I care about Atheists are naturally very concerned about being seen as good people and as moral and you can find a lot of YouTube Videos where you know, this is what happens when you raise your kids with no religion Well teach them to be empathetic teach them to be moral teach them to do what's right in the eyes of others Well, they don't murder they don't steal They don't they try to keep their sex legal the immaterial form of their righteousness is in many ways in sort of the collective Subjective or maybe just to satisfy themselves Spiritual as they would call it would be the inter relational for them because Well, it gets a little hard to ask the question Well, what is moving the matter if the matter isn't moving itself? But again Jesus comes in there and says be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them If you do you'll have no reward for your father from your father in heaven And again an atheist would say well, I don't care about that aspect of it So go ahead and show your virtue publicly see it gets difficult now What we see is that basically this gets compressed into two dimensions you have the reputational dimension And you have the material dimension and now Jesus is going to address the material dimension Because if you're a materialist if you say that there is no god and there's nothing after death and All that we are doing right now is having the experience that a conscious being should have Well What does that mean about the good what really is important? Jesus continues with a very famous passage Jesus continues with a very famous passage that Might sound very familiar to you and what's sort of interesting about this passage is that Even Christians are going to feel a little uncomfortable about this And so we're gonna have to do a little bit of exegetical work and talking about the language of the passage Most traditional translations will say something like do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth Where moth and vermin destroy or moth and rust consume And where the thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven Where moth and vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal For where your treasure is there will your heart be also Now again if you're an atheist well what are you going to do with this? How do you store up treasure in heaven? Do you store up your treasure relationally? Now I wanted to take a little closer look at the language before translation of this Because the two words store and treasure in Greek are really the same word And so thinking about what's an English word that then of course the Greek is You can take that Greek in the New Testament and compare it to the first century translation of the First century BC translation of the Old Testament into Greek that was done in Alexandria called the Septuagint And get an idea for what the Hebrew scholars believed best fit for the Greek language And what would fit with that word and the word is very much like heaping up So if you're living in an agricultural society you would heap up your stores of grain or multiply your stores of sheep Or if it was gold or silver you would pile up in your treasure room your stores of treasure And so that word very much means to to store up to heap up And so I thought maybe heap would be a word that would sort of play with our filters a little bit And get us thinking in a fresh way about this verse so I did my own little translation of it Do not heap up for yourselves heaps on earth And that really gets visual where moth and vermin destroy now the New Testament translators are Sometimes rust and and really the word there is sort of eating And so it's so then they try and get little animal images in there but the idea is quite simple If you had a pile of grain well the vermin would get in and eat the grain If you had a pile of clothing clothing was a very big indicator of wealth in the ancient world Well moths would come and and eat the clothing and and so your heaps of clothing or grain or Or whatever it is whatever it is you value and whatever it is you sort of Put your trust in in terms of holding value in this world Jesus says don't store it up here on earth Because it gets eaten away but heap up for yourselves heaps in heaven and then you think What would I heap up in heaven where moths and vermin do not destroy and where thieves do not Break in and steal for where your heaps are there your heart will be also and again the reason I Use heaps is because you sort of have this picture of working all the time in the field to bring in This grain working all the time and in in the market to a step to to buy this fancy clothing to To accumulate this gold and so where your heap is now we're using a location image here where your heap is That's what you think about How's my 401k doing? The next passage is again a little bit of a difficult passage and partly because The theory about how eyesight worked in the ancient world was a little different from us The eye is the lamp of the body and now that sounds strange in english But it made perfect sense to the original listeners because the idea was sort of like the eyes are the lamps of the body In the way that your headlamps or your headlights are the lamps of the car Okay, and then you see this with someone who has bright eyes or their eyes were shining. I mean these are very Common ways of understanding eyes But then because this is different for us a lot of translators Try to mess around with the translation to make it intelligible in english But I did a little translation that will sort of keep the words there even though they're they're difficult for us to understand Therefore your if your eye is single or simple and if you look at some old translations You'll find those words using used your whole body will be full of light But if your eye is evil Your whole body will be dark Therefore if the light in your the light in you is darkness. How great is the darkness and again? This is a very confusing passage for many And to the best that I can find and you're gonna if you look at a whole bunch of commentaries You'll see a whole bunch of bible scholars with all different takes on this passage But i'll give you my take that the the question is whether your insides and your outsides will be the same the old testament places and the new testament places a great deal of criticism on duplicity That would be the opposite of what we would call integrity And and there there could be in this passage a sense that if inside you are good You will see the good out there, but if inside you are dark Well, everything is dark and probably many of you have known that there could be a connotation here Or maybe i'm just putting it on there here of cynicism And and those who have a I think in a sense what we might say in english those who cast a cynical eye Well, everything they see is darkness and those who perhaps in a polyannish way are looking out with good intent Well, the world looks much better But but what's critical here is is the capacity of the eye it seems To to keep things open Are you single-minded or are you duplicitous and evil? And and now we're leveraging this because of the passage before is fairly easy to understand Heeping up for your 12 treasures in earth and the passage that after is right alongside right along with the first one and so It seems to be a question of a double face or a double heart or a single-minded life Because in this world, we're always torn between two between two things heaven and earth often So no one is able to serve two masters Either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other You are not able to serve god and And then what happens again if you read an old translation? They'll use a loan word a loan word all the way from aramaic Which was the common language that was spoken when jesus was teaching The loan word was mammon mammona. Well, what is that? Well, what is what is mammona? Well, actually it's pretty close to heaps And so if we go back and we look at don't heap up for yourself Treasures on earth where the eaters eat it or the thieves break in and steal it when it comes to the gold the things That eaters don't eat But heap up for yourself treasures in heaven where there are no moths and eaters to eat it And where there's no thieves that break in and steal for where your heaps are there will your heart be and the state of your heart Very much is connected in terms of what you see around you And what you see going on. So if it's darkness inside How great that darkness is because there's plenty of darkness in the world You can't serve two masters You will love the one and hate the other or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other and so you have to choose Is it going to be god? Or is it going to be your heaps? Now most contemporary translations will choose money and money isn't a bad translation because in many ways because piles of grain get eaten by vermin and clothing gets eaten by moths and Gold is stolen by thieves We have used a thing That's fairly immune to decay. It's really an idea which is dollars. I mean show me a dollar Well, you might say well, well here's a dollar bill But you know as well as I do This is sort of just a sacrament of a dollar that You have You know if you have a thousand dollars in the bank It doesn't mean there's a little box in the bank with a thousand of these one stacked up on top of the other Dollars are completely fictitious. They're not subject to decay Like gold is not subject to decay But they are subject to theft and so well, what is jesus getting at here? He is again mostly talking about your heart But he's not done Therefore I tell you do not worry about your life What you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear Is not life more than food and the body more than clothes Look at the birds of the air They did not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them Are you not more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? Now many people in reading this passage have noted I find dead birds all the time Yeah We do die like the birds. Don't we? Yeah, the point of this passage is not that well somehow if you're religious and you trust in god then You won't have anything to worry about the point of this passage as with the previous passage before it is all about the concerns of your heart Where is your heart? That's the question your life is finite You will die like the birds of the air Like the grass of the fields and its place remembers it no more The old testament is very clear on this but your worry about it Does that really add to your life? But what exactly is your life? And why do you worry about your clothes those things that moth eats See how the flowers of the field grow they do not labor or spin Yet I tell you that night even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these Clothing was a very big deal in the ancient world most people had One set of clothing to wear and so your status in society was very much Communicated by the clothing you wear still is today, but not to the degree it was there If this is how god closed the grass of the field which are worth nothing cows eat it Which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire Will he not much more clothe you? you of little faith So so what's he getting at with this worry? Well the same thing he's getting at earlier with The concerns of the heart and the heaping Did you select the factors that govern the beauty of your adornments because the truth is You didn't choose your parents or your genetics and in many ways your social status was determined By to whom you were born and where you were born and all these sorts of things The nation the century the class you didn't choose any of these things You didn't choose whether or not you'd live during a pandemic surprise here. We are A war a famine a depression Yeah, the birds of the air and the flowers of the field They're pretty they're pretty finite Yeah, you sit here and you wring your hands and you worry and you worry and you worry You didn't choose any of this Jesus is basically telling you You're pretty small Do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink? What shall we wear? For the and here again a greek word the ethne. You know a lot of Bibles will translate it pagans. It's a much older That's coming from the latin really the because if you say the nations what what it means is that You're talking about the jewish people And then you're talking about the goi the people who are the nations the ethne of the world the people who are who don't believe In god. Well, why do they work this way? If you remember some of the things i've talked about in terms of the the meta divine realm that That the the common pagan and even materialist conception of the world is that this world is just this Impersonal place and it's up to you and your power to make life work. And if you fail at it. Well, then you're lost But That's not the story of the bible That's not the story of the the people of god according to the old testament and then the new testament No, you might suffer and you will die But you are in god's hands and he is choosing for you it's not So much just simply left up to you the ethne the nations they run after these things But your father in heaven knows that you need them But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well Therefore do not worry again back to the worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself Each day has enough trouble on its own and again the point here is Every day is going to have trouble Birds die flowers fade cows eat it. It's thrown into the fire Yeah, so with the with the atheists. Yeah, we are we are we are fodder for the age of decay Age of decay But how do you think about it how do you approach it how much heaping Now this heaping again is a very anxious heaping How much anxious heaping will you do? You see now i'm covering up Okay the nations Oops Okay The nations seek their reputation and their lives it's all up to them so you'd better worry Even they'll tell you it's probably not a good idea you'll burn through your Autonomic nervous system and die young Ironically worrying doesn't in fact add any days to your life worrying takes them away And jesus teaches Consider your reputation with god an audience of one Don't worry about what you can't control Live freely trusting in your father in heaven Now you get the two sets of the parallels here in the sermon Now you might say i'd love to tell you what you want to hear That maybe it's all up to you because you trust yourself Or maybe you don't trust yourself at all and so it's it's all just up to god and you have nothing to do in life Well, that's not true either jesus gives plenty of admonitions That somehow it's you're able to secure your own righteousness your own moral standing with god and the community That that you're able to secure your physical welfare and your pleasure That's natural But it's a fantasy and it's a fantasy that is born out every time you see someone who by virtue of How they were born or where they were born? Simply have their entire life stacked against them Maybe they're born with a birth defect and they die young Maybe they're born at the bottom of a social heap and they never get to climb out Maybe they were born at the wrong time And everything was against them Maybe they just arrived at the flower of their youth and they got drafted into a war and they they died a senseless death On some faraway beach Yeah, the birds of the air fall one after another The message here isn't well, you know Religion will make you wealthy and happy and satisfied You're not in control of your moral quality near to the degree that you imagine Oh congratulations, you haven't murdered anyone Talk to me about the bitterness in your heart. Oh congratulations. You haven't slept around Talk to me about how you think about the others Talk to me about your divorce about your oath taking your yes be yes and your no be no and And the vengeance that you that you just nurse in your heart Do you have that generosity that even we as a culture? admire So so don't live your life heaping up It's not the way life is supposed to work Don't live your life heaping up because you can't plan your life. You have one master God is good. So trust him. It doesn't mean you won't die young Don't be anxious Look at nature Your father in heaven knows what you need So seek first his kingdom And his righteousness I would love to stop the sermon here because this is an easy place to stop but The application of this gets hard as many of you know Is savings for retirement against jesus command? Can I realistically stop worrying i'm anxious all the time and now with covid it's all around me Is money evil? What does it mean to seek his kingdom and his righteousness? Why are there two things and not one? One now I can do a whole sermon series just on these things, but I'm not going to So i'll give a little bit of wisdom What does why is jesus talking about money in this way or mammon or heaping? Well jesus had a very interesting relationship with money Clearly he wasn't a wealthy man. He didn't own Vast amounts of property But he wasn't destitute either he had at least a piece of clothing that the roman soldiers saw fit to not Divide up so they cast lots for it He relied on the generosity of wealthy people for his food and his lodging Although for the first 30 years of his life, it seems he worked for his own to sustain himself. So The point here isn't money is bad and the point here isn't Be responsible with your money money seems almost incidental to jesus He understands its conceits And he understands its importance, but it's the heaping up It's the disposition of the heart that's seen in the heaping and the worrying that jesus says to his disciples Don't do it There's no life there That's what the ethne that's what the nations chase after and it goes away Jesus is most concerned with how it grips our hearts where your heap is There is where your heart is So first we should begin by understanding our smallness So much of your life is chosen for you by others in the flow of history You are responsible for what you do with the opportunities and the challenges. So Go for it But that's a very different attitude than i'm working my heap. I'm working my heap The eulogy virtues versus the versus the resume virtues and i've often found this david brooks introduced it to me in his book the road to character We have these resume virtues where we're heaping up things We're heaping up things on our resume. We're heaping up our degrees. We're heaping up the impressive job titles We've had we're heaping up the the accomplishments out there in the world But really on your deathbed Is this what you ponder? and I've seen this dealt with in movies the razor's edge one of my favorite movies from the 80s The one guy who who lived his whole life Worrying about what everybody thought of him worrying about his money his estate all of these things Is that what matters? When he's dying This isn't hard to know pretty much almost everybody knows this whether or not you believe in god What do you really? Care about for those you love. Where is your heart really? Yes You want people to be secure happy and comfortable it is many times when it's often the man who dies before the woman in a marriage and my friend will look at me and Will you look after my wife? Yes We'll keep an eye on your wife And so they're worried about their loved ones Do they want them to live fabulously wealthy? You know, well, they'd be secure comfortable happy. Yes, but but once Sort of the the minimum requirement is met Nobody on their deathbed says I wished I worked more up more more time in the office. I wish I spent more time heaping Look at what jesus says that kingdom righteousness, what's he getting after? Is there peace among the children? Our past divisions Reconciled well the broken be mended Will the world be mended Have I done right by this world? And my god, how did I use my time and treasure? Your heart is not on the treasure or the time the heart is on the goal Of what you're using these things for towards what end? A lot of talk about this game be what if everybody in the world lived this way In many ways when I listen to the concerns that individuals who talk about game be have These are their concerns We're not far off on that score less anxious less workaholism Fewer barn builders the best illustration of jesus teaching I think comes from jesus Someone in the crowd said to the teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me Have you ever seen a family squabble over inheritance money? jesus replied man Who appointed me as judge and arbiter over you classic jesus move? Then he said to them talking to the crowd Watch out Be guard against all kinds of greed Life does not consist in the abundance of possessions life does not consist in heaping up And he told them this parable The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest he thought to himself now again What may who made this ground fertile? Did the lord bring the rain did the lord bring the sun it was all a gift? And boom suddenly he's a wealthy man And he thought to himself what shall I do? I have no place to store my crops. I have no place for my heaps Then he said this is what i'll do I'll tear down my barns and i'll build bigger ones And there I will store my surplus grain now again The bible isn't against barn building read the story of joseph joseph says we're gonna have seven fat years and seven lean years So build big barns and we'll feed the world And joseph is an old testament picture of jesus It's the next move And i'll say to myself you have plenty of grain to live up to laid up for many years Take life easy eat drink and be merry Ah, there it is. There it is the center of his heart But god said to him you fool you fool This very night your life will be demanded of you Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself? This is how it will be With whoever stores up things for themselves But is not rich towards god
