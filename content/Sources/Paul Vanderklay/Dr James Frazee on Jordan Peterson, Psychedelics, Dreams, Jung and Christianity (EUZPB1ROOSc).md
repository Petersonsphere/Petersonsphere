 Hi, this is Paul and I have a special guest today named James Frazi and James goes to James, introduce yourself. My name is James Frazi and I'm a professor of psychology at Cosumnes River College here in South Sacramento. So Paul and I serve a similar demographic of folks in very different ways and in some very similar ways. Okay, I met you before but then we bumped into each other and we discovered a similar interest in Jordan Peterson. Why don't you talk a little bit about how you found Jordan Peterson and what got you interested in him? Well Paul and I met in a completely random way that he came to the church I attend and I just saw him that morning and greeted him and got to know him and found out he was a pastor down here at Livingstone and I thought that was really neat that on his day off he would go to church. That was a pretty profound thing for me on my day off I wouldn't go lecture. Actually my wife probably thinks I lecture. So I met him then and randomly I saw some videos that he was doing with the Freddie and Paul show back. I told him today that I saw the Aslan rap video and I thought oh I just got to keep watching this it hooked me from the beginning. And synergistically both he and I became interested in Jordan Peterson and the videos that he was releasing and so we got to talking and then I became a part of the meetup group that he started here and it's just been a really insightful time to hear from people and to be able to talk through some of these things and it's been a real intense and good and learning experience to be a part of the meetup group. I just find it so fascinating so many interesting people come and they share some really great ideas I haven't thought of and say things I don't agree with and I mean I like that type of thing. So it's been fun. So you first heard about Jordan Peterson from a student correct? So I teach at the college here and I teach well I should have said that before my PhD is in clinical neuropsychology so Dr. Peterson and I have similar training and one of my students came to me and said oh a lot of what you're talking about sounds a lot like Jordan Peterson and in fact the way you speak does because you say things forthrightly that are somewhat shocking and meant to make us think about things in a deep and intense way and he said you sound a lot like Jordan Peterson have you watched his videos? And so I hadn't and this was office hours so I said do you want to watch some? And I think we picked up on one of his videos on the personality lectures and so I watched that with the student and heard some of the similar things that I teach my students about people and their behavior, the brain and it was also some things I also teach statistics at the college here and so I really enjoyed his I enjoyed the way he described empirical methods of investigation so that really sparked my interest and then I kept watching and I kept watching and my professional development sort of took Jordan Peterson in turn. So your professional development took a Jordan Peterson turn what does that mean? How has he shaped you do you think? One of the most important things in my job is being able to communicate very complex ideas about the brain and behavior relationship which fundamentally people understand the idea of that but when it gets to the nitty gritty it's very difficult to give good analogies and to speak clearly and concisely and I teach at a community college which has an intense difference in people's abilities preparation and so what I love about Jordan Peterson is that he doesn't compromise the language but then he recognizes sometimes that people aren't familiar with things and explains it in a way that helps people to understand very complex ideas about neuropsychology and so that really helped me to think through how it is that I'm discussing difficult concepts about the brain and how that translates to literally what people are doing how they're feeling and it's been really helpful for me to use some of the language to be able to communicate effectively with my students. Okay so what part of Jordan Peterson's I mean the guy talks about all kinds of things what part of the kinds of things he talks about are of most interest to you? That's a loaded question right? They're all loaded. From a professional standpoint I enjoy his integration of the mysterious elements of what we don't know and how science doesn't explain a lot of things about the integration of biology or brain neuroscience and people's experience of their conscious mind. That's a great thing to think through but from a personal standpoint another thing is that when I was doing my training the the curriculum was you don't just focus on neuropsychology you also have to pick something completely different from what you're doing and so you're given these options of what you could go into and I could have done school psychology I could have done rational emotive behavioral therapy I could have learned some sort of other technique but I sought out one of the instructors Dr. Teague actually I think he's now here in Sacramento and he's the Jungian and he taught us a curriculum of Jungian psychoanalytic psychodynamic psychotherapies dream analysis. We did intense experiences where we would go for a week to a Franciscan monastery out in the middle of nowhere in California and do silent retreats where he would lecture to us during the day but we were to do nothing about speaking at all and that was really powerful for me from a personal standpoint and so I began to read a lot of Jung's work and Freud and Adler and the curriculum that we used for one of those or one of the parts that was a book that Peterson described as a fantastic intro to psychoanalytic and psychodynamic thought and that's the discovery of the unconscious by Ellen Brejai. I highly recommend that book it's thick tome but it's good stories and it's not just the theories of these people were having really interesting thoughts about human spirit psyche, intellect, pathology, psychosis. It's really a great read so I highly recommend that one. So the personal side was that Jungian and psychoanalytic thought really helped develop me as a person not something that I apply and I don't actually teach that in my real-life job at the college because it's not something that's part of our curriculum and it's something that people would get if they're continuing a course of study in psychology and really focusing on clinical aspects of that. Now as a pastor I went to Christian school K through 12 I went to Calvin College I went to Calvin Seminary I'm very much a product of my subculture and I would have to say that if there was someone that I almost never heard anything about in all of my educational years it was Jung and Jung has a very negative reputation in the evangelical community. A lot of people are made nervous by him they have concerns about the occult they have you know some the evangelical community has had a long-standing suspicion of Freud and Jung but now you as you mentioned we met in church so you go to church you're a Christian and you studied Jung and how should Christians think about Jung in your opinion? I don't know my personal experience again that the side of Peterson that we're talking about that professionally I understand is very much the neuropsych side and Jung is much more of someone who helped me to understand myself in relationship to my community in relationship to a larger community in relationship to the inner part of who I am and it really was a benefit to me personally. What should my experiences like yours I actually grew up going to what you call an evangelical church you you actually taught me what that was I didn't know we just called ourselves non-denominational and I thought that meant that all we did was not pay a larger organization I didn't know that there were such a wide doctrinal difference but again that's the the context you grew up and becomes your reality and I went to a Christian school my whole life my mother actually taught she was a teacher at the Christian school I was I used to joke I was at my church seven days a week growing up because I went to school there Monday through Friday Saturday we had sports and Sunday we went to church so it was I was I was immersed in Christian evangelical culture as a college student going to the University of California at Irvine I was completely blindsided by the secular worldview I hadn't been introduced to it I hadn't been provided with the necessary basis to understand what was happening and it became a big a big challenge for me to integrate who I was and to create a system of beliefs for myself that were authentic rather than ones that I had been given from that that context so when I was in graduate school studying and I went to church in college I went to a little call a little church called Saddleback so right and non-denominational they're Southern Baptist but they don't talk is it okay I didn't hear any of that there certainly were no dances well a lot of people don't know Saddleback is Rick Warren's church it's a mega church in in Southern California very important church in terms of the seeker movement so go on I will say this like I watched the Freddie and Paul show from the beginning I actually went to Saddleback when it just met at El Toro high school so that was it was not it was not what it what it is now I did that because my aunt and uncle lived in El Toro it's now called Lake Forest was called El Toro back then nonetheless I went away from the church and I didn't have a church I belonged to and I didn't go away from my beliefs I didn't go away from Christianity that as I studied things Christianity remained a foundation for me at what Young might call the the shadowy level the low level that that was the reality but I had avoided really wrestling with it and dealing with it and it's something that is difficult to do when you are living in the context that I was going to graduate school studying neuroscience there wasn't a lot of room for spirituality in that and it's one of those things that is such a blind a blind spot for science is the integration of religious and spiritual aspects of people and so I knew personally that that was something that was real to me that was always an important thing to me but it wasn't something that was supported by my academic pursuits so how should Christians view Young first of all I would ask how should Christians view Darwin that's one of those things that a lot of people have these ideological presuppositions about them that they've been told about them have you read On Origin of the Species have you read Aeon or have you read the dream seminar that Young talks about have you read answer to Job if you're if you're Christian go read answer to Job by CG Young CJ Young and it'll really challenge you so I found his work to be completely okay with my belief system because I didn't expect him to be the answer I didn't expect him to be the new religion I was seeking I expected and I got from Young a broadened perspective on my own beliefs so you grew up seven days a week going to church I did I did and and so you had I mean I think there are a lot of people who say grew up in a non-denominational evangelical church going to Christian school and then go to secular university a lot of it's it's almost a it's almost a trope that people who then they go to secular university then they give up the faith and but because it's Darwin or Jesus and and many churches I don't know if that was taught to you growing up that wasn't taught explicitly explicitly but there was definitely an implicit training and I think that's the the part that was really important to me was um you can't believe this this isn't real this isn't something that you can consider and when I was challenged to read books at the secular level in my academic training I guess maybe I'm high in openness that that's becoming apparent quite quickly and maybe I'm high in openness but I didn't read them as though they were going to supplant what I believed I read them as a perspective that gains you know my life's too short to to think through these huge existential philosophical things that's why tradition is so important for us is that we can learn from others and we can know what to expect and that we can have an enriched life not trying to figure it out on our own and I was really open to reading those things and when I read through Darwin's On Origin of Species I was blown away because it talks about the glorious design that God had in nature nobody talks about that when they're teaching evolutionary biology but the the foundational text is from a preacher's son and he had that context and and if you know Carl Gustav Jung was also a preacher's son and they had that context through which the lens through which they saw the world and they expounded on it and they developed their belief systems that were separate but I think a lot of Christians sometimes will arbitrarily write off somebody who's a thinker if they've said something that's not in line with doctrine and that dogma keeps you from being exposed to more things and it doesn't mean that your belief system has to change but it does mean that you should probably be exposing yourself to things that make you think critically and that's something that I try to teach in my students on the academic side is that they question what it is that they believe and that there's difference between knowing something and believing something and both are completely okay and so it sounds like instead of you know having you know this either or because of your openness you you integrated and you you figured out I am integrating you are integrating yeah what so so here's a question for you what so Peterson I mean Peterson is closer to my age than your age and so I can very much I can very much identify with his experience in the cold war my upbringing was very different from his he grew up at least a little bit in a main line in a main line church United Church of Canada that left the faith and then now has is in this weird place of acting as if there is a god acting as if Jesus saves us acting as if the resurrection happened all of this stuff what what do you think Peterson is up to what what does what does Jordan Peterson want to accomplish I've been very curious about that because having watched his videos you try to find the theme or what is he getting at what I want from Jordan Peterson I don't think is necessarily accurately what he's looking for you know I want more intellectual thought and and critical thinking and new ideas about how the brain works to promote consciousness and that what's that integration almost going back to a Cartesian analysis but but with the advancements and neuroimaging and neuroscience that we have now I want him to do that and that's not what he's doing and what he is doing is important and you and I had the experience of having gone to Jordan Peterson's talk here in Sacramento and I went I said this in the meetup that I went I actually brought my wife and we sat in the front row it was really an amazing experience and we went and I had said this to her is that this is my breakup with Jordan Peterson I think I have Jordan Peterson-itis I'm ready to I've heard what he said I'm ready to ready to move on and not have him be somebody that I'm listening to and who's influencing the way I think and when I saw him give his talk and I heard him speak in an extemporaneous fashion and his thinking through talking I really relate to I was so appreciative of that but that wasn't what changed the way I thought about him and what he is doing what changes that and the VIP experience the omg vip whatever acronym it is we got to see him interact individually you and I did you and I did you you had a much better seat I was the last like almost the last person in line and and you were one of the first ones by happen circumstance but you got to sit there and listen to him and hear what he said to these individuals and hear how they interacted with him and I didn't get to hear the words which you know I really would have liked to but we're all where we're supposed to be and I got to see him and see his body language and see him interact with hundreds and hundreds of people after he lectured for two hours done another hour of taking questions that are really difficult and and I know how draining that can be as somebody who speaks in front of people for a living you know how that that can be speaking in front of people for a living and and then individually afterwards being present for them I was so struck and impressed by his ability to connect with somebody in a incredibly short period of time you know and as as I my trainings in clinical neuropsychology which has nothing to do with meeting people in therapy and we can talk about that later but I do know about therapy and and that usually has a lot of time that's one of the beauties of it is that there's a lot of time there and he was able to make genuine connections with people and he was present to talk to them and it was just a tour de force of what his mission is and that's individually to connect with people and to help them through their lives it's really a it's really a testament to what he says he wants to do and that I saw that actually happening so I think he's really being at least as far as he can be sort of like his book says at least not lying about what he's doing I think he really is attempting that and and I see that by him extending his tour and continuing to do that now we have talked in the meetup about what his longevity is going to be like in this and I know from my experiences as a lecturer that you can run out of fuel and and unless there's a break I'm on break right now and I'm loving this but um unless you rejuvenate and I don't know how he does but unless you continue to maintain a consistent level that's something that I worry about is is he going to be able to continue to do this because it's a it's a yeoman's task yeah yeah I'm blown away by his um his endurance and I you know I had exactly the same that was that that was the biggest takeaway of the evening for me was watching him connect with individuals because I know I know what that requires of a person and that blew me away that blew me away we got we even heard from people in our meetup who said they were sitting in the very back of the auditorium yeah and they felt that he was as present with them as I felt sitting in the front row seeing him eye to eye yeah um yeah they felt that too and that's a testament to somebody who's really given themselves to being present for people yeah yeah yeah now have you watched many of his biblical series uh that's my favorite stuff okay why what do you what do you think of his biblical series well I I've talked with you before I have some big problems with what he says about the Bible such as uh a lot of things um I don't want to dwell on those negative parts because I think what the benefit is is thinking about how he's engaging people to consider these scriptures that are so profound in changing humanity in changing individuals and communities and countries and the world more transformative way than has ever happened he appreciates that and is giving it credit and to me that's something I don't want to put the negative my personal subjective negative aspects of what I think he's saying I don't think he's saying well I'm not even sure I have a position to say but I don't think he's saying heretical things that can't be beneficial for instruction of people who have given their their belief systems 100 faith to Christianity and who abide by the tenets of the church I don't think it's bad for people I think it's something again where there's a profound group of people who are have unmet needs and that would be served if they and you know this is a pastor seeing people who are so spiritually need driven and he's providing a gateway to them um to really consider what these stories myths realities mean for their life and I find that to be just a tremendous boon to a lot of people I actually use a lot of biblical language when I explain analogies because that's the culture I grew up in those are the stories I read and I studied I was preached to about and I considered and I how I thought about the world so actually in my teaching sometimes biblical stories come up and that's really something that also is true in western culture our storytelling has been shifted by biblical narratives and so his focus on it and his unabashed connection to the bible is really a breath of fresh air from an academician you know I always feel like I'm going to be singled out as some sort of a wacko who's teaching neuroscience and then uses an analogy from uh Cain and Abel to talk about children and development and birth order and and yet here he does talking and biblical lectures that are sold out and people really do want to hear about it and sometimes I don't I don't know whether or not that's his charisma or the way he speaks or whether or not that's the stories I think it's probably synergistically both it's it's the right time the right place the right stories and the right person doing the speaking okay do you find that your students at the college that you teach at when you use biblical references do many of them do many of them understand that these come from the bible or know anything about the bible well I have to read the room and um see if they're if they're nodding if they're paying attention and most of the time they are some are unfamiliar with the stories but that'll just take a little bit of explanation and that's one of those things where you know I also teach I didn't say but I teach human sexuality and so a lot of what we talk about when we talk about traditional cultures and cross-cultural sexuality and we discuss where our sexual mori's come from biblical stories are some of the best references from historical anthropological investigation as to how did people engage one another from the standpoint of courtship marrying we discussed that and and a lot of people find that the bible to be helpful source for them to understand the historical perspectives on how people have engaged one another so so so this guy who grew up as an evangelical who went to Saddleback church is teaching human sexuality at a public college in Sacramento and they're letting you do this um I could say the same thing about this guy who's sitting here doing Jordan Peterson lectures oh maybe we're traitors to the cause um one of the questions I get often that I feel particularly ill-equipped to address that I really wanted to have you on this to help me with now I am I grew up in the Christian Reformed Church which is its own insular bubble I I don't drink alcohol not because of faith reasons because Dutch CRC people drink like they know how to drink um I don't smoke tobacco even again Dutch CRC people they know they don't have any religious qualms about tobacco and I've even cut out a lot of caffeine from my life but I regularly have people coming to me and asking me about psychedelics because this has been a a big element of the conversation not only Jordan Peterson talks about them a bit but if you listen to Joe Rogan uh Michael Michael here you know Michael Pollan who's famous for the omnivores developed um Dilemma is now you know written a very big book on psychedelics there's a huge openness in society and I know nothing about this and you've got a PhD in neuropsychology and you've talked about this at the meetup a little bit I just wanted to get your take I don't know how much of this conversation you've heard but people look to me for wisdom on this and I don't have much to offer so what's your take on this so I have personally never taken any psychedelics and that's the traditional kind so from the perspective I'm speaking about if we're gonna discuss it it's not on an experiential side it's on the side of understanding what's going on in the brain and how brain chemistry affects how people feel that's the least interesting aspect of psychedelics whatsoever really of course because the brain science that we're talking about here is are we affecting uh different neurotransmitter systems and when I say those things oftentimes my students will just shut off their eyes glaze over their eyes glaze over and no frame of reference for any of that language and do we so what I like to do is to try and bring it back to things that we do know about things that we understand and given the epidemic of depression in our culture and the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association's stance on this the prime treatment for depression is to take a pill that alters your serotonin what are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors right now this is acting on the same system that's something like psilocybin or ayahuasca are going to be changing in your brain all right so the basics of it is you have a brain the brain is consistent of a lot of cells called neurons but even more called glia but the ones we always focus on are our neurons and those communicate to each other you have some other cells that kind of do communication like in your endocrine system that's why psychoneuro endocrinology is now a huge huge field of study but neurons are really special they're different they're unique in that they last your lifetime when you're born you have all the neurons you'll ever have well really you don't you you grow some but it's almost inconsequential because they're only in areas of our brain for developing new memories and and smelling new things and from the day you're born you'll have less neurons but the ones that stay become really important because of something that they do and that's that they interact with each other they talk to each other and how they talk to each other is inside they do chemical and electrical communication but between each other they can only communicate chemically now this is where when we're taking a drug that's going to alter that you have to understand what's the the essence by which it could change the communication if you sent a letter to somebody overseas and i intercepted it midway and wrote something different on it what would the effect be of that if you said hey come visit us at christmas and i said don't come visit us at christmas the reaction would be different from the next cell and simplistically put the cells can give each other this is extremely simplified and and i do that just because a my understanding of it is simple even though i've been studying it for a long time and i think about it a lot it's difficult to do this because i'm i'm actually doing it with my own neocortex the cell can tell the next cell hey get excited or get less excited so that's sort of what we have is this big classification of drugs which would be central nervous system depressants and those those would be things that like alcohol that's something that acts on the GABA and again GABA i could even use the bigger word gamma immunobutyric acid who cares about that what it does is it's the primary neurotransmitter that tells your brain calm down send less signals and you have all these neurons for your whole life since you were born that have been communicating to each other now if you alter them with something like say alcohol then it's going to turn on a system specifically in the frontal lobes which are the areas of your brain that help you focus attention help you move are part of your personality and also the most important thing you know this from alcohol is that they inhibit you from doing things that you wouldn't normally do and so when we when we're drinking alcohol you don't i do is that you're inhibiting your inhibiting system so you're becoming disinhibited and that would be a central nervous system depressant an excitatory central nervous system response comes from other drugs that work on different systems like say cocaine works on the dopamine system and so that tells the cells get excited send more more neural activity across channel what's called the synapse to the next cell so what what also happens is that when we're taking hallucinogens or those are psychedelic drugs those are drugs that are aimed at altering the normal flow of information to our brain so we've got our our senses out here and all of our senses are limited in fact one of the poets william blake i think i think blake said if the doors of perception were cleansed we would see the world as it is infinite and i use that in my teaching because not not the sort of hey go you know on a timothy leary trip with with you know lsd and um and do something fun but it's to understand how your senses actually perceive the world and that's that there's a limited range by which they see the world and this is very easy for people to access because you know your dog can smell things that you can't smell and you find that because they get into it and eat it and roll in it and then and then you smell it but our brain has limitations and that limitation there's a a small part of our brain that's not the big neocortex side where we we spend all of our time thinking but it's it's called the thalamus and other than smell um it acts as a valve system for sensory input and so sensory input goes through the thalamus and this is a grouping of cells that then sort of limit what the rest of the brain gets and as it does so it keeps us um in in a boundary or in a range of sensory perception when somebody goes and takes um ecstasy ecstasy also known as molly or um mdma or methyl deoxymethamphetamine if you're a psychopharmacologist um what it does is it uses the serotonin system that's a neurotransmitter and it sort of takes the breaks off and it allows for sensory perception to go out to the neocortex with with less involvement of the filter the thalamus um and what that does is that people feel um a lot of times they express feelings of um a lot of times they express feelings of euphoria or or sensory perception and enhancement if that's what they call it um and so that's people who are doing that are altering their brain in a way to make it uh like you could hijack your car if your car had sort of a a governor on it and you took the governor off you could push the engine faster and so that's kind of what it is like to hijack your thalamus with the use of something like um mdma or with the use of psilocybin you know those magic mushrooms ayahuasca dmt um so again i could i could talk about this for a long time but what's interesting to your listeners and and what have people told you that they want to know about psychedelics and how it affects people well so you've got sam harris over here that says you know oh he doesn't want to be labeled too much of a materialist this is oh i'm really into consciousness and you know so we i take these psychedelics and i have these wild experiences of consciousness but those are just stuck in my brain so you got sam harris over here trying to be cool with the other kids and not just be a square naturalist and then you have more of the spiritualist new age experimental community that says you know when i take ayahuasca or psilocybin or you know one of these drugs i get in tune with a much bigger reality than my limited senses can take so i've got these two sides coming at me and i listen to them and i think you two are playing with the same drugs but thinking whole lots of different things about it so i couldn't agree more it sounds so much more like questions the the hallucinogens the um the psychedelics aren't even the issue here it seems like um they're almost a a tool for those people to explore their thoughts they're already having and a lot of people will say oh no it awakens me to new thoughts um i have a problem with that and and i don't think that it's necessarily awakening them to thoughts that they couldn't have um but that i i could talk out of both sides of my mouth because there has been shown uh the use of um psychedelics in clinical applications that some people have reported being able to become more empathetic when they because of whatever experiences they had their brain sort of tracked a way of behaving that this enabled them to incorporate a new style of emotional uh regulation that would enable them to sort of become more empathetic if they've say been shut off emotionally from some trauma in their past i don't i don't know i i know that when we think about our perception we think that it is in a totality that we're actually perceiving the world as it is and it really isn't um jordis peterson's famous for talking about lobsters and their hierarchies but you know lobsters can see ultraviolet they can see ultraviolet you you can't you can't see ultraviolet things uh we know ultraviolet things exist we know that there's a wavelength of photons that's in an ultraviolet spectrum we can't visually perceive it our our our eyes don't have um the bandwidth to to perceive that but we use it all the time for babies who um have a particular build up in their system with bilirubin their liver can't function to break it down yet you shine some light on them and in that full spectrum of light there's ultraviolet light it does the work and what's funny is is that when they they first invented these uh machines to use ultraviolet lights to to help babies who had an lights to to help babies who had an excess of bilirubin um they would turn the light on and and again it's an ultraviolet wavelength so you you can't see it and and you know parents you're a parent yourself i'm a parent and and what happens is this baby who's maybe colicky or frustrated and not feeling good is still squirming around and they turn the light on it and the parents expect something and they don't perceive anything and so they got really mad the manufacturers doctors so so what do the doctors do some some medical engineer uh decides okay well why don't we just put in a black light in it you can perceive the the violet portion of the visible spectrum of light it's not going to do anything to help the bilirubin it's not going to break down the bilirubin but then people will think that it is and now there are no complaints when you put a baby under this light except for that they have to wear these little goggles now so so what people think they perceive is not the totality of what is and coming to grips with that is a existential crisis is the answer to that to trick your brain chemically into doing something that it doesn't do i would argue that if you don't have the context to do that in that you're really grasping for straws that you should try those things that your brain naturally does you should try everything else first you should try things that are going to give you ecclesiastical experiences that we know breathing practices imagery religiosity you should try reading intellectualize and you should try all these other things to engage what your mind can do and perceive in a healthy and in a stable way because you haven't exhausted those answers you really haven't you haven't done the work that it is to sort of find who you are in this world where is your place and what does that mean for you and how how you should go about doing things and the other question i have for people that are talking about this like say the sam harris side which is he's denying the the spiritual element of people and saying that it's it's all happening here i'll say to him that part of my training was in a neuropsychology was at the hospitals and what i was involved with was called intraoperative speech mapping and in an intraoperative speech mapping the patient lays on the side their cranium is opened by the neurosurgeon actually the residence neuro surgeon never does the opening but um because the patient's under then the anesthesiologist wakes them back up and i come in and i do some cognitive testing with them as the neurosurgeon is sort of searching for what does this tissue do because we want to avoid taking out tissue that's important for that person to function if we're taking out the bad stuff great idea i had existential crisis when i would be talking to somebody like i'm speaking to you except for your your face might be draped with some sort of um field to keep it away from the surgical field and on the other side of that curtain i can see your gray matter i can see the folds of your gyri and i can see him touching it with an electrode and then suspending your ability to sort of name a picture or remember something and there's an element of is that all that we are and sam harris would say yep we're just complex robots uh and what you can really find out what the complexity is of this robot if you take this you know magic mushroom um and i would i would really venture to guess that what he's actually physically experiencing in that moment is a connection to something that's that didn't take me magic mushrooms but took me looking at someone's neocortex and then looking into their eyes the window to their soul and seeing that person seeing that what you describe and not you i'm sure you're the pastor of the intellectual dark web but i don't think you invented the idea of the imago dei no i certainly did not but that's your language that you used to talk about that personhood that holiness that worthy that dignity that's the thing that we do see and we support in our society and we've even codified it in our language of our constitution that people are made in that image and that's not all that we are as these complex neural circuitry that i've been describing how we can alter the uh the sort of petri dish up there that's not um that's not the limit to what we are when people take psychedelics a lot of times people take psychedelics and they they experience bad trips um and i think young would say would say that what they're engaging is the part of their subconscious that's the shadowy side or the side that we want to avoid right that's part of us but that we don't want to incorporate into thinking about who we are jordan peterson talks about you know that you have the capability that you wouldn't have been the person in europe to save the jewish people from the um horrible nazi uh prison camps but you would have been that person who turned a blind eye and he uses the language of the gulag archipelago to talk about that's what most people did they were all informing on each other and that's part of you and so when people experience bad trips you know that's part of them a lot of the literature on it will say oh you you got to take it in the right context well i'm not sure what the right context is and and if you're going to experiment with psychedelics i would suggest that you experiment with things that can take you transformatively to a place that you haven't been before that you would do things that are going to push you to the physical limits to intellectual limits to emotional limits that would also create for you a sense of newness and creativity and insight um before you go messing with drugs and the reason i say that is one of my trips i was uh not one of my trips that's a freudian slip you could call them that but one of my uh internships i was at the children's hospital oakland and one of the patients i saw was a young girl who took a whole bunch of ecstasy we didn't call it molly back then we called it ecstasy um and she took way too much and it literally um there's one time she took it one time she took way too much but the effect that it had is that it over read a system in her brain and and when neurons get too excited if in fact when when you get hypoxic or you don't have enough oxygen they don't slow down they actually speed up into like you redline your engine until it breaks and that's what happened in her in her brain with some of the serotonergic system is that it burned little tiny holes little infarcts little little lacunar um holes in her brain and this poor young 17 year old girl with her life in front of her with with everything out there um was now apathetic such that she didn't have any real ability to control herself if you said you know go go bang your head against the wall she would she wouldn't think not to she was now sort of not an efficacious agent in this world and and i saw that negativity you know and also i i learned about reading some of the bad lsd trips that people had i think it's laceric acid um there's lsd lsa there's a whole bunch of them but some of the bad acid trips that people took had some pretty severe consequences to them including when they took too much they could have really profound paralysis and and we we learned about that when we were studying the brain and and uh dopaminergic and serotonergic systems well that's that's really helpful but what's interesting to me too is that so you know we're getting a picture of you in this little video and so we have james this is this is the face this is this is the uh the hidden behind the face of who i really am right so we've got some dmt you'd see you'd see the real me well so we've got james who grew up in church james who still goes to church as an adult um james not who still goes to church remember who then decided as an adult to go back okay who went back to church now we're talking about okay the brain and its function and you're talking about this this uh formative experience that you had of doing this job of of looking into the gray matter and looking at the face because obviously when we look at the gray matter we don't see the person exactly you can line up gray matters and say oh they were born in detroit and their mother was withholding and their their father was generous and you know and they went to school here you can't see any of that stuff looking at the brain but they're you know they're probing the brain my my one of my kids at home is now newly into house he didn't watch it back was on tv and he's kind of going through house and you know they sometimes do these brain probe things and people will taste something or they'll smell something so on and so forth so when i was a missionary i was one of the one of the women in one of the communities i worked with came to me one day and said oh missionary missionary i had a dream about you last night patients were very big into their dreams and and i said yeah what did you dream she said you were you were surrounded by flowers and fruit and i said well you know what does that mean dream interpretation which of course young is very big on and she said well this this this means you're going to have a lot of children and this was interesting to me because my wife and i had one child and you know we didn't think we're all that fertile and so we were sloppy in terms of birth control and i kind of laughed at her you know kind of sarah's laugh and you know now i went on to have five children which which is a lot in north america and and you know biblical dreams in the bible are very important joseph has these dreams that are prophetic and daniel has these dreams that are prophetic so so knowing you know what you've said about experiences and psychedelics and and you having studied young i mean how do you piece this stuff together is is the bible just who we on that and we just record the dreams that come true and is it a selection bias or does god work this way what do you think well nothing i say in statistics or in biological psychology or in human sexuality gets people so mad as to when i talk to them about the the difference between sort of the biological aspect of dreaming and the sort of more metaphysical spiritual side that we tend to think we tend to think they have meaning we tend to maybe record those ones that have meaning to us and the one that i had about mopping the floor when there's all those squirrels around i don't i don't i don't have any interpretation for that so it doesn't necessarily sort of integrate into who i am a lot of people have the experience of dreaming and then look for meaning to it but from the perspective that that i teach and this makes people very upset is that you don't actually dream when you're asleep okay now sounds funny right and i like to say those things because that gets people to think and that gets people to consider what you're saying so if we have these two states right one would be consciousness the other would be unconscious well which one are you when you're asleep unconscious exactly so tell me other things that happen to you while you're unconscious uh i don't know because i'm not conscious right so then why do you think that you would perceive dreams that happen when you're unconscious oh that's interesting especially when we consider death the big sleep so you know here's a problem is that we do have this experience of dreaming um not everybody but i think everybody but we remember them or experience them in different ways right but you're actually dreaming when you're awake you're actually dreaming when you're awake dreaming what you have the experience of dreaming is is awakeness and remembering this sort of imagery you're having this imagery or this woman was having imagery of you and not you but her projection of you is what young would say and and all these flowers is sort of symbolic flowers around now if i had say had an eeg that's a an electroencephalogram i have all these electrodes that are recording her brain's neural circuitry and i had some way of going back and say putting those electrodes on your brain and reversing the electro they only record they don't they don't send anything in but if i had the ability to sort of send in that neural circuitry to you would you dream the same thing absolutely not so there's two different brains you're two different brains but your neural circuitry is doing a whole bunch of activity when you're asleep when you're unconscious um so from the biological side you don't have access to the conscious perception of what that neural circuitry would be like when you're awake there's all sorts of people who have problems when they're sleeping people that you know there's a man who murdered his wife there's uh people who have driven cars people who have um you know cooked when they're asleep boiled water there's all sorts of anecdotal evidence of what people have done they don't remember that at all that's not a conscious perception so are you saying when they're so my grandfather was a big sleepwalker are you saying so when he was so so one of the one of the big stories we had in my family was my grandfather used to grab my grandmother's arm and pull her arm in the middle of the night and he was having a dream that he was rescuing her for something my grandmother had very little tolerance for this and finally one day woke him up and said if you ever do this again i am divorcing you and he never did it again but she spoke she spoke to his subconscious yeah so but you know so so you're saying he's conscious or unconscious when he's dreaming and then acting on it because that kind of confuses my definitions of conscious and unconscious no you're unconscious when you're asleep we can watch that we can watch your sleep uh neural architecture so your your neurons they have what's called a spontaneous firing rate and they fire at a certain rate just randomly um when you go to sleep they slow down and that's the general sort of simplistic way of saying it and we can watch the sleep architecture and it takes a certain pattern where they'll get slower slower slower and then they'll kind of speed up and then they get really fast almost like awake but not really awake that's called rem or rapid eye movement okay what's going on in the brain is that your lower part of your brain during that fast acting time it's not fast acting like we're having right now which is awake and conscious sort of activity but it's really fast compared to the other levels of sleep but at that time your brain sends a signal to to the rest of your body to relax uh to you know to to relax so if you ever see somebody in rapid eye movement the only thing that you see moving is their eye and the reason is that the signal comes from below their third cranial nerve or their ocular motor nerve and so their eyes move all around and do crazy stuff but that's the only part of them that's moving while their brain's having this very fast activity they're completely unaware of what's going on however if you wake them up when you see their brain doing that rem sleep right they are more likely to report a dream than if you say wake them up in this almost like suspended animation of what's called slow wave sleep they are very less likely they don't wake up and they're really tired they're really not refreshed they really have a hard time sort of getting um up to a conscious level because you're way down at the bottom of neural activity you got to speed it all up if you're up at this higher level this rem you're probably closer to your awake conscious level activity and so people report dreaming more now this gets people very upset when i tell them that they only dream when they're awake because you're not dreaming when you're asleep you're only having the experience of that dream as sort of interpreting what was going on in your brain with neurocircuitry in that active pattern before some of the interesting neuroscience on that is that when you teach a rat a new maze uh they do t mazes where the rat has to go up and go left or right that's a t maze in neuroscience and they'll record what's happening or how that rat is learning that maze in neurocircuitry and then at night when they watch it sleep it rehearses those patterns when it gets into rem that those patterns start to re-emerge it's and this is something we know from studying people is that if you deprive them of rem sleep they will not be able to retain information that they knew newly learned that day that's why i always tell my students you got to get a good night sleep the night before an exam rather than stay up and waste your your time um cramming for something that you won't be able to to remember right so okay so you're saying well we only dream and we're conscious and i can kind of understand that i'm not upset by this but what is that can god talk to us through our through our dreams well i remember being told that the the message message was another interpretation of the word dream right or angel or some sort of a message from god and so people for all time have thought that dreams were telling them something that dreams are an important element of who you are and how your life should be guided and and i think a lot of the psychedelics in the ritualistic ceremonies that i've understood is that they're used in a context to promote insight they're used in a in a context to give the person a new identity to give them something that they they haven't experienced before and i think that that's probably been done in cultural culturally over a long period of time where people have understood what to expect and that the culture promotes what to expect i think our culture doesn't have that relationship with psychedelics here in america we we have a relationship since they became illegal in the 60s and you know timothy leary lost his job to the the summer of love and and all that sort of experimentation with culture with relationships with men and women with society and government and with our experimentation with who we were by taking psychedelic drugs that didn't a lot of those things stuck a lot of those changes stuck from the the time of the 60s to change till now but a lot of it didn't and one of the things that didn't stick was the use of psychedelic medic medications or drugs as a part of a ritualistic way now i would argue on one hand that we we do need to think about the development of our youth and i see this all the time with my younger students you know the typical college student is an 18 to 24 year old is that they're going through some really profound changes in who they are as a person and that we don't really have standardized ways in which we can help them know what to expect and we don't really have a good developmental cultural ritual by which they could know that they're now gaining a responsibility of an adult gaining the rights and and we don't we don't have that what we do have is a continual process of foreclosure where we're giving younger and younger people more and more adult level responsibility before they're ready and this this is akin to what young said about be aware of unearned wisdom right because what are you going to do with it how are you going to bring that back from the hero's journey into your culture and reincorporate it into a way that that's helpful to everybody how are you going to complete that cycle if you're having these big personal experiences that are not relatable to your culture you need to know your culture and so i would really i would if students ask me should i take psychedelic medications i would say probably not probably you probably shouldn't um but maybe um and i and i don't know everybody's um particular situation i i do know this that variation is is the one true thing we can count on and that people are different so um maybe but probably not and as a statistician as somebody who who tells people to look at the probability outcomes before they decide a decision before they make a um something that's potentially dangerous for you be very careful about it not that it's always bad not that it's somehow like this you know cia and mk ultra you know that you're gonna have mind control or you know the chem trails are controlling us but that just be careful what you're ready for and have you developed yourself and is this something that is necessary is this something that you're just trying to experience that's different um and and i would really question people as to why they would like to take or ingest these substances that are going to alter their neurochemistry in sometimes permanent ways well it's interesting to me when when you frame it that way i think of the fact that perhaps our cultural attitude towards psychedelics exactly reflects our culture because we are looking at we are looking at psychedelics as in a sense sam harris of well this is a we are going to use our mind like a playground yeah whereas in traditional cultures they are saying you know we there's a certain there we're going to respect this area of life as in some ways sacred now i'm using sacred here as a functional term that this is something that we as a society protect give reverence for behave in a way that says this is special and set apart so whereas we as a society say oh acid let me try it i'm bored so we have sort of done that as a society when here in california when we um legalize marijuana although you can't do that if you don't understand hamilton and jefferson in our country anyway uh when we legalize it what we're saying is we think it's okay for people to experiment with this drug we think for it's okay and we're not going to criminalize it which i i do agree with i don't think we should criminalize the use of drugs but we should educate and um marijuana is a mild hallucinogen and so when people are hallucinating on on marijuana what they're doing is they're altering their neurochemistry you actually have uh endogenous um cannabinergic receptors so they're part of your brain that responds to cannabinoids you have them in your brain you you release them when you do big runs when you have an orgasm and and when you smoke marijuana you have an active molecule you're ingesting that's then going to alter that system um whether or not that's a wise thing for people to do we do know this for young and developing brains it's a very bad idea to smoke marijuana it is for young and developing brains um you shouldn't be experimenting with marijuana that message does not get out it doesn't but the scientific literature states it very clearly in fact there's now um growing evidence that experimentation with um marijuana might actually precipitate psychotic breaks or people getting schizophrenia that's a that's a thought disorder and the what's going on is that we have these propensities these genetic propensities towards something but that unless it's enacted upon with some sort of contextual element it won't come to fruition and what they're now finding is that the use of marijuana is now thought to be something that can trip that um that can catalyze the change from somebody who wouldn't become schizophrenic to them actually uh experiencing schizophrenic symptoms so that's one of those things we know they shouldn't do in fact we know and this is something i i do want to talk about more which which is that these illegal drugs um are used far less than the legal drugs the legal drugs that are prescribed and the legal drugs that are prescribed work on the same brain systems the legal drugs that are prescribed to us have the same potential for bad things to happen to us um they're regulated and they're sold by pharmaceutical companies so now there's this um market interest and um it changes the way we interact with them and uh our our medical legal system especially the um suing your doctor from our practice side has has come up with some really bad behaviors that we have now in prescription practices and treating mental illness um we know that teenagers should not be prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors the traditional antidepressants we know that for a fact because what it does is for a small subset of them it makes them more suicidal like it's it's called iatrogenic or doctor induced that the cause of it they would be less suicidal if they hadn't taken the drug the doctor gave them and that's the opposite of what we're trying to do so this um discussion this conversation of how we alter our brain chemistry is a very very long one and a very big one it's not one that i hear i mean now with the increasing i mean if michael pollen if his book continues to get attention as it has been we might have more of that conversation but i well part of my pet peeves is that i don't think i think as a culture we have we are we we do not i i think we have not done well at having broad cultural conversations in a productive way and this is what i think is hopeful about the intellectual dark web or using youtube or the capacity to have long-form conversations and i think peterson is right that via podcasts and youtube more and more people are going to find these conversations conversations accessible and productive and then ideally again we model we model the kinds of behaviors necessary in order to have productive conversations and not sound bite yelling and politicking the kinds of things that we're seeing especially in our political realm right now yeah i um strangely i got to meet michael pollen yeah he wrote the book omnivores dilemma yeah and our college chose that as a one book i used to be a part of the one book committee at our at our school and and provide group where we're all as a college reading a book together yeah and omnivores dilemma was the one we chose because it it went cross curriculum that a lot of people could apply that to to what they were teaching in their college courses and we invited him and he actually came and talked at our college it was really neat to meet him um if you read botany of desire he talks about um growing marijuana and actually taking uh opiates um he's somebody who grew up in the culture where that was a lot more appropriate a lot more sort of mainstream is to to experiment with those and i really don't see that expanding to a broader community in our um in the youth that i see i do see a lot of people using marijuana i do not see a lot of people experimenting with say dmt and psilocybin and that's a small subgroup of people um and so i think there's always been a small subgroup of people who have wanted to do that um and that's probably always going to be around with us maybe it's those group that are really really high in openness um but uh his book on psychedelics i haven't read it yet and the summer's almost over so i would say i'm putting into my reading list but hey if you're listening michael please do the audio version so i can so i think he is i think there is an ear here what you had to say about it um well do you have anything i've pretty much driven this conversation so far do you have anything on your list that that you want to talk to me about or get me to say on camera i'm not going to hijack uh hijack this with my own personal stuff and we can we can have uh conversations at meetups i will say i will say this um what i see you doing is respectable and it's honorable and i appreciate it and i know a lot of people that listen to you are are really encouraged and inspired by what you're doing and i know i am i i told you i ended up um starting to watch more of you than i did of other people and i think your prodigious output is a pretty pretty intense um so get help with it sometimes people like me come on and talk to you so that you're not the one who's having to think out loud the whole time um well i i mean people often comment about that but you know i am and we talked about a little this before in my office i am i do just think out loud and for me it is helpful i have these thoughts and if i don't if i take the extra step of either writing them or recording them of taking just the additional movement of trying to get it down i find that helps develop the thoughts and then i record them so i can myself go back and find them and think about them and you know it's for me this whole experience has simply been a an extended learning process and the fact that others are benefiting from it to me is just is icing on the cake i would probably do this for five subscribers and i would be i would be totally happy with that in fact the the volume of email that i have coming my way is increasing and i'm gratified by this and and that actually feeds this the frustration i have is i you say i'm prodigious i can't keep up with everyone throwing things back at me because i got to process and integrate and but the to me the meetup aspect of it has been just a joy i i don't i was just sharing with a a pastor friend yesterday i i this even though we have women that come to it this has been the most successful men's ministry i've ever done just because most of those who show up at the meetup are men but this to me has been just i i look forward to every time we do it and i always leave gratified and and refreshed from it i uh i play basketball every sunday night it's a ritual that i i have a group of guys i play basketball with and i really enjoy basketball and and when i when i don't get to go because of family obligations or i have to get up early or something i really miss it and i'm finding that i'm experiencing that with a meetup too i will be missing my first one this sunday because i'm headed up to a family reunion so tell all the people at the meetup that i i greeted them and that i appreciate them being there and and and the community that we've created that's even going beyond sort of jordan peterson stuff yeah yeah no that's true so well thank you again and i really appreciate you taking the time i'm glad we could do this and you know i i really appreciate the the conversation about the brain and drugs because this is again this is an area that people come to me with questions and it's like i don't know i'm a pastor well next time next time we'll talk about transubstantiation and uh and being elected that sounds like fun and there's a lot of folks out there that that really want to be sitting out sitting in the chair you're at and being throwing questions um at me on that so maybe i pulled too many punches all right i really appreciate it bye bye bye
