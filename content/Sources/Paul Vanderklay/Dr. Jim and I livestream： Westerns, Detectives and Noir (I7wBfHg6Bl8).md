 thing. Ah, there it is. There it is. There we go. You're alive now. So, welcome everyone. This is um this is Paul and this is Doctor Jim and Doctor Jim has been on the channel quite a few times. Oh, not quite a few. It's several times and Doctor Jim always brings some really interesting stuff to the channel and some new ideas and so then after I've done some of this western stuff and of course he and I talked about westerns and James Bond and he said, oh, I, you know, you, there's some more stuff I'd like to talk to you about. I said, oh, that sounds great to me. So, um let's let's let's have at it. What what what what kind of thing did you propose? First thing I would say is the last time I was on, we talked about High Noon and um you know, I I think I underestimated the audience because you know, I used it as a fairly I used it in a kind of superficial way. I did not get into the details of it. The nuances because I thought, you know, I need something I can present in two or three minutes and you know, one of the one of the viewers, I don't, he may or may not be on right now but a guy named Rob W really called me out on it in the comments. So, it turned into a really interesting exchange between the two of us about that and I really I really enjoyed that and he really did point out the kind of superficial way I was I was talking about that about that film. Although I still would defend that it served the purpose that I that I intended it to but as he points out, these movies are very dense and nuanced with all sorts of um layers and um so, I just would call, I would just call attention to that and and recognize him for for you know, making that an enjoyable experience to talk about. Yeah, I, you know, I, so we were just before a minute, I was I was saying that I'm trying to I'm I'm trying to get up to speed on my cultural literacy with respect to old westerns. So, I've started trying to watch them and and when my wife sees the black and white movie come on TV, she'll usually look at me and say, you're not gonna have me sit through this, are you? And and so, actually, I started thinking about some of these movies. I started watching Stagecoach which is a pre World War II um western and an important movie for John Wayne's career and you know, I I was I was I was thinking about what uh Hannah Long had said in that Plow podcast with respect to people sort of not respecting the genre and not respecting the movies and and I think part of it is that there is sort of a there there are certain cultural liturgies as James K Smith called them in some of those old films that sort of trigger us to imagine that these are very flat um cardboard characters. You sort of have even often very a number of the actors will play the same role in the same movie. It'll be the drunk or the buffoon or the you know, kind of floozy woman who gets sent out of town, you know, and and I think contemporary audiences look at that and just sort of dismiss it even though truth be told, if you watch most of our films today, we have lots of cardboard characters in those films. They're just more out of our world and so we tend to not dismiss them like we dismiss these other people. Yeah, let me talk about that a little bit. This the the gentleman you referred to, I can't remember his name but the the one who was interviewed and and talked about uh the the western hero. He he was referring to this guy, this uh Richard Slatkin and and he uh writes this this history of the western myth in America and he uses the western film as a as a backbone to that and um one of the things that he emphasizes is how much of a uh very ensconced uh genre the western was and we don't really have the experience of having a genre like that. Uh you know, if he he charts this out kind of from like 1920 to 1970, for some periods of time in there, 75 to 80% of all films made were westerns during some of the years like in 1958 or something like that. So this was this was what everyone expected to see and that made it a very kind of the set of a genre expectations that people would have going into watching um a western were very very well established and that allowed for uh something like High Noon and the way that I superficially uh discussed it as um you um one of the points he makes is that there's no there's no single film that actually instantiates the genre completely. So in a certain way and there's some kind of academic conversations about whether we should even use the term genre because of that. That is to say no individual's film actually has all the parts of the genre which is telling you that when someone goes in and makes a film that's within the genre, they're they're creating tensions between the genre expectation and what they're trying to say. And so essentially all the films are going to have that kind of interplay. You either you either embrace the genre and try to emphasize the the your affinity with the genre genre or you try to undermine the expectations of the genre and and that allows for doing all sorts of interesting things in the film that you really wouldn't be able to do if people didn't have that very well established genre expectation. So just as an example your uh well as an example you'll see early films that create a certain expectation about the hero and then that allows for you know Ford in the 50s to put in a character like John Wayne in The Searchers and he's he's kind of using the genre expectation to say something more than what the you know the original expectation about a hero would be. And so that's one thing about the western that I think is is very interesting to to track and once you kind of get that genre expectation down and you watch those early films you can come to modern examples of it that become very I think very much more interesting aesthetically. So there's one of the central themes in in the western is is the Jesse James type character which is really something we haven't talked about before but he's kind of the anti-hero character and the story of Jesse James and how Jesse James the story of his life got turned into a film is very interesting stories a lot of detail to it and we know a whole lot about what happened with Jesse James and how that was then translated by a person who was trying to make money writing about Jesse James and there were lots and lots of films about Jesse James and exactly how things happened with him and then if you turn to the Brad Pitt movie of just a few years ago the assassination of of Jesse James by the coward Robert I can't remember the the the full title there but it's a recent movie it's a very elegiac lament with beautiful music and a slow pace and you'd watch that movie if you didn't know that genre you would perhaps be bored by it but I find it to be a fascinating retelling of that and the only way you really get that is by is by knowing those that whole genre set of genre expectations this this is a little side point from what I was wanting to talk about but I think it is we don't really have a genre anymore and it's in a certain way a part of the contemporary cultural environment that we're not going to sit still for one you know story frame and that creates a different environment for going to for you know for experiencing spectating these these works of art this is really interesting to me I had no idea of the of the dominance of westerns in terms of film overall you know it's funny because right now with all these streaming channels so I got a I got a I got an Amazon streaming stick because I wanted to capture over there tv and blah blah blah so I nerdy stuff setting all this stuff up and then I realized that there's this grip tv which is one of these channels which is just dedicated to westerns now of course you know gun smoke and bonanza there's plenty of westerns from tv that that were on there but lots and lots of movies and of course the fact that there was so many westerns means there was a lot a lot a lot of bad westerns so we're not you know when you say oh I love the western that doesn't mean you right you don't recognize that it's a background of a huge you know thing but but this the structure of these stories because because when you say you know we don't have a genre anymore one of the things that I find right now is in terms of streaming I I look sometimes at the amount of content that there is out there because we have all these streaming networks and they're all trying to they're trying to find their their Yellowstone or their Sopranos or their Game of Thrones that are just going to sort of hook their audience and keep people subscribing to their stream and so what we have are just just this this flood of content being put out there and I obviously don't watch most of it I don't have that much time to watch tv but so much of what I do see is just seems so there there are structures underneath these stories that seem very predictable and repetitive and not terribly artistic so the other thing that changes that whole scene is is the serialization of the stories and and that the expectation previously of course would have been a closed narrative a film that that closes and now we have this expectation of a of a ongoing story and that kind of changes the way you can structure the the whole narrative let me get to the the kind of idea that I was kind of playing with here and that is um how to start this I see the western as um let's see these films that I'm going to talk about as a kind of arena in the sense that you talked talked about arenas and um one of the kind of prominent things about the western is that there is no moral ambiguity and I think that's pretty consistent across the genre that it is not a question of how you identify or how do you know who is the good guy and who's the bad guy um high noon is a perfect example of this there's no question about you know who's the bad guy what's going on everybody knows that all the different characters know this about that world so what I want to point out there is that this is not a world in which epistemology is a question this is not a world in which epistemology is the problem this is a world in which morality is the problem but really actually I would want to frame it as agency it's it's it's a world in which you know what what's going on so knowing is not the problem it's acting it's being able to act on the situation and um so the action is then symbolized by strength or let's let's put it in the frame of the western by violence and so the way the the narratives play themselves out is that the dilemma for the characters is is how can you act can we you know can you act as an individual and what is the right way to act to to confront essentially this moral circumstance that is evident to you and of course the kind of philosoph or the kind of ontologic base of it or let's put it another way the the hope the hope in the story has to be in the end that there's going to be some way in which strength lines up with the good rather than strength lining up with with the evil and then of course you're going to play around with that throughout the the history of the genre but the point I want to emphasize there is that epistemological doubt is not really a part of the part of the narrative and keep going and then I'll in a second I'll turn to the detective story which I think is the counterpoint to that right and and I think it will you know kind of illustrate the kind of the the kind of difference the contrast between those two worlds and I think you know you you laying that out right there nicely I think is super helpful because so much of current concern tends to be epistemology right in our world where I was going yeah yeah in our world so when I often I often will point to um Smith's Christian Smith's book soul searching where in the 90s he did this he did this massive survey sitting sat down and talked to high school kids about religion and morality and what he found was that for them um morality was self-evident the moral system was in that sense flat um what for them was the question was epistemology and and so perhaps you know part of the reason that we have this knee-jerk dismissive attitude towards some of these some of these films that you described is we are mostly looking for we're mostly looking for conversations with respect to epistemology and morality I don't know it's just off the top well this is exactly the point that I was going to get at and let me just compare contrast this now with the uh with the detective story and the classic one I don't know if I used this with you before maybe I'm repeating myself who knows um is Colombo and the the reason I use that and I'm going to modify it a little bit in a minute but the reason I use that is Colombo knows who the bad guy is and uh it's just self-evident to him but nobody else does and so then the drama plays itself out as a epistemological challenge and the challenge is he he faces two problems he needs to prove that so he needs to have some sort of rational empirical construct that that proves that the bad guy is the bad guy that murder is the murderer and then he also turns out needs to display that to the community there has to be a reveal of that at some point and there's interesting kind of elements of this that I that always love because the reveal will often be you know kind of a set of a bunch of characters in a room and there's Colombo outlining what happened and it's a it's a kind of a scientistic demonstration of how this all fits together and how compelling the rational uh proof of the guilt of the murderer is and of course you always have this this kind of impotent cop standing in the back right and everybody's impotent until the reveal and then of course the cop can just walk up slap on the cuffs so so action is constrained action that the environment is such that that action is constrained by this this net this need to overcome that that epistemic challenge and I think that that in a way we live in a world that has gone through let's say an age you talk about it as modernism as an age of epistemologic anxiety if you look at um Descartes um and his method of radical doubt you know that doesn't really make sense that whole argument doesn't make sense unless you are uncertain about essentially everything so the reason that landed the reason people saw Descartes as having such power in the ideas was that they were living in a world where all the authority for um for speaking truth had been diffused and lost that was already the case before he did what he did or else his his analysis wouldn't have landed so you know you see that that as as the kind of inauguration if you will the act the making explicit if you will of that epistemic anxiety and and you know I think you certainly see that as being exaggerated in the in the form of Hume and I think that in a way we live in that the tail end of that world of epistemic anxiety and we need these these demonstrations to you know to kind of solidify our commitments and I think that's not yeah I don't think that's totalizing you know I think to say it and make to say think it's categorical or or totalizing is not correct but I think it's it's there and I think it's expressed in a kind of pop art way in the in that kind of detective story drama yeah I recently watched the first season of so HBO Max streaming has done a thing on on Perry Mason now I was too young to to watch the tv serials Perry Mason they were sort of a generation before me and I remember that Perry Mason was a lawyer and in this in this so there might be a few spoilers here folks full warning in the in the age in the new HBO remix of this it's interesting because basically the first season is his transition into law the first first he's a private investigator and and then he sort of becomes a lawyer when the lawyer dies and there's nobody else to sort of defend the woman who needs who needs who needs justice in this case but but I was you know part of what I was thinking about because I was thinking about these western things and I was watching this and of course this the Perry Mason is set in the in Los Angeles between the two world wars during Prohibition you've got people flying down to Mexico Los Angeles you know the movie industry is starting to get going Los Angeles has a sense that it's it's sort of a debauched place but the the the questions you know I think your transition between a world of of you know no epistemic question and in that then very clearly in that context you see yes it is it is a world of not knowing I also just finished HBO Max also has CB Strike which is a detective series written by J.K. Rowling's which I just finished which was which was really it was quite good you had a you had a you had a Afghan war vet who had lost a limb who is it sort of got into it sort of gets into noir like Perry Mason it's dark it's urban it's you know the question is finding finding the killer this as opposed to there's another there's another thing out right now I think it's on Netflix Poker Face which is a a comedian who is doing now she's got the the the trick in that little drama is she's got this mysterious ability to detect lies in people she won't exactly know what's going on but she can tell when people are lying there's a mobster out after her and and that is actually set in the west it starts in Vegas and she goes out from there and it's daytime more than sort of the darkness of these others but I think your your your distinction there is is I think really good and helpful in terms of watching us watch some of these things well and watching us in the way that we behave or the way we think about well let's just say Christian faith as an example what does it take to have solid Christian faith well if we live in an age of epistemic anxiety well then you're going to have the the demand that it's you know that it's rational that we're able to you know we can't act we can't believe we can't we're impotent if you will we don't we can't act unless we can do that rational reconstruction unless we can deploy that and and it can be credible in community that's the that's the display to the community it has to be credible in a community before we can before we can act I think that's kind of the I think we I think we still have a hangover of that kind of epistemic anxiety and I think it structures a lot of of the way we act I mean I I don't I don't know how this will land but to some degree the the construct that for vacay has of the four Ps of knowing is kind of an example of this because you know I guess the precipitate the participatory knowing I don't know which one would you put riding a bike is is what procedural procedural you know we have a word for that it's called skill and we don't need to stuff it back into the epistemic box in order to talk about it and the fact that we feel comfortable doing that kind of means that we're living in that with that emphasis if you will that emphasis you know just having you know I don't know how that lands really but it does seem to me that we we do feel that separation we feel the need for that kind of that kind of rational connection between our participation in the world because we we doubt that connection essentially well so in the the video that I released this morning which was on the conversation between Paul Kingsnorth and Tom Holland which I really liked yeah and and I thought what was so interesting about that conversation was on one level I think people would say oh you here you've got these two modern writers and Kingsnorth winds up in orthodoxy via a Romanian monastery in Ireland and Tom Holland sort of continues to sort of stay on the fence Kingsnorth had had always simply acted in an he had an intuitive sense of an enchanted world and in some ways he was looking for sort of the right container the right arena by which he could live in this enchanted world given all of the environmental catastrophism that he had been reacting to between them and then of course Tom Holland you know poor poor Marcus gets pushed to the side and Tom Holland's like I'm an interrogation here he was a good interviewer by keeping his mouth shut that was exactly what he should have done that's right that's right and it's like get out of here I got questions to ask this guy and and so I mean but then I think you I think you said it very well Holland then gets to this point where okay but is it when and of course when he says is it true right there's a certain assumption that Tom has in terms of well this is how we do truth and you know if you listen to hours of the rest is history you can they're they're often often to questions of well this is just the Atlantis thing that he's doing you know well Plato made this up as a construct and yada yada yada another spoiler alert sorry folks I think Plato's been out long enough that we can spoil a few things so but but I could very much I could very much see that in terms of of many people who they're looking to that they they are they are dissatisfied with the world that they are inhabiting and their their quest for a spiritual home they're looking for faith their questions about church the questions our community are all a part of this and yet you know sort of trapped in this in this epistemic anxiety and that then keeps them in some ways from acting right and even if even if what you mean by acting is committing or right accepting or you know I think this is one way to talk about I get I get um pretty I go I go a long ways with these ideas but I think it's one way to look at the whole what what we might call postmodern or what I like to refer back to the the trifecta of Marx Nietzsche and Freud kind of creates the circumstance of the detective story and what I mean by that is it creates an arena or an environment in which you have a two-level theory the world is structured as a two-level theory the the phenomenal world the way you experience the world is something you can't you can't trust that you are that it's authentic the way you see it is real this is this is the the circumstance of the patient when Freud is sitting talking to him or it's the circumstance for Marx of you know history those guys thought that they were you know doing the French Revolution to to you know I don't free themselves but in reality there was material facts on the ground or the Protestant Reformation really wasn't about the ideas of Luther it was really about the acquisition of the property and that really is what drove it and they were just riding along they didn't they didn't know what they were really doing or they didn't know what you know they had no conscience their phenomenal experience wasn't what was really going on there's this deeper level of what's really going on and of course that creates the need for another individual in this the interpreter you've got to have Marx now who's standing outside or in the in the detective story it's Colombo but or Freud to tell you what's really happening to you and you know it's I think it's the it's the development of the of the modern contemporary expert the contemporary interpreter of the world that you know has has kind of played itself out in the in the form of of the you know modern academia that is you know one of the reasons I think that postmodernism really in the academic world took hold was that it created a cottage industry it created a role it created an authoritative position from which you look at whatever phenomenon you want to pick out and you then are in the position of the the interpreter the the truths the the seer of the truth and you know and that kind of I think is a is a big part of the way our kind of worldviews are are constructed I think it's kind of fading and then you've been talking about this a lot there's there's a lot of it that's fraying at the edges but that is that's kind of one of the one of the ideas that well in covid I mean I mean we both occupy um we both we both occupy industries that have come on hard times the the churchman the preacher the clergyman the interpreter the biblical exegete I mean cast then in that light is the one who can give I mean there's certain there's sort of a an implicit gnosticism here um you can't read the bible yourself you need the preacher to read it and um you don't really know what's going on in your body you need to go to the doctor and the doctor will tell you and of course uh via covid the uh reputation of the medical industry has um you know has its stock you know risen or fallen because of covid um it's you know it's it's part of where we're at and and then the question okay I mean even even the um you know the whole the entire environmental the the climate debate you know trust the experts believe the science etc etc and people saying well wait a minute um aren't we to judge by your track records shouldn't Florida have been underwater already by estimates from the 1980s um you know this is this is this is your shtick in terms of prediction and validation so if you don't measure up to your yardstick what where does that leave me and of course we have a vast proliferation now via the internet of opinion providers or or experts at just about I mean we've basically had combinatorial explosiveness with respect to experts yes which which sort of fractures the whole thing there's an inflation of experts we have yes diminishing diminishing value of each expert as they as they enumerate as they uh uh as the number expands and and the pastor you know people before they come to the path they don't come to the pastor asking the pastor what should I think about same-sex marriage they come to the pastor to announce exactly what they've already determined is true about same-sex marriage as based on you know whatever they've seen on the internet or streaming tv or or ever and they come to the pastor and say I'm a I'm a consumer looking for a church that's going to validate my positions on all of these subjects and I'm sure the same thing happens um in your profession where they come into you and well pastor I've got google or doctor I've got google and I've read all of these things and you know and and and the uh you know the drugs are being they're being advertised on television and so they come in and what about this drug no yeah yeah yeah I think it's uh I think it's a it's a new dilemma and it's a it's also a new uh uncertainty it's really hard to predict where that's gonna go you know how people are gonna evolve in their in their understanding of things and their confidence in things I think this in some ways leads into this question of authenticity because you know perhaps authenticity is a I'm not gonna trust you because you have something on your wall that says you have a medical degree from such and such a school um authenticity is sort of I think in some ways broadening the the research do I like you as a person you know are you personable now whether you're personable at least in the frame of expert says nothing about whether you can give a good diagnosis with respect to someone's heart and so you know in that in the something I talked about a while ago with respect to the Daily Show and and Stewart now suddenly this personal affable comedian is you I feel via this internet thing that I have a personal relationship with Paul Banderclay I love the length of his beard or the changingness of his beard I love the tone of his voice so therefore I'm going to trust him on matters of religion we sort of expand beyond sort of the narrow frame of the personal and I think and again I think one of the changes so a bunch of people in the comments are talking about you know more contemporary westerns you know not seeing the comments oh really yeah oh I gotta click on them there we go yeah yeah um got it which ones have been mentioned there well you know a lot of Clint Eastwood yeah restaurants including you know unforgiven where I think in this age of authenticity movie makers have in this commercial environment have obviously learned how to adjust to make even um even bad guys likable and and I think that word relatable relatable has everything to do with authenticity because we have to expand we have to expand the range of potential connections to this person in order for this person to give the light let's say what we're looking for from the movie beneath the surface which is you know we wish to be enlightened in a sense yeah and I think the other element of that that plays um that makes things difficult let's say in in talking about authenticity is the is the individual is the degree to which the individual is is given the task of self-actualization and I'm sure you can you can see this in in the pastor's role you're you're you're really you're going to well I don't know if you're going to struggle or not but what you'd hope for would be a community where the definition of what a person was in that community was was instantiated by the community as a whole but I can see particularly in a protestant environment where you're you're really trying to convince each individual to to assent to the doctrine or assent to the to the um and so you're really trying to we're stuck in a in a very individuated culture and it leaves everyone on their own to play the role of that you know kind of that detective to take their instinct to their intuition turn you know rationalize it bring it to a community convince that community that it's that it's authentic that's a that's a great burden on an individual to do that and it can play itself out on the left with you know I I'm actualizing my own assessment of what what's going on but it can it can also be in a religious context you know sola scriptura I'm there facing the the Bible and I have to pull out of it what it really means you know as an individual and um you know I don't I don't know if that's overly uh stated but I think it's part of what we struggle with. Oh I think it is even I I think it's difficult for us to fail to appreciate the the way in which um that the the structures around us that afford a fairly low consequence freedom in our world for example I think about my my great grandfather who at the age of 18 was put on a ship by his father you know go you know leave Rotterdam come into Ellis Island run that gauntlet get to western Michigan uh set up shop figure out the legal system you know so which I and your mother and a couple of your siblings can now come over and join you in Spring Lake Michigan I think about would I have sent any of my 18 year olds on such a thing yeah and and I think I think I think part of the reason in the American imagination the western has been such a compelling arena is that we we have this virtual desire to um to to ask ourselves you know what what challenge am I up again because the kinds of challenges I face in my life seem you know absolutely pedestrian and you know we might even say meaningless and and the the western you know now suddenly there's there's danger around every turn and you know you see that in even you know to what degree does Star Wars a lot of people saw Star Wars and said well that that's really western right um and and to what and to what degree do so many of our stories invite us to sort of vicariously enter the show I remember Jordan Peterson he'd go to a you know the movie's too scary why'd you take your son there his son's a little scared in the movie so well keep your eye on the hero and um watch watch the hero and and part of that is vicariously identify with the hero which of course in our context has led to well we can't just have heroes look like um you know look like Clint Eastwood or John Wayne we have to have you know female heroes who are um who are bad asses and killers and we need to you know and then on and on throughout the the rest of it so I think your your point about self-actualization is um is really important especially with a sense of anxiety that well I've never really been tested by anything because all of my tests are you know can I really make it through med school you know can you know and and the kinds of challenges you have in terms of getting good degrees at college well those are very different challenges than let's say the challenges that you might face if you are if you're a soldier yeah you you were right about the chat the chat got me distracted don't look at the chat I am don't look at the chat I am I am those of you who have questions in the chat question usually in cap I am starving it's all good and we will get back to your questions and I'll run through there's a bunch of friends in there I don't I've never talked to but friends that I know of you know Grimm's in there and stuff so yeah so it makes me want to look but yeah you know I don't know where to go with that is like I have a quick comment on the noir and what that's about but also you were mentioning this this this coming across the Atlantic and the birth of the nation kind of view and I think that you can see also something that in the western that kind of is a reflection of our distinction from Europe you know we we we came across to get away from both the kind of cultural accretions of the European culture in all of its forms you know the religious structures the monarchical structures the you know the political structures the economic structures and we were able to kind of just move away from it move west away from it and the same true temporally we were able to disconnect from the history we were able to say well yeah that all that religious infighting as that was back that was across there that wasn't really what what we were doing it's not us it doesn't define us and the western is kind of structured that way the western film is structured that way it's moving from into the frontier it's moving into a historical place it's moving into the kind of primordial wilderness with both the valence of the positive which is you know our natural state with all sorts of glories in it but also it's untainted in that sense but it's also wild and vicious and uncontrolled and dangerous and then the thing we leave behind the east which is often visualized in the in the western the east that you're moving away from is also got its positive valence and its negative valence you know the negative valence is corruption man's inhumanity to man you know all the characters and a lot of the westerns have that from the cultural you know the the railroadman and all of that but it also has its positive valence it has you know structure structure of relationships it has man and wife and child it has stability of culture and the western really is a is a kind of liminal narrative about going out there and and confronting all those problems and kind of re-establishing the the new culture but that's always going to be bringing in the past even though you were kind of moving away from it and i think america really in that part of the narrative america really did do that it moved we moved we disconnected ourselves from that the burden of that history and europe wasn't able to do that they they weren't able to do that i think that changes the you know the you know european consciousness is different than the than american consciousness even up to this day in that in that way i think well it's also interesting that a lot of but by virtue of the time frame of the western it's usually post civil war and then pre second world war so even the i mean the most you know the most successful current westerns would have to be in the yellowstone series you had 1883 which was you've got a lot of you've got a lot of people leaving the the corrupt the east and and it's also interesting that especially you know more contemporary westerns like the yellowstone family of of shows you will you know for a whole variety of reasons give the native americans much more backstory whereas in many westerns it's just indians they're they're flat in that sense they're part of the backstory whereas the world that people had left and i think this this gets into the questions of detective and noir because in most of those genres you're wrestling with other people and there's a sense in the west that if you're dealing with rattlesnakes and horses and flat indians of course they're the most dangerous coyotes what have you there's a surface level that that and you're not going and you're not going anywhere in the detective you're not going anywhere you're just trying to maintain you're you're in a static world usually an urban world in which everything's set the institutions are out there the cops are out there the institutions are out there and there are individual violations of morality that are going on they're going on under the surface and and what we need to do is reveal them you know explicate them and but we're not going any anywhere we're not changing the world we're not becoming a new a new thing in that in that environment well and and also you know part of you know even in in high noon the the marshal there's this real tension because you do have the sense of out east it's complex it's corrupt it's war-torn but but the goal of the marshal in the west is in some ways to instantiate that that's right yeah the good you know that's a that's a good example that's bride comes from the east the bride always comes from the east and she's a school teacher so she's going to establish education you know she's going to she's going to establish education stagecoach is a is a is a good mix of all this because you've got the banker who's corrupt you've got you know actually i think stagecoach is actually a very subversive or a kind of progressive liberal vision yeah because you've got and that wasn't mentioned by this this person who was talking about it on that podcast because you know you've got things that you know it's we look at it now as old and whatever but but that the the way in which the woman was being treated by the culture she was a she was a fallen woman she wasn't she shouldn't have been able to be in you know she wasn't a marriage she wasn't a marriageable woman the the the the the woman in high noon she's pure and white you know wearing a white dress and and and she's she's an example of a marriage eligible woman and in stagecoach you've got a kind of subversion of that and and you got the doctor who's drunk but he's got a good heart and he kind of overcomes that and it's a it's a much more complicated world stagecoach is but it seems it seems you know so when i think about let's say the puritan so the the puritans of course leave the old world i mean it's very similar structure they have to pass over the ocean and and of course the the puritans their goal is to instantiate god city in the east but in in the west in the new world and but of course the you know bring religion to the indians um finally we're we're free from the corruption of the old world and and in some ways you see this this this question hopping there's a lot of questions in in the comments or a lot of comments in the comments about perhaps the end of the west and the end of the western in the sense that um you know maybe you know in a in a jordan peterson way the um the frontier is gone um there is no more new land now we are simply left to have to deal with um static stagnant corrupt institutions and and the fact that on one hand nature and and sort of these flat indians that are in some of these westerns that they're always going to do what you expect them to do you can you can out think a coyote or a or you know we're we're clearly the epistemic superiors to the animal kingdom but you know part of what is in the detective and the noir is people do have all these layers and we're playing against each other yeah i um so let's see where i'd go with that um i see no country for old men as a kind of you know a kind of eligible kind of a kind of upside down um western with a little bit of a noir twist and i'll throw this in the in there to introduce my idea about the noir but um you know you have the this the hero who's really the the killer that is to say he's the guy who's acting on principle he's the guy who's who's um you know he actually i i there there's a one of the one of the great westerns i think that has all the kind of key elements that i want to emphasize is shane i don't know if you know that one but yeah i watched it yeah shane is a really good movie and in the end so my wife agreed yeah there you go in the end the hero is the is the good bad man or the bad good man and he is alan lad and he ends up getting wounded in the last shootout was i think it was palance was the guy but anyway um and he's rides off into the sunset leaves behind the nuclear family to to live a wonderful life but he will he goes off wounded and i think the cohen brothers you know put that into no country for old men because if you remember the very last scene there was going to be cosmic justice at the end with that car crash uh but of course he gets out of the car and he's kind of limping down the street just like alan lad is walking off into the sunset and i i think the cohen brothers do that kind of thing i think that was intentional and it was really a very cynical statement about you know and and also a cynical statement about the the end of that is because it's completely inverted and and and lost um and then they made this other movie which is a kind of hodgepodge of western themed events uh someone in the in the uh chat will tell me or remind me the name of this film but uh they just take you should watch it after you watch stage coach it's it's got all of the western themes and then they just um kind of what's the right word they kind of take the worst message from them oh was it ballad yeah yeah i saw that he said and they just they just in your face you know when the i mean they just in your face turn all those things upside down and then make it very painful the way the way each of those little scenarios and one of them is just directly from stagecoach the the guy who's trying to protect if you remember the guy who's trying to protect the girl and he gives her the gun because she's going to need to kill herself before she gets taken by the indians that's that's that's taken right out of stagecoach if you remember there's a there's a scene like that in stagecoach and uh and so that's what you'll get in a in a uh what's the word decadence this is decadence uh taking that genre and kind of using it in a kind of rococo way of overdoing exaggerating and flipping over everything that's that's part of the original uh the original genre noir you know are about that so the way i see noir is that it's a that it's a world of in which the dominant um energy is the energy of passion so they so these are the this is like a detective environment an urban environment and what happens to take double indemnity as an example is this is this temptation there there's there's a temptation a sexual temptation a romantic temptation or a financial temptation and the hero just really really doesn't have the ability to resist that temptation and that ends up creating the you know the downfall of the whole uh experience so it's it's kind of in a way the you know the the we talked about the the um detective story there's kind of an agency that you have with your rationality you're going to achieve um you're going to achieve something with that the western you've got the you know morality play here you're you're lost with you don't have the ability at least the hero doesn't have the ability to to you know um to to have confidence that they can translate what they have as ideas about the world or what the what their understanding of things is into effective action it's just going to be uh an expression uh a kind of a kind of uh inability to control the relationship between the natural action that comes from a passion and the outcome of that and that that's the that's the you know kind of fear-ridden uh environment of the noir is that you really are going to be you can't there's control is lost because of that and this is obviously has biblical connections to paul says i do not what i want to do you know and and you know part of perhaps part of what we're dealing with is the the piling up of these of these genres because you know and again if you if you look at some of these westerns the the heroes look flat they um i'm not as i'm not as convinced no no but i think that's the stereotype that they look like oh that's the stereotype right and of course in these dramas they have to make choices they do have to make choices but you're right it's it's not that the choice is good or evil do i right you look at so the man who shot you know the man who shot liberty balance the john wane character he and um oh why can't i think it's a wonderful life jimmy uh jimmy stewart and he and jimmy stewart they they're they're they're rivals for the love interest and it's clear that john wane got there first but he's going to lose um passion is structured by um by a culture that's true in uh in uh shane as well yes yes oh yeah because i remember watching that movie and it's like boy there's a lot of yeah there's innuendo she looks out the window and it's like you know it's that kind of stuff is so is so fun to see because it's it's kind of it's kind of an attempt to not be on the surface but it really is really on the surface you know it's kind of fun it is kind of fun and it's there's a there's in some ways a again there's in some ways a a delightful innocent honesty to it it's like yeah she's ogling this guy yeah and her husband's right here and her husband's just bringing him right in and it's like dude is this real what you want to do do you really want to have this guy live on the farm when your wife just can't take her eyes off him yeah and that that whole dynamic of the the sexual attractiveness of the rugged you know not quite morally upright gun slinger uh that that that would be the object of desire is you know is kind of part of the is part of the whole genre well well what do you want to do do you have some more things you want to do or shall we switch to questions um we we can do that i would say josey wales came up here a few times that's definitely one of my favorite uh westerns um and i would under i would i would comment on the the the podcast you talked about who tried to say that clint eastwood was she didn't like clint eastwood i think clint eastwood's a great uh both actor and director he's not all of his movies are good i'm not i wouldn't argue that but he has made some very good movies and he he is um he's the john ford of of of at least that part that that time frame i think is at least one version of that all right so now i am going to if you want me to handle your question you don't have to talk to the audience oh yeah you don't have to leave a super chat um just put question in all caps at the beginning and i'll take some of them that are already in there and then i'll work their way through so grim grids says um dr jim have you seen the deadwood series i've watched part of it i you know i watch tv mostly with my wife and so i have some restrictions there and i couldn't get going in it uh i didn't have enough time to get into it when i could do it without her i do think that i'm going to guess and grim can comment on this but i'm going to guess that it's this version of um late uh decadent uh version of taking that genre and and kind of you know putting all sorts of uh uh you know kind of visual attractiveness intensity violence that's very well um uh simulated and not necessarily concentrating on and grim you can tell me because i haven't watched it so that's so i'm commenting where i don't know but i'm going to guess it loses that element of the of the structured narrative as the dominant thing it's trying to do and uh i worried that that was going to be the case after i watched like three three of the episodes but grim what do you am i wrong he took off oh um he said he had to go so he's gonna have to watch it uh time delay but uh all right for those who like uh for those that so grim has a little thing if you like um if you like westerns join the deadwood dandies and the broken clock tower discord from uh from grim gris so uh clint d asks um dr jim do you connect do you connect western films with western country music well i don't know western country music all that well but i do know that there's a very deep tradition of the music within the westerns and you know and there's a lot of there's a lot of you know of stuff to learn and and and like in that uh as an example high noon the uh i think the background music was uh was tex ridder who was jack ridder's father and um jack was is his name jack the threes company guy oh yeah yeah yeah yeah um and that's it that's just that's another fun thing just like the aesthetics of movie of film the westerns are you know you were talking about these these individual actors will will appear over and over again and that that can seem tedious but it's actually a lot of fun because you can see these characters lives go by and you can also see the way in which it's all interconnected everybody it's a it's a it's a big family kind of thing that is going on there's a there's a perry lodge in canob utah where my wife and i like to like to stay it's a they filmed tons of westerns out there in the desert near canob and perry lodge is where they'd all stay and so all of the rooms oh right right these people and it's an old hotel um it's a it's a lot of fun to stay i gotta say the vibe of things like you know whiskey river who's the who's the artist for whiskey river what's that uh someone will put it in there that recent grammy award-winning song the vibe of that is certainly in certainly a kind of um uh background vibe in in a lot of westerns the the doc holiday character yeah if you know that part of the story the the kind of self-destructive uh kind of pathos filled but in the in his heart stone yeah tombstone yeah yeah i mean you can you can you can lay the threads in the western one would be something like the stagecoach another is jesse james and the third is the okay corral and those three threads you can follow all the way through to to contemporary movies all right was uh was dances with wolves and anti-western i think so i mean i i think of it a little i think of it as yeah yeah i say what i say it is i think it's it's got the you know that one of the original elements that slatkin talks about and i think is really true from the last of the mohawkens is the man who knows indians as as the man who um it doesn't necessarily mean indians only it means the man who knows the wild ways the wild world the world of the cowboy the world of the of the of the bar and the bar brawl and the world of skill with guns and horses but also the man who knows indians and um i think that's a uh a gesture at uh inverting that and and and um recognizing the um the fact that through that history the the fact that through that history of the western it was difficult to grapple with what they had done to indigent people in the genre itself you know how they had used them as stock you know flat characters and there's all sorts of ways in which that finds its way back into the genre with efforts to react to it john ford being an example of that in in searchers and um and maybe we'd take the dances with wolves as the you know kind of full-on version of that of of going native uh and people have made comparisons between that and an avatar as well yeah yeah that would make sense all right brian tan says a big thematic element of the western is the west itself coming to an end the closing of the frontier uh 20th century nostalgia for manifest destiny um frontier thereafter moves to science fiction correct yeah i think that's absolutely right and there because there's nowhere else to go and it's right in the in the uh role of uh of star trek a final frontier and i think that's right i think it's i think it's uh i don't know there's lots of good science fiction i mean science fiction i'm a big fan of ridley scott and alien um which i think is a which is a kind of modern scientific western a science fiction western uh with all of the you know you know so i think that works but it's also i think ultimately can't sustain itself well i guess it does i don't know people have different opinions about the modern cg movies and the and the exploration into space i think that's a sad thing in the end because there's nowhere to go out there it turns out and so i think they bump into that uh with with trying to do that um but but yeah the wild bunch is a great example of the west coming to an end absolutely in fact i was very interested in this woman on that podcast pulling out ride the high country because that's a well that's a okay corral kind of story it's that in that thread if you remember okay corral or um doc holiday and whoever the other guy is i can't remember that they're the the pair of heroes one is the kind of drunk who's who's you know sick usually and he's got morally he's morally questionable but he pulls himself back together in the end when the demand of the moral situation you know pushes him there and ride the high country is of course um sam pecampas early sam pecama wild bunch late sam pecama and the stories are are very parallel except wild bunch is just rod bunch is a great movie uh but but you've got two old cowboys they're they're um kind of kind of riding through the world where it's it you know it's completely it's it's it's a mess and they're not going to be able to uh ultimately achieve anything in the and the the candy cane the cotton candy version and i think still a good movie but the cotton candy version of that is sundance kid in which you've got the heroes you've got them aesthetically attractive as cowboy you know as gun slingers but they've got a tragic uh ending with a no win circumstance obviously the whole story is going towards that and it's a similar story as wild bunch except wild bunch is serious and um and sundance kid is kind of attractive and fun but it's got the same kind of pop it's pop there you go that's the right one pop all right is smoky and the bandit a western well not i don't think that's pop i don't i don't remember that movie well enough i know i saw it a couple times but i don't remember it well enough to know um i don't know how the narrative goes i can't even remember well you know it's interesting because travel movie yeah that's a car it's a car trip movie car trip movie yeah um so and it yeah um have you thought about the connection between the noir getting married with love crafty and cosmic horror modern noir seems to brush up um to existential horror more and more um so noir i mean the classic example of i think what this this comment is referring to is is blade runner um i don't know is that i hope i'm getting that right but blade runner is the noir in in sign in the science fiction futuristic world and i think it i think it uh is self-consciously that and i think it's a great movie um it's got more complexity to it it moves us into the world of ai and and uh um you know androids and all that those ideas i think your observation about the noir that the the arena of noir is is psychological yeah it's it's it's moral psychological in terms of temptation and desire and i think that that nicely sort of brings brings out the category um here's and i've never firefly is a cult favorite out there but i suspect younger than us because i've never watched i i don't know that one either sorry to say so sorry are uh oh no no no youtube for old men here um let's see yeah yeah val kilmer and doc holiday yeah that that's a pretty good modern western it really is yep yep yep i think i think it got poor reviews originally but i think it's a better movie than than it was originally reviewed at least no i i i hadn't seen it and that's the that's the doc holiday thread coming all the way in yeah and and it was actually rick who um rick who who gave me a list of movies that he said i should see and some of my because of course rick is 10 years younger than i am so he's i mean that that's some of this is our age yeah and because the um the technology has moved on you know one of the things when i homeschooled my kids i i told them you know i gave them assignments in cultural literacy which they mostly liked i had them i had them watch certain movies and tv shows and and this and that because i just wanted to give them a sense of the world a little bit before them but i think part of what we're facing in this in our current you know even even just i mean that that blows me away what you said that i mean this percentage of movies that were westerns now obviously this is commercial driven and it really it really gathered but you know we've got i mean a lot of my audience i looked at my i have one i have one video that is very the algorithm is clearly pushing it to people who do not frequent my channel because my channel is 95 men and the majority age is between 25 and 45 what am i doing here paul well i know there's some of us who are who are a little bit older here but yeah but that but this question about um about age and medium is is important just in terms of the aesthetics i'll just say this again because if you want one one of the things i would give you to do is watch a couple of the early jesse james flicks the kind of standard one i can't remember the name of the standard one it's probably just jesse james read the wikipedia page on jesse james and then watch the the um brad pitt version of it casey aflac isn't it yeah that's a it's and and you see how that that is the aesthetic version i i think of usually using a tradition and honoring that tradition by knowing it and and deploying it in what you're doing now you know and so i find that to be it's mostly an aesthetic thing it's not really a you know okay question who's more the discarded forgotten gunslinger for the good the non-ukrainian soldier who we won't discuss or jordan peterson on gunning for non-ordinary genders with still forming ideas on sex well that's a big question i have to get my mind this is something that i was trying to think through before we started and and and where i would put jordan peterson in this array of these you know kind of models that i've constructed that could be the western with agency and trying to line up the good with the powerful versus is he more of a detect is he more of a an interpreter of the world is he more trying to convince us of something or convince himself of something at least in terms of his religious seeking but certainly on twitter he seems to be wanting to play the role of the gunslinger yeah and so i don't i don't know that's i think we well what do you think about that in terms of the biblical series and his own posture towards what he's seeking he's trying to he's trying to make a rational case for something right so that i think is a dominant part of what he's what he's doing i still i still see jordan in some ways as a displaced person i think he still is a university professor and a clinical psychologist but he has been he has been pushed out of his arena and so he is you know he's got this big youtube channel so he's talking to people okay but where do these things go now he's got this new arc project where he's going to gather the people he's been talking to and he's going to bring him into a place in london and and that's going to be an alternative to the world economic you know to me he still seems sort of this i think this place is right but i i do think he you know and i i i really hesitate talking about some figure that i'm taking my assumptions from just the screen so i i put that caveat on it but i think he's he's i think he's got this epistemic anxiety i think there's a sense at which he's disconnected from something that he's seeking to to you know rationally recreate and that would allow him to move to that you know that would be the criteria of moving to some ascent or some commitment and i also i also wonder about the noir in the sense of he's certainly a passionate guy yeah and that passion i think has um has been a difficulty for him it's drawn him to places that that have been difficult for him obviously and this is it's a kind of tragic way in which the noir hero is is living because they have they're drawn with this energy to it to go in a direction now he certainly seems to have come to a better place and that's all very good but but that's certainly part of what's going on with him is letting himself be guided by his passion which is very attractive in a lot of ways and and maybe and maybe a good thing in a lot of ways and heroic in a lot of ways well i i do think he i mean he very much he very much wants to inhabit the heroic i just have you know and will will we see jordan sort of a part of the part of the western is the question most of these figures like john wane or alan lad alan lad doesn't finally in shane arrive at home no most of the heroes are homeless and will oh yeah and liberty valence john wane and liberty valence this says the whole story is sad in that way um yeah that's true that's true but he's got family no he does have family but but but but you're right he's he's standing apart that way right and it's hard to imagine now that he's been exiled from the university and exiled from the therapist's office it's hard to he's an itinerant preacher and unlike let's say a preacher who let's say creates at least a protestant preacher you know creates a church inhabits a church and then is buried in the church cemetery jordan peterson and is an itinerant preacher there's no there's no cathedral from which he um from which he acts and so who was it that said billy graham there uh it's it's a he's he's in the same position except you at least billy graham would have a church in the invisible you know did the protestants have their invisible church at least billy graham inhabits and sort of any in true and and that's right and jordan doesn't have that that's and jordan doesn't have that so i i still i i did i did very much see jordan in light of this western hero who is someone who will you know go off into he's already been mortally wounded once and he's sort of come back for the fresh fight but he he still is i think without a home so i think that's right i think that's right all right i'm totally with you i had to watch all of my walking dead without my wife because that's not her genre so walking dead especially the first two seasons with with rick and shane we can get into police stories too um as sci-fi westerns maybe even dr jim's comment on stagnation on frontier with zombies definitely stagnation definitely a stagnation and i think the zombie is a kind of the extreme version of the um the the asymptote of our individual society and the seek for self self-actualization and and the the the worry that there is nothing in there uh for me to actualize and so you know i'm a walking zombie and um uh i don't um sci-fi western walking dead i the the ver is that is it well it's interesting so i i did watch very closely the number of seasons of the walking dead and of course uh rick is a sheriff he wears a hat he's got a solid arm right right right he's killing zombies so there's definitely has part of that energy and i think the zombie space is much more of a western space in that again zombies are pretty flat yeah oh they're very flat they can't calculate opportunities plan and there are opportunities to commit violence without moral consequence yep yep so so i think it definitely has that but the i mean i think also in some ways the police genre also sort of picks up out of the western because that that then becomes obviously another genre in in i think post frontier movie and story making in america where is walking dead going what's the eschatology of walking dead is there is there one i i think i haven't watched a number of the latest season i mean some of these shows once you get past four or five six seasons breaking bad knew what they were doing in terms of okay we're gonna land the plane after five um so i think that's a good point i think that's but i i think again a lot of these stories are looking for home because what what walking dead wants to so they go to a prison one season and the prison sort of has bars and walls that you can keep the zombie hordes out for a while they're in this little town that they found which was sort of a gated community and the community was able to put up walls um and and so walking dead is always looking for habitable order without zombies where people can settle down and and and of course walking dead is also it's it's like many like many things today it's a movie about trauma and there is that undercurrent in westerns again because the civil war is back there so if you look have you watched 1883 i've watched about five of those yeah okay i'm i'm i'm watching that one okay um yeah that's i that's a whole other western theme is that you know if you watch closely the heroes are often uh graduates of the of the civil war they're civil war vets yep um and that's an interesting thing that's in the background of it i do think that the your comments about the walking dead though raised and the the question of eschatology raises the question of how the series actually changes the way the story and the world is actually structured because you don't have the you know you pick up a book and just by holding the book in your hand you know there's a last page yep but in the series it's like oh who knows the streaming world streaming world it's just like open-ended and in a way uh you know as someone said this um we can imagine the end of the world easier than we can imagine the end of capitalism now this was this was a modern capitalist uh critic but the point there is apocalypse is very easy to imagine in in our world now apocalypse in the in the sense of something like the end of the world with zombies and um and so that's you know the end point uh is this this destroyed diffused uh lack of destination world right uh you know planet of the apes charlton hestern um early apocalyptic but of course zombies and apes are very different um and of course the apes talk and so the apes are sort of these you know you have that you have that tension in the in the 60s and 70s you know i think i think your point though here is with these dystopian visions of the future i i think that expresses the fact that in our let's say in a materialist narrative it tends towards dystopian and it is non-eschatological right there is there is nothing in a sense to really look forward to there is no there is no city four square that descends from above there's no new jerusalem yeah and the great threat is meaninglessness which is what this zombie embodies and what the little towns that are trying to put together are kind of building walls against the you know kind of total lack of of depth and thickness to the person yeah and to the community all right what do you do with western spoofs blazing saddles wrestlers rhapsody um you know i just think it's part of the the ecosystem the big marketplace the big you know kind of landscape of these films i'm sure there's something smart to say about it but um it's fun i i do think that the one of the things that the genre being so ensconced allows for is is these kinds of playfulness it allows for all the different things that you can do as long as at the center you have these expectations that can be played on i mean obviously blazing saddles has is doing this very self-consciously and very explicitly taking all of the and using some of the actors in fact to do it well i think this gets you know a while ago we were talking about the you know the new the new sincerity um i remember eric weinstein asking ross dalfit if jesus was alive today would he just get meaned to death um there's there's something um it's interesting in our in our cultural cycle where you have mockery and you have laughter and you know in the blazing these are these are good-hearted spoofs where we can sort of laugh at some of the genres you know i think about um um why can't i think of the film dan acroy john belushi blues brothers blues brothers which is sort of uh now that's a that's that's more of a travel movie you know that's a but but but there's also a narrative and there there's some certainly a lot of spoof characters to that but um you know some noir in it because uh jake and um elwood have to resist their demons to their mission from god for the penguin um there's the movie's an incredible genre okay regarding previous question about noir lovecraft there is a strain of fan theory that the first season of true detective exists in a lovecraftian world yellow king carcosa this is part of the problem that the the chat is smarter than we are exactly everything that they've watched is far beyond what we i did watch true detective and i thought it was well done but it was very painful but it was well done um and again i think it's got the feel really of of um no country for old men in a way and uh i can't remember how that ended so i'm not going to be able to to comment on that i'm not i'm not an expert on lovecraft and i have seen a lot of people talk there's a lot there's a there's a cult following of lovecraft for sure and i'm i'm not uh up on that as well as i need to be all right could you speak a little bit about whatever happened to baby jane is it better than citizen cain i mean i haven't seen that movie in a long time i would say that citizen cain is a is uh i do like that film um let me see here if i can i i i'm my my list of movies to rewatch is really growing fast in this conversation well i would say that citizen cain is a is a movie i would jump off here because i don't i can't comment on whatever happened to baby jane but i would comment on the citizen cain to third man connection and the third man i think you know third man is a great kind of um mashup of different genres the western being one of them and the noir being another and there's a lot of interest in that there's a lot to talk about in that relative to the end of world war ii the um the you know american um the transition from old europe to america and a very european comment on that which is not very it's not very um positive to the american world that came after world war ii and um i think that was um and there's a lot of connections between citizen cain and and and uh and the third man because uh orson wells is in both so is uh the second guy whose name now escapes me believe it or not but um i don't know how that connects with that comment but um citizen cain's a standout movie that's non-genre you know it's its own thing yep um to what degree should the heroes of westerns be imitated if at all or what lessons ought we to take from them well that's a question i have for you paul actually because you evoked this notion of christianity needing the bad good hero and what i you know talk a little more about that because that's not necessarily a completely attractive comment about christian culture no no i think i think this is so the conversation going on right now about the winsome wars in evangelicalism is tim keller too nice are is is david french making peace with the enemy instead of standing up and fighting them like he should if he were one of us is i think this this haunts um this haunts christian history so constantin you know constantin sort of legalizes christianity doesn't necessarily instantiate it uh some form of christianity is his favored religion they're trying to of course gain god's favor for the flourishing of his dynasty but there's you know you know there's there's the question could could martin luther king jr have stopped racism in nazi germany was gandhi was gandhi's success in india um was gandhi's success in india dependent on the fact that the british raj was deeply christian and so that type of non-violent perhaps sort of anabaptist display of power can that actually work in the world and i think that question when i watch westerns that question is really out there do we need john wane to shoot liberty valent balance the shadows this is a serious this is a serious problematic i wouldn't call it an indictment of the human condition but it's a it's showing you a real problem and it raises something that i you know actually before you started talking about films again paul i have been kind of working through this the struggle i've had with the tom holland thesis his his his confrontation with his kind of internalizing christian christian history and i and i have this um i have this difficult i think i think i have a concern about about the way in which christian history actually plays itself out in um and how it impacted for for just for me it's a central issue for me in terms of the shape of my faith is how to account for how to take seriously the fullness of christian history part of which is what tom holland is is doing what i would call and i don't mean this critically hey geography of of christian uh history um and taking into account that but taking into account the difficulties that are also embedded in the actual way in which christianity christendom manifests itself through history and it's um and its failure in that and how that uh well anyway that would be a whole nother conversation that i would really like to have with you and it's part of a um it's part of a way in which you know a lot of times i come and when i've talked to you before i've i've talked a little bit about who i am and what my faith is but if we talked about the impact of christian history on the way i think about christianity what ultimately would my christian faith i'd put it instead of christianity um what ultimately would happen in that conversation is that you'd you'd learn a lot more about me and the way i i think about things and i want to have that conversation you want to have it on the internet i'm there yeah so we so at some point i really would like to do that and part of the reason i hesitated to call you is that i find it to be a problematic and difficult thing to talk about because it's very um a lot of what i think would sound like an anti-christian polemic in some in some ways but i don't intend it that way i don't mean it that way and it comes up so often for me when i see tom holland's place where he's at i mean he's taken this to a place that i think is good and i agree with what he's saying i agree with what he's saying but it seems selective to me in a way that creates a problem for me and i have to resolve that and there's ways in which i've done that but um anyway i don't know what that how that lands for you but well i'm about to bring someone into the room who has absolutely no problem with anti-christian polemic um and then the people out there probably know exactly who's there waiting for me to let him in the room um is dr evil stroking his cat waiting to have the calvinist minister on this so much this is so much fun i love this but before i let him in those you know those questions are deep and difficult because on one hand what you see let's say in the new testament is the the apostles for the most part marching to their death yet it's um you know it's the roman on one hand it's the romans that crucified jesus on the other it's the same jerusalem guard that rescues paul in the temple and you know if if not for his um if not for his his roman citizenship so this this agent arena relationship with respect to um christian non-violence this this is that so i want to have that conversation with you we'll have to set that up but i'm gonna let i'm gonna let these two into the room um i want to give at jacob you're on the internet a lot i'm gonna give kate because this is the first time i've seen kate here so kate welcome i've seen you in the comments i've oh my god the delight of this is always to finally put some faces and voices with comment names so kate thank you so much for jumping in i assume you want to follow up a little bit on your question um or maybe not hello can you hear me i hear you just fine oh well hello um i'm really unprepared i'm so sorry uh i was just this is my first time have you seen my videos do i look prepared half the time okay well um okay i'll just jump right in then um for brevity's sake um have you uh dr jim uh great conversation by the way this is fascinating thank you i really enjoyed really enjoyable yeah um so the the movie whatever happened for baby jane or to baby jane are you familiar with that i am not as familiar as i need to be so tell me about okay oh well i mean it's got what's her name oh gosh ready davis ready davis and the other the her like yep yeah they were jone crofford jone crofford thank you yeah and i guess they had sort of a contentious relationship dynamic or professional dynamic between the two of them oh i have seen this i remember this movie it's very difficult movie to watch it's a noir yeah um and i guess like a little bit about my background without getting super personal but like i am absolutely fascinated in like sort of the darker dark triad of like human dynamics and um i feel like that movie really articulates it so well and and it really struck me too because i don't remember how old i was when i first saw it but it um i mean it's an old film it's really old it's way before my time and yet it was just so well crafted and just an absolute masterpiece as far as i'm concerned it's my favorite film so that's why i'm bringing it up and i will just how does it fit into any of the did i did i touch on anything say in my discussion noir yeah yeah it's definitely it's a black and white um and then i don't know like in terms of like because noir i think you were like the western dynamic versus um like sort of the detective aspect of noir um i would say it's i don't i don't i don't know the language well enough to like articulate but i would say that it would i think you would really enjoy it and you could probably watch it again dissect the crap out of it i'm sure so anyway all right thank you so much this is oh sure thank you kate thank you i'm honored that it was that it was me that brought you into the circle here yeah i mean i didn't know you're so into this like into films although i shouldn't be surprised at all because um yeah you're into all sorts of things so that's a problem it'd be better if i specialized a little bit but i think you probably you specialize i think but anyway so you're welcome to stay and you know we'll see where the conversations go uh mark is someone i met in ireland so it's it's great fun to see you again hi guys you hear me okay we hear you fine hey mark perfect okay i should let jacob jacob you you wanted you heard anti-christian polemic and we just summoned you or you just want to be part of the conversation jacob no okay i i actually came on because i saw nobody else on and first i wanted to tell all the people who haven't pressed liked yet that jesus is sad that you don't you have not pressed like on this video i don't think you can say that but but jacob is speaking for jesus all right but you did you did remind me of something that i i've been talking a little bit about that i would like dr jim's i thought uh thoughts about i think jesus in the gospels especially how protestants see him is a bit of a mary sue and i think that's why people identify with paul and his letters so much more at least some people than the gospels because jesus is a mary sue to them oh boy but i don't know if you'd get that from the new testament you might get that from your sunday school class yeah i well i have all i've i'll tell you this i have not felt like i could put together a coherent you know kind of genre map of the new testament on whatever genre you might pick out the other thing is you know now you're gonna you're gonna trigger me a little bit jacob there so so i am yes so i am um you know the the crucifixion for me represents you know a heroic act and i see it as um i see it as um i see it as articulated to follow the garden scene with paul with peter pulling out the sword and it you know it's it's i think what tom holland is picking out one of the elements of what tom holland is picking out of the gospels is the is the restructuring of our understanding of of the appropriate application of power in the world and that is to to uh to honor the notion of the dignity of the individual and to act with power or the only legitimate use of power is to act in that way and the and the crucifixion is a is a kind of at least maybe it's more than this of course but at least a symbol of that and in that sense i see it as a heroic act even in its passivity and so i would not use the term what did you call it mary mary sue i wouldn't use that term so i don't see i don't see jesus that way but i i i agree with you in that reading the gospels and i think a lot for a lot of people they read the gospels they in fact do see jesus as someone who struggles as someone who is tempted as someone who is human but that's there's a lot of theology which changes that which i think that's that's what i see as some people kind of seem to be they fall out of love with jesus because he becomes that child of a virgin that is that is going to be resurrected that they kind of get over the crucifixion get over the temptation the temptation that oh jesus wasn't really tempted and i i agree with paul that it's you don't necessarily get it out of the gospels themselves but i think there's a lot of sunday school theology which in fact reduces jesus to a very soon and i would say jacob that an element of the conversation that i would like to have with paul is is maybe coming off of what you're saying there and that is that where theology has gone through history is is problematic it's not just a story of the introduction into history of the individual as having dignity in the way that i just described it's not just that it's it's also a a theology of confession a theology of of exclusion and inclusion and those things are problematic and they reach back very close to the text itself and that's a that's a big comment there but i don't know who wants to jump in on that but um good i interjected that conversation there yeah yeah i'm following the kate's courage here because i was sitting here should do it or should i not do it so i dived in i'm glad you did yeah so it's interesting that um what these guys are saying in terms of uh the sunday school jesus that rings true and i think two of the people that sort of helped me uh dispense with that was jordan peterson and tom holland uh particularly tom holland i would say um and the book dominion because uh that introduced me to the world of the saints uh being from ireland kind of knows of patrick uh but not knowing the story that well until i sort of started reading tom's book and then that led to colin banas and cuffbert and then bonaface all those guys the saints yeah yeah saints yeah yeah you see that's they're they're very far away from a mary suit jesus those guys and they're in a way they're looking to imitate christ so it's back to your story comment earlier so the question who should we imitate these western heroes it's not necessary it's a it's an interesting one we should really be trying to imitate the saints um but then the saints needed king alfred this fight off the gake vikings and then in ireland they needed brahmbaru to fight off the vikings so it's it's that's an interesting thread i i i like that i want to i want to because that's tom holland thing as well talking about cuffbert and the saints and everything well and part of what i i was thinking about when we were talking about these other stories was i've also watched for a while i was watching a bunch of there's there's a bunch of these viking stories that are there and part of what's interesting to me about these viking stories is that these in some way so these norsemen come down and you know they've got they've got woden they've got fry they've got all their fierce violent gods and when you watch these shows you it begins to dawn on you how on earth are the christians going to win but the christians do win and i haven't seen any of these any of these viking shows that it seems to me that the creators can't quite figure out how to have the christians win but the christians have to win because they do and so it's you know it's interesting to me too mark because one of the fun things listening to the rest of history is hearing about america through through english eyes and you know one of the one of my i'm so glad i had a chance to visit ireland because and i was glad that we were able to do some estuary stuff in there too because it gave me at least a little bit more of a sense of the the kinds of transformations going on in ireland from this sort of unified catholic country now to you know who on earth knows what's going to happen in ireland so yeah yeah there's so many things going going around right now yeah yeah what what are the views of westerns from you um did you watch many growing up or comment the rest is history version of discussing the west in the united states was the worst of the rest is history wow so just throw that out there but anyway go ahead mark comment on that yeah so the main reason for coming in was just to mention the movie news of the world with tom hanks and just to pick up on the topic that these guys mentioned about itinerant preachers so it's actually directed by an english man paul greengrass he's got quite a film quite a list of films that he's made but um these guys said that they were ex civil war soldiers so tom hanks is an ex confederate soldier after the civil war but he's taken up news reading and the the director when interviewed about it said that the tom hanks character is actually based on the guys from england the methodists and the dinner preachers so it was interesting to me that in the movie it's secular news that the guy is delivering around to people he's going around sell back and delivering the news and it's bringing hope and bringing sort of cohesion and community to the to the people as he goes around and it's interesting that i guess he couldn't make a movie about him a hollywood movie about a methodist itinerant preacher um but um and it's funny there's a bit of a nod at the end you should watch it it's it's it's worth watching um um uh it does it it has a pretty good ending as well a happy ending um but if you re-watch it in the light that if the guy really wanted to make a film he'd make it with a methodist preacher but he's made it with this uh uh person who's delivering sector news and it's back to your point as well paul about amusing yourself to death i've came across in the movie that the news back then was almost like a form of entertainment as well the way it's presented in the movie there was crowds coming in just to hear this guy read the news out just back to the genre there's there's a thread throughout the western genre of the news person the journalist that's walking around there's always a kind of side character in a lot of the different stories where there's a newspaper guy and yeah and they're writing the stories that are going back to the east and um so i don't know if that's the thread that that picks up but i'll definitely watch that yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's interesting as well there's there's a bit of an archetype where the hero has to look after an orphan so he picks up an orphan um the remake of true grit with uh yeah with your mom bull bridges or jeff bridges and picks them up then logan logan which is the closest thing the marlon movie to a western he picks up an orphan and then then all our data james bond movie as well it's his daughter at the end that he discovers so there's a theme there as well of the the aged hero picking up an orphan and sort of finding meaning through that it's an interesting archetype it occurs more often than you'd think probably yeah yeah the child is often a symbol of weak of weakness and innocence in the western and is sometimes you know in one of the first kind of genre examples dodge city i think and in that uh in that there's a child that the the hero notices is going to be vulnerable and and that's what inspires the moral arc of that character can i can i jump in here yeah go ahead um so i would be remiss if i didn't bring this up so my uh because this is i need to at least attempt to capitalize on this great opportunity that i accidentally stumbled into well let me give you the full screen we'll make the most of it here oh boy okay totally wasn't prepared didn't know i was going to do this today um so my uh my father and my father was completely obsessed with john wane and like uh and his father was a world war two vet and like i think it came from there but like these tough men like the the whole like archetype so i guess what i want to ask this is directed at you uh paul i i think i've heard rumors of you maybe getting together uh to have a zoom or whatever you do whatever this is called with mary herrington yeah it's coming up friday yes i'm very excited for that um because i would be really fascinated if if she would speak and like even if we could get you know dr jim here uh like you guys talking about it as well because like she she's focused very much on sort of the feminist aspect of of like where we're at and where we've been but like there's definitely a dovetail between the masculine and the feminine and i think uh there's a lot to be said for like the john wane archetype and how it affected people like my father um so anyway that's it um your father your father was the son of a world war two vet yeah he was the first born of three boys um actually like i think in your parts are you from whereabouts in new jersey patterson yeah yeah yeah he was from basking ridge so i think that's nearby but i don't really know i'm from actually the west coast but um we grew up there but yeah just these like tough rugged men like but but actually kind of falling short of that like not really actually being that just having this image in their minds and then sort of like the fallout of like trying to live within a myth and yeah the complexity of john wane's career is is very interesting to lay it over the kind of hero worship that attached to him because you know just take searchers as an example i mean searches is a very complex and that's that guy's not a particularly i mean it's he's a complex guy he's he's he's much uh more problematic than a flat character and and that and the way he ended up and i'm not even going to be able to speak to it that well but the way he ended up becoming a a kind of um object of of such veneration for something that's not quite it's kind of a skew to what his actual work ultimately was i think yeah that's all about it yeah because like um i guess like because uh at least with my father and i think this is quite common for his generation um the reverence of their their fathers and the world world war two veterans right and then like how do you kind of like live up to that and and then at the same time you also had the burgeoning of like uh i guess like hollywood like and everything that came out of hollywood and and then that's sort of a regurgitation of some of these stories and so there's a lot of myth building plus like the 60s and everything that came along with like plastics you know all this new technology and then um and like the explosion of rock and roll so like it and then it kind of like that was sort of maybe the beginning of like the splintering off and the atomization and kind of why we're where we're at a little bit but it's been sort of a struggle for me like growing up to try to like make sense of it and it's kind of a little bit overwhelming i think like for people my age because there's just i mean you have to have like multiple phds but anyway blah blah blah yada yada thank you guys for including me of course thank you for jumping in i think there is a lot to the connection between the second world war and what happened with the western in the 50s one of the one of the interesting things about our looking back at war is you know shell shock um i mean there are all kinds of there are all kinds of terms for trauma for soldiers i had an uncle who served in the air force in the pacific and i remember as a kid i was i was fascinated by the second world war i still listen i still actually take in a lot of second world war uh books and things but i so then the children of the people who come back from war with fathers who so my uncle my i once i heard that my uncle served on a bomber in the pacific and thinking back on that now he you know he drove a cement truck when he came back he came back home so you think about the second world war in terms of your you're going out so for america for you know obviously for for europe the war was there for america you know pearl harbor you know you get a little you got a little little bit of shelling from submarines but none of that as much and so for americans you go out on a hero's journey out into the world and i mean it is it is just this meat grinder of course john wane did go on to do war movies and and even the even the war movie industry that i mean so hollywood goes to war and all of this storytelling of the war i think i mean it's it's like they had okay we have to tell war stories but we've got all this western stuff so let's let's convert the western industry to the war industry right and and entertainment with albus yes and it well and the confrontation between this uh this image of the of the hero that i think you're evoking with john wane and the culture being so um both chaotic and to some degree disrespectful of that uh of that that uh telos of that character and the impact of that on you know people trying to live out that post world war two um um image maybe it's the story of the of the 60s and the the um kind of disrespect of the prior generation the other yeah and this is my last but uh mad men uh that's something i've been re-watching um that's another thing that i've been sort of i take comfort in because for some reason it reminds me of uh like my grandparents that i didn't really know very well um but yeah but yeah so anyway that would be like noir correct dr jim i think so yeah uh i think it's down quite well i think but anyway yeah totally noir i think the the main character there is is driven and uh tragic quite um but the betty draper aspect as well i think that's really cool um she's such a complex character because a lot of the women back then were uh you know living lives of quiet desperation uh i remember hearing a story from my dad about in actually in basking ridge i guess uh hopefully no one oh gosh anyway this is like years years ago but uh that apparently it was quite common for the ladies um to um you know have alcoholism because uh they were just bored just totally bored and so like so i guess uh betty draper is a really good uh encapsulation of a lot of that um she's a complex character but so it's in your wheelhouse i think i'm gonna get off now because i've talked too much but thank you kate thank you so much again take care excuse me i know we're not going to get to all the questions but this seemed like a really good question why does my university textbook called gunfighter nation the myth of the frontier by slotkin have no references to christianity the index of 800 pages of material yes slotkin uh you know i he's an interesting guy he uh was a wesley college professor and he had a series of of lectures that used to be on the internet and i watched them and he went from movie to movie it was the way i walked through the western and then they pulled it down so you can no longer watch that which is kind of disappointing but he's also a figure who people might know that the that the postmodern world here derrida foucault those guys that whole intellectual uh thing one of its origins was in literary literary theory in generations before that and uh t.s. elliot actually was a kind of uh kind of a precursor to that in his literary theory but the literary theory developed through the six 50s and 60s and became the way that literature and history were analyzed and i came to understand slotkin as actually kind of one of the early heroes of the postmodern academic world because he applied those concepts in a very practical way and created a quality academic product but he is in that sphere he is he is um he is a secular academic and obviously that comes through with with the comment there but um uh that was his i think that's his kind of position academically all right all right well i'll say i'll sign off with one last comment just in relation to what cate was saying uh in your video today you talked about john wayne being a a created character it's that that wasn't his real name and the person immediately came to mind of that era as well as a creative character persona was marlon monroe and uh and just that seemed to be on like parallel train train tracks you know in terms of cultural influence so you know it's one of the two words that come to mind in relation to them is sex and violence so john wayne was on the the violence track and marlon monroe was on the sex track so what was going on there i don't know that's something to pick up with mary harnson on friday what's what's the legacy of both characters in terms of masculine and femininity but the both obviously had a huge cultural impact did marilyn monroe ever appear on a western the last the last her last film was was kind of a post-western thing um i can't remember the name of it yeah yeah well that actually is a very interesting thing for mary herrington because i don't know her thread of her thought too well but i think she's a kind of reactionary feminist would be the way i'd characterize her calls herself yeah and that would the task there if you were to look back at a guy like john wayne but also marilyn monroe is to somehow rescue a value structure from that you know kind of complex and mostly viewed as a degenerate past if you will to somehow rescue from let's say the story of high noon well better shane but high noon the the honorable ending the honorable ending despite the fact that you've got grace kelly who can't be more than 19 years old and um you know and who was it gregory pecker uh uh you know he's 50 easy 50 yeah yeah yeah but better shane they have a real nuclear family there that you know somehow rescue from the the look back on all this that is critical you know that is very critical from a patriarchal perspective they look back on the western in that in that light and i don't know if she's interested in westerns but somehow rescue the you know positive value structure from that somehow well do you do you mind if i pick up that theme or you want to cover some more questions i'm going to jump here pretty quick but go ahead yeah so that your first video dr jen that you did with uh paul when you talked about high noon loved it along with this one so what immediately came to mind with that and it kind of ties back to john wayne marlon monroe characters finding their salvation in a relationship going off into the sunset and everything being okay um and the the thing that struck me about when you had that conversation is uh and this is a this is a i think i said it was one of the biggest cultural sins ever is hal and leah at the end of eternal the jedi going off into the sunset all happy all good all good and then when it comes to force awakens their families are rack their sons you know a homicidal maniac ends up killing this dad where that that film to me would have been much better if i had a sort of taken off family made the family the the the hero element of it but they just put it they just drove it they used the western pun that drove a horse and car just right through it so yeah well that was part of my point in that prior conversation is that is that the hopeful um narrative we don't we don't have much for that i'm sure someone's going to tell me i'm wrong about this but it doesn't seem to be at least at the center of our our conversations too easy this is what i was talking about before we can easily we can more easily imagine apocalypse than we can anything else yeah and um and that's a that's a real situation we're in yeah yeah yeah yeah guys i'll set off good thanks for the thank you mark yeah good night good night good mark appreciate it and jim so glad you could join us again and all right when you uh when you when you're ready for that other conversation send me an email and we'll set it up all right very good hey thanks again paul i really appreciate it all right take care everybody have a good evening
