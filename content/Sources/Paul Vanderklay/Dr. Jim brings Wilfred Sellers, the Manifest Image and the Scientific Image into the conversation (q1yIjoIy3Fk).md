 Okay, go ahead. Yeah, so let me tell you a story about something that happened after our last conversation. I have a friend who sets up house shows for music and he likes singer-songwriters and there's this interesting website where you can kind of open your house to artists and then ask them to kind of show up at your house and play and then you promise to sell a certain number of tickets and It's really a cool thing and this this guy this guy's name is Clem Slade I think his name is Snides Clem Snide and he's kind of a B Level guy's not like a top level guy But he's a singer-songwriter real soulful from the East Coast that my friend had gone to school in the area where he was He was really popular and this guy happened to be traveling over here And so he has a house show with this guy and he's really really good artist, but I'm setting up to watch I'm kind of in the front row of this little house and my son and I are there waiting to For him to get going and he's kind of warming up and he's kind of looking at me sideways You know, I'm like kind of weird and he says, you know, do I know you and I said, I don't think so You're dr. Jim and I said dr. Jim I knew exactly what he was talking about he had seen me on our conversations and Immediately we were friends and we were talking about how this guy had seen me on your show and it was all the sudden this just Conversation with him. I was like that. I was like his best friend at the show. It's really cool and And so there's there's this weird thing going on out there That's insane. I mean these these videos get a thousand two thousand. Yeah, that's not a lot. Yeah So he's driving what he does is he drives around he has bigger shows in places like Portland and Seattle And bigger places and then between those shows they'll drive around and do these house shows and that was just it was just a lot of fun Wow, wow, that's that, you know whenever something like that happens it Because again, I mean really there's 300 plus million people in the United States. I Mean, that's a lot of people and some people look at my oh you get lots of people but a thousand two thousand views Nothing. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so so anyway, that was some fun. That was fun Keeps keeps rolling on this thing. Yeah, it does it does, you know, and I you know, I Still sometimes I think what am I doing? Why am I doing this? This is a little insane, but it's so much fun And it's it's been so meaningful and it's opened up lots of interesting opportunities and and more Interesting conversations than I ever could have imagined. So yeah, I'm not stopping. Yeah, you're still holding my interest, you know, you know Jordan's kind of drifted in the background a little bit because his troubles hope the best for him there, but You still hold my attention. I'll tell you that well, you know, I think about that a lot because you know Okay so I look at I look at the analytics that come through and it's like you can see you know waves go up and down and I watch myself watch other Youtubers and I'll watch this person pretty intensely for a while and then over here and then over there I mean, that's sort of how we are. It's kind of the order chaos mapped unmapped dynamic So I'm glad I don't do this for a living Yeah, because I assume you really get a sense of how fickle the market or the mob are Yeah Just dropping off all of a sudden Somebody and then they've banked a lot on it and it just turns out not to be the fat of the next phase and There they go. Yeah, and I think about that with respect to Jordan So, yeah, he hasn't put out he hasn't put out product because he's you know, obviously got what much more important stuff to take care of But you know, so Jordan was this, you know huge thing for a moment Then the question is, you know, will this last but then the other question is will there be another you know when he comes back How will he be? What will he talk about? You know, he certainly struck a nerve I mean the man and moment met each other at a time and and and really, you know broke open a lot of other cool Stuff. So yeah, I mean we can we can only be grateful. Yep, definitely definitely So I kind of got fascinated again by you when you took a turn a few weeks ago with the group B group a oh Yeah, some thing you did you're kind of a wanderer, you know Went off in two or three different directions between then and now but but that's a thing that's close to my kind of I don't know my my world because of because of what I do as a physician and and It kind of made me think I'd be interested in having a conversation with you about that about that topic So that's that's how I got this going. Well, I think there is something to the fact that both of us work with people yes, and both of us well, especially you as a physician because in so many ways physicians demystify and disenchant our bodies which is You know you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you these things and it's like Is that true? Is that me because the me I experiences this again this sort of this sort of Non decaying Autobiography that goes through time that is the center of my story. That's me and then there's this body that's aging and losing hair You know my sister died. So now I have a cardiologist Because you know, my sister my father both died of heart attack So now I don't have any heart trouble, but I have a cardiologist now And so I said go ahead bit disconcerting to live in that world Although I would say and that's kind of the area that I'm interested in kind of exploring a bit Because in a way for me I live within it so much that I kind of get to a sense a place where You know, I don't really have that cognitive dissonance between What I'm doing With the patient the patient as a whole person the patient has Autonomy the patient is a full-fledged agent they have They they violate the determinism of the universe on a regular basis They're part of a story within their family. They're part of a story that is their their narrative of their lives And yet I'm thinking about what's happening to them mechanistically and in fully naturalistic and materialistic terms, which is of course exactly what I should be doing and In a way when I'm dealing with patients and engaged one-on-one With the whole activity there isn't cognitive dissonance, you know right at that level And that's I think interesting to note So I you know I had a direction I was going to take this and I can guess I can run with that for a minute and then I'll Let you you think about it So I was gonna I was gonna pull out a kind of example. It's more ordinary than maybe the heightened intensity of my you know kind of work with patients and illustrate some things and kind of move towards a claim that I'm a Card carrying naturalist and materialist but then Move beyond that talk about something some way in which I'm more than that Let's say so so I'm playing soccer with my son and we're kicking the ball back and forth and You know as the balls going through the air I have you know, we take it to be the case that that's happening You know in a fully naturalistic and materialistic way or let me put that in a little bit of different terms The ball is going to travel invariantly in a certain way and And I recognize that I know that to be the case and I use the word invariant rather than using words like deterministic or bound up in causal relations Because I want to emphasize the point that we take it to be that without any of that thought We recognize it as that and we also see the ball and its environment as you know, not having agency or let's use the word inanimate and So that so those two words invariant and inanimate I want to kind of stand in for the direct experience of these more kind of abstracted Things that we take to be the case or that we maybe question sometimes like naturalism or the kind of iron box of causal relations or or the laws of nature or Or the materialistic view which was the second kind of the inert nature of it so I don't have to evoke anything like, you know some atomic theory of matter or or Any you know any of that in order to be in be recognizing that it is that and so and in maybe one more step it's It's unexceptionally that and what I mean by unexceptionally here is that might be illustrated by My reaction to anomalies. So if the balls going back and forth, you know And then one time it hits the grass and boom it goes off into a weird direction I do not say That something from outside that little field of action came in and broke in and made it do that I say there must be a reason for that or I search out the reason for that and I find that there's a sprinkler head There it hit the sprinkler head that I didn't see and that's what is the case. So even in the case of an anomaly You I see my own intuition my own instinct to say that it that it's contained Within this field of what I've told invariant inert and unexception and Again, the reason I say that is that I want to emphasize that we we know it that way or we engage in it that way Before we do some sort of rational reconstruction of that that layers on some other level of thinking about it some abstract level of thinking about it from some theory of science or some and That's kind of a starting point. I have other directions to go from that, but that's kind of a starting point Of course at the same time I'm playing soccer with my son and he is a person and he's got agency and he's gonna kick the ball where he pleases and and I'm you know, I regard him as Someone I'm I recognize he he recognizes me as a full-fledged person. We have relationships of dependency we have histories all those things are there as well and They're there in a kind of uncomplicated way at that At that level of engagement. So that's kind of my starting point. I don't know if you want to throw in some comments Well, yeah, I think that's really it's a really lovely illustration and and we can even pursue Let's see the spirit of geometry into your son because let's say you kick around the ball quite a bit with him Having done this many times on one hand you don't You don't demythologize him as an agent yet over time you learn his habits and his patterns and you learn if the ball Comes this way he likes to approach it this way if there's this movie likes to make this move and and and so you just have This you know You just have these probabilities that you seamlessly work in your head and of course when he gets to the level of professional ball players not only you know, they watch tapes of each other they study each other and They learn let's say basketball they learn that this guy always likes to you know cut to the right and and head down the lane But and so you learn that and you practice that but when the guy does it the defense doesn't even sit There's not time for the defense to sit and say, okay, he's heading down the lane They just respond and so in fact practice is all about Taking all of this all of this rational cognition and somehow Embedding it more deeply in these processes that we aren't fully in control of and off there So this is a I love this illustration. So keep going. Yeah, so, you know, you could you could evoke a Verveki term participatory knowledge here. I mean, we're just we're fully or Heideggerian. We're embedded in the world we're being in the world and that in that sense is not complicated, but And and so I want to say something else like You know this thing we think of as materialism and naturalism You know, it's not a you know the result of you know, some dyspeptic You know dead white men in the in the 16th century kind of wanting to foist upon us some you know, kind of annoying theory to ruin our mood today, you know that that Something happened in the Enlightenment that shifted something and I have a kind of idea about what that is But but at some base level, this is a perennial problem. Not a Not a new problem. This is this is this is obviously gonna go we can say it's a modern dualism Mind body but we could use the word spirit flesh and we're probably saying very much the same thing And we could look at Genesis 2 7 and the Lord formed man out of dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and we're probably talking about something very similar and So so you know in a way there's a dilemma there and I think there is a modernist dilemma there which I kind of want to move towards but this is this is the the baseline Circumstance that has probably been in some sense at the center of our experience in our attempt to work out our experience You know going going a long way back well, I think that's right and I I like I like how you set it up here because it and then So on one hand we're observers of this and we reflect upon this. We don't just observe and participate We're now doing this in the sense of self-transcendence where we're reflecting upon it And then there's also the desire within us. Well, what is that desire? Well, we would like to know this Well, why would we like to know this? Well, because we we have a we have an intuition that knowledge of this affords us power opportunity control security because we also have a a very very real appreciation on our cautionary side that There's a reason we say people don't like surprises now people do and they don't like surprises. They like pleasant surprises They don't like you know and and and with your illustration I did so at the beginning of the of the Australia conference on Jordan Peterson the organizers of the conference set up my conversation and just a brief conversation with James Anderson the former deputy prime minister of of of Australia and Before you know before I went to Australia someone had clued me and said you should watch this video about him and It was an interview that when he when he was a boy he was playing cricket with his father and he hit a ball and The ball that he hit killed one of his siblings I mean just a tragic tragic accident, but but here's you know on one hand we have this Father and son kicking around a soccer ball on a on a on a lovely afternoon in the grass and it's it's all good And we can do self-transcendence and reflect upon all of this stuff at the same time We know that even in a father and son, you know with a bat and a ball hitting it around bang tragedy happens and that tragedy You know for better and worse set someone's life in a different direction So it's not just a ball hitting a sprinkler and deep down we know this Yes, it's it you know and we know that's with car accidents We know this we're just doing something mindless and bang the world changes in an instant and it all seems to be You know balls and gravity on lawns. So There's real stuff at stake with this for us Yes, absolutely and The the notion of My patient as you know as organism my patient as you know complex biochemistry and Electrophysiology, you know, that is something in a certain sense. My patient is bound up in and and Governs to use your word and I'm gonna act within that world You know You know assuming all of that in order to hopefully have a sense You know as a as a culture medicine of understanding what health is and trying to recognize You know suffering as as as a as a consequence of this, you know kind of materialistic Vision and and make decisions but those decisions and are Not only but at least partly and heavily Materialistically based naturalistically based decisions to try to achieve those goals And so yes, I totally grew that I I had studied a guy From the 16th century who's a kind of underappreciated scientist William Harvey and the reason I Studied him was that he was the first guy to correctly describe the circulation of the blood but his interest his interesting place in history is that he was a contemporary of Galileo and So Galileo was the purveyor of the Copernican Revolution. So now we're looking out at the stars and we're seeing how the Aristotelian vision is kind of not gonna hold hold out and Harvey at the same time was really taking that same vision and turning it to the organism of the body He was he was taking this organ the heart which which of course had Carried all this the kind of Aristotelian meaning In that world to our very Our very selves, you know, I mean what was the heart back then but the heart of the matter but the center and in a certain sense the center of the universe because The human being was at the center of the universe, right? and this heart was this kind of source of heat and action and and and animation of our being and he Described it as a pump. He described it as a mechanical object and This you know this at the time Descartes actually reflects back on Harvey as a very big influence To him and I think it's interesting to speculate a little bit as to why we don't Put Harvey in the same kind of place that we put Galileo Because Galileo can be seen heroically The stars can still have wonder in a certain way, but boy you get getting a little personal if you're talking about about the very organism that we that we are and These are these are things to I don't know reflect on and see Yeah, I think that's I think that's that's so Amazing and I you know, so I you know as a pastor as a pastor in a kind of moderate denomination the Christian Reformed Church, you know doesn't go off into Into creation science or any of that and I like that even though there's a lot of people in the Christian Reformed Church that are fairly Literalistic in Genesis and so the CRC is kind of a moderate and all those things and and so and so I always I'm just such an annoying person in many ways because I say things I shouldn't say and I'll ask some people say, you know You want you want, you know, you want someone to have a you know, a biblical a biblical cosmology What do you want someone to have a biblical anatomy? Do you look to a literalism in the Bible to human anatomy? Because the Bible has a variety of side comments about anatomy within it So do you go to a doctor you say I'm looking for I'm looking for a biblical literalist from a doctor and I want you to treat my Bible as The way the Bible describes the body and and that's just such a deeply disturbing You know And so what I find is that a lot of creation scientists and and highly literalistic people act as if they're You know their doctors Their doctors, you know It's just with we're not being fully honest with the world And so I loved this I knew nothing about this man But I think you're exactly right because it's far more disturbing for us as little centers of the universe To imagine that the thing that keeps is keeping us alive is a pump Right, so that's you know that I find that all that fascinating. Um Let's see where and I don't know where to go with it I do I do think it it it frames my worldview and I don't want to say that I you know, kind of don't still I'm not still able to to in my own idiosyncratic faith. I think completely I wouldn't say square but completely embrace Let's say our incarnate Reality while still maintaining my faith. I do think it makes my faith pretty idiosyncratic At least the way I see it. I think I I don't know how ultimate and I mean we could potentially talk about how I square all those circles, but um, I Don't think it's the same as my fellow parishioners. Let's probably not And you know, so pastors pastors are popularizers So, you know what what you tend to try to do is give broad answers that satisfy a Majority of your people at least to the degree that they won't act up or leave the flock or something like this And so pastors have all of their own conflicting Agendas going on with with herds and people and institutions and organizations So I would be you know, because it's funny because I play You know as a pastor of a Congregation with a lot of older people. I So what the way the script goes is that the you know, the person comes back from the doctor and the doctor says Well, you've got these things going on and then of course the people come to the doctor and say well what does that mean and what they're looking for usually some kind of time frame and ability frame and so the doctor and Doctors for the most part do their best say first of all, I don't know but they forget the I don't know part I really try not to forget that I don't know part but the doctors don't forget it the patients Oh, right. Right. Oh, I see you're saying right because I see them on the other end of it I'm not in there with the doctor hearing with the doctor says I hear what the person reports the doctor have saying and so then They will give an answer and I will often Remind I will often say something to the fact of well, um That's true let's but let's let's what I as a pastor will tell you is that your life is in God's hands and He will he will decide the day and and then I will you know, then I will leverage my own story I'll have to say, you know my father My father fainted for some strange reason and then you know was under you know Intensive scrutiny by his his general practitioner his heart doctor. He was on a heart monitor he did all of that and then You know, it was two or three days after they had taken off the heart monitor because everything looks fine Bang he he he drops dead of a heart attack in the middle of having coffee with someone in a pastoral conversation across the table and it's like Well And then the doctor is like, you know, my mother didn't hold any ill will but the poor doctors like, you know, I I We did everything right? We did everything. Yeah, but there we are. We don't we don't control the whole show we don't control the whole show and in fact the Even with as far as our knowledge progresses You know that that just tends to open up, you know, I love the way I was Neil deGrasse Tyson made a point He said, you know the progression of knowledge actually also Magnifies the amount that we don't know because that's that's just simply how progression of knowledge works I would say there isn't a single day almost when I'm taking care of patients seeing lots of different patients where there there are Numerous circumstances in which I don't really get a handle on Exactly how things are and how do I explain that and and It's for a variety of different reasons. It's for you know, it's for limitations of our testing maybe limitations of our theories Just the circumstance of the patient won't allow certain things for me to do to get to that You know, there's a lot of different reasons why they're not allowed to do that To that, you know, there's a lot of different reasons why there might be mystery around what's happening But it's but it's always ever-present that we're not you know, we're not Covering the field. We're not we don't we don't have the landscape completely laid out Often and and yet you and not unlike clergy you you work in a highly liturgical Setting I mean you dress a certain way you speak a certain way there are liturgies You know, I always reflect on this because now I have two doctors not one Yeah, and my two doctors don't always agree. So my one doctor says talk to the other doctor about this It's like I you know, I feel fine, which is exactly what my father said the day before he died so but but we have all of these liturgies and and and So it isn't even just You know, it isn't just you and the patient and the chemistry or the science of of the patient and their health It's you know completely within an entire world And so you are always dealing both with the spirit of geometry Where here's all this hard science and here are our metrics and you know, this is your these are your know We can do this is what we can't do right and and it's also the spirit of finesse where you're looking at You're trying intuitively to see as much of the picture as you can in this tiny window of their life and And weighed in on an aspect of their life, which is life and death pretty important for all of us and in a way that you know It's it's it's it's incredible what we're doing Yeah, and and we all you know, always try to keep the the caring for um the person You know at the forefront of of what you're doing So the goals and the and the intentions and the and the meaning for the patient Is always very much in front of what you're trying to do so so the fact that there's this other kind of uh scientific way of of making decisions does not Shield that or or or make that on a any less important Well, you don't undermine their agency but at the same time I would imagine their agency is Their agency is almost always an enormously complicating and sometimes frustrating fact. I mean I I When I listen to my primary care physician, you know I'd really like you to lose this weight and i'd really like you to eat this way and you know He's got all these you know things that he'd like me to do and i'm not the best patient in the world But i'm not the worst patient in the world and but then I see it from his point of view and I think gosh, I don't know if I'd want his job because Working with people. Oh wow Well, you do it every day i'm sure but it is true, uh, particularly as a cardiologist I see Essentially, probably not exactly but essentially everybody. I mean there's there's pretty much no one who doesn't come my way eventually and um And so you see a very kind of I think a very broad population broad cross-section of the population so you see a lot of different kinds of people with different ideas about what's going on and different ways of handling emotionally and and uh And intellectually and so you have to be There for all of them and try to be the thing they want you to be that's that's kind of a Part of it as well. You used to talk about the liturgy or the or the you know, the way I dress or whatever There's a certain sense of of being um You know being confident for them being being uh having a assurance for them that helps everything Anyway, the oh, sorry, go ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, so, you know this this split vision kind of idea is is kind of the way I was kind of wanting to wander and To illustrate this I was I would bring up a guy named Wilford Sellers now, he's a philosopher from the middle of the 20th century I don't recommend him really as someone to read because he comes from an analytic tradition but he kind of undermined the whole analytic tradition by by that's not attacking but um Undermining the the idea that science could be purely based on empiricism and he did that from within the analytic tradition. So he kind of Stopped in a certain sense. You might think of him as a guy who stopped the analytic dominance of philosophy in the in the american, you know, uh, academia and uh, there's a there's a quote that I would read for him that kind of goes parallel with this and maybe evokes in your In your mind that first couple of sentences of maps of meaning with the field of objects versus arena for action But he wrote a book called the philosophy philosophy and the scientific image of man and i'm getting this from the stanford encyclopedia page philosophy and and the Scientific image of man describes what seller sees as the major problem confronting philosophy today This is the clash in quotes between the manifest image Of man in the world and the scientific image These two images are idealizations of distinct distinct conceptual frameworks in terms of which humans conceive Of the world and their place in it Sellers characterizes the manifest image as quote the framework in which Excuse me the framework in terms of which man come and came to be aware of himself as man in the world But it is more broadly the frame framework in terms of which we ordinarily Observe and explain our world the fundamental objects of the manifest image are persons and things With emphasis on persons which put normativity and reason at the center stage According to the manifest image people think and they do things for reasons And both of these can occur only within a framework of conceptually Excuse me of conceptual thinking in terms of which They can be criticized supported refuted in short evaluated so that's the first Posture that he takes on the manifest image, but then he makes the following claim, which is kind of where I wanted to go here As comparing that to the scientific image, which he doesn't describe more which isn't described explicitly here But it's it's what we were just talking about. So then the quote goes on Sellers claims that the scientific image presents itself as the main problem as a rival image From its point of view the manifest image on which it rests is an inadequate But pragmatically you useful likeness of of reality which of the of a reality which it first finds as um So let me try that again useful likeness of a reality which first finds its adequate in principle likeness In the scientific image, you know, in other words the scientific image has within it a kind of impulse towards totalization An impulse towards being All there is the the whole show if you will and and I think that's in the description that I Gave in terms of this unexceptionalness or this lack of exception And I think that's kind of where I see kind of a problem or the problem arising which is that Um, which is that we have a temptation to move towards Sam harris, let's say we have a temptation to move towards a sense that Things in the manifest image are not quite as real as things in the scientific image or to put that another way The two images entail a kind of ontology. So if we if we see the ball behaving the way it is Coming along with that is the ontology that things are materialized Things are bound up in this We see on the other side the persons and their And their ontology the ontology of that world, which is persons and agency and free will and and all of that But there's a kind of intuition that we have and perhaps an intuition that this might have been inherited through modernism as per as perhaps different from before Which is that we set up a hierarchy of being There's a hierarchy of being rather than rather than a kind of easy Coincidence of things as I described in in playing soccer with kevin There when we reflect on it when we step back What we do is we start to see things like well gosh, you know free will doesn't seem to be consistent with The scientific image and that means that I have to put the scientific image at some level of more Substantial ontology and now i'm demoting the manifest image and i'm seeing it as somehow less real And i'm starting to wonder about terms like emergence to explain it and now and ultimately I Arrive at sam harris where the self is an illusion And I see that word illusion when he does I don't know if you know that Spiel that he has where he he says something like, you know, the We know the biochemistry of the brain and we can see on the mri that this stuff is happening and that stuff is happening And we can see in the anatomy that that stuff is there and that means That the self is an illusion And that's that same move and illusion in that sentence functions as the deflationary term it it it it It relegates Our our direct experience of the world to us Our direct experience of the world to a lesser status in terms of ontology you cannot have an ontology That excludes things from existence non-existence is not A reality. It's just another category of existence and and therefore it's an it's just a way of kind of with superlatives and with emphasis Um Describing something as having less claim on reality rather than I don't know if you followed all that but oh, absolutely. I think I think the modernist turn in a way Has this temptation to set that hierarchy that up that way and we inherit that and then we struggle with it because of that rather than rather than being able to embrace the you know the alternative I that's excellent. That's excellent and you'll have to send me the send me the link to that quote because people will People who very much want to read that because I let's try to do that while we're talking here. Okay, that's that's tremendously helpful because The the irony of course is that As I think peterson notes and many others We We act as if the manifest image Is the truer image because we can't do anything else I mean and so that then sets up this conflict where and this morning This morning I was watching so rationality rules. I don't know if you've seen know who he is. He's a guy out there so rationality rules just Google served up upper left hand corner first video in my feed a rationality rules video with this credit girl from From sweden or norway from scandinavia and jordan peterson. I thought yeah, I know why google's doing that So I was working on i'm working on a video about the movie of the joker, which I saw last night Which is I saw as well. Did you? Oh That movie is a masterpiece anyway, um, yeah so So rationality rules is is doing his thing and of course rationality rules in some ways Epitomizes or at least aspires to epitomize the scientific image. That's that's his whole schtick and But what's happening now in that video is about climate change of which I am not a skeptic but that video and a number of other videos are demonstrating that Climate change is the near perfect challenge to modernity Right, i've heard this argument for you because it's it's a conflict and with the with the With the the things that you just put on the table here because it's near perfect conflict between the manifest image for which Can't see climate And the scientific image so you have all the scientists saying This is going to kill us the manifest image shows no danger And so, you know all the rationalist people are saying well, we should rationally address it this way Oh, but to do that will uh quite likely First of all, we probably can't do it because most of the carbon emissions are actually going to come from china india Africa and the developing world and so your real question is well just how much violence are you willing to threaten them with? in order to put them under a A neo-colonial totalitarian regime that has everything to do with carbon when almost no one in that world Is thinking in the scientific image that even hardly anyone in the first world Which is the most educated the most you know colonized thinks in and so you can't you can't win this political battle in The developed world, you know, it's basically we're looking at this thing saying hey, you know what we're screwed we have and Not to mention the fact that you don't know what to do. That's right. That's right Even even within the scientific image. That's right. And so, you know what I I was looking at i'm thinking well Yeah, well, this is this is the end of rationalism in many ways because either way this thing goes rationalism loses and and but But there we are and I I really love what you just read now because I think that very Very clearly Lines up the relationships and shows the kinds of conflicts that are that are just playing out again and again beneath all the turbulence that we're seeing Yeah, and I think the it's one place where I can kind of feel like we have uh kind of a reserve of agency is is this is this sense of Of setting up our our ontological A hierarchy because we you know, we don't have to You know, we don't have to think of ourselves as you know Insubstantial we can we can We do in fact think of persons as holes even if parts of them no longer Partake, you know someone breaks their leg or god forbid has a stroke and I hope we're all thinking But that person is still the same person and this deserving of all of the of the compassion and or rights and or all the things that we attribute to to them as uh as full persons including our our our love for them and our belief in them as as you know as Fully substantial in just the same way before they lost one of their parts so, you know that That's a that's a normative Um demand that plays only in that arena of our Our ontologic choices or our choices about what we take to be existent and important and um, so I you know So that's where the manifest image is You know, we ought to not get tempted and I use the word tempted tempted on purpose not get tempted to to Dismiss that so well, yeah well and So not you know, how do we how how do we manage both image because obviously at this point? um uh we're We're not giving up the scientific image. No, I mean we're you mean because our our lives depend on it and many many aspects Here in you know here in northern, California now California now Last year we had the paradise fire which was likely caused by sparking power lines in the in the north winds that we get every year and so Oh, well big, you know big electric Not a lot of people have a lot of love for PG&E for whole hosts of reasons And so the state of California was going to hold PG&E accountable for all the loss in those fires And they weren't going to let PG&E slip out of it if they went bankrupt And so this year PG is just turning off power and in many areas of northern, California where the winds are high and Well, this is a very astute scientific move to make but now um in terms of the manifest image people get up in the morning and the power is out and they worry about their milk in the in the fridge and people have medical equipment in their homes and People have to go to work and they discover that the gas station is closed because the gas pumps don't work without power and and and and and and and so No, this is a this is a wonderful way of of of setting up the dilemmas That that we face because we we're not about to discard the scientific image. We can't but we Right exactly then the question is how do you know? I don't know that there's any answer to these things, of course, but but um but uh it does seem like we've we've moved to a place where the the these these priorities have been inherited by people and it and it foists a burden on on a lot of a lot of people that I think the let's go back to John Breveke the the psychotechnologies that we have available are not quite up to You know navigating and we don't and maybe they never were you know, that's that's part of the deal. Maybe we don't You know, maybe maybe we struggle to be communities That can that can make decisions Uh as communities with the kind of priorities that I don't know. I don't know. I hate to use the word should That that we should um Maybe we never were able to do that. But but uh, but it certainly seems like uh, I don't know we should You know, well we should and and you know your your image too as again as a pastor one of the one of the increasingly common and yet Trying dynamics that you see in families is our memory issues and memory loss of of parents and loved ones and You know, it's when it comes to you know, as we're seeing now in the golden age of brain science These issues when it comes to the brain They they get accentuated because in many ways I can you know, it's it's a little bit easier for me to Differentiate myself From let's say my ticker my little pump in here Because oh well, maybe you can because pump well, maybe put another pump in if if all it has to do is pump the blood but when it comes to This thing that's generating the autobiography and and now suddenly I can't remember or there's a stroke and And I see this fairly often then there's a change in personality After the stroke along with the change in capability Uh, then people are looking at you know, well i've i've lost my i've lost my husband And my my husband is still there, but i've lost my husband and I mean, yeah, these are huge issues. Yeah, I think we uh, it's kind of dovetails into another direction I had thought of going into which was to to critique jordan peterson's half of the Uh, you know field of objects versus arena for action and I I think arena for action is probably wrong and uh, and the reason that arena for action is wrong is that it's no really in a certain sense It's no different than a field of objects. That is to say actions aren't in themselves. They don't have any value So, you know you can take the field of objects and you can say, you know I can stack up a bunch of objects in a lot of complicated different ways But it just turns out to be a stack of Objects and the same is true with actions You can put a sequence of actions all sorts of complicated sequence of actions together But it's only a sequence of value neutral actions until you do something else and so I think you get to nichi with with um That formula now, I know I don't think jordan peterson is doing this because he obviously moves quickly to meaning and goes into other directions So i'm not wanting to lay this on jordan peterson, but simply saying there's a starting point that the that the fundamental Essence is is action I think leads to a power Kind of dynamic and I think we move to something else. I I toyed with a while for with the term care Which is a heideggerian idea that that it's a field that we care about things are things are things that we care about And then we act based on our care, but I even go to a Another level that I think your comment raises and that is That our essence really in our in our in our manifest images is dependence We we are either To we are we either have people who are depending on us or we are dependent on others We are dependent in our very nature from our big from our origin to our to our final act and We that's the tonight dynamic we're in even with the Neutral or however you want to describe the universe of the absolute we are dependent in our kind of central essence and recognizing that I don't know may make a bit more sense out of Out of the manifest image. I don't know I think it's really good You know, it's You know, so vervecky goes with his Relevance realization As as kind of a I think it's a more I think it's a more developed It's a more developed alternative to action because it's fuller, especially when it puts the two words together Because that second word has a double aspect to it. It's both mental and it's physical Because realize has that double dynamic in english and in and in some other languages as well um, but but you're right that that a you know, a sequence of actions is can be just as valueless Which isn't as as a sequence of as a pile of objects and which is what the You know one of jordan peterson's favorite illustrations of the nazi prison guard having Having You know prisoners haul sacks of sawdust back and forth across the factory floor I mean, that's the image of it that the point of the story is a valueless exercise in order to Reinforce valueless, but there is in fact care behind that And then the question is well, what is that we're back into meaning we're back into value And and the quest for these things And and attempting to square I mean in some ways we're back to humes is an ought That we're we're working on the Intersection of these and again, it's it's all of these it's it's all of these things that we bump up against mind matter Is ought and these tend to line up fairly well Heaven and earth in some ways. I think that's right And and so we're working through those things. No, that's that's really really helpful Yeah, and it worries me that power also or let's say action can seem to have A quality of that we would honor in the form of of of competence so competence might be thought of as as hey, that's a way that that That this I can be more comfortable with or something, but I don't really think so because because Being competent. We're not always competent. Sometimes we're not competent and um, and sometimes we're weak and sometimes we're uh, ultimately relegated to being passive and being dependent on others and so we can't plenty of us are not competent and we Have to see ourselves in that in that relationship with each other and we can't just well, it's you can't just judge people Simply based on competence, you know, we Um Competence has nested within it a telos a goal an end. I mean, it's always competence towards something And and again, it's it's the telos and outcomes that especially in the secular frame We are so bad at because secularity by setting itself up You know wants to wants to push those things away Which leaves jordan peterson's with a sort of internal internal compass of meaning But I really like I really like your your point on dependence, which of course is Is deeply biblical In that the I mean, what is man? Well man is like the flower of the field That flourishes is full of glory for a moment But then its place remembers him no more. I mean and and you just you look at the artistry Of you know, of course, this is something that that I as a pastor I read this a lot with older people and so as we're As we're in as i'm trying to facilitate their negotiation With their often impending death you know This is so we go back because on one hand we want to leverage the promises of the bible For meaning and purpose and never-endingness That that that is the promise of the religion but at the same time there's the there's a realization of the religion that This this thing that you have feared And and you rightly have kept pushing away. That's um This thing is an inevitability That that you will not win no matter what action no matter how many objects you line up That's right and I this goes to a kind of an image of the cross that I think might be somewhere in the In the in the gerard renee gerard thing, but you know what? The way I one of the ways I frame the the crucifixion Is a kind of a kind of declaration well, let's say let's say we're in a field of action and we're um And we're peter in the garden and and the Soldier comes up and and is he sees this is it? This is the beginning we're going This is this is the fight we've been preparing for And he pulls out his sword and he says let's go And Uh that would and gerards. I don't know if you got to that point in the gerard Comments, but gerard frames this exactly right because what would happen at that moment if that were the case If jesus had taken up the sword with peter What would have happened? Well, it would have been a complete mess obviously and it would have undone the whole thing and and jesus of course knows this and And he goes through the passion and he is crucified as a kind of declaration of something like Death cannot be seen as failure It cannot be seen if you're if you're gonna put competence. Let's go back to that if you're gonna put competence at the top No, you're you're not going to be able to be competent enough to have that not happen and so the the cross is a a declaration an affirmative declaration that we That death is not failure Because if death is failure then the whole then that's the end that that's if narrative defines what? You know what we take as meaningful? And death is failure then That's going to be all of our stories And so I think this is that's kind of the it's a symbolic but you know, well, let's say real for christians It's a real declaration that says That we could be in our incarnate life without that being the defining narrative And I don't I'll let you run. That's wonderful. That'll preach i'm i'm robbing that thing I'm robbing that thing hard That I think that's I think that's terrific and I think that's right Because and and that's again, I think part of why? the the climate controversy is the perfect storm for rationality because the the value implicit in the The value implicit in the humanist rationalist project is in fact that We can employ science and of course anything that we employ is by definition not at the top of the hierarchy because it is serving that which is Employing it we can employ science in order to in order to beat death and um the You know, this is why I love c.s. Lewis's life in an atomic age Because you know in the late 40s everybody's freaking out because now now the soviets have the bomb too And and everyone's falling all over themselves and c.s. Lewis said well, what kind of world did you think you were living in? Which is exactly the right question That that you had that you had imagined that Well, you had imagined both that you know, maybe death isn't inevitable or at least we can have death on our terms But death is a failure and something which should be avoided and Lewis comes and of course as a christian says well number one No, you're not getting out of none of us are getting out of this alive, and we all know that But we have concocted an enormous culture around You know becket's term the denial of death c.s. Or a book that peterson thinks is a wonderful book but deeply flawed um the denial of death and And and so then we can continue to live in this in this this life over here where we push it off and push it Off and then when it happens, well, then we'll either kick over to religion and say they're in a better place Or we take that. I find very few atheists now, you know shooting their mouth off at gravesides personally Say well, yeah, they're nothing now, right? Well, that was a waste Doesn't sell at the funeral No, I Jim this was that was that was really I I could not have said it any better myself and um That that's just simply That's just simply fantastic and and I love you know how you set up this scene in the garden too because You know if you take the image of jesus That we see in the gospels of someone stilling a storm with a word And someone raising the dead with a word well you want to talk about power You know, is it easier to make a storm? So one of the members of my congregation is involved in cloud seeding and some of those kind of things Is it easier to make a storm or at least to enhance a storm or to still a storm? Is it easier to raise the dead or to cause death? Well, we've been causing death You know seems like the obvious answer to that one is yeah apparent So then you know the the the assumption in As garrard would say the kingdom of satan would be that jesus would use his power to cause the death of his enemies And he completely inverts that and he refuses to use his power. In fact uses minor power To you know, he calls his disciples off. He heals the servant's ear He goes willingly to the cross And And you know all of the scenes in the gospels all of his trial scenes make it abundantly obvious that And he didn't even need a lawyer To avoid the cross and a pilot's practically pleading with him Give me any excuse. I would love to stick it to these guys who are bringing I would love that And and my wife is you know talking in my ear. Don't hurt this man Give me any excuse at all not to crucify you And and jesus jesus just simply will not play his game At any level and that's where in a in a weird way, you know jesus and the joker, you know I don't give too many spoilers, but there's a scene in that movie, which is right out of classical christian imagery and and jesus in a sense like the joker simply defies every narrative That all the competing elements are bringing to him And so they have no choice but to kill him. That's that's all you can do with such a person Yeah, and so then he's the victim And he's god That's why that's how Renee's garrard stuff is so powerful Yeah, I really i'm really gonna follow you along as you as you dive into that because I I really find him to be fascinating For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it'll bring some good stuff Let me let me give a quick plug here my son. I told you before my son is in a band And there's one of his songs that I put in that email. It's called black magic The band is called the slow And they're on spotify and i'm you know, he's he's it's just little local bands It's not like this is gonna go anywhere But I really think that song just kind of goes along with what we my son's a really he's a creative smart You know, he's a very passionate kind of guy when he writes poetry And his poetry is in that song so I just I just black friday is the name of the song on the front. I will put the I will put the I will put the that's in that that's in that email there. Okay, I will put the link in the notes Here's the album right here. He's got it We'll give him a little bit of well, who knows, you know if that artist You know heard of us who knows where this reaches. Yeah, exactly. I was thinking Who knows what'll happen? I was like dad. Could you talk to paul vanderclav again? Get my album up on his channel He wouldn't he wouldn't be the first he did not say that he could be embarrassed by this That's all right. That's all right. That's okay Well, jim, this is this is wonderful as always and and thanks for listening and thanks. Oh and another plug for mary Just to say it out loud mary. I really you know mary coca coca is her name Co co and i really I really like her stuff. So everybody should listen to her. She's a smart lady Kind of crazy how I can't um, I here's my prejudice I wouldn't have thought that someone coming from where she comes from I would I would have been prejudice against that person. Yeah, and she is very impressive In that and that just opens my eyes to a lot of things and then she's reading ratzinger Which is definitely worthy. So I just throw that plug out as well. Yeah. Yeah mary I You know and and in fact I'm need a few more female voices out there Yeah, yeah Well and and karen too karen long the the stuff that she's doing i'll i'll often watch her stuff and i'll you know, she'll just she'll just really spark ideas and I the conversations that are going on on the randos channel and I I it's it's just been it's just been wonderful And um, there's there's more there's more good stuff out there than I have time to listen to which is regrettable But that's as a christian I I console myself Because when we've been there 10 000 years bright shining as the sun We've no less days to sing god's praise and part of how we sing that praise is we we have conversations and we listen and um So together come together. That's right. That's right. So thank you jim This has been terrific again, and i'll post this probably sometimes next sometime next week. It'll get out there. Perfect Thanks again, paul. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye
