 Hi, this is Paul and I hope this will be my last video on the monk debate Getting a little tired of it actually, but it's it's there's some there's some important things to go to go through here Peterson's rebuttal on group guilt I think was important and helpful Assertation of tribalism. It doesn't matter whether it's on the left or the right With regards to the idea of group rights Well, there's a fundamental and this is something we've fallen into terribly in Canada Not least because we had to contend with the threat of Quebec separatism but the idea of group rights is extraordinarily problematic because the the obverse of the coin of individual rights is individual responsibilities and you can hold an individual responsible and an individual can be Responsible and so that's partly why individuals have rights but groups. How do you hold a group responsible? I mean the whole idea is not it's not a good idea to hold a group responsible It first of all it flies in the face of the idea of the sort of justice systems that we've laid out in the West That are essentially predicated first on the assumption of individual innocence But also on the possibility of individual guilt not group guilt We saw what happened in the 20th century many many times when the idea of group guilt was it was it it was enabled to Get a foothold. Let's say in the polity and in the justice system. It was absolutely catastrophic No, I think he makes a good point here because there was a Babylon B. There was a Babylon B Meme where Bill Cosby Complained that he was you know, it was just this tiny little portion of his life that he behaved this way and that was then related to this just a tiny little portion of Planned Parenthood that That does abortions versus the other medical things that they offer Individual when when we hold individuals to account we we hold them to account as an individual now You might say well just a part of me is is wrong in this way And I only hold up I only hold up liquor stores just a very tiny portion of my time So if you jail me you should only jail a very tiny portion of my time There's this there's this Consequence and guilt that we work on with individuals that is that is to a degree totalizing What happens if you try and hold groups to that standard it's very difficult, especially with respect to skin color Let's say I might say well, I know for a fact all of my genetic descendants Came from Europe After the Civil War after slavery was abolished so to what degree am I? Responsible for the decisions of Southern plantation white men now White privilege is an idea that there are ways that I benefit from being white in this culture that people of other ethnic groups don't benefit from and I've Spoken with Asians for example Asians who are who are whose families have been in this country longer because they have Asian physical features. They're commonly thought of as you know Perpetual foreigners and you can find videos about this too many many Different people have this and and a lot of this has has to do with contextuality There's a certain there's a certain assumption of a A multifaceted way of expressing oneself within a context and and if you break from that context you Well, basically the group The group tries to put you back in if you watch the movie inception if you start, you know Monkey with if you start munkling with the vision that the vision begins to turn on you and and that's how we as human beings keep Cohesion and and so that's that's a very complicated thing and again this gets back to Peterson's idea that we know There is more wisdom and knowledge and information built into our actions Then there is then we are able to articulate and so We are able to articulate And so when we we are talking about these things, we're always to a certain degree at a disadvantage And so, okay fine group rights Well, what are you gonna how are you going to contend with the alternative to that the opposite of that? Or that where's the group responsibility? And how are you going to keep how are you going to hold your groups responsible? Well, we don't have to talk about that because we're too concerned with rectifying hypothetical Rectifying historical injustices hypothetical and otherwise, okay historical injustices this Gets to be a very difficult thing The at one point in time Okay the The homo sapiens who crossed the bearing seat land bridge Were at least partially responsible and there's a huge debate to what degree they were responsible for wiping out the large mammals in north america To what degree shall we hold native americans responsible for that environmental devastation? Someone might say you know That was you know 10,000 15,000 years ago. How on earth can you hold me responsible for that? Well to what degree shall we hold all homo sapiens responsible for the the wiping out of the neanderthals? Well, that was 60,000 years ago. How are we going to hold ourselves responsible for being that well? Part of what happens in our culture is that if you notice in our conversations the the Bad has now turned to suffering not life itself And this is a this is a this is a thing that we don't often get into when we're having the materialist debates, for example Suicide tends to be sanctioned in the materialist community and and implicit within that is the assumption that The true enemy is suffering and so almost any Remedy is warranted if suffering is to be addressed or eliminated even Destruction of consciousness itself in suicide now. That's a very funny thing and and that Dynamic is behind this conversation because when we talk about The evils and injustices for example that have been committed against women or that have been committed against Africans who are brought over here against their will as slaves Injustices brought it, you know that have been done against almost any group The frame of that injustice is suffering the difficulty with suffering is that The difficulty with suffering is that suffering is not only contextualized it's individualized I might feel Myself, I I think youtube is doing me an injustice Because pewdiepie has more subscribers than I do and certainly I what I am doing on YouTube is a far greater value than what pewdiepie is doing Therefore somehow I have to hold youtube accountable for the suffering I am enduring to my ego because pewdiepie who I value as being Has his content of being less than mine Therefore an injustice is being done and I am going to call to youtube to remedy this injustice Because obviously what I have to say is far more important than what pewdiepie has to say Okay How are you going to adjudicate this? How is society going to adjudicate this? My claim of injustice what kinds of behaviors that are normally Outside of the normal social realm does this justify? These are all very difficult questions And that's certainly not to say that there weren't any shortage of absolutely catastrophic historical injustices The difficulty that peterson has is when he throws this as sort of a parenthetical remark People miss it and so one of the things that say Dyson is doing very effectively is You know Exaggerating and forefronting certain ideas and peterson might be helped by Forefronting this idea and in the end of my comment in the last video I said this this could actually help him in in debates like this. That's not the point The point is how you view the situation at the most fundamental level and group rights are an absolute catastrophe in my opinion Let's michelle come in on that point This is something you've written about Uh the idea that you know in identity politics, uh the identity of the group is is absolutely a valid part of The discourse and and individuals could and should be seen in participating groups as they enter into the civic space I'm not sure that we necessarily have to analogize from Individual the you know, the opposite of individual rights is individual responsibility I'm not sure that that analogy necessarily holds for the groups. I mean in I'm not really quite sure her point here part of the problem that she has in this forum is She's not she's not Making a point making it clearly and defending it. She's kind of It's it's self-expression Okay, and that's right and that's but that's also partly again consciousness Back to back to other conversations i'm having consciousness is is very important here because We can only pay attention to one thing at a time and what i'm about to say you're about to forget And so what we tend to do is we make things simple and we make things bold and we try to make things memorable And so now we've got let's say uh gay people women and The descendants of african slaves, okay We're going to take this group and we're going to we're going to hold up this group and we're going to prioritize their grievances their claims And and we're going to say these are the ones we should focus on which which to me is always remarkable because Well poverty There are there are there are illness That there are so many other Causes of suffering that one might be able to highlight to hold these up and say These are the ones that must draw our attention Okay Why these now well, that's kind of because of the flow of history but certainly there are if you if you if you Divide people in other ways. Um older people are discriminated against because they're not as uh lovely looking as younger people. Um You know beauty privilege and this is where if you read a site like everyday feminism, um it's I I I have that on my my priority list on my On my feedley reader just because every day I'm i'm just amazed at At what is put forward and I and I watch the constant stream of things being put forward and I just think How can anyone possibly keep up with this and and what sense does any of this make and this is in a sense the new morality? but You know, let's let's stop. Let's stop discriminating against people with disabilities by by no longer recognizing What has been known as disabilities because that stigmatization is hurting them. So Well, okay, so we're going to dismiss with the american disabilities act because by definition the american disabilities act requires Ramps and elevators and sometimes very costly remedies in public spaces Because people in a wheelchair and for me to say to someone in a wheelchair. Well, I don't see you in a wheelchair I just think you're just sitting down right now Okay, but what if they have to go to the bathroom This this whole thing just comes undone So let's let michelle talk a little bit more but in the united states, um A great a huge part of our politics has been groups Struggling for rights for their individual members, right? I mean so women in the united states and and that's a good point um collective action Collective action is a function of a democratic system that again Diminishes the process and then says this is how we gain power through majoritarian action and so therefore individuals organize and group which is why you have various groups of minorities being clumped together and say if we can have the women and the african-americans and the hispanics And the asians The asians are always kind of left out. Um Nobody pays any attention to them maybe because they're mostly on the west coast Maybe increasingly not so but the asians are almost always ignored and they're the most populous group of people in the world so I don't know but We're going to clump these group of people and then all these group of people together is going to be able to take on the White men and that's kind of the way the game is played States, you know seeking the right to reproductive control of their body A word about that Women have always been The the sex that selects and jordan peterson makes this point again and again and again Unlike let's say chimpanzee populations women decide I will mate with this man. I will not mate with that man Um, I was just reading in the masculinist, which is a newsletter that I pointed out a couple of times 40 percent of men Procreate 70 percent of women procreate Women do the selecting women are the gatekeepers watch Ghostbusters the gatekeepers and the key master women are the gatekeepers. That's that's the way they are now her point here is again her point about Contraception and abortion which is interesting So in a sense she's saying women ought to be able to have sex without worries about reproduction I I think generally speaking contraception is a fine thing. I'm a protestant not a roman catholic But it's not an uncomplicated thing and there have been some interesting conversations on the internet Jordan peterson has made this point a number of places that we don't really have any idea the ways that the pill is Changing the relationship between the sexes. That's a that's a very interesting conversation You know african-americans in the united states seeking Redress from police brutality or discrimination or simply the kind of tendency and again Based on my last videos. This is a this is a community of people that I have Lived with that in many ways I identify with I almost always vote like them Um, I I totally agree there there are historical there are historical wrongs whose repercussions continue to impact people's abilities to function but what we're going to get into though is is the difficulties that that Not all of these things are external and external things become internalized and cultures cultures have achievements and and if we're going to Talk about the ability of african-americans to achieve And again go back to um Go back to to glenn laury. That's a really important place. All right, I want to play that at some point In america of white people to call the police whenever they see an african-american in a place where they don't think that they're supposed to be And you simply I don't see how you can contend with any of those social problems If you see society as just an ocean of atomized individuals Every time someone calls the I recently saw a whole thing about white women's need to stop calling the police on black men Wow Okay Every time the police almost every time the police are called they're called because of an individual or a tiny group of individuals And there are a whole matrix of things going on in that moment with respect to the decision to call the police I will completely agree. I mean some of the some of the heinous stories about You know people the police are called because someone is letting themselves into their own home Or a college student is taking a nap in the lobby um, you know these are These these are white people problems, I mean these are these are problems with people who are in a majority context and Certain stereotypes have have been developed. I remember going to calvin college um A girl I knew calvin college, which was a very white place in the 80s when I was there A girl that I knew coming from canada going to calvin college had never actually met An african-american person in her life This is an 18 year old girl. She lived in probably a fairly rural area in canada Just weren't many folks there now now on one hand You can say yeah. Well, what's wrong with you? Well She's young Well, they should be trained well, okay, so they should be trained in canada about well what about asians and southeast asians and you know go through the list And and this is something that comes up in the debate with jordan peterson jordan peterson grew up with I don't know the preferred term in canada aboriginal peoples first nations peoples He had it seems to have had a lot of experience with that particular population No one can be expected to have a lot of experience with every population when I was When I was teaching day camp in paterson at my father's church many of the children in that program never left Never left the environment around their homes within a few blocks And so part of our program in day camp is we would take these trips and we would go out to the park and we would We would go to the shore and we'd go to a ver we'd go into new york city and we'd go to a variety of places Many of these children had never had an opportunity there young african-american children many of these children had never had an opportunity To get to know white folks before so I would sit down and they'd put their fingers through my hair I had more hair then they'd put their fingers through my hair I'd go to the bathroom, you know at a urinal and they'd look around because they wanted to see if white all went all the way down their children they're learning they've never seen a white penis before so Ta-da there it is Same skin same color as their estimate. Um, you know, hopefully not too much information or not too much graphic but people have limitations on what they know by virtue of their Experience and it seems to me we ought to as a society have a certain degree of Understanding for those Limiting experiences and I appreciate the fact for certain minority groups It gets very tiresome to always be in the position of having to educate the majority About who you are and how you know and and generally speaking because Hierarchies are tyrannical to one degree or another Those on the bottom always know those on the top a lot better than those on the top No, though on the know those on the bottom because they have to all of those dynamics are true All of these dynamics we can begin to understand but Now the starbucks point I Mean this is what she's about to express is is basically progressive liberationism Rod dreier who who I read from time to time made a point that okay starbucks is about to say, okay Well, you know from now on you don't need to buy anything. You can stay in the store as long as you want Doesn't take a brain doesn't take a rocket scientist or a sociologist to figure out what's going to happen in certain starbucks in certain areas of the country and in certain cities and And as made the comment before i've got a lot of experience with the homeless population who by no means are all black by any means and someone like you know, my friends who live on the street, they can't go into a starbucks because Starbucks knows how my friends act they're gonna come in there. They're gonna use the bathroom. They're gonna camp out and cities Don't quite know what to do with this And and this is a very very difficult problem because people are enormously complicated so When people call the police and when they don't call the police Is a real problem and ideally you want this sorted out at the level of the police because on one hand you've got the police Saying the populations if you see it, you know, if you see it call us if something's strange Keep your eyes out again in the post 9 11 world. We're all told, you know If there's anything weird call Well, you're gonna get race. You're gonna have calls that are racially motivated It is going to happen and I don't know how you filter that You know, it could well be that if you're black and someone is giving you grief from where you're at You can call the police and say hey this white person here keeps telling me I have no right to be here But i've got my student id and I have every right to be here. So, you know Tell this person to shut up Okay, there's going to be a process involved Um, you know and I just again I I don't I don't think there's anything pernicious about people Banding together on the basis of their common identity to seek redress for Discrimination and exclusion. I mean, I think that that is everything that's best About our democracy that is the definition of progress Right there. That is the definition of progress and this is where you know, this is this is in a sense the creative progressive liberationism that What history is is this movement of? Greater freedom and equality and this is progressive and as I mentioned in the previous video This is you've got some of this 20th century Evolutionary Progressivistic thought that well, this is what's going to happen. But now it wouldn't take too much to say, okay Well to what degree are the pedophiles? discriminated against they many of them will claim that their their experience of attraction towards you know towards children is You know is natural to them, you know at what who says 18 is some magical age, you know Right now we've got a big debate and then all kinds of things 18 versus 21 Um, we might maybe you should push that back to 25 if you're looking for a biological argument for brain plasticity. So What i'm what i'm saying in this is that on one hand From her point of view it seems very obvious Which groups have rights and which groups don't and then the next thing that's brought in is well These people don't hurt each other pedophiles hurt people. Well now we're going to have the argument whether um, You know adult child sexual activity is in fact bad for the child and you'll find pedophiles making that argument and You know you can the point that peterson makes and many others is that okay groups can come together and advocate for their position Well, what about the homeless people and their allies? Well, that's part of the conversation that's going on now. It's gonna go on now with respect to starbucks even though the two guys who You know who who were arrested for being in starbucks and not having bought a coffee who were black You know the interviews show these guys to be wonderful human beings who in fact Donated their settlement to to help other people. I take my hat off to these guys and you know To injustice couldn't have happened to two better individuals and the world is blessed through them i'm not saying that it should keep happening, but This is the conversation we're having but this is in a sense the definition of progressive liberationism and as a consistent way of figuring out As a religion, it's a pretty lousy one and So again, I just I keep stumbling with the idea that this is somehow Tyrannical or that way lies stalinism And you know a lot of things now it's interesting because peterson listens to her pretty well Dyson peterson has about had it with and you'll notice the body language Won't even look at him as as dyson gets going who are opposed to political correctness talk about the concept of category creep Or is it no no Yeah category creep, which is a concept that was originated Right so that you okay, then they're gonna go on this and then because you know undergraduates often think in broad and slightly overwrought categories, I know I did when I was when I was a kid, um, yeah, maybe still do but That's a that's a nice little piece of of You know, I appreciate the fact that that she made that comment but I I hear a lot of Category creep in again the argument against political correctness or against seeking group redress the idea that kind of that way lies Dehumanization or you know, and I think that's a fair that's a fair point and both sides have to figure out Okay, where are our boundaries? um and and and what is you know, where do our points lie? And then they're going to go to stephen fry I'm still very lost about why we aren't talking about political correctness. We're talking about politics and uh, that's fine And we're talking about politics again if you see my last video because in a sense the pro side their their implicit religion is progressive liberationism And they're meaning the real reason they're on the stage is because jordan peterson there Is is there and poor stephen fry flew across the atlantic and never got the conversation. It was promised And I share You know share exactly what you think about it. I'm not an enemy of identity politics per se I can obviously see where it goes wrong and this is where he's loki, you know He can be flexible for anything what he's interested in is the sovereignty of the individual So he's you know a little bit more individual extreme than peterson the whole time peterson has been saying We have to negotiate the relationship between the communal and the individual the individual should have priority But the communal is important too wrong and where it's annoying One one of the things one of the things that that I appreciated jonathan peugeot just recently did a Did a video on the guide to postmodernism where he's talking about radical hospitality and that's in a sense where the starbucks conversation goes as well because You can you can express radical hospitality to the degree that you Completely lose yourself and you completely lose your capacity to be an actor or an agent or have any sovereignty or any ownership over that which Should be considered to be rightfully yours and and at this point, you know peugeot basically says post-modernity kind of swallows itself at this point because You know, you can be so radically hospitable that you stop making your point because if you find your point is annoying someone Then you're not practicing your point. Then you should you should be radically hospitable and shut up And at this point Peugeot basically says and this is where hierarchies assert themselves where we have priorities of ideas We have priorities of thoughts and these priorities exist so that we can in fact have order and what this radical What this radical hospitality really gives way to is is simply is simply chaos part of the difficulty here is the question, you know, do you know, do you know when the kingdom comes and Let's jump back fry. We'll keep talking for a while. How well is it working for you in america at the moment? And and this is and this is the question he says it says okay your political correctness. How is that working for you? Not well at all Really isn't right. I you can answer me in a moment. Um the reason The reason that trump and brexit in britain and all kinds of nativists all over europe is succeeding is not the triumph of the right It's the catastrophic failure of the left. It's our fault Now notice again how many times fry gets applause in this show we Absolutely, and that'll tell you a lot about the audience My point is not that i've turned to the right or anything like that or that i'm nice and fluffy and want everybody to be decent I'm saying fuck political correctness resist Fight if you have a point of view fight it in the proper manner using democracies. It should be not channels of education not language And I think in some ways fry is This is how people fight people fight with language Language is the first frontier. It's so silly But there's a chess rule, you know in chess the best move to play in chess is not the best chess move It's the move your opponent least wants you to play at the moment You're being recruiting sergeants for the right but by annoying and upsetting and instead of fighting either fighting or persuading But political correctness is a middle course that simply doesn't work Well, first of all, please you said be empirical now empirical My point is you said be empirical now empirical as far as I know the word means that which can be verified And and it really seems sometimes with dyson here that he's got some ideas and his mouth just keeps running and he's just got a list of words that he throws out there and Falsified through the senses exactly. So if we look at it in an objective, um a way Uh, the the reality is that people don't have equal access to the means to articulate the very moment you're talking about I'm talking about the empirical results of this political attitude. I understand that but my point is I understand that but my but Whose point were we talking about? It's law i'm gonna hijack this simply this i'm suggesting to you that people use the weapons at hand Now it was abraham joshua hesho the rabbi who said everybody's not guilty, but everybody's responsible Now we're going to talk about guilt quite a bit more in a little bit because that's really where a lot of this stuff goes That's a distinction there. Everybody clearly is not guilty. But what's interesting? Look at the flip side if you have benefited from 300 years of holding people in servitude Now now peterson is going to say wait a minute. Who's you? Okay, this is a collective you And to what degree do each of us participate? And benefit from this collective view because that is going to be met Individualist individually for example my my friend here to what degree did he benefit from being white? To what degree did he benefit from from the various things in in his life and where and while he by virtue of Now again by thing virtue of things that we may say he can change. Well given now the what we think about mental illness Choice, you know, what degree can he change these things? I mean he is he was now he's in prison now He was excluded from starbucks and the grocery store and the convenience store and and he was excluded from the bus and he was excluded From just about everywhere and he even would have a pretty hard time getting into an er Depending on the day and his mood and and how he was and so on and so forth Very difficult. These are very difficult conversations thinking that you did it all on your own Why can't these people work harder? Let me see now. He's trading in a lot of tropes here 300 years You ain't had no job No job, I mean again, who are you talking about? It's it's really comfortable keeping things vague here and There there's assumptions here about the groupings. So the reality is for 300 years you hold people in the bands You hold them in subordination you Nobody's listening to him. He was to give them rights Then all of a sudden you free them and say you're now individuals not having the skills Not you You free them not having the skills and now I want to I want to come back I've been wondering if i'm going to play this part of of glenn laury's talk and I think I will Harvey mansfield has invited us to his program uh Has to do with the series of conversations that john mcwarder and I have been having online at uh The glenn show at blogging heads.tv. That's my video blog. I'm Every other week or so chatting with somebody about some issue of politics or culture We put it up on youtube and the blogging head site people think that we have something of a following And john and I it's too little of a following. You should have a bigger following Of uh of uh commentary at the glenshow we are John mcwarder can speak for himself. He's an able linguist and cultural critic. I know you're about to say the black guy Yes blogging heads.tv And that's almost literally true, you know every now and then there's a person of color at the site But um, you know mostly not you know as in other areas of american life But uh, it falls to us from time to time to take up the questions of the day You know the things that are being highly debated and contested, you know cohen happy nick taking a knee and leading the black laborers at the nfl and the direction of social justice warriorship Or or black lives matter and the issue of police violence and brutality and whether or not the framing of the problem of violence and Constraint on african-american Humanity as it's playing out in american society is properly undertaken by framing and in terms of police violence. I saw on john And I have not always the same view about those things we go back and forth about it I expect that we're here to do a little bit of that back and forth with uh colloquy with you um I just want to make a couple of remarks. Let me say a little bit of something about myself. I said I taught at harvard Um, I was a reagan conservative in the 1980s I would have gone into the government but for personal scandal that had me uh withdraw from a high level appointment and 1987 Uh in the second reagan administration term. I am was am was A black conservative. I I say am was okay because like There's been a little bit of evolution. There's been some shifting my book race incarceration and american values would I think pass muster with uh progressive commentators on the race issue as being you know, politically appropriate But others of the things that i've said and written not so much so one by one from the inside out. This was a cry from the heart about the importance of behavioral dysfunction as a basis of african-american Disadvantage and the need for us to take responsibility within our families and communities and address these dysfunctional behaviors. That was a Collection of essays of pieces that I had written over the preceding 10 years They were conservative in their tone they extolled booker t washington and this kind of thing They criticized affirmative action. They talked about black on black crime without uh without blinking And so on I've evolved but not that much Okay, um and uh Uh, I must say and this is by way of prelude and i'm going to turn it over john to do a similar thing And we maybe will have some back and forth. I must say that I feel sometimes like I haven't gotten off a square one Um, i'm looking around at uh, the state of the discourse I don't see honesty. I don't see transparency. I don't see straightforwardness. I see um I see a um avoidance of the reality of the root of african-american persisting disadvantage I see narratives about um You know white supremacy about plunder about endemic and intrinsic american racism about the denial of black humanity at every turn um I don't see much talk at all about the development of the capacities of african-americans to actually compete on our own merits and what is a increasingly Difficult competition in the modern world the globalized world the small world that we live in um I I see uh a kind of being locked in to a rhetoric and a discourse that I I believe is uh inadequate and a politics that I believe ultimately is inadequate to uh to the problem so I'm in one of our last conversations john asked me how i'm feeling about talking about race with the black guys at bloghist.tv And I had to say God i'm in despair. I'm I I worry for my country. I worry for my people Um and what might equality for african-americans actually consist We do political theory in here, right? What is equality? What would it mean? I'm in a university i'm looking around the university. We have a africana studies department god love them We have a diversity initiative full-throated endorsement from the provost and from the president a slew of deans Who are responsible for overseeing this or that dimension of inclusion diversity and inclusion? We're devoted to it go to The science lab go to the school of engineering The possibility of african-american faces in these places is not possible to ignore I was I My youngest son is going to go to uc santa cruz in the fall and I was at a meeting of all of the students who are accepted in engineering and computer science in that program in the school the room was filled with It was a very large classroom. It was filled with parents and students who were incoming I saw One American male in that room There were a good number of white students. There were a large number of asian students Those of indian descent those of chinese or korean descent I I believe the the current position is that you see schools have you know cannot practice affirmative action and I I just looked around that room because I was interested in this question and what What glenn laury says here is is just true and Well, i'm going to let him keep talking because he says it far better than I do What is that about For my money it's about the fact that an inadequate number of our youngsters are Achieving the capacities of performance and function in those particular areas of human endeavor To penetrate these elite and exclusive institutions and numbers and what is the narrative in response to that fact the fact the fact being If you look at test scores, we're not supposed to talk about test scores test scores are a bad thing to talk about If you look at the actual levels of achievement you see huge disparities by race if you look at the narrative For talking about the under representation of african americans I speak now about brown I speak now about the physics department or about the electrical engineering department or about the applied mathematics department And I speak about the paucity of black faces there You take note of that Uh, the basic response is well the institution is not inclusive. We're not doing enough I want to say something like if we are not able to instill within our children a capacity to function At a level that is competitive in these elite venues. We will not have true equality. Do you really think that affirmative action abetted Inclusion initiatives that count heads and get the numbers up but that don't address the underlying function Is a path to equality No, it's not it's a path to permanent patronage It's a it's a clientelism argument Uh, it is not a good substitute for mastery over those skills to play a political card Which induces a sympathetic response from administration because that's the easiest path the easiest path Would be to say ah, don't worry. We're gonna bend over backwards. We're gonna get a few more in don't worry. Don't worry Don't worry. The hard path is a saying something that's true, but that is unpalatable Functioning is disparate by race and it will not change unless we actually address the objective circumstances that are producing people some of whom are able to do the calculus course in the applied math department and others who are not and not enough blacks are getting that developmental exposure and Enhancement of their human capacity so as to be able to meet our diversity and inclusion. That's hard work That would be hard just saying the fact of it is hard and doing something about it is harder still Much easier is this um Dance that we uh engage in and this is my point about The the problem is so much worse than Choosing affirmative action at the university level My wife has taught public school here in sacramento and before she taught in this waldof school She was teaching in a a neighborhood one of the poorer neighborhoods of the city and Again where where i've ministered where my father has ministered the question of Is there a Can't can we help this community? Have the very complex social religious cultural matrix out of which black Children in america can flourish and reach their potential. That is the goal and Instead of actually I think what we've seen over the last 50 years is not only have we not seen much if any improvement In the side of black youth in america. We've seen loss in other ethnic groups in america As a as a culture, I believe we have lost the the soft The the the kinds of capacities intact families families with a father and mother and child You know wholeness at the family level that produces The kind of capacity from children and and we know more than we've ever known before in terms of how early this needs to begin I was I was just sitting down with a sunday. I was just sitting down with an unwed mother who is Oldish she she may be 20 I'm trying to think which of my child she's the same age as she might be 20 years old might be 19 years old Has a child who is under one? Had had this child out of wedlock read read David brooks column a number of months ago on on so often fathers of unwed mothers and fathers of the children of unmed mothers Initially start to try to make efforts to be involved and and they that falls away There's an entire there's an entire Framework that we as human beings need that so often we inherit that is that is so different Difficult if not inherited And if not supported by by family and assumption and upbringing and morality and institutions and all of this If that structure is not there then then we see the kinds of problems that I see Again and again and again with children that we know starting out with non-optimal situations And and there are always the few exceptions who will be able to overcome And and and some of these individuals are our elders and leaders in my church who were born In in poverty in los angeles or in other places to single motherhood and they were some of the few individuals that were able to take Advantage of of some of the social programs that have been around for a couple of generations now at least and they were able to get into college Good schools and they were able to get degrees and they were able to one way or another have an intact family system And they were able to provide for their children what they needed and and some of those children Some of those african-american children they have flourished and they have had opportunities and I Praise god for the efforts that previous generations have gone through so that I have no problem Prioritizing these individuals for the sake of the of the greater culture But the point that laury is making here is that it starts so young and there are so few and and that we much we must need a far larger Conversation as a church and as a church of the people of the world And I think that's the most important thing that we need to do to get to the point where we are at A larger conversation at a very beginning level that that is going to yes certainly take into account The ways that racism and the the history of slavery and then jim crow and ongoing Discriminations and and and poverty have hurt these communities. I'm absolutely willing to have those conversations but Just like with every other community that doesn't face those significant headwinds There still must be the kinds of family and social structure and and religious context and and all of those things that allow those children to come up And and what's amazing is that so often we see children coming from far more desperately poor countries as immigrants to the United States Their families might not might have less money than than even the the groups of African-Americans stacked up at zero in our context But by virtue of their culture, they are able to get in and succeed even even the groups that the chief of staff recently was talking about Coming to this nation with the parents with a sixth grade education, but their children come in and they flourish and they and they get moving Not all of them, but they're able to and so you have to say what can we possibly do together? But it's going to be together and and it's and it isn't going to be a client ism as Glen Lowry says here It is going to be us working together at this and to turn a blind eye to the dynamics going on within the community Is not leadership within the community and a little while from later a little while from now I'm going to play what McWhorter says about this because I think he is dead on right about it I'll let I'll let Lowry finish because I I move to tears every time I listen to this and I must have listened to this a dozen times This ritual that we enact this self-flagellation that these institutions are inclined to in which you say oh don't worry don't worry don't worry And yet the real business of the university continues on So that in other words the world is more competitive the world is globalized Nobody's going to wait for these kids. It's going to be in my mind is not equality In my mind, it's not equality to have the jails overflowing with black felons Let me just say it one more time people who have broken the law people who have stolen people who have hurt other people The jails are not full of innocent nonviolent drug offenders who've been scooped up by racist cops The jails are basically full of people who are dangerous, contemptuous of social order and a threat to their neighbors, especially their black neighbors So here we are with the jails overflowing. There are too many people in prison in the United States. I've written a whole book about this There are too many black people in prison in the United States. It's the new Jim Crow Oh, oh, I see. It's America's way in the 21st century of reenacting the old American drama of plundering black bodies by corralling them because there's contempt for their humanity That's Ta-Nehisi Coates' thesis No, it is not. And pretty much everybody knows that it is not. Anybody who lives in a city knows that it is not They know what the character of the threats are. They know what the pathological behavior of a few people who happen to belong to this group has wrought And yet the pablum, oh, it's the new Jim Crow, oh, this is just America's way of denigrating black people yet again Denial of a dishonest rhetoric, it's not a path to equality You think people don't know? They know that you can shut them up by waving the bloody shirt of racism in their faces By waving your finger in their faces, that you can make them go silent doesn't change the objective facts on the ground So I have probably said as much as I should say by way of introduction I'm furious, I'm furious, I'm furious here in my 70th year of life That a half century after the civil rights movement, when I look around at the intellectual and political leadership of my people When I look at the persisting disparate circumstances that characterize their social condition And when I listen to the superficial and manipulative rhetoric that's offered up by way of explanation Superficial and manipulative rhetoric, and that's exactly right I'm furious about that I have decided that I'm going to devote myself to saying such truths as I think I may understand Notwithstanding the zeitgeist, on the theory that there are a few and hopefully over time a few more And hopefully over time a few more yet, I won't ever expect it to be a majority Who will open up the discourse and allow some air to get in Because we're dying over here They're dying in Chicago, they're dying in East St. Louis, they're dying in Oakland, California We're dying over here in these schools that are producing kids who can't read We're dying in these jails full of these young men whose humanity never had a chance to reach a full extent You're going to blame white people for that? Well, you certainly can do it And by the way, there are a fair number of white people who will pat you on the back for doing it They'll give you awards for doing it, they'll make you into a star They'll make you rich for doing it, for blaming them For the failures in your own community Yeah, there are failures in our community I haven't even started talking about raising children I haven't started talking about the conditions of family life Okay, oh, no, we're not supposed to talk like that That would be blaming the victim, wouldn't it? Asking people to raise their children is blaming the victim? So that's where I'm coming from, y'all have that in me And we'll get back to this Because that's, like I said, that's a powerful video I'm back to this guy Not having the skills, I'm talking about America, first of all I'm talking about the American society, first of all I'm talking about the Northern Hemisphere I'm talking about every society where enslavement has existed I'm speaking specifically of the repudiation of individual rights Among people of color in America who were denied the opportunity to be individuals So I, see, I obviously and ideally, and I think Michelle Goldberg does too Agree with the emphasis on individuals What we're saying to you is that we have not been permitted to be individuals We have not been permitted to exercise our individuality And that is very true, but to what degree is that true now? Now it can't be, it's not binary, it's not zero or a million There's places in between here And the degree to where those places are, are significant ...autonomy and authority and the refusal to do so To recognize me as an individual means when you roll up on me And I'm a 12 year old boy in a park and you shoot first In ways you do to black kids that you don't do to white kids You are not treating that person as an individual And if we're living in a society where women are subject to aberrant forms of horrid, patriarchal, sexist and misogynist behavior You are not acknowledging the centrality of the individuality of women You are treating them according to a group dynamic And if we get beyond the ability of people on the right to understand the degree to which they have operated from the basis of benefit from group identity ...the great American philosopher Beyoncé No... Let's go back ... Part of the difficulty we have here is when do you know when it's done I remember listening to 2008 Obama acceptance speech Which I thought was an amazing speech, but it also scared me Because he was basically taking a victory lap Well, you know, here we are, we have a black president Well, that solves everything And then we get into this game Does it solve everything? Yes or no? This is where I think it's a remarkable thing for this country that Barack Obama was elected And I remember having a conversation with a dear friend of mine who's far more politically astute than I am It's his professional life And I remember him telling me during the primaries There's no way the Democrats are going to choose Obama over Hillary And that was a black man telling me that And I said, I think you're wrong I think Obama is a better candidate I think he's going to win And he won And he won the whole thing And a lot of people were And I think that's something to rightly celebrate But it's a point that has to be owned And every time I hear someone saying America is a white supremacist country Well, I guess that means that Barack Obama was a white supremacist That kind of talk is it's dishonest and it's stupid So let's get a little bit into John McWhorter here White privilege is real, yes You walk around white, there are things that will not happen to you That happen when you are black Sure, yeah My problem is the idea that young white people need to be indoctrinated Into the idea that they are privileged My problem with What is Dyson's whole point in this whole lecture? I have to teach you all that you are privileged Okay, I'm privileged, I admit it Now what? Well, there's no now what that he has to offer You just have to keep knowing your guilt The idea of white privilege is the idea that it's not about you The idea is that you learn that you're privileged But you're not allowed to have anything contradictory to say You're just supposed to listen to any black claim that's made And anybody that says anything about being black cannot be questioned And frankly, no human being is that smart Black people are not always right because no human beings are always right But it's often said that it's not about you And the idea is that it's a stain that never goes away And that's exactly right Progressive liberationism is the replacement for Christianity For many on the one hand And many on the other It's a replacement for the white privilege And there's a lot of people that think that Because of the white privilege That white privilege is a replacement for the original sin Which is a very good question Because white privilege is a replacement for the original sin Which I think is very much analogous to original sin And there are many on the American political left They no longer believe all of the historical accoutrements of Christianity And if you look at the evolution of the conversation Again, back into late enlightenment They'd say, well, now because of Darwin We can't read the Bible as history or science But we can read the Bible as ethics That endures into the Cold War Now we can no longer read the Bible as ethics God is not good Christianity is evil And now you need a new ethic to replace it Well, what is that new ethic going to be? Well, Michelle Goldberg just basically said Well, our new ethic, we can derive that from the civil rights movement And we can derive that from Well, now it's this progressive liberationism That we are going to be liberated from all of the ways That we are unfree And so in that sense Stephen Fry is way over at the extreme Because he is fully individual, fully unfree And now he's at, in a sense, the sacred self Where whatever I feel my appetites and my desires are This is to what I should be allowed to indulge in and pursue And develop as far as I want to go And I think McWhorter is dead on correct here The left basically gave up Christianity But kept Christian eschatology as soteriology And so what happens with white privilege is now They have, in a sense, become Calvinists But instead of the broader category of sin Being the category by that which they have to overcome Now it's just their bigotry Now it's just the ways that they are trying to contain other people And now they have to atone for the great history of evil That by virtue of their white skin they have inherited the benefits of And so McWhorter is dead on right This now has replaced Christianity and it has become religious But it doesn't solve any problems And more to the point, to focus on white privilege as a kind of original sin Detracts from some solutions for black community problems That don't lend themselves to that paradigm So what you have then is, okay, so I'm responsible for the racism I'm responsible for the slavery I'm responsible for the new Jim Crow I'm responsible for the continued oppression So how do I get rid of my guilt? Well, most people don't do anything except, well, I can sell them my vote So here's my guilt, you have my vote And there have been, and this is where I get into my frustration With the leadership of the black community What have they done with that vote? And this is something that Trump was able to capitalize on And say to many black folks, what have the Democrats done for you? Now for many black folks, they're not going to vote for the Republicans For a whole variety of reasons And I completely understand, I haven't voted for them either But I'm not giving the Democrats my votes anymore either At least most of them The Democrats that I know, Larry Carr, I respect him A lot of the politicians that I know personally I will vote for them, I continue to have a democratic bias But, you know, it's meaningless And that's exactly what McWhorter's going to say Also to give one example, and then I'll shut up Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, cops killing black people for no real reason That is a real problem But if you are a black person in a troubled community The enraged white cop is one of the least of your problems There are so many things going on In terms of who's going to kill you It's not going to be Darren Wilson It's much more likely to be the other Trayvon down the street Because of this white privilege focus We focus on these cops and we think of Black Lives Matter as the new great society I've noticed all over Cambridge that these Black Lives Matter signs Paste it up in... The great society was LBJ's campaign I don't even know how they got that high But clearly something is going on Black Lives Matter, great, and Black Lives do matter, I get it Yeah, is that what it is? Usually on church Some major ladders that they've gone up Which is fine, but that's not what people in those communities' problems really consist of So, yes, white privilege encourages us to focus on things that aren't really problems And too many Black people stay poor Yeah, that's what I meant by that Let me add something to that I didn't write a piece criticizing the term white privilege But I can think of an argument that might be worthy of considering in the context of discussing it Which is about fetishizing race There's a lot of different kinds of privilege The whiteness of the person We're going to make that the touchstone for a disposition on relative power, advantage, inheritance, status, and prerogative Surely it's more complicated than that I'm reading, just finished reading Matt Desmond, the sociologist Matthew Desmond's book, Evicted It's about Milwaukee And it's about poor people who get kicked out of their residences because they can't pay their rent About the moving companies to come to get their stuff and set the stuff on the curb About the storage companies that make space for their stuff to be put away for $100 a month About the landlords who are rapacious but also hardscrabble businessmen and women trying to make a buck in a tough market And so on It's about Milwaukee There's two sides of town in Milwaukee, north side and south side Blacks on one, whites on the other As far as I can tell The disadvantages, the pathos, the loss, the sense of helplessness, the marginality, the poverty The impoverished lives, the abandoned children, the irresponsibility, the drug addiction, the violence, domestic violence Doesn't know any color in Milwaukee As far as I can tell Those tenements on the black side of town where the black people are getting evicted Are just as miserable and those people are just as desperate as those trailer parks on the white side of town where the white people are being evicted When I look at the Washington Post publication of the As best they can tell from searching records Universe of cop killings in the United States That's all of them All 1,252 in the year 2016 I make that number up, it's something like that Something like a little bit over a thousand And they enumerate every single one that they could find searching all the sources They tell us about the conditions, they tell us whether or not the assailant, the person who was shot was armed They tell us about the race of the person killed, about the race of the police officer, etc. etc. Were they fleeing? How did the officer get called to the scene? There's a lot of comprehensive data there As far as I can tell, three times as many whites as blacks are killed by police officers in this country in a given year If there's a problem with the cops, it's a problem with the cops How did it get to be white privilege when you've got white unarmed Tamir Rice getting gunned down by cops? Yes, that has happened Yesterday, not yesterday, three days ago in Chicago, a police commander was gunned down in a stairwell across the street from City Hall It happens that the police commander, a high level officer in the Chicago Police Department Was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, he got a radio call, he ran down a stairwell It happens that that man was white And it happens that the multiple felon who was fleeing police and was armed and who ran down into that stairwell And was chased by this police commander and who shot him dead was black Now, now, there will be no news reports, and there shouldn't be In which it is trumpeted that black former frequent offending felon led out too early by a judge has gunned down a decent white cop You're not going to read that story Had the cop gotten the drop on the felon and shot him before he was murdered by him The headline would be yet another young black man, I don't know how it would work, gunned down by a racist white cop Privilege, including the privilege of exercising the prerogatives of citizenship without undue violent interference from agents of the state Doesn't know any color Do you think that race card playing kids at these liberal venues, newsrooms Where they can define the debate simply by demonstrating their anger How dare you white people write a story like that? Lecture halls where they can set the temper of what is going to be said and what can't be said based upon claims of privilege You don't know how my ancestors have suffered. You don't know what it's like to be black. Do you think that's not power? Do you think the ability to shut down a conversation, to shut people up is not power? Do you think the people who exercise that prerogative don't know that they have power? So no, my argument with white privilege is why are you racial? Why are you fetishizing race? In fact, I thought that the nails in the coffin of Jim Crow were driven by a completely different moral argument I thought the nails in the coffin of Jim Crow in the late 1950s and through the 1960s were driven by the compelling force of the argument That our humanity transcends the narrowness and historical accident of our racial categories We are not the color of our skin. That's not who we are as people Now, if you want to get run out of town on a rail, try saying that. Try saying, quote, we should be colorblind, close quote in any progressive venue. Try saying we should look past the color of people's skin. That's the idea. No, we haven't achieved the ideal That's the appropriate ideal So that would be the, you know, I've talked too long about this That would be the content of my rebuttal of the white privilege thing It's a narrow, it's a ethically inadequate, not very deep Amartya Sen, our colleague here at Harvard, the great, is he still here? Silence, the illusion of destiny, which is very interesting And it starts out with him telling an anecdote about being a boy growing up in post-independence India and watching a communal violence act in which, you know, some Muslim is hunted down by some Hindu mob and hacked to death And he runs to his father, wants to know what's going on, his father explains to him that they killed him because he's a Muslim And Sen is recollecting this, and he's saying, how could the identity of Muslimness or Hinduness take on such salience in people's minds that it would transcend their, the constraints that they ought to willfully embrace about their behavior that attends to their and others' humanity? How could that be? And he goes on to develop an argument And he says, you know, yes, we are Muslim and Hindu, yes, we are black and we are white and Chinese and Jewish and such These things are true, but they're not the only things that are true about us We love poetry, we are conservative in our disposition, we are gay or straight, we are, there are many things We are, properly described, a long vector of descriptors There are a lot of different things that are there And the moral challenge that we face is knowing when and how to emphasize what dimensions of our identity within a given social and political situation Race is not the only thing that's going on here It is often not the main thing that's going on here Reducing it to that black and white template, to my mind, is both intellectually and morally superficial in ways that should be critiqued And I want to add something This is the teaching moment on this What Glenn is saying, I think, is clearly, logically true Nobody has been sitting and shaking their heads at what Glenn is saying It's true, you're speaking the truth And yet, there's a way of hearing what he's saying where we think, well, I get that, but then there are other things that I want to think about too That's part of the conversation, but really also racism, racism, racism, racism So let's try it I've been getting, I'm 52, I've had bursitis in my shoulder The couch of... And then he goes on, and again, watch this Watch the whole video on your own So then, it's interesting that Peterson now gets into a specific remedy And I think this is probably one of the most important pieces of the night And it just gets dismissed because, okay, let's accept these truths Let's assume for a moment that I've benefited from my white privilege Okay, so let's assume that, that's fine Yeah, well, that's what you would say You as an individual So let's say, here, let's get precise about this, okay Was that very individual of you? Let's get precise about this, okay To what degree is my present level of attainment or achievement a consequence of my white privilege? And I don't mean sort of, I mean, do you mean 5%? Do you mean 15%? Do you mean 25%? Do you mean 75%? And what do you propose I do about it? How about a tax? How about a tax that's like specialized for me so that I can account for my damn privilege You thought that would be great shit, right? So that I can stop hearing about it Now, let's get precise about one other thing, okay We'll get precise about one other thing Precise? Yeah, precise, yes And so, if we can agree, and we have them, that the left can go too far And then Peterson will go where he usually goes in that But that point of Peterson's, I think, is a really important one About, okay, get specific, and even here, you know, Dyson, okay, let's have that conversation Okay, let's have the conversation Can the guilt be ex- I mean, this is John Brown's question, you know And Abraham Lincoln's question To what degree can communal collective guilt be washed away? Well, these are really hard things Now, a little bit earlier, McWhorter then goes into the white problem and the black problem And I think, again, this is, you know, maybe this is all just an excuse for me to play this video to you Because I know some of you won't listen to it otherwise And I think this is a vitally important conversation to watch when it comes to race John I'm not 70 I- let's establish that first I'm 52 and that's the oldest I've ever been And I share Glenn's frustrations for many of the same reasons And as we've discussed on Blogging Heads, I write about race less since about early last year than I ever have before I quietly turn down most offers I no longer speak live about race at all except when it involves Glenn, despite the money that I could make doing it And it is because of a certain stalemate in the dialogue that I see And I'm not sure that we can quite get past it And it's based on really just two things It's not complex It's actually rather simple It's two logjams that make it impossible to have an honest conversation about race in this country right now And I've decided to sit out the debate for about five years until fashions change And I don't want to make it seem like I'm talking around the fact that, as Glenn was referring to, the idea that freshmen are now given Ta-Nehisi Coates' book to read, to me, basically just stops the race debate in its tracks If it's going to be like that, then I'm not in it until some time passes This is what I mean There are two problems One is a white problem, one is a black problem I'm going to do the white one first It has become a matter of religious faith among educated white people in America to feel a sense of atonement for being racist When I say that it's religious, I don't mean that as a kind of trash talk I don't mean that as a way of getting attention I don't mean that it has become a matter of what any anthropologist who had no pre-existent biases would identify as a religious faith We don't use the word religion, but it is a faith And that is the idea that, for example, I'm going to use a phrase that we're also used to, but really break it down America needs to come to terms with racism Okay, what terms? What does that mean? Come to terms? What would the situation be if America came to those terms? Let's imagine the America that we're all about to walk back into after this seminar This is an America where America has come to terms What? Is it about something that would be written? Is it about conversations that would be had? What are the terms? One imagines a certain musical soundtrack, but that's a movie What are the terms? It has no meaning at all that America would come to terms Does it mean reparations for slavery? Because we've talked about that and nothing comes of it, and yet we keep talking about the coming to terms It means nothing What it means is that educated whites now consider it a mark of being morally advanced to acknowledge their inner racists And the idea is that at some point America will come to terms with that racism, but what are the terms? That has no meaning except as an analogy to Christian theological conceptions It's about a judgment day It's about this time when all of a sudden something happens where white people are absolved of their inner racism and then we move on And when is that? Because part of what's going on is that as long as you can keep someone in their guilt You can in fact exercise a degree of control over them And I think what has been happening in our political situation is that basically the Republicans for a long time have had abortion And abortion has been a powerful social trump card for the Republicans And you can just keep playing that abortion card over and over and over and over and over again And it doesn't matter how many Supreme Court justices have been appointed by Republican presidents It doesn't matter how many state legislatures You just keep playing that abortion card Well, now the left has their own card and this is the card Because you can play the white guilt card over and over and over and over and over and over again Because how can you be absolved of your white guilt? Because you are downstream from the genocide of the American Indian cultures and the genocide of many of those people to begin with You are downstream from the patriarchy You are downstream of the racism and the slavery And so, boy, you can just keep going with this sucker But as McWhorter says, it's a game But obviously, in terms of the lives that we're leading, walking around with our bottles of water, that has no meaning at all And so, that's not activism To be a white person and to think, I am racist, I have white privilege, I'm going to acknowledge this all the time Does nothing for the black people that Glenn was just talking about It's something that's inwardly directed It's very humane, it's well intended, but it has nothing to do with anything that Dr. King was talking about It has nothing to do with anything that the civil rights movement was about It's an inwardly turned and, frankly, idle matter I have not written about this because I think it would be mean to the people who convene Aspen But I'll say it here, that I was at Aspen in 2017 and various things were discussed at Aspen It was a very smart event All sorts of brilliance was going on at Aspen But, of course, at one point in the middle, there was this event that was about racism in the 21st century Okay, so, racism in the 21st century Now, the question would be, given all the other events, what were we going to learn at this event? What was the new thing? But there was nothing to learn I went to this thinking to myself, I shouldn't go, but I'm black and I'm at Aspen and there aren't that many black people I should go And I'm going to learn about the racism here at Aspen So, I went, the food was spectacular Now, it was run by one of my favorite black commentators I'm not going to name who she was, but I really wish they had not wasted her time doing this And there were three panelists And everybody who was black at Aspen went to it, and a lot of the white people as well This event had no substance whatsoever It was church, it was literally church And now, in a sense, Peterson and McWhorter are on the same page in terms of church That church is pointless, the church is this sort of, you know, in our context, we imagine Actually, 20 years ago in our context, okay We imagine that there's a thing called sin, and here in church we magically get rid of it But it's just this pointless drama that people are going through That's what McWhorter means No one would have used the word church, but there was this church service in the middle of Aspen So, an eminent black foundation director, who I will not name, talked about how when he was coming up in the business He would not wear casual clothes on casual Friday where he worked Because he thought that it wouldn't be good for a black person to do that, and everybody clapped That was considered very funny Then, a middle-aged, I know I'm middle-aged too, a middle-aged white man talked about how he has a coach To teach him about white privilege every week Somebody comes to his house every week and teaches him that he's privileged as a white person, and everybody clapped In other words, he has a pastor And then everybody left, and everybody talked about how wonderful this event had been Nobody learned anything That event served for white people at Aspen to atone for being racist And everybody went off and actually learned things It was a church service That is the way things are now Every third story on slate is a church service Every third story at NPR is a church service It really doesn't help anything to acknowledge that racism is something more abstract than cross-burnings on lawns is one thing To walk around thinking of it as a permanent stain that you must always atone for And never really will until America quote unquote comes to terms with racism is fiction It is something as benighted and idle as something that we might see in an unlettered tribe and find curious That is the white problem If you want to listen to the black problem, I think most of my audience is white If you want to listen to the black problem, listen to the whole video Because it's something else I wanted to play This issue of guilt Now it's interesting how we're coming back to this This issue of guilt And one of the best things that I've seen on this issue is The Strange Persistence of Guilt by Wilfred McClay And the Hedgehog review And I'll put the link to it And it's here so let's play it God might be dead The influence of religion subliminal But guilt nonetheless persists Writing in the Hedgehog review Wilfred M. McClay asks how one can account for the rise of the prestige of victims in the contemporary world Read by me, Scott Siskon for Curio.io Now what's interesting here is we have this guilt We have this white guilt We have this genocide guilt But this is only the beginning of our guilt We have environmental guilt We have, there's no end to the guilt And just like the guilt that Dyson would like to hang around Peterson's neck And then later Dyson is going to Okay, you're an angley white guy Okay, they're going to fight about that And then you come with me to a black baptist church And what? And what? Oh! And what? You know, and Peterson quite rightly says I grew up amongst indigenous people I have some understanding about privilege I have some understanding about how You know, depending on who you are But then again in other communities I grew up, I was in many black spaces in which It was not a good thing to be a white guy So I understand both sides of privilege Maybe not enough Maybe not sufficiently enough for you Who would wish to judge me Fine But the point is there's no way to get rid of this guilt And this isn't just black and white This is endemic And especially as I look at the younger generation growing up now Who's being educated by our universities Those of us living in the developed countries of the West Find ourselves in the tightening grip of a paradox One whose shape and character have so far largely eluded our understanding It is the strange persistence of guilt As a psychological force in modern life If anything, the word persistence understates the matter Guilt has not merely lingered It has grown, even metastasized Into an ever more powerful and pervasive element In the life of the contemporary West Even as the rich language formerly used to define it Has withered and faded from discourse And the means of containing its effects Let alone obtaining relief from it Have become ever more elusive This paradox has set up a condition in which the phenomenon of rising guilt Becomes both a byproduct of And an obstacle to civilizational advance The stupendous achievements of the West in improving the material conditions of human life And extending the blessings of liberty and dignity to more and more people Are in danger of being countervailed And even negated by a growing burden of guilt That poisons our social relations And hinders our efforts to live happy and harmonious lives I use the words strange persistence To suggest that the modern drama of guilt Has not followed the script that was written for it Prophets such as Friedrich Nietzsche Were confident that once the modern Western world Finally threw off the metaphysical straitjacket That had confined the possibilities of all previous generations The moral reflexes that had accompanied that framework Would disappear along with them With God dead, all would indeed be permitted Chief among the outmoded reflexes would be the experience of guilt An obvious vestige of irrational fear promulgated by oppressive, life-denying institutions Erected in the name and image of a punitive deity Indeed, Nietzsche had argued in 1887's On the Genealogy of Morality A Locus Classicus for the modern understanding of guilt That the very idea of God, or of the gods Originated hand in hand with the feeling of indebtedness The German schuld, or guilt Being the same as the word for debt, Schulden The belief in God or gods arose in primitive societies, Nietzsche speculated Out of the dread of the ancestors and a feeling of indebtedness to them This feeling of indebtedness expanded its hold In tandem with the expansion of the concept of God To the point that when the Christian God offered itself as The maximal God yet achieved It also brought about the greatest feeling of indebtedness on earth But we have now started in the reverse direction, Nietzsche exalted With the death of God, meaning God's general cultural unavailability We should expect to see a consequent decline in the consciousness of human debt With the cultural triumph of atheism at hand Such a victory could also release humanity from this whole feeling of being indebted toward its beginnings Its prima causa Atheism would mean a second innocence A regaining of Eden, with neither God nor Satan there To interfere with and otherwise corrupt the proceedings And you can hear some of this hope in the new atheists That, you know, if we get rid of Christianity We will get rid of all of this stuff that we have And then we'll be free, we'll be free Of course we'll be moral, we'll be moral and we'll do what we need to do But we'll also be free and no more of all of these crazy tribalistic Traditional restrictions Bring this over to the progressive liberationists And we'll just keep, we'll just keep liberating folks Well, really, is that where this is gonna go? This is not quite what has happened Nor does there seem to be much likelihood that it will happen in the near future Nietzsche's younger contemporary, Sigmund Freud, has proven to be the better prophet Having offered a dramatically different analysis that seems to have been more fully borne out In his book, Civilization and its Discontents Or, Das Unbehagen in der Kultur Freud declared the tenacious sense of guilt to be The most important problem in the development of civilization Indeed, he observed, the price we pay for our advance in civilization Is a loss of happiness through the heightening of the sense of guilt Such guilt was hard to identify and hard to understand though Since it so frequently dwelled on an unconscious level And could easily be mistaken for something else It often appears to us, Freud argued, as a sort of malaise or unbehagen A dissatisfaction for which people seek other explanations Whether external or internal Guilt is crafty, a trickster and chameleon Capable of disguising itself, hiding out, changing its size and appearance Even its location, all the while managing to persist and deepen This seems to me a very rich and incisive description And a useful starting place for considering a subject almost entirely neglected by historians The steadily intensifying, although not always visible, role played by guilt In determining the structure of our lives in the 20th and 21st centuries By connecting the phenomenon of rising guilt to the phenomenon of civilizational advance Freud was pointing to an unsuspected but inevitable byproduct of progress itself A problem that will only become more pronounced in the generations to come What is interesting now, think about the language of the university The professor, well, why do we call university professors professors? What are they professing? Well, go back into the history of the university The university grows out of Western Europe, out of the church The university comes to the city and you have the monastic movement And the monasteries preserve the culture and the learning and all of that Well, the university now becomes still within the church A bit more open place to train and what are the professors doing? I mean, you're coming out of medieval Europe, all of this knowledge is God's knowledge All of this science is God's science and so professors are doctors of philosophy Well, what is this philosophy? Well, it's some classicism but it's also Christianity And so now it's very interesting that professors, let's say if you read the book George Marsden's book about the secularizing of the university I don't know if I have that book here at home A hundred years ago and currently still in Calvinist schools You at university, you might, college or university, you might learn about the ways that you are guilty And how Jesus can help you with your guilt Well, here's the thing, McWhorter's right The question is, the problem is there's no Jesus And so what are you going to do with your guilt? Thanks in part to Freud's influence, we live in a therapeutic age Nothing illustrates that fact more clearly than the striking ways in which the sources of guilt's power And the nature of its would-be antidotes have changed for us Freud sought to relieve in his patients the worst mental burdens and pathologies Imposed by their oppressive and hyperactive consciences Which he renamed their super egos While deliberately refraining from rendering any judgment as to whether the guilty feelings Ordained by those punitive super egos had any moral justification In other words, he sought to release the patient from guilt's crushing hold by disarming And setting aside guilt's moral significance And redesignating it as just another psychological phenomenon Whose proper functioning could be ascertained by its efforts on one's more general well-being He sought to demoralize guilt by treating it as a strictly subjective and emotional matter Now, one of the early and best series on HBO was The Sopranos And right there, at least to the degree that The Sopranos stuck to the tension of the therapist Trying to apply therapy to a mob boss who is a ruthless killer Well, to what degree can she demoralize his guilt? Okay, you've got guilt, and so one of the things that nagged the story of The Sopranos was To what degree ought you to feel guilty? So now, we are in a very different moment than when The Sopranos aired Now we have a culture where the predominant voices of the culture are saying Guilt is good! We need you to feel guilty, you must feel guilty Okay, white America, be very, very guilty Okay, elites, be very, very guilty In a sense, Donald Trump is the new Jesus in that he gets rid of guilt He's not dying for us, but he gets rid of guilt by saying, I'm post-moral Health was the only remaining criterion for success or failure in therapy And health was a functional category, not an ontological one And the non-judgmental therapeutic worldview whose seeds Freud planted Has come into full flower in the mainstream sensibility of modern America Which in turn has profoundly affected the standing and meaning of the most venerable among our moral transactions And not merely matters of guilt Take for example the various ways in which forgiveness is now understood Forgiveness is one of the chief antidotes to the forensic stigma of guilt And as such has long been one of the golden words of our culture With particularly deep roots in the Christian tradition In which the capacity for forgiveness is seen as a central attribute to the deity itself Now this is where, if you go back to Peterson's conversations about individuals and communities So, okay, let's say I feel guilty for the way that white people have The way discrimination has hurt black people, people of color Okay, I feel guilty about it Okay, how can I be absolved of this guilt? One black person comes to me and says, Paul, you're forgiven Okay, but another one says, hey, whitey, you know, I ain't forgiven you I ain't forgiven you nothing Okay, am I forgiven? Who's to tell? If I wrong an individual and I ask for forgiveness and they say I forgive you And they continue to release me from that debt Well, then it's clear But how can this be transacted with a community? Well, in the past, God declares it What if there is no God? In the face of our shared human frailty Forgiveness expresses a kind of transcendent and unconditional regard for the humanity of the other Free of any admixture of interest or punitive anger or puffed up self-righteousness Yet forgiveness, rightly understood, can never deny the reality of justice To forgive, whether one forgives trespasses or debts Means abandoning the just claims we have against others In the name of the higher ground of love Forgiveness affirms justice even in the act of suspending it It is rare because it is so costly In the new therapeutic dispensation, however Forgiveness is all about the forgiver and his or her power and well-being We have come a long way from Shakespeare's Portia Who spoke so memorably in The Merchant of Venice about the unstrained quality of mercy Which droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven And blesses both him that gives and him that takes And an even longer way from Christ's anguished cry from the cross Forgive them, for they know not what they do And perhaps even further yet from the most basic sense of forgiveness The cancelling of a monetary debt or the pardoning of a criminal offense In either case a very conscious suspension of the entirely rightful demands of justice We still claim to think well of forgiveness But it has in fact very nearly lost its moral weight By having been translated into an act of random kindness Whose chief value lies in the sense of personal release it gives us Now, not only forgiveness, but grace Notice that grace has become kindness CS Lewis's point is that everything has become kindness We have a problem there when everything is reduced to kindness Other more weighty, powerful things we need are no longer available to us Forgiveness, proclaimed the journalist Greg Easterbrook writing in Beliefnet Is good for your health Like the similar acts of confession or apology and other transactions in the moral economy of sin and guilt Forgiveness is in danger of being debased into a kind of cheap grace A waving of standards entirely Standards without which such transactions have little or no moral significance Now often I'll hear, well why can't God just forgive without Jesus? Well that's essentially the guilt, the forgiveness that people are talking about A waving of standards Oh you... You killed all of the... You killed 95 of the indigenous people in the Americas because you didn't realize that the... The germs on your ship and in your body and the mosquitoes and all of the other things that you were carrying across the Antique and you didn't realize it Oops! Oops! That's kind of what... You know the contemporary idea of God's forgiveness is But there's a consequence to that which is exactly where he's going to go Forgiveness only makes sense in the presence of a robust conception of justice Without that, it is in real danger of being reduced to something passive and automatic and flimsy A sanctimonious way of saying that nothing really matters very much at all The therapeutic view of guilt seems to offer the guilt ridden an avenue of escape from its power By redefining guilt as the result of psychic forces that do not relate to anything morally consequential But that has not turned out to be an entirely workable solution Since it is not so easy to banish guilt merely by denying its reality And so this, again, you get into say the other conversations that we're having with atheist materialists What is the reality of guilt if there isn't another human actor? Let's say, is guilt incurred by the destruction of the large mammals of North America By the original migrants who come over the Bering Sea land bridge? Is there guilt involved? Guilt owed to whom? Do animals have rights? And if there is no God, it just happens There is another powerful factor at work too One that might be called the infinite extensibility of guilt This proceeds from a very different set of assumptions And is a surprising byproduct of modernity's proudest achievement Its ceaselessly expanding capacity to comprehend and control the physical world In a world in which the web of relationships between causes and effects yields increasingly to human understanding and manipulation And in which human agency therefore becomes ever more powerful and effective The range of our potential moral responsibility and therefore of our potential guilt also steadily expands We like to speak, romantically, of the interconnectedness of all things Failing to recognize that this same principle means that there is almost nothing for which we cannot be, in some way, held responsible This is one inevitable side effect of the growing movement to change the name of our geological epoch From the Holocene to the Anthropocene The first era in the life of the planet to be defined by the effects of the human presence and human power The first era in the life of the planet to be defined by the effects of the human presence and human power Effects such as nuclear fallout, plastic pollution, domesticated animals, and anthropogenic climate change Power entails responsibility, and responsibility leads to guilt I can see pictures of a starving child in a remote corner of the world on my television I don't do it, but I know I could Although, if I did so, I would be a well-meaning fool like Dickens' ludicrous Mrs. Jellyby Who grossly neglects her own family and neighborhood in favor of the distant philanthropy of African missions Either way, some measure of guilt would seem to be my inescapable lot as an empowered man living in an interconnected world Whatever donation I make to a charitable organization, it can never be as much as I could have given I can never diminish my carbon footprint enough, or give to the poor enough, or support medical research enough, or otherwise do the things that would render me morally blameless Colonialism, slavery, structural poverty, water pollution, deforestation There's an endless list of items for which you and I can take the rap To be found blameless is a pipe dream, for the demands on an active conscience are literally as endless as an act of imagination's ability to conjure them And as those of us who teach young people often have occasion to observe, it may be precisely the most morally perceptive and earnest individuals Who have the weakest common-sense defenses against such overwhelming assaults on their over-receptive sensibilities They cannot see a logical place to stop Indeed, when any one of us reflects on the brute fact of our being alive and taking up space on this planet Consuming resources that could have met some other, more worthy need We may be led to feel guilt about the very fact of our existence The questions involved are genuine and profound, they deserve to be asked Those who struggle most deeply with the issues of environmental justice and stewardship Are often led to wonder whether there can be any way of life that might allow one to escape being implicated in the cycles of exploitation And cruelty and privilege that mark, ineluctably, our relationship with our environment They suffer from a hypertrophied sense of guilt and desperately seek some path to an existence free of it In this, they embody a tendency of the West as a whole, expressed in an only slightly exaggerated form So excessive is this propensity toward guilt, particularly in the most highly developed nations of the Western world That the French writer Pascal Bruckner, in a courageous and brilliant recent study called The Tyranny of Guilt In French, the title is slightly different, La tyrannie de la pénitence Has identified the problem as Western masochism The lingering presence of the old notion of original sin, the ancient poison of damnation, Bruckner argues Holds even secular philosophers and sociologists captive to its logic This is the religion that McWhorter is talking about, only far larger For all its brilliance, though, Bruckner's analysis is not fully adequate The problem goes deeper than a mere question of alleged cultural masochism arising out of vestigial moral reflexes It is, after all, not merely our pathologies that dispose us in this direction The pathologies themselves have an anterior source in the very things that make us proudest Our knowledge of the world, of its causes and effects, and our consequent power to shape and alter those causes and effects The problem is perfectly expressed in T.S. Eliot's famous question After such knowledge, what forgiveness? In a world of relentlessly proliferating knowledge, there is no easy way of deciding how much guilt is enough And how much is too much Notwithstanding all claims about our living in a post-Christian world, devoid of censorious public morality We, in fact, live in a world that carries around an enormous and growing burden of guilt And yearns, sometimes even demands, to be free of it About this, Bruckner could not have been more right And that burden is always looking for an opportunity to discharge itself Indeed, it is impossible to exaggerate how many of the deeds of individual men and women Can be traced back to the powerful and inextinguishable need of human beings to feel morally justified To feel themselves to be right with the world One would be right to expect that such a powerful need, nearly as powerful as the merely physical ones Would continue to find ways to manifest itself, even if it had to do so in odd and perverse ways Which brings me to a very curious story, full of significance for these matters It comes from a New York Times op-ed column by Daniel Mendelson, published on the 9th of March 2008 And aptly titled, Stolen Suffering Mendelson, a Bard College professor who had written a book about his family's experience of the Holocaust Told of hearing the story of an orphaned Jewish girl who trekked 2,000 miles from Belgium to Ukraine Surviving the Warsaw ghetto, murdering a German officer and taking refuge in forests where she was protected by kindly wolves The story had been given wide circulation in a 1997 book, Misha, a memoir of the Holocaust years And its veracity was generally accepted But it was eventually discovered to be a complete fabrication, created by a Belgian Roman Catholic called Monique Devel Such a deception, Mendelson argued, is not an isolated event It needs to be understood in the context of a growing number of phony memoirs Such as the notorious child survivor Holocaust memoir, Fragments, or Love and Consequences The putative autobiography of a young mixed-race woman raised by a black foster mother in gang-infested Los Angeles These books were, as Mendelson said, a plagiarism of other people's trauma Written not, as their authors claimed, by members of oppressed classes The Jews during World War II, the impoverished African Americans of Los Angeles today But by members of relatively safe or privileged classes Interestingly, too, he noted that the authors seemed to have an unusual degree of identification with their subjects Indeed, a degree of identification approaching the pathological Defending Misha, Devel declared astonishingly that The story is mine, not actually reality, but my reality, my way of surviving Don't you see this? You see this all around, don't you? Because one way of dealing with the overwhelming guilt of being white is to be not white And the overwhelming guilt of having destroyed the Native Americans is to prioritize the 3% in me that is Native American Or to, in my case, say, well, I'm a person of Dutch descent No, I'm a Jew, I'm a victim Because once I'm a victim, well, this now is a way to deal with my guilt What these authors have appropriated is suffering And the identification they pursue is an identification not with certifiable heroes, but with certifiable victims It is a particular and peculiar kind of identity theft How do we account for it? What motivates it? Why would comfortable and privileged people want to identify with victims? And why would their efforts appeal to a substantial reading public? Or, to pose the question even more generally, in a way that I think goes straight to the heart of our dilemma How can one account for the rise of the extraordinary prestige of victims, as a category, in the contemporary world? I believe that the explanation can be traced back to the extraordinary weight of guilt in our time The pervasive need to find innocence through moral absolution and somehow discharge one's moral burden And the fact that the conventional means of finding that absolution, or even of keeping the range of one's responsibility for one's sins within some kind of reasonable boundaries Are no longer generally available Making a claim to the status of certified victim, or identifying with victims, however Offers itself as a substitute means by which the moral burden of sin can be shifted, and one's innocence affirmed Recognition of this substitution may operate with particular strength in certain individuals, such as Devel and her fellow hoaxing memoirists But the strangeness of the phenomenon suggests a larger shift of sensibility, which represents a change in the moral economy of sin And almost none of it has occurred consciously It is not something as simple as hypocrisy that we are seeing Instead, it is a story of people working out their salvation in fear and trembling So why all the allyship? Why all the victim appropriation that we're seeing? Why do we have a portion of a generation of people who are in a religious frenzy on the white side, as McWhorter said, to know my guilt? And then to therefore be an ally, and then to therefore jump out into the public frame and I am an ally of the victim And therefore by standing up to the man, I myself am a victim because if I am a victim, then I am not a perpetrator And this is the means I can atone for my sin, and the more angry I get with this, the less I feel guilty And this is why so often I look at the conversations going and I think, this is a white thing Why is this a white thing? Immigrants come to the nation, they aren't playing this game, not like the white folks Why are the white folks playing this game? I mean, McKay has a point In the Jewish moral world in which Christianity originated, and without which it would have been unthinkable, sin had always had to be paid for, generally by the sacrificial shedding of blood Its effects could never be ignored or willed away, which is precisely why, in the Christian context, forgiveness of sin was specifically related to Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice His vicarious payment for all human sins, procured through his death on the cross and made available freely to all who embraced him in faith Forgiveness has a stratospherically high standing in the Christian faith, but it is grounded in fundamental theological and metaphysical beliefs about the person and work of Christ Which in turn can be traced back to Jewish notions of sin and how one pays for it It makes little sense without them, forgiveness or expiation or atonement All of these concepts promising freedom from the weight of guilt are grounded in a moral transaction enacted within the universe of a moral economy of sin But in a society that retains its Judeo-Christian moral reflexes but has abandoned the corresponding metaphysics How can the moral economy of sin continue to operate properly and its transactions be effectual? Can a credible substitute means of discharging the weight of sin be found? One workable way to be at peace with oneself and feel innocent and right with the world is to identify oneself as a certifiable victim Or better yet, to identify oneself with victims This is why the Mendelssohn story is so important and so profoundly indicative, even if it deals with an extreme case It points to the way in which identification with victims and the appropriation of victim status has become an irresistible moral attraction It suggests the real possibility that claiming victim status is the sole sure means left of absolving oneself and securing one's sense of fundamental moral innocence It explains the extraordinary moral prestige of victimhood in modern America and Western society in general Why should that be so? The answer is simple With moral responsibility comes inevitable moral guilt, for reasons already explained So if one wishes to be accounted innocent, one must find a way to make the claim that one cannot be held morally responsible This is precisely what the status of victimhood accomplishes When one is a certifiable victim, one is released from a moral responsibility, since a victim is someone who is, by definition, not responsible for his condition, but can point to another who is responsible So watch Dyson in the thing What is he doing the whole time? Y'all are responsible! Well, okay, well what about you? You're a leader, supposedly a leader in that community I think you're much more a leader in the white community And it's church You're preaching, and you're preaching fundamentally guilt And this is, again, this is a preacher trick So I'm gonna guilt you, and so what you're gonna do is you're gonna give money And I'm gonna perpetually guilt you, and I'm just gonna keep guilting you because that keeps you on the hook Until you get to the point where you say nuts, and you'll walk away from the religion But victimhood, at its most potent, promises not only release from responsibility, but an ability to displace that responsibility onto others As a victim, one can project onto another person, the victimizer or oppressor, any feelings of guilt he might harbor, and in projecting that guilt, lift it from his own shoulders The result is an astonishing reversal in which the designated victimizer plays the role of the scapegoat, upon whose head the sin comes to rest, and who pays the price for it By contrast, in appropriating the status of victim, or identifying oneself with victims, the victimized can experience a profound sense of moral release, of recovered innocence It is no wonder that this has become so common a gambit in our time, so effectively does it deal with the problem of guilt, at least individually and in the short run Though at the price of social pathologies in the larger society, that will likely prove unsustainable All of this confusion and disruption to our most time-honored ways of handling the dispensing of guilt and absolution creates enormous problems, especially in our public life As we assess questions of social justice and group inequalities, which are almost impossible to address without such morally charged categories coming into play Just look at the incredible spectacle of today's college campuses, saturated as they are with ever more fractured identity politics, featuring an ever-expanding array of ever more minute grievances, with accompanying rounds of moral accusation and declarations of victimhood These phenomena are not merely a fad, and they did not come out of nowhere Similar categories also come into play powerfully when the issues in question are ones related to matters such as the historical guilt of nations, and their culpability or innocence in the international sphere Such questions are ubiquitous, as never before In the words of the political scientist Thomas U. Berger, We live in an age of apology and recrimination, and he could not be more right Guilt is everywhere around us, and its potential sources have only just begun to be plumbed, as our understanding of the buried past widens and deepens Gone is the amoral Hobbesian notion that war between nations is merely an expression of the state of nature The assignment of responsibility for causing a war, the designation of war guilt, the assessment of punishments and reparations, the identification and prosecution of war crimes, the compensation of victims, and so on All of these are thought to be an essential part of settling a war's effects justly, and are part and parcel of the moral economy of guilt as it now operates on the national and international levels The heightened moral awareness we now bring to international affairs is something new in human history, stemming from the growing social and political pluralism of Western democracies And the unprecedented influence of universalized norms of human rights and justice, supported and buttressed by a robust array of international institutions and non-governmental organizations, ranging from the International Criminal Court to Amnesty International In addition, the larger narratives through which a nation organizes and relates its history, and through which it constitutes its collective memory, are increasingly subject to monitoring and careful scrutiny by its constituent ethnic, linguistic, cultural, and other subgroups And are responsive to demands that those histories reflect the nation's past misdeeds, and express contrition for them Never has there been a keener and more widespread sense of particularized grievances at work throughout in the world, and never have such grievances been able to count on receiving such a thorough and generally sympathetic hearing from scholars and the general public Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to say that one could not begin to understand the workings of world politics today without taking into account a whole range of morally charged questions of guilt and innocence How can one fully understand the decision by Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit a million foreign migrants a year into Germany without first understanding how powerfully the burden of historical guilt weighs upon her and many other Germans? Such factors are now as much a part of historical causation and explanation as such standbys as climate, geography, access to natural resources, demographics, and socio-economic organization There is no disputing the fact, then, that history itself, particularly in the form of coming to terms with Remember McWhorter? Coming to terms with. This is the new liturgy. This is the new... this is how we, in a sense, theoretically atone, but not really The wrongs of the past and the search for historical justice is becoming an ever more salient element in national and international politics We see it in the concern over past abuses of indigenous peoples, colonized peoples, subordinated races and classes, and the like And we see it in the ways that nations relate their stories of war Far from being buried, the past has become ever more alive with moral contestation Perhaps the most impressive example of sustained collective penitence in human history has come from the government and people of Germany who have done so much to atone for the sins of Nazism But how much penitence is enough? And how long must penance be done? When can we say that the German people, who are, after all, an almost entirely different cast of characters from those who lived under the Nazis are free and clear and have paid their debt to the world and to the past and are no longer under a cloud of suspicion Who could possibly make that judgement? And will there come a day, indeed, has it already arrived, with the nation's backlash against Chancellor Merkel's immigration blunders When the Germans have had enough of the Sisyphean guilt which, as it may seem to them, they have been forced by other sinful nations to bear and begin to seek their redemption by other means Who, after all, has ever been pure and wise enough to administer such post-war justice with impartiality and detachment and impeccable moral credibility? What nation or entity at the close of World War II was sufficiently without sin to cast the decisive stone? The Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials were landmarks in the establishment of institutional entities administering and enforcing international law But they also were of questionable legality, reflecting the imposition of ad hoc ex post facto laws administered by victors whose own hands were far from entirely clean Consider the irony of Soviet judges sitting in judgement of the same kinds of crimes their own regime committed with impunity Indeed, victors who might well have been made to stand trial themselves, had the tables been turned, and the subject at hand been the bombing of civilian targets in Hiroshima and Dresden Or consider whether the infamous Article 231 in the Treaty of Versailles assigning guilt to Germany for the First World War was not, in the very attempt to impose the victor's just punishment on a defeated foe Itself an act of grave injustice, the indignity of which surely helped to precipitate the catastrophes that followed it The assignment of guilt, especially exclusive guilt, to one party or another may satisfy the most urgent claims of justice, or the desire for retribution, but may fail utterly the needs of reconciliation and reconstruction As Elisar Barkan bluntly argued in his book The Guilt of Nations Enforcing an admission of war guilt at Versailles, rather than healing, the victors instigated resentment that contributed to the rise of fascism The work of healing, like the work of the Red Cross, has a claim all its own, one that is not always compatible with the utmost pursuit of justice, although it probably cannot succeed in the complete absence of such a pursuit Nor does such an effort to isolate and assign exclusive guilt meet the needs of a more capacious historical understanding, one that understands, as Herbert Butterfield once wrote That history is a clash of wills out of which there emerges something that no man ever willed, and, he might have added, in which no party is entirely innocent So once again we find ourselves confronting the paradox of sin that cannot be adequately expiated The deeply inscribed algorithm of sin demands some kind of atonement, but for some aspects of the past, there is no imaginable way of making that transaction, without creating new sins of equivalent or greater dimension What possible atonement can there be for, say, the institution of slavery? It is no wonder that the issue of reparations for slavery surfaces periodically, and probably always will, yet it is simply beyond the power of the present or the future to atone for the sins of the past in any effective way Those of us who teach history and take seriously the moral formation of our students have to consider what the takeaway from this is likely to be Do we really want to rest easy with the idea that a proper moral education needs to involve a knowledge of our extensive individual and collective guilt? A guilt for which there is no imaginable atonement That this is not a satisfactory state of affairs would seem obvious. What to do about it, particularly in a strictly secular context, is another matter Again, the question arises whether and to what extent all of this has something to do with our living in a world that has increasingly, for the past century or so, been run according to secular premises, using a secular vocabulary operating with an imminent frame A mode of operation that requires us to be silent about, and forcibly repress, the very religious frameworks and vocabularies within which the dynamics of sin and guilt and atonement have hitherto been rendered intelligible I use the term repress here with some irony, given its Freudian provenance, but even the irreligious Freud did not envision the liberation of the human race from its religious illusions as an automatic and sufficient solution to its problems He saw nothing resembling a solution. Indeed, it could well be the case, and paradoxically so, that just at the moment when we have become more keenly aware than ever of the wages of sin in the world, and more keenly anxious to address those sins, we find ourselves least able to describe them in those now forbidden terms, let alone find moral release from their weight Andrew Del Blanco puts it quite well in his perceptive and insightful 1995 book, The Death of Satan So there are always going to be consequences attendant upon the disappearance of such words, and they may be harder to understand than they are to understand the and hard to address What ever became of sin? asked the psychiatrist Carl Menninger in his 1973 book of that title What, in the new arrangements, can accomplish the moral and transactional work that was formerly done by the now discarded concepts? If, thanks to Nietzsche, the absence of belief in God is the notional condition of modern Western culture, as Paula Fredrickson argues in her study of the history of the concept of sin, doesn't that mean that the idea of sin is finished too? Yes, it would seem to mean just that. After all, sin cannot be understood apart from a larger context of ideas. So what happens when all the ideas that upheld sin in its earlier sense have ceased to be normatively embraced? Could not the answer to Menninger's question be something like Zarathustra's famous cry, Sin is dead, and we have killed it? Sin is a transgression against God, and without God, how can there be such a thing as sin? So the theory would seem to dictate. But as Fredrickson argues, that theory fails miserably to explain the world we actually inhabit. Sin lives on, it seems, even if we decline to name it as such. We live, she says, in the web of culture, and the biblical God seems to have taken up permanent residence in Western imagination. So much so, that even nonbelievers seem to know exactly who or what it is they do not believe in. In fact, given the anger that so many nonbelievers evince toward this nonexistent God, one might be tempted to speculate whether their unconscious cry is, Lord, I do not believe. Please strengthen my belief in your nonexistence. Such was Nietzsche's genius in communicating how difficult an achievement a clean and unconditional atheism is, a conundrum that he captured not by asserting that God does not exist, but that God is dead. For the existence of the dead constitutes, for us, a presence as well as an absence. It is not so easy to wish that enduring presence away, particularly when there is the lingering sense that the presence was once something living and breathing. What makes the situation dangerous for us, as Fredrickson observes, is not only the fact that we have lost the ability to make conscious use of the concept of sin, but that we have also lost any semblance of a coherent idea of redemption, the idea that has always been required to accompany the concept of sin in the past and tame its harsh and punitive potential. The presence of vast amounts of unacknowledged sin in a culture, a culture full to the brim with its own hubristic sense of world-conquering power and agency, but lacking any effectual means of achieving redemption for all the unacknowledged sin that accompanies such power. This is surely a moral crisis in the making, a kind of moral transactional analogue to the debt crisis that threatens the world fiscal and monetary health. The rituals of scapegoating, of public humiliation and shaming, of multiplying morally impermissible utterances and sentiments and punishing them with disproportionate severity are visibly on the increase in our public life. They are not merely signs of intolerance or incivility, but of a deeper moral disorder, an unbehagam that cannot be willed away by the psychoanalytic trick of pretending that it does not exist. Where then does this analysis of our broken moral economy leave us? The progress of our scientific and technological knowledge in the West, and of the culture of mastery that has come along with it, has worked to displace the cultural centrality of Christianity and Judaism, the great historical religions of the West. But it has not been able to replace them. For all its achievements, modern science has left us with at least two overwhelmingly important, and seemingly insoluble, problems for the conduct of human life. First, modern science cannot instruct us in how to live, since it cannot provide us with the ordering ends according to which our human strivings should be oriented. In a word, it cannot tell us what we should live for, let alone what we should be willing to sacrifice for or die for. This is Peterson's point, or one of Peterson's points. And second, science cannot do anything to relieve the guilt weighing down on our souls, a weight to which it has added appreciably, precisely by rendering us able to be in control of, and therefore accountable for, more and more elements in our lives, responsibility being the fertile seedbed of guilt. That growing weight seeks opportunities for release, seeks transactional outlets, but finds no obvious or straightforward ones in the secular dispensation. Instead, more often than not, we are left to flail about, seeking some semblance of absolution in an incoherent post-Christian moral economy that has not entirely abandoned the concept of sin, but lacks the transactional power of absolution or expiation, without which no moral system can be bearable. What is to be done? One conclusion seems unavoidable. Those who have viewed the obliteration of religion, and particularly of Judeo-Christian metaphysics, as the modern age's single act of human liberation, need to reconsider their dogmatic assurance on that point. Indeed, the persistent problem of guilt may open up an entirely different basis for reconsidering the enduring claims of religion. Perhaps human progress cannot be sustained without religion, or something like it, and specifically without something very like the moral economy of sin and absolution that has hitherto been secured by the religious traditions of the West. Such an argument would have little to do with the conventional theological apologetics. Instead, it would draw from empirical realities regarding the social and psychological makeup of advanced Western societies. Such an argument would fully face the fact that, without the support of religious beliefs and institutions, one may have no choice but to accept the dismal prospect envisioned by Freud, in which the advance of human civilization brings not happiness, but a mounting tide of unassuaged guilt, ever in search of novel and ineffective, and ultimately bizarre, ways to discharge itself. There. That's the whole thing. It would smother the energies of innovation that have made the West what it is, and fatally undermine the spirited confidence needed to uphold the very possibility of progress itself. It must therefore be countered. But to be countered, it must first be understood. There, that's the whole thing. And I think, I read that after it came out, David Brooks had made a point about it in one of his columns, and then I dug down and found it and passed it around. It gets very much to the, well, here it is. So we have guilt. And the larger our power, the more guilt we experience. Well, what do we do with our guilt? We no longer have a God that we can say Christ died to bear our guilt and shame and take our guilt from us. Okay, without that Christ, what do we do? Well, what he argues is that, in fact, we do what we see happen in this debate, where, well, now we align with the victims. Now we find our righteousness by, well, if I, by my white maleness, have insufficient, have an insufficient capacity, I've got way more guilt than victimhood. Well, I can ally, and especially in the course of fighting the other, I can raise my victimhood status. And as I mentioned last time, progressive liberationism is a negative, it relies on there being a perpetrator. Because as long as there's a perpetrator, then I can be the ally, then I can derive my self-righteousness by being on, by standing with the victims and being on the right side of history. Now look at our movies and watch our dialogue and watch this played out currently. And it is, it is in fact the new gospel of self-salvation by becoming a victim. And I think it, I think it makes, I think it makes perfect sense, and I think McClay hits it well. So yeah, some of you said, oh, you like the long format for two hours? Here's another two hour one for you. I can't promise they'll all be this, but I hope this was helpful. Well, just to sum up, I think, so what role does Dyson play in this? Well, he's a preacher. But he's a preacher of a new gospel. It's progressive liberationism. And underneath this is this, this guilt, the more powerful we are, the more responsible we are, the more guilty we are for everything. Well, well, what can I do with this guilt? There's no longer a savior that can die for the world. So what I will do is become the accuser. Which is, of course, if you know any Christian theology, Satan. I will become the accuser. I will be the victim. And I will place this on you. And I will keep you in the perpetrator status. Now, again, I think in this way, Frye is right. You just keep hitting people with this. What are they going to do? Well, they're going to do what we see happening. And so Frye says, you're building Brexit. You're building Trump. And the victims say, don't blame us. We're the victims. And you have Michelle Goldberg's breathless comments about how, you know, how horrible it is to be in the United States today because Donald Trump is president. I don't buy it. I don't think she buys it because she stays. So there's our drama. Let me know what you think.
