 Hi, this is Paul and this is Rough Draft for Sunday where I run through the current version of my sermon. And this is Easter. Easter sermons are usually pretty personal. Easter sermons deal with death and deal with loss and deal with the centrality of the Christian hope. So some of this stuff, I don't know how well it'll go with the whole audience, but we're doing of course services sort of online, which at Living Stones means me doing a lot more things sort of like I already do on video on my on my personal channel. The church stuff is over on the church channel and you can find a link to the church channel below. It's always down below in the standard group of links that I put under most of my videos. So many of us had hoped we could be together for Easter and we had a council meeting Thursday night and I probably didn't appreciate until the council meeting just in terms of we're doing council meetings on Zoom and all of the council church council members are weekly phone calls to all the members of the church and people attend the church and in our and in our church community as such and just had a real sense of the loss. No families getting together, no celebrations and yeah the the sheltered home order came down on March 18. The last service at Living Stones was March 8. We closed the week before that. It's been lonely so so you know the Sunday after the 15th was we didn't have services and it's been a lonely quiet sort of a new normal and personally I probably wasn't prepared for how much I miss being together with the church on Sunday mornings as well as during the week even though I unlike some in my congregation I've got four other people living in my house my wife and three of my children so we're by no means lonely there but people I very much care for talk to on the phone maybe even a video chat but it's not the same. It's sort of like a death of the old but without all the rituals of grief. Easter's past are are just such there's something there's something special about an Easter service there's a special life to it there's a special vibrancy to it and when I look at and I don't take near enough pictures on Sunday as I should but this picture was my kids are fairly small a grade school age in this picture and I see a number of people who have since passed away and you just have a sense of time. Here's you know my oldest son playing with a another good friend of the family who was learning bass at the time and Ben who's moved up to Oregon Joe Nina still leads on worship and you can find her on the videos. Joe at the end passed away a number of years ago and the other picture here is older still and I see Nina's mother and I see Dorothy Watkins and Pat Roberts great great great people taught me so much when I was a young pastor and these old women just you know they just you know they would tell me you young kid you don't know Squaw let us teach you something about life and these women just you know just just were wonderful just were wonderful and I see many of the people some of the people in that picture who are still living dramatically changed that picture. Oh that picture is probably 20 years ago I've been at this church 22 years and then pictures here of Neil and Dottie and Jack and Joe such good friends such saints they're gone. Think about Patterson there's pictures from the 70s Patterson Easter was you know twice as many people would show up for church because you know Patterson the first ward where my father pastored you know most of the most of the folks there had you know come up from the south between the wars or after World War II and we're looking for jobs and new life in the north but they still had those southern habits so they they dress up for Easter on for Easter Sunday and kids that you wouldn't see all the rest of the year they'd show up in their Easter best and you know you'd haul out the tables and we'd have a you know we that might not that other the potluck picture might not have been Easter but it it captures the it captures the sense of Northside Chapel in the 1970s in Patterson New Jersey of you know there was a real sense that there was something special going on there and and and white folks and black folks black folks up from the south and white folks from from different areas of the country in the world who didn't know anything just learning about new people and had building new relationships and yeah Easter Easter was a crazy wild frenzied thing now we have COVID Easter and no family get-togethers no egg hunts a pandemic comes through something we didn't expect but you know why don't we expect it why are we surprised I found this video not a Christian man I don't know what kind of stuff that this guy deals in but he had spent years doing as a counselor to to hospice people I think in Ontario or someplace in Canada learned a lot about death and he said you know we think we know we're all going to die but we don't act like we know it because we don't really know it and those of you watching my online videos you think about for vacay's four P's of knowing you know if you knew that there was enough food and toilet paper would you really go and hoard things at Costco the knowledge that you have is you know Jordan Peterson said such a thin thing that the real knowledge our real knowledge is betrayed by our actions and our emotions and and and this guy talked about the fact that how many people he'd see going into that place and they'd be dying and they'd say no I didn't think it would come upon us so soon so suddenly and he's like what about living don't you understand and and and he noted that well he's talking about Canadians there but North Americans they act so surprised and offended that their human rights are violated by the intrusion of things that are beyond their control that that simply don't ask their permission for anything really this surprises us it just displays just how just how outstanding and exceptional our lives in this country really are CS Lewis noted this back in the 1940s when suddenly the Russians got the bomb and everyone was freaking out you know as as long as we had it on our side that was okay and Lewis wades in and says you know what kind of a world did you think you were living in and he's talking about you know before 1914 everything was grand but of course CS Lewis was drafted into the Great War and was wounded in the war and the right kind of wound that would mean that he you know he served out the rest of the war and in a hospital and survived the war and he makes the comment he said what what did you think nature is we at once when we have been waked when we have been waked that the important question is not whether an atomic bomb or a pandemic is going to obliterate civilization the important question is whether nature is a thing studied by the sciences is the only thing in existence because if you answer the question yes to the second question then the first question only amounts to asking whether the inevitable frustration of all human activities may be hurried on by our own action instead of coming at its natural time that is of course a question that concerns us very much even on a ship which will certainly sink sooner or later the news that the boiler might blow up now will not be heard with indifference by anyone and so a pandemic comes along and Easter services stop and no Easter egg hunts no getting together with friends and family no dressing up for church none of this and suddenly we feel like our rights are violated and Lewis says have you do you not pay attention to life in this world have we had it just so good that we have lost touch with reality a bunch of the people that I make videos about or everyone's you know well there's got to be a plan B because these people are not quite as disconnected from nature and life as as many of the rest of us there's there's climate change there's the possibility of nuclear war or there's there's the slow numb of decadence that basically keeps us busy and frenzied you know eyeballs glued to Netflix and the newspapers until suddenly death crops up and it's like me now really no I haven't had enough time no one gave me warning but you aren't even going to last that long as climate change or nuclear war in all likelihood and Lord willing for most of us this COVID-19 will spare the lot of us and then of course so please let me die in my sleep or surrounded by loved ones and that's really part of the horror here that in some of the few cases where I know people have died in my extended network the horror realization that they are separated from their loved ones and hoping that maybe there's a hospital chaplain or a nurse who will sit by their sit by their bed in their last minutes and not just have someone put the TV on we were distracted by the politics we thought that nothing could get our attention away from Donald Trump or the upcoming elections or or whatever he said now or or the Chinese or this or that did we imagine that a new leader with new guns or new tanks and would somehow make the world right last week was just Palm Sunday and Jesus rides in and oh well who knows what what who knows what Jesus will do when he comes to Jerusalem who knows what he will do well if you read the Gospels before they even headed down that way his arrest and execution was really no surprise someone who dies the death of a slave cast as the maker and master of the world the next day the one after the preparation day the chief priests and the Pharisees went to pilot sir they said we remember that while he was still alive the deceiver said that's Jesus of course after three days I will rise again so give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may come and steal the body and tell people that he has been raised from the dead this last deception will be worse than the first take a guard pilot answered go make the tomb as secure as you may as you know now so they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting a guard it seems Jesus enemies took Jesus a little more seriously than even his disciples after the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb there was a violent earthquake for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it his appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow and the guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men so Jesus in the tomb is supposed to be dead they roll away the stone but there's no indication in any of the gospel accounts that Jesus needed the stone to be rolled away he later shows up in a in a in a in a room with the door locked why would they roll away the stone why would they bother to do all of this the angel said to the women do not be afraid now what's what's interesting here what's in what's interesting here is that the guards are all lying around like dead men and the women are still alive still terrified of course do not be afraid it seems to be the most the most common admonition given by given by heavenly messengers when they show up in the Bible do not be afraid it's like well turn down the wattage the earthquake the stone the people coming from heaven yeah it's scare anyone do not be afraid for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified he is not here he has risen you don't have to go in there and shake him and wake him up and no no no no he's not here he's risen just as he said come and see the place where he laid on that's why you roll away the stone then go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee there you will see him now I have told you mission accomplished so the women hurried away from the tomb afraid yet filled with joy and ran to tell his disciples because they don't know what to think suddenly Jesus met them greetings he said they came to him clasped his feet nobody pays attention to these little details they worshiped him they're doing what they're worshiping Jesus why are they worshiping Jesus they're Jews they know not to worship a man they're worshiping Jesus you'll find that later in the Gospel of Matthew the Gospel of Matthew which which more than the other Gospels is is written so intentionally to a Jewish audience they worshiped him then Jesus said to them do not be afraid just like the angels said do not be afraid I've risen do not be afraid do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee there they will see me well the angel had already told them why does Jesus tell them show up to tell them the same thing they need to hear it from Jesus do not be afraid do not be afraid now of course this launches a world of debate about the first five minutes in a secular age the big focus is well did he or didn't he and it's an important question because as Paul notes in 1st Corinthians 15 if he didn't well it's not just a story about good feelings and Easter bunnies and coming around again obviously if you believe a lie or a hoax or a legend you're back to facing nature because it will come for you and yours it always does none of us get out of here alive denial and avoidance which is with our wealth and our entertainment our culture is so adept at offering until we are surprised and offended by the inevitable we thought somehow we would be exempt CS Lewis points out that well he says this when modern writers talk about resurrection they usually mean one particular moment the discovery of the empty tomb and the appearance of Jesus just a few yards away the story of that moment is what Christian apologists now chiefly try to support and skeptics chiefly try to impugn but this almost exclusive concentration on the first five minutes or so of the resurrection would have astonished the earliest Christian teachers and claiming to have seen the resurrection they are not necessarily claiming to have seen that just guards are laying like dead men some of them had some of them had not it had no more importance than any of the other appearances of the risen Jesus apart from the poetic and dramatic importance which the beginning of things must always have what they were claiming was that they had at one time or another met Jesus during the six or seven weeks that followed his death sometime they seem to sometimes they seem to have been alone when they did so but on one occasion 12 of them saw him together on this occasion that I read in the gospel Matthew at least two women and on another occasion about 500 of them where Matthew says and some worshiped and some doubted so st. Paul says that the majority of the 500 were still alive when he wrote the first letter of the Corinthians in about 55 AD so not a lot of time for a legend there's erection to which they bore witness was in fact not the action of rising from the dead but the state of having risen a state as they held attested by intermittent meetings during a limited period except for the special in some ways different meeting vouchsafe by st. Paul this termination of the period is important for as we shall see there is no possibility of isolating the doctrine of the resurrection from that of the ascension you'll have to wait for that teaching until ascension Sunday which will come Lord willing by Christ passed from death passing after death so as no man had passed before neither into a purely that is negatively spiritual mode of existence nor into a natural life just as we know but into a life which has as its own a new nature and we're see us Lewis talking about life in the atomic age that well if all there is is the nature you know then you know it doesn't really matter whether you're entertaining yourself and living in denial of death it comes just like a pandemic Andrew Sullivan notes in his commentary this week of all the lessons that plagues teach us surely the most valuable one is humility look around you the most advanced sophisticated and wealthy civilization ever to exist on planet earth our glorious multinational globalized technological miracle and as has now been brought to a screeching so tiny no one is known who was able to see their complex structure no one was able to see their complex structures until the last century for all our unparalleled wealth and knowledge our streets are empty our businesses for the most parts are suspended and our efficiency and technological mastery have been mocked by a speck of nature this minuscule organism that isn't even technically alive could all by itself generate a global depression unlike any since the 1930s later on and this is the truth about reality it does it really does exist whatever the postmodernists might argue it's complicated and even if it can't be ignored or forgotten in our very human discourses it will win in the end this virus is in a way a symbol of that reality of that nature it can be stymied for a while it can be suppressed and avoided it can be controlled so it doesn't overwhelm us in one fell swoop but stas the sizing the damage but it is unbeatable and it is winning this war it is always going to do as it is always going to do and only a vaccine can make a real difference but just a vaccine for this one thing I'll be another the coming months will be an unsatisfying series of starts and stops as we struggle to live with it we are not in other words fighting and winning this war we are merely negotiating the terms of our surrender to reality and there is nothing more humble humbling for humans than that and nothing more clarifying either the records represent Christ as passing after death as no man had passed before neither into a purely that is negatively spiritual mode of existence nor into a natural life such as we know but into a life that has its own new nature it represents him as withdrawing six weeks later into some different mode of existence we don't know what it says he says that he goes to prepare a place for us this presumably means that he is about to create that whole new nature which will provide the environment or conditions for his glorified humanity and in him for hours the picture is not that we expected though whether it is less or more probable and philosophical on that account is another question it is not a picture of an escape from any or every kind of nature capital M into some unconditioned and utterly transcendent life it is the picture of a new human nature and a new nature in general it is creation 2.0 that is begun in his resurrected body we must indeed believe the risen body to be extremely different from the mortal body but the existence as in a new state of anything that could in any sense be described as body at all involve some sort of spatial relation and in the whole and in the long run a whole new universe that is the picture not an unmaking but a remaking the old field of space-time matter in the senses is about to be weeded dug and sown into a new crop we may tire of that old field but God is not he goes on but entropy by its very character assures that though it may be universal truth it might be a universal rule in the nature we know it cannot be universally absolute if a man says Humpty Dumpty is falling you see at once that it is not a complete story the bit that you have been told implies both to a later chapter in which Humpty Dumpty may have reached the ground and an earlier chapter in which he is still seated on the wall a nature which is running down cannot be the whole story a clock can't run down unless it has been wound up Humpty Dumpty can't fall off a wall which has never existed if a nature which disintegrated which disintegrates order where the whole of reality where would she find any order to disintegrate thus in any view there must have been a time when the process the reverse of whose we now see we're going on a time of winding up the Christians claim is that those days are not gone forever Humpty Dumpty is going to be replaced on the wall at least in the sense that what has died is going to recover life probably in the sense that the inorganic universe is going to be reordered either Humpty Dumpty will never reach the ground being caught in midfall by the everlasting arms or else when he reaches it he will be put together again and replaced in a new and better wall admittedly science discerns no King's horses and no Kings men who can put Humpty Dumpty back together again but you would not expect her to she is based on observation and all our observations are observations of Humpty Dumpty in mid-air they do not reach either the wall above or the ground below much less the King with his horses and his men hastening towards that spot what is CS Lewis trying to say he is saying that to understand Jesus is not a denial of creation 1.0 Jesus is a glimpse into a new creation and that new creation begins with him and the old creation and the new creation are indeed not separated but at this point unfinished I think CS Lewis speaks best of this in his last of the books of the Narnia series called the last battle after the children watch a hopeless war and watch their friends lose and die Aslan steps in I see she said at last thoughtfully I see now this garden is like the stable it is far bigger inside than it is outside no that didn't start with Harry Potter or Doctor Who of course daughter of Eve said the fawn the further up and further in you go the bigger everything gets the inside is larger than the outside Lucy looked hard at the garden and saw that it was not really a garden but a whole world with its own rivers and woods and sea and mountains but they are not strange but they were not strange she knew them all now why is CS Lewis writing a book to children because in many ways we are children looking at the resurrection and we don't understand we the best we can do is like the the women at the tomb we're told don't be afraid they grab on to Jesus when they see him and he says don't be afraid and and they can't quite figure out what's going on but it slowly begins to dawn on them but it is not a making of them of their own I see she said this is still Narnia and a more real and a more beautiful and more real and more more real and more beautiful than the Narnia down below just as it was more real and more beautiful than the Narnia outside the stable door I see world within world Narnia within Narnia yes said mr. Thomas mr. Thomas we meet in the first book like an onion except that as you continue to go in and in each circle is larger than the last which of course is opposite an onion for which each one is smaller Lucy looked this way and that and soon found that the new and beautiful things that happened to her whatever she looked at however far away it might be once she had fixed her eyes steadily on it became clearer and closer notice the change in consciousness as if she were looking through a telescope she could see the whole southern desert and beyond it the great the great city of Tashban to the east sheet she could see care paraval on the edge of the sea and the very window of the room that had been once her own and far out to see she could discover the islands islands after islands to the end of the world and beyond the end the huge mountain which she had called Aslan's country but now she saw that it was a part of a great chain of mountains which ringed around the whole world in front of her it seemed to come to to it seemed to come quite close then she looked to her left and saw what she took to be a great bank of brightly covered cloud cut off from them by a gap but she looked and she she looked harder and saw that it was not a cloud at all but a real land and there she had fixed her eyes on one particular spot she at once cried out Peter Edmund come look come quickly and they came and looked for their eyes also had become like hers why Peter exclaimed it's England you're in a book about Narnia how could you see England and and and it's that house itself professor Kirk's old home in the country where all of our adventures began I thought that the house had been destroyed said Edmund so it was says the Fawn but you are now looking at England within England the real England just as this is the real Narnia and in that inner England no good thing is destroyed suddenly they shifted their eyes to another spot and then Peter and Edmund and Lucy gasped with amazement and shouted out and began waving for there they saw their father and mother waving back at them across the great deep valley it was like when you see people waving at you from the deck of a big ship when you are waiting on the quay to meet them but how can we get to them said Lucy that's easy said mr. Tumnus that country in this country all the real countries are only spurs jutting out from the great mountains of Aslan we have only to walk along the ridge upward and inward till it joins on and listen there's King Frank's horn we must all go up and soon they found themselves all walking together and a great bright procession it was up towards the mountains higher than you could see in this world even if they were there to be seen but there was no snow on these mountains there were forests and green the no snow you got remember the first book then there were forests and green slopes and sweet orchards and flashing waterfalls one above the other going up forever we look at these old pictures we see windows into past Easter's we see children who are no longer small we see friends who are no longer with us we see some of us who were young and fit and able now broken down by illness or sin or one tragedy or another and we know that in this nature 1.0 even this cove it Easter is a sign of things to come if the Lord tarries living stones will close the building will go away the place will remember it no more but communion was anticipation of a better communion the musicians just now learning their craft the food just the beginnings of a far better banquet that will come someday the uneasy relationships filled with complexity and difficulty by the things we do to each other just beginning to learn what it means to actually relate to another human being loved ones lost in creation 1.0 are remade are resurrected just like their master our celebrations our first fruits they're just tastes and windows they look miniature they look small but as we have new eyes and continue to see in them we understand that real Patterson real Sacramento the places of your youth those real things are not taken out by nature God loves them and has plans for them the kinds of plans that we ourselves are not smart enough to construct just like we're not great builders in this world the stuff we make falls apart now you might say wow but I can't believe it that's that's that's a beautiful vision it's a beautiful idea and in fact I and some of those those debates I hear I hear atheists say things like well I would get bored and well maybe the Lord is sparing you from participation in this but I believe in Easter how how how do you believe even if you want to believe how do you believe well in a land like this it involves training and many lands in the history of the world you didn't have to train much because death was always around you but in this land of of wonder and profit and amusement and endless distraction it might take a little bit more discipline you're going to have to start acting like the story is true you're going to have to start believing that there's a real Narnia and a more real Sacramento and a more real Patterson and a more real you that is partly but not entirely yours to construct just like you are not really yours to construct if you want to believe you have to begin you have to begin living into that new world and that involves knowing about your death it involves believing in the one who didn't have to die but took on our flesh and did and in the process transformed our flesh into a new creation and is leading us into where he has already trod now again you might say that's inspiring and it is if you want to believe it you're going to have to live into it
