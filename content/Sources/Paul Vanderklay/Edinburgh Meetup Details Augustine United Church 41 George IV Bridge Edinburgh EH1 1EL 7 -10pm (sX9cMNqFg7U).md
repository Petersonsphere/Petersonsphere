 Hi, this is Paul and I am going to... I've tried to say the name of this city a number of times and everybody looks at me funny. I always say, Edinburgh. But Edinburgh. Edinburgh. We will have a meet up there. We have a capacity of 25 people. It will be Friday night at... Friday night at 7pm at the Augustine United Church. 41 George IV Bridge, Edinburgh, EH1, 1EL. We've got the place from 7pm to 10pm. So if you're up in Scotland, this is my first trip to Scotland. If you're up in Scotland, come by. Say hello. Again, what I do in a random conversation is what I do here. Except I don't usually have the most time to share with me a little bit who you are and your story. And how you got here and why you're staying and why this is valuable for you. If we get enough people or maybe we'll do a little estuary protocol, we'll see. Augustine United Church, Edinburgh. Hope to see you there.
