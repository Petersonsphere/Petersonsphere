 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. This is episode number 13. We've got Phillip in this week. No, Nancy. Nancy's sick, so Nancy can't be here. We got Phillip in here. We got Freddie. Say hello to everybody, Freddie. Hey, how you guys doing out there? We got our show going on, and I hope you tune in because by the grace of God, we can do all things through Christ that's sprinkling us in Jesus' name. You got the floor, Paul. Okay, go ahead, Phillip. This is love, and I gave a magnet that fits on your refrigerator. Says Jesus, and I had an envelope. I gave it to a man, he said, I don't know you, and I said, he opened the envelope, and he saw it says Jesus. And I said, that, Jesus knows you. And he said, yeah, and then he comes back and he said, yeah, he did. He was in Vietnam, and God took care of him, while he was in Vietnam. So, okay, I'll open it. That's what happens when I give out a Jesus sign. That's cool. To people, that's cool. There's a Jesus sign. Oh, right, the new one. And I got a Bible verse from top and bottom now, a new one. So, Phil, can Sid use to perfect this Jesus sign? What do you think of this whole thing, Freddie? You think this is a good thing? I think it's awesome. Yeah, what do you like about it? I like the way you look at it. You gotta really concentrate on what it says on there, but once you see what it says on there, you have to explain yourself, and you have to make sure you're walking the Christian life, because if you're not walking the Christian life, well, then you're improving, improvement needed, and you should walk the Christian life, and you should look at the Jesus sign. And if you have Jesus, you can do all things you do Christ that strengthens you. Okay, all right. And I was on, a few years ago, I was in Denver, and the Lord spoke to me, and said I need to write, give a sign out. So I had to write it on a piece of plastic I had on the train, and the man wanted, did you just sign? I said, you give me your address, and I sent it to him. And four hours later, he was thrown off the train because he was drunk. So that was a miracle, and if I didn't live up to- The drunking part wasn't a miracle. No, but it was a miracle that I gave it to him. That's true, that's true. And it was that I had to listen to the Lord. If I did not make the sign and give it to the guy, he would never would have got it. So I got to listen to the Lord. And the sign speaks to people. Even when a person's cussing, he sees it, he will quit cussing. Okay. Okay. All right. Anything else? Pretty much size is up. Tune in next week when we'll have more to talk about. And- We got the coffee special, and we got the CS Lewis wrap. We're still looking forward to it. CS Lewis wrap next week, next Sunday. Or next Sunday, or maybe during the week, we'll see. We'll see, or whenever we can get to it. And thank you for tuning in, everybody. Catch you on the flip side. You have a wonderful day. One, come on, come on. One love. I'm getting the whole thing down now. One love. All right. Thank you very much.
