 The Freddie and Paul show this is episode 20. 20? No where is it? 21. I think it's 21. 21 okay there we go. So how's everybody been out there? How are you being Paul? I've been good. I've been good. I listened to your sermon you said that you need to walk the Christian way if you don't walk the Christian way then there'll be some flaws like I was saying before. I don't know if I said that. So we talked about what was the sermon about? What was the sermon about? The sermon was about Jesus something happened to Jesus. Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and John the Baptist said no no no I shouldn't baptize you. Yes. But Jesus says yes to fulfill all righteousness. Right because if you're baptized then you're one in the Lord and one in the strength. That you're one in the Lord and one in the Spirit that's right we're baptized into Christ's death and then we're raised with him. And then once you do that you have to walk the Christian walk. You should try you should walk the Christian walk that's absolutely right. So help me out you said something else though you said something about there's not enough people don't walk the Christian walk all the time but they should because then they'll be united as one. Well remember there's misery deliverance gratitude. Okay. So we we walk the Christian walk out of gratitude to Christ for what he did for us. Okay I understand. We don't earn our salvation. Because he died for our sins. That's right. So if we sin and we ask for forgiveness he will he is there for us to forgive us because we have we're Christians and we believe in him and he says all the believe in me walk forward to me and you shall be united as one basically. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. I don't know I'm just talking. That's true that's true that's good. I don't know. That's good. So now your raiders are out of the playoffs. But it's okay.
