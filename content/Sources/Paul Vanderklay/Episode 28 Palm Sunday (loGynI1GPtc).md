 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show this is episode 28 we have a bigger group. We got a lot going on. I talked to my boy CJ and he thinks we should email people you know to tell them we have the program and we'll get more viewers. Do you want emails? Yes. I don't know if they want emails. What's the matter with our show? Yeah but anyway I'll figure out how we'll promote it. I'm not looking to spam people. We have Nancy is in. Now Nancy look short because she's on a regular chair not a stool so don't read too much into it. And Kimmy's on today too and so we got a bunch of guests on today and I'm trying to get the camera right. Now a couple of topics we're going to talk about today is Palm Sunday. Okay so let's hear about Palm Sunday. What do you think Palm Sunday means? Everybody laughs. Why should you laugh? Well basically. Are those your notes or your mom's notes? Mom took them this time. Okay. This would love to point tongues at people. Tongues at people. What does that mean? Fingers. We're not going to point tongues at people. No fingers then. We're not going to point fingers at people by their appearance because people have a good personality and somebody that has a good personality. What if they got a bad personality? Well then you know what we do? What? We walk in love. There you go. That's good. That's good. Anything else about Palm Sunday? No. My birthday's coming up. Kimmy's birthday's coming up. Happy birthday Kimmy. She's also a little nervous because she's got a cataract surgery coming up and so if you want to pray for Kimmy, pray for Kimmy and her cataract surgery. Okay. Well it says Hosanna Palm Sunday. Model perfect better than us. Miss Hatch. Okay. And we should have gratitude. Okay go ahead. Pastor Paul was talking about a Pepsi commercial. Right here. And this lady who is actually a daughter of the other dinner that became a trans whatever. Yes that's her. How does that work? Well basically she was going to do this Pepsi commercial and she decided that she wanted people to get along so she gave a Pepsi to somebody in the audience and I don't know. No he was a cop. He gave a Pepsi to a cop. Oh. To the cop. Okay. Oh. Alright. Anyhow but what it shows is that a model like her is like a perfect person and we feel that a model is better than us. Oh we do feel that sometimes. That's why I can't be a model. No way could I be a model. Oh I can be a model. I was a model for Nike. No joke that's my mom. Yeah you're on TV. Mason's on TV. Hey you were a model for Nike. I'm on TV right now. Okay bye. Bye. In 1998. He was a model for Nike. Yes remember I took those model pictures and we went to LA with dad. Me and CJ. We were models for Nike. There we go. Freddie was a model for Nike. I got a hold on. What's happening King? One love baby. Alright so. Why are you changing all the subjects? Because he likes that. Oh. Don't you Paul. He likes moving. We gotta keep it moving. Okay Kimmy had a topic today. Your topic Kimmy was? Man made versus God made. What do you think about that? Do you have questions or comments about that? Yeah what's man made what's God made. What's man made what's God made. Well basically God made everything. So everything that man makes they make from what God makes. So Tolkien called us sub creators. God is the creator we're sub creators. We make stuff out of what he's made. And that's kind of in the story of the Garden of Eden. What's called cultural mandate is be fruitful and fulfill the earth. So take the good stuff God does and make good things from it. Sometimes we make bad things but that's man made versus God made. Basically don't judge your book by your cover. That's true too. I don't know how that's connected but that's good. And have gratitude. Have gratitude. For Jesus what he did for us. Exactly. And we need to give him the props of everything because he's the one that made us. And he's the one we should be fishers of men. Follow Jesus Christ in a good way. Treat others the way you want to be treated. Be pure, great, compassionate, trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, and just be cheerful and do the connect way. Because the connect way is the only way because Paul is the big daddy on the way. Alright. Any comments about that Nancy? Well basically yeah the fruits of the spirit is what we should be doing when he's talking about you know sometimes it's hard to do those things. It is hard to do those things. Okay. I'm going to do a rap about Palm Sunday. Okay. Freddie's going to do a rap about Palm Sunday. And then we're going to have a show. Then we're going to close the show. No. I'm going to talk about God the whole time. Okay. Here we go. Alright. Jesus washed the disciples feet. Don't you understand it's not trick or treat. God's the one in command. I love my mom because she loves Jesus Christ for sheeding my man. Good to go without a word to say. Jesus Christ died for us. He died for our sins anyway. When Easter comes he rose from the dead. And when I'm on the mic my name is Fred. One two three you know it's me. Rhyming profiling like one two three one love is what I have to say. Kimmy's sitting down and my mom says hi. I don't know how you do that. That is backwards I think. Alright we're going to close the show. We're going to do a rap. I'm dyslexic. I never know which way it goes. I just do it. Okay. Everybody ready? Amen. One love. Have a good Palm Sunday and we'll see you for Easter Sunday. And hopefully my mom. Easter is next Sunday right? Easter is next Sunday. Yes I was right. And thank you for the Bible Paul. I really appreciate it. You're welcome.
