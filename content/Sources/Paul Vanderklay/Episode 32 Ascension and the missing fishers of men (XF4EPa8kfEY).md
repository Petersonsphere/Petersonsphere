 Hey, how you doing Paul? How's everything been with you man? I'm doing good Fred. Golden State Warriors! Warriors! Come out and play! Anyways, I think they're gonna win it. It's gonna be close. It's gonna be close. It's gonna be close. Because LeBron James is good and Urban is good and Kevin Love. So that's my stuff over there, Maury don't touch it. Anyways, basically what's going on is baseball is doing good with the Giants or whatever. They're doing pretty good. And I enjoyed your sermon. I like the assumption. We talked about Superman. Hey, I have a question. You didn't mention Green Lantern. Not mention Green Lantern. He is another one who does fly. He flies too. He's pretty much abundant too. He does his own thing right? He's got a ring. He's got a special ring. And don't forget about the penguins. When Batman. Remember Batman? Oh we got someone behind us. Anyways, now we got guest stars. We got guest stars. Anyways, so what'd you... Okay, but you didn't mention Fisher's of Meadow. I didn't mention Fisher's of Meadow. Were you mad at me? Were you mad at me because I talked during church? No, I wasn't mad at you. You made an appropriate comment. I just didn't tell him appropriate. I get more out of it if I talk to you while you're preaching. I know it throws you off. It doesn't throw me off. I'm fine with it. I'm just like, you know, it's just like I like to get into it and then talk to you sometimes. Not all the time. Just once or twice. And then just do what we gotta do, you know? But we didn't say Fisher's of Men. We could have said that. But it wasn't appropriate for that time. Fisher's of Men isn't in every sermon. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. But it's like a motto. Like the cadet code. Trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious, and cheerful. That's true. But that doesn't get in any sermons either. But I know. I know. But Paul, what could I do to practice my Christian... I think I'm doing what's right. But if anybody has any insight, please contact Paul. Because we need to know what you would like to hear on the program. Like I said, I talk about athletics. We talk about the preach. So go ahead with the sermon now and let's finish. So I can understand. All I understand is if you ask God for forgiveness, he will forgive you. And if you ask for his guidance, he'll reach you with the praises of the Lord. We talked about resurrection and ascension. What is ascension? Ascension is when Jesus flew. When Jesus went to heaven, which means that Jesus reigns over the earth. But he didn't do it at this time, did he? Was it in this month? Well, actually Thursday was Ascension Day, the day we remember it. And he rose that day? No, he rose on Easter. Okay, that's what I thought. So Easter he arose, Ascension Day he reigns from heaven. Okay. And then Pentecost, which is next week. You know what happens on Pentecost? I forgot. The Holy Spirit comes. Oh, okay. The Spirit and the soul. The Holy Spirit, not the soul. Oh, you have a soul already. The Holy Spirit comes on the disciples. Okay. That's next week. Well, I just wanted to tell you I appreciate you as a pastor. Well, thank you. And I like what you do. And I guess you'll be much cooler now that you got the dome done. Oh, I gotta kick you out of that one. No, I'm not from with you, not at you. Because I really appreciate you. You're a very nice person. And you're a good pastor. And you help me in my ways. Okay, Fred. But what I would like to know is why am I such a perfectionist? Where does that come from? I think, Fred, you were born this way. Is that jeans? Is that jeans? Is that jeans? That's just my motto or something? That's just how you are. That's my personality? Everybody is given different things. That's part of what you've done. Alright, let's close the show. I appreciate it. In two weeks we'll have Forrest on and we'll talk about the sermon. Because by then they'll have everything worked out. With the audio and everything. And then we can talk about it. So Forrest preached last week and I haven't seen it yet. And it was nice. It was very good. So we want to have Forrest on to talk about his sermon. Okay, let's do it. Thank you for tuning in. One love. Amen.
