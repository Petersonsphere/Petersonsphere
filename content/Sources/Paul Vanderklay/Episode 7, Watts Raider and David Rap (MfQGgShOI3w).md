 Okay, welcome back to the Freddie and Paul show. Why don't you welcome our guest, Freddie. Hey, how's everybody doing out here? You're tuning in to the Freddie and Paul show. We do this every Sunday after church, so tune in because your opinion means a lot. And Reggie knows about NFL football because he is the chairman of the board of the football resolution. And we are going to talk today about whatever Paul has the topic about. So Paul, it's your turn to talk. Go ahead, my friend. What about me? Oh, we have Nancy Landon. I'm a guest, too. She's my mom and she's my guest and she's my relationship mother. Anyway, and go ahead, Paul. What's the next topic? Alright, Freddie, I think today we're having Reggie and Nancy in as for an intervention. Okay. Because one thing that people don't know is Reggie and Nancy are co-owners of a fantasy football team. Now how is your team doing, mother? Well, we're doing okay, but injuries are not a nice thing. Alright. Okay? Oh, by the way, the Raiders play the Broncos tonight. Really? And the Saints play the 49ers. Who's going to win, the Raiders or the Broncos? Raiders. Watch, they're going to upset them. Car is a good quarterback and we got Crabtree and we got Murray, right? Cooper. Cooper and Murray. And who's the running back? Murray. Murray, yeah, Murray. So who was your number one draft pick this year in your fantasy football team? Our number one pick this year, Jeffries. How's that worked out for you? So far, you know, just so-so, not great. They had some quarterback issues there in Chicago. He wasn't targeted a great deal, but we're looking forward to a great second half, right? How do you feel about that first round pick? Oh, it's okay. But last, this week, we had, we were winning. And you know what happens in football is in 40 seconds to the end, this guy did a touchdown. And how many points did he get with all that? And then yardage, too. He got nine points, eight for the touchdown and one for the reception, and that was enough. And that meant we lost. So you can lose, you can lose in the last second of a game. And that's kind of hard. I just want the viewers to know, though, that the Watts Raiders is probably one of the best fantasy football teams in America. We had the championship last year. Tell them again. We had the championship. We have this nice big trophy. That's right. And well, there's a story behind one of the other trophies. But a series of bad luck and maybe some bad decisions on my part have led to us being three and five at this point in the season. But we have a secret weapon. Nancy, do you want to tell the audience our secret weapon? Our secret weapon? What is it? That's a secret. We don't want to. It's a great secret. We can't tell you the secret because there might be some of our team. I just want to make sure that the relationship between the owner and the manager of the Watts Raiders is a good one, amicable, no complaints from the owner about the management? No. I mean, no. I mean, okay. You have no complaints, right? No. Okay. He hasn't used up all his waiver moves? Now, what I want to say is it's therapy for me. And I really like you for that. You give me something to look forward to this winter. Right on. Okay. Any other thoughts, Fred? Well, I just want to do a rap real quick. Okay, do a rap. I want to do a rap about David. Okay. Okay. Here we go, Paul. David is the man in command, but really though my man, Jesus is the man. One, two, three, don't you know? Good to go without a word to say because David treated others the way he wanted to be treated. On the microphone, because you know he's not defeated. He's the man in command. And when he's on the microphone, he's the number one man. But Jesus is the man in command. And that's all I got to say, Reggie, really though, man. That was a good take. Tune in next week to more interviews and more good conversations. And thank you very much, California Christian Reformed Church. One love. One life. Thank you. All right, we're good.
