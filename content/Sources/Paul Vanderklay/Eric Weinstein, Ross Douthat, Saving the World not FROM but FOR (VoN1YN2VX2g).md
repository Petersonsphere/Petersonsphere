 Hi, this is Paul. Time to talk about Eric. Eric Weinstein. I first heard about the Weinsteins after I heard about Jordan Peterson and I heard about the this term the intellectual dark web and I first I followed one on Twitter and then there is this other one I thought well haven't I follow him and then I figured out there are two of them and that they're brothers and of course resolution continued to increase I learned a bit more and more about them and of course Brett Weinstein shows up on the conversation with Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson and then there was a some interesting appearances of Brett and Eric on Dave Rubin Joe Rogan and so sort of been following these guys a little bit. Eric I think lately because of podcast has been one of the more interesting individuals of the intellectual dark web recently I just tweeted some things and on Twitter of course you get opinions of other people and somebody just was telling me how he did the whole fake Nobel Prize thing zero respect for Eric and Brett okay well I'm not I'm not there I'm I'm finding with the absence of Jordan Peterson in the space Brett and Eric are two of the more interesting people to look at and to listen to I find them more interesting than Sam Harris I find them more interesting than Ben Shapiro again the politics really isn't my angle and that's really Ben Shapiro's gig so not that interested now Eric has an interesting mission he repeatedly portrays himself as a reluctant actor on the podcast stage and his most recent conversation with Ross with Ross Dalfit is no exception to that he basically says there's there's no other way I just finished listening to that podcast for the third time and why would I listen to something like that three times because if there's something there each time I listen to it it sparks new inspiration it gives me new ideas my view of their positions is clearer and clearer and and Eric is a really smart guy now raw intelligence is one thing wisdom is another and clear about the distinction between clear as clear as you can be the difference between just intelligence and wisdom but but Eric is a phenomenally smart guy or at least he comes across that way as does his brother Brett I'm sure their IQs are way higher than mine but Eric has is on a mission and he's out to save the world but from what exactly well many of you know Eric is the I don't know his current employment situation but he's friend and and employee I presume of Peter Thiel and Peter Thiel of course made a lot of money with PayPal and dot-coms and Peter Thiel is an interesting character in his own right and when I mentioned Eric Weinstein some people say I don't listen to Eric just listen to Peter and Peter's another interesting guy to listen to and a lot of Eric's well what do we need to be saved from well stagnation in economics and corruption in science and technology universal institutional failure in the Academy in the markets in government and society and so when I read Ross Douthat's book on decadence I immediately understood a little bit better about what Eric Weinstein had been going on about sort of listening to the two and so I was very excited a couple of months ago or at the beginning of April actually after I had made a video about Eric and some of this stuff I said I really want to hear him talk to talk to Ross Douthat and sounds like the episode was already in the can by then so good on them yesterday in the Twitter verse and vino veritas and Twitter veritas Eric is interesting to follow on Twitter as 330,000 followers on Twitter that's a pretty that's a pretty big that's a pretty pretty big Twitter following I couldn't find the tweet this was following just this makes zero sense to me he tweets and then I wake up and I just can't believe this is our world none of the official stuff is trustworthy we haven't seen a real leader in ages I can't accept that there are no news desks that work there are no candidates under 70 there are no senators with relevant technical doctorates now like I said I listened to the podcast with Ross Douthat three times and so with each time I'm increasingly clear on what exactly are Eric's gripes what exactly is the target it has a lot to do with what I was talking about in the video where I revisited the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversations especially where Jordan Peterson talks to Roger Scruton because Jordan there brings out his plumber illustration about corruption and sort of woke religions suspicion that that power is all there is and Jordan Peterson likes to remind us that competence is its own citadel rather than power and I noticed that Sevilla King just did a commentary on my commentary on two years after Jordan and Sam and Brett and Doug Murray got together and so I've been doing a lot of thinking about quality you know that's what Sevilla King has been working on and competence what exactly is competence and that gets more and more interesting as you listen to Eric Eric is posturing himself as sort of a populist but Eric would be the kind of populist that one would imagine is a pretty selective populist because many populists sort of like our current president have an overlarged imagination about what common sense can produce and what Yuval Harari notes before AI came along the best thinking we could do would be our own intuitive thinking the fact that in many ways our brains are smarter than the conscious selves that are moving our lips and that's a whole nother conversation but but Eric sees corruption in the citadel he sees corruption in the places of power and he notes that as happens with all corrupt places they lock out better thinking and more competence because they don't trust others and now it's easy to get cynical listening to Eric it's very easy to get cynical listen to Eric and as they say in a little nicer way complaints are like buttholes everybody's got one but Eric has some points to make I think and these points aren't necessarily new in many ways they follow along with Jordan Peterson's complaints about institutions and corruption I of course am a Protestant and I know a lot of my Roman Catholic and Orthodox listeners are are waiting for me to convert back to a more sacramental era of the church I have no plans thus far of leaving my denomination or the church in which I was raised the denomination at which I was raised at least the church in which I was raised is across the continent in Patterson New Jersey but the points about corruption are right and what make this conversation between Eric and Ross doubt that now Ross is sort of the out one of the outliers in the New York Times opinion space because they want to bring in at least some conservatives to have conversations with in their walled garden in their citadel as Eric calls it and Ross is one of them and so Ross and Eric have a conversation and I thought now third time through it usually the difference between a good conversation and a better conversation or a lousy conversation is how many times can I listen to it and still feel that was a good use of two and a half hours and I felt that with my third time through this Eric sort of takes the Jordan Peterson plumber idea in this tweet a little further if your electrician were this incompetent he's talking about the government and the other institutions of power let's say if your electrician were this incompetent your home would have burnt to the ground if if this were your plumber you'd be flooded truly technical people can't afford this level of delusion the military can't either this is peculiar to creatures of the system and no one else and let more recent tweet there is so much pain going on so much grace and horror happening simultaneously that we cannot have simplistic people leading I mean it's great that carbon emissions are going down at one level but cheering for ah what's the point all right so Eric again for me operates in an interesting space and now he might not interest some of you and so maybe you won't probably didn't even click on the video for that matter but but one of the interesting things is that the more you get to know the thought of a person the clearer your understanding of even something as simple as a tweet and in this third of this series that Twitter laid out for me where Eric is talking about electricians and plumbers this in some ways is the common-sense dream of populism it's an it's an interesting thing the difficult thing is of course will it scale because when we're talking about something as complex as an economy or society there are worlds of complexities that none of us this gets sort of back to the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversation there are words that worlds of complexities that none of us have the time within our lifetimes to master no matter how smart we are because we don't live that long and this is in many ways where institutions step in and again this is one of the things that I've appreciated about Eric not necessarily in contrast to Jordan but Jordan is Jordan's mission was to rescue the individual from nihilism and Jordan I think was quite successful at that Eric has a very interesting relationship with institutions he sees the corruption of institutions again it's cynical to look at to listen to Eric and say well he's just upset because he's on the outside of power would he be different if he were on staff at the New York Times or whatever place he would be interested in this posture of Eric's is very interesting if you go back and listen to his conversation with Brett because basically his complaint about Brett was that Brett didn't play the institutional game as he should have and if Brett had played the institutional game then the imagined meritocracy with a sufficient resistance to corruption would have yielded Brett a Nobel Prize instead Brett did the rather countercultural thing of taking a job at a little college in the Pacific Northwest that was very religious in its own way at least according to some of the religious ideas that were popular at the time and Eric was a little upset as a big brother to his little brother Brett that Brett hadn't stewarded his career in as savvy a way as to place himself within the realms of power that's interesting comparing that to Eric talking with to Ross Douthat about the Citadel and the institutions of power and the corruption and the decadence which this podcast is full of now I think in many ways Eric and Brett are in the IDW a forking of new atheism Eric was the one of course who coined the term the intellectual dark web as an alternative sense-making group in a world that has lost its sense of sense and he's sort of on the other side from Steven Pinker who has of course been known now for writing books that says things are getting better and better greater and greater and that of course was before the pandemic and pandemics are apocalyptic in the sense that they expose they reveal and I just saw a little tweet on Twitter from an Atlantic article that said something to the effect that America is a failed state now the lack of the right we call it patriotism that isn't quite the right word the the the the abundance of critique for America has been a staple of the left obviously since the 60s it's been a staple of institutions of critical thinking such as the university for a very long time and that is fact is the as CS Lewis might say the glory of the university to be to think critically about what is and so Eric and Brett are I would say very much at the upper end in a pretty smart pool of smart people in the intellectual dark web and you know Steven Pinker saying things are getting greater and greater and sort of like the attack dog of the group of the celebrity atheist who is Sam Harris even if you might be afraid of dog spelled backwards things are getting better and better if we'd only ditch the religious BS now Eric and Brett have had a little bit they were a little less allergic than then Sam to religion that came through in the conversations with Jordan Peterson Brett in many ways was sort of in between Jordan and Sam as was Douglas Murray and Jordan Peterson is very much the Dr. Strange of the bunch he will be the one that gets involved in mysticism and and all this stuff and now of course Brett will sort of reactively complain that he's done psychedelics and he has a meditation app but I remember when I started making YouTube videos I really didn't know why rather dramatically unsuccessful pastors such as myself who's in you if you watch all my videos you know that John Sook said why doesn't your church grow and I think well I'm certainly a part of the reason my church doesn't grow I know pastors who are far more competent than I am at the pastor craft the question is always what is the craft of a pastor because pastors have job descriptions that are this wide is it building an institution is it preaching good sermons is it relating to individuals is it helping the poor is it I mean what exactly is the job of pastor well I wondered why anybody would listen to any of my videos and one of the things that I would get from people would be well you know we can find pastors out there that don't believe in God we can find pastors out there that don't believe in miracles and they're over to one side and yeah I don't you can listen to BISC Bishop Spong might agree with your political agenda if you're over on the left but why you would really go to his church I don't know then of course there are other pastors over on the other side who very much believe in God very much believe in miracles very much but these are not the kind of people that the intellectual dark web would want to be anywhere near Pentecostals and and preachers like that and that's where Jordan Peterson is sort of the doctor strange Jordan Peterson will visit Liberty University and speak at their commencement boy that's something I don't know if we'd see Eric or Brett if they would even be invited I really doubt they would speak at a commencement a convocation at Liberty University that would be something Dave Rubin shows up on unbelievable Brett showed up on unbelievable that impressed me but I always thought they're a little allergic to certain kinds of Christians and so I kind of got into that in Twitter and Caleb had I've been mentioned that I was going to have my conversation with Tom Holland and Caleb mentioned I just got jacked up for this convo make it long and beefy please cuz thanks maybe a short series of dialogues and bring in Jonathan Peugeot on for goodness sakes yeah Jonathan Peugeot I love bringing in Jonathan any any chance I can then bring in Brett and Eric Weinstein whammy I just mapped out your 2020 well Caleb you're doing pretty good in this been thinking a lot more about this Caleb writes and how Paul VanderKlaay is legitimately attempting to bring pathways into religion yes I am to traffic and evolution metaphysics politics values morals etc and if Eric Weinstein really wants to slip the disk I think a conf con I think a convo is long overdue now if Eric is sitting knocking at the clocked door of the Citadel many would imagine I'm sitting listen look knocking looking at the locked door of Eric Weinstein I'm not exactly sure a conversation between myself and Eric is appropriate at this point because of status and status is a real thing and status impedes conversations this conversation with Ross might not have worked if Ross didn't at least in some ways and against status is always context specific if Ross at least in this regime doesn't have more status than Eric Ross was just going on to a bigger fish which is Bill Marr and we won't see Eric and Bill Marr and I think that's probably right now maybe if we go way back in the day when I first started watching Bill Marr actually don't watch him much at all now but I used to watch Bill Marr's politically incorrect I really enjoyed that show on ABC until Bill Marr got a little too politically incorrect for television or at least network television and it's probably in the right place with HBO but then I said the IDW remains Christianiverse someone of sufficient status like Bishop Barron would be welcome Bishop did a conversation with Jordan but low status pastor like me probably not gonna happen and again my conversation with Jordan Peterson that was a total hack and one that I found out you know one that I only partially had a hand in but came to be whatever of course Esther jumped in even Bishop Barron might have a slightly spooky effect more than the safe rabbi like David Wulpe who of course was on the portal and then I shared with her I was following the portal long and listening to episodes and I thought said yeah I was excited to see a religious leader on the show and then I listened a few minutes oh modernism it's that kind of rabbi and Esther jumps in Wulpe has plenty of analogues in the Catholic Church too yet and in the Protestant Church as well but fortunately Barron isn't one of them Bishop Barron is a is a is a very legit guy and if you don't believe me look at all the footnotes to him in this fine little book anyway that didn't seem to bother Ruben yeah but Ruben see I'm gonna get to Ruben in a little while here but the Weinstein seemed to be curating their guests more narrowly again Bishop Barron has status and status I don't have and legitimacy I don't have I I am I am a pastor of a very small little church with a really a quite small little YouTube channel and a small little following so if you're listening to my videos all the time thank you you you probably honor me more than I deserve and then I let this one rip Eric's quirky agenda is very interesting and unnerving I always find Eric to be both sometimes it makes me think Megamind and Alex Jones had a love child and I still think that I mean Eric is a super smart guy and he's not above dabbling in conspiracy theories and so he's been getting into the Epstein business which and frankly I like that about Eric and I know when Eric used his portal to say that little brother Brett should have won the Nobel Prize a lot of people rolled their eyes and walked away but I you know people say they want authenticity that's authentic I like it and I I like the fact that as Eric says he's got F you money and I guess he's got F you status and he does his own thing to me that makes him interesting it makes him a little less scripted and then Esther says cannot unsee because I was a little jiff of Megamind doing his thing and then lo and behold a guy with actually looks at his at some time which took me by surprise what Eric says now suddenly we're like CS Lewis's commentary about pantheism what if you hear footsteps in the hall what if the line tugs back and then of course Esther runs for cover I didn't say it argue with Paul and she ducks also I like your agenda for the record stay quirky and this is just the kind of thing that status does Weinstein's are less a less do have less of an allergy to religion they see value there that comes through from both of them they offer some respect instead of constant condemnation which you get from attack dog Sam Harris they understand that right now there's a price to pay however and actually Eric gets into that a little bit in that podcast which I found refreshing you may not be taken seriously if you get a little too religious or if you say things like what Sam really wanted to back Gordon Jordan off of which was a why so allergic to that because once you open the door to a break in the imagination of the ironclad laws of physics well then suddenly lots of extra things around the table and status well he and Daniel Smettenberger man with a longer name than I have had a terrific conversation about status I thought and I played that in one of my previous videos and I thought again Eric Eric is worth listening to you got to do a little sifting with Eric just like you have to do with every other human being but Eric is worth listening to because sometimes he drops some things that I listen to and I say yeah I could not have said that better myself he really nailed that and and when Eric was talking about status he noted with Danny said you know status is not the be-and and is not the be-all and end-all and what you really want is that when you call they pick up the phone that status that status now oh let me get a drink of water now when it comes to Eric's boss Peter Thiel this gets really interesting because whereas Brett and Eric are not allergic like Sam Harris they have friends who are getting downright cozy now when I look at Peter Thiel and Dave Rubin in some ways I see the new black Republicans what I mean by that well some of you conservatives know exactly what I mean by that because for years there have been these these outliers in African-American America that have dared to be conservative Shelby Steele and guys who I think are legitimate members of the IDW Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter whose conversations I love to listen to with Peter Thiel and Dave Rubin we have two married gay men not married to each other we have two married gay men politically conservative Peter Thiel goes to the Republican National Convention last year and announces his support as a gay man for Donald Trump and they're both Christian curious and friendly I'll leave it at that I I know that for both of them and Dave Rubin shows up on unbelievable has a very interesting conversation with John Lennox and Dave was very interesting in that conversation Peter Thiel studied under René Girard and I geographically close enough and in some of my networks I know that Peter Thiel is I don't know where he stands with respect to Christianity probably someone will leave a comment if if that is part of his life that he shares publicly or not I don't know but I if you're a student of René Girard and if you've been having conversations with the people that I know he's been having conversations with then these are in some ways the new black Republicans the new gay married Republicans and yeah and so especially Peter Thiel and Eric Weinstein are very close there was another I think it was later on in that Twitter conversation when I made the point that I think the IDW is a little Christian averse a little Christian allergic and I said Eric has sort of been that way and Eric took offense at that and all right I'm very open to be corrected so my list of people that I'd love to see on the portal you can put Bishop Barron on there I'd be curious to see it I've given enough time I can probably think of someone I'd rather I have on more than Bishop Barron because everybody's sort of working their own little space and part of what's happened is that when I mentioned George Marsden's The Twilight of the American Enlightenment something that has happened in the decadence post 1970s has been the elimination of Christians from the public stage Christians as Christians Billy Graham obviously before the 70s in many ways and and really again the 70s was about the high water mark of Billy Graham Phil's Yankee Stadium and after the 70s Billy Graham's way of doing things has really declined considerably the whole story of Rick Warren and Barack Obama and then Googley Oh's disinvitation at was it Barack Obama's second because of course he pastored a church that was not friendly to gay marriage so interesting things have been going and those of you who are watching some of my work on the question of a confessional conversation with respect to the church and gay met same-sex marriage well maybe you'll understand some of the context for this now it's very interesting this whole conversation and again if you haven't listened to this episode of the portal it's not out on YouTube yet is it it is out on podcast I very much recommend it I've listened to it now three times and I might listen to it a fourth it was I probably enjoyed my third time through more than I enjoyed my first time through now it says a lot of things about me says I'm not necessarily smart enough to catch it the the first time not necessarily you know I have to do a little little bit of sleuthing and googling to to track down some of the nomenclature and to figure out what they're talking about but doubt that is a great bridge he's a serious Roman Catholic convert he's on his fourth child and if there's a way to understand what kind of Catholic someone is find out how many children they have reproduction has sort of become a Roman Catholic bona fide in our culture and if you don't believe me go digging through Rod Rear's archives and look at why he left the Roman Catholic Church I'll save you the digging he became more and more serious about the Roman Catholic faith and he went to talk to a priest because he wanted to talk to the priest about the church's official position on contraception and wanted guidance from his priest about how he and his wife could practice Roman Catholic faithful contraception and his priest rolled his eyes and said you're one of those and at that point Rod Rear headed to the Orthodox Church at least the Orthodox seemed serious about what they're doing unlike the kind of corruption that Eric is talking about in this podcast and sees all over the place Douthat has more status than Eric he gets to go on Bill Maher Douthat is within the citadel but being on the opinion team gets let out to talk to outliers like Eric who given all the things Eric is saying on his podcast well may never wind up with a seat inside the citadel but I want to pick up at about minute 140 now we're going to jump in here to a place in the conversation where where Eric is making his argument that the kind of economic and social dislocation that happened with basically the exportation of American industry to China and into the third world this was not accidental and what's interesting here is and I think this is this is part of I think what what the Weinsteins at least what Eric and Jordan Peterson have in common is again more of an Augustinian view of humanity even Ross who is should be closer to the Augustinians wants to argue that the kinds of destruction that we saw in working-class America was accidental and incidental to the gains that globalization afforded the country Eric is not willing to concede that point very quickly and and this is where you know the kind of populist that Eric is gets really interesting because he's he's sort of a guy who wants to look out for the little guy look at look at fat Frank Capra's movie meet John Doe sometime one of my favorite movies you know Eric is gonna look out for the little guy and make sure that everyone gets a fair shake now is this right wing or left wing now obviously you know concerned for the working class well if I phrase it that way it's left wing but of course Trump comes in as sort of a populist and whether or not Trump has done anything for the little guy even though Trump was able to capture the imagination of many people who felt themselves dislocated by globalization Eric sort of slides into that kind of populism here and and Ross is a little less convinced that the Titans of industry and the ec and the economists at the helm knew exactly what they were doing that we should wreck but now but but now that is said so two things right one now that is said openly in certain liberal circles and I agree that it was not said and and what it said openly was the the globalism of the left that hey all right so workers throughout the Rust Belt took a downgrade but peasants in Mexico did better this is a plus now of course Eric will jump in and say yeah but the workers in the Rust Belt did worse and you all the the plutocratic element of society you did lots and lots better too so on one hand you might try to shop it out there that American industry and American working class people got disenfranchised and and sent to the back of the bus that that oh you know your virtue signaling that that you know Mexican peasants are doing well so it's a it's an uptick in the fortunes of the global poor but don't run that moral victory lap too quickly because you all made a boatload of money from globalization that's Eric's point openly when NAFTA was passed or when China entered the WTO but now it is a commonplace I think to have immigration defended again in certain left-wing circles by versions of this kind of you know cosmopolitan we're making policy for the world argument so that case which I agree was sort of latent has been flushed into the open more in contemporary debates or people but also I think this gets back to the question of like how much do people understand the conditions of decadence right because the DeLong the the DeLong theory or the economist theory is that there will be compensation for the losers no no I think no I think it is I don't think people I think the assumption of the certainly the late Clinton era technocrats was that they would always be in charge and they were good liberal Democrats who would be willing to spend some money on redistribution I think doubt that is exactly right on that point I think and and if you don't if you don't know that look at was it Aaron Sorkin who wrote that piece to his daughters when Trump got elected that this will never happen again it's the end of history and and Clintonism will go on forever well Hillary dropped the ball and not enough were with her at least they weren't in the right states I think that that is quite real that they honestly believe that I mean I'm just I'm in a completely different place if I look at what the word deplorable means I think it's code for democratic apostate I think that if you look at the for example Appalachia had a lot of deep blue in it in terms of voting now it was generally not college-educated gun-owning Bible thumping heteronormative family structures blah blah blah blah okay yeah failing heteronormative family structures in some cases you know what all families are in danger of failing families are a marginal activity and everybody who signs up to have a family and makes it through we salute you okay I don't want to dump on Appalachia some of those that Eric's gonna be a man of the people here he's gonna be a populist but he's a populist with a really big brain and this is where sort of Eric as a merger between Megamind and Alex Jones kind of comes into view incredible family structures so my concern is is that between around 1980 and the present we went from having like a majority blue position in places to having you know north of 80 some odd percent voting for Trump and and who lost that it's the Democratic Party that started hating our Democratic base and you have to ask why and what's interesting about Eric here is that he like many on the left want to say it's all economics there's a again my congregation is very diverse politically and we're in Sacramento and so and the congregations about half African American and lots of other in between okay in the Christian Reformed Church and so there's Republicans Central Valley Republicans and black African American Democrats some of whom have or do or will or used to work in the state capital in the Democratic machine and I remember listening to one conversation between two people which was a very smart very successful African American he's not a politician he's never he's basically a staffer for a whole bunch of people deep in the aft deep within African American politics arguing with this other woman who's never been from Appalachia but she's from the Central Valley in California and there's aspects of the Central Valley in California that that sociologically mirror Appalachia and fly over country and I remember this African American man who has way more money than this white woman ever will have has IQ scores far higher than this white woman has far more successful than this white woman arguing with her that in voting for Republican she's voting against her own economic interest this woman is not about to vote for the Dems and all the reasons she will bring out these have been the reasons that have been fed her by the talking points but most people will remind you that people especially for president or political party they don't vote rationally in that sense they vote with their intuitions and the reason that parties now on both sides the Republicans have had abortion now the Dems have all the you know another sexuality issues gay marriage the reason these social issues are so held on to is because that's how people vote and the Dems lost a good bit of America not because of economic policy even when people were voting against their own best interest because people understand archetypes at a very deep intuitive level and politicians are very low resolution I remember a certain group of Christians not in California they were so impressed that George W Bush was had a relationship with Billy Graham that was a big deal for them and when he would say God bless you they felt pride if Barack Obama would say God bless you well he was just pulling the wool over their eyes and this is part of the blind spot I think we see with Eric and religion and and Eric mentioned some of these things that you'll find trotted out on the news in terms of the demographics of people but I'm amazed when people scratch their heads and say well how did the Democratic Party lose all of these white Christian people who many of whom not all many of whom loved FDR many of them who made me many of whom loved John F Kennedy even though his Roman Catholicism was forgivable how do they lose well it's not that hard to figure out really if you understand religion and why did the new atheist arise and why did they attack Christianity and again you can listen to Sam Harris you can listen to Richard Dawkins and it almost always boils down to votes we want to talk people out of their faith so that they vote with us because if they remain reliably Christian and they listen to those Christian ministers well then they will vote for the other side labor became distasteful you know it's the unwanted skunk at a garden party who invited labor right and that's the problem on the left is it was the search for identity this is my wife's point that identity is the least expensive constituency with which to replace labor identity is the least expensive constituency with which to replace labor yeah both sides have played identity deeply labor actually had economic demands and the Clinton type people didn't want to meet those demands because that was too expensive but what you're actually saying all of this discussion about immigration and financialization and trade this was the get rich quick scheme of the Davos crowd and the idea that it came with an ideology and maybe a song like we are the world blinded people to the idea that it was a pickpocket operation and that's what the genie coefficient looks like but it didn't blind people on the right they had a suspicion about we are the world they had a suspicion about the Davos crowd looks like a transfer operation I mean to your point about the decadent society that when real technology and lead growth ran out and when science became decadent the only way to grow a slice of the pie wasn't to keep your slice and watch the pie expand it was to eye somebody else's slice right I guess all again I'm basically in agreement with you so I'm just trying to sort of make an argument for the sake of I'm in agreement with you but but I think but I think that there I think you're under and to go back before they get into the next section which is also interesting a lot of people don't understand why african-americans who are the most per capita church-going group of people in America prop aid in California in 2008 when a majority of Californians voted against same-sex marriage the demographic group that supposedly tipped the scales were black women when I watched church politics this is very very interesting I watched church politics it tends to be the church on the left that keeps wanting to talk about diversity in the church institutions and diversity quotas and all of that and so they bring in Hispanics and African-americans and Koreans and Chinese and you know people from all over the world we want them in the church and when they come into the church how do they vote with respect to same-sex marriage they vote against if you want to see a case in point in this look at the Reform Church of America the reform Church of America I'm in the Christian Reformed Church return Church of America is sister denomination very close very different politics but look at the Reform Church of America reform Church of America decided the the left wing of the reform Churches of America Church of America which is very affirming kept saying we want we want more people of color we want you know we want people of color in charge well guess what they put people of color in charge and those people of color were more socially conservative and they were skeptical about same-sex marriage. So in other words, things don't always line up the way you imagine they might. Estimating the extent to which people keep multiple, people are incredibly complicated and keep multiple ideas in their head. Yes, people are incredibly complicated, keep multiple ideas in their head and manage multiple agendas, but not all agendas are weighed equally. And at the same time, right? So the Hillary Clinton who, you know, expressed her contempt for the deplorables is also a Hillary Clinton who would happily vote for a Medicaid expansion or, you know, some kind of spending program that would be... A totalistic one. Yes, yes. Oh yeah, absolutely. But you see, it's the labor shortage which allows the Appalachian former co-worker to say, I need more money or I'm walking. And without the ability to engage in what our managerial class has renamed labor shortages, that class has no power to demand. Hillary may view that it flows from her largesse and this is what should make Republicans very angry. Oh, you're going to tap some collection of wealth and redistribute it to some other people and then say that like Moses, you're the one bringing water forth from the rock when in fact it was never your water to begin with, right? That is what animates... Or you're going to conjure the money out of the air with modern monetary theory. I mean, they're different. But if you use modern monetary theory and print your way out of a problem, what you're doing is that you're using a technique called seniorage, which is equivalent to stealing into everybody's bedroom at night and shaving silver off of their dimes and quarters in order to give it to somebody else. Right. So the idea is... But if interest rates are low enough, you're only shaving a teeny tiny bit of the silver. But no, I basically agree. And I think that you see this... Look, I mean, the best thing about the Trump economy has been that arguably that Trump in effect created labor shortages, which have coincided with the first substantial increase in wages for the bottom 20% relative to the other percentiles in 10 or 15... Not 10 or 15, the years since really since the 1990s. And that I think is a signifier that the sort of post George Borjas consensus that common sense was wrong about immigration is itself wrong. But there is still this wealth of technical analysis that I'm not an economist and I'm not... Would you defer to an economist? I wouldn't defer, but you have to engage and acknowledge. Ross, they had an interesting subtext in this conversation about deferment because Eric would lean on Ross about, well, don't defer to these people. I think. Geez, I have a completely different idea, which is that I'm not... This is where I am. I'm not an economist. A company man at some level, probably. Well, it may be, right? And that's part of the issue, which is how do we make sure that the story from outside the citadel starts to make it impossible to tell... My claim would be you can't tell a trade story or an immigration story or a financialization story or a health story or any one of these stories inside the citadel the way it is currently told if there's even one strong voice saying, what have you all agreed to as a frame? It somehow requires almost universal participation in a farce. Now, these citadel stories that Eric gets into in this get very close to C.S. Lewis's inner ring. And because where I agree with Eric on some of these things is that being in the citadel shapes the people. There's a big difference being inside and outside the citadel. Now, the difficulty is that Eric seems to want to, maybe I'm wrong here, indulge in a sort of romantic idea that will break down the walls of the citadel and we can live without a citadel. Read C.S. Lewis's take on inner rings. Inner rings always form. It's a human sociological fact. And we're very conscious of where we are, whether we're in the ring or out of the ring. And one of the ways that, one of the little tricks that populism has is that when we complain about those who are in the ring, what we've done is we've just set up another ring. And with those who are in the citadel and those who are outside the citadel, we out here are the voices of those outside the citadel. And this is the moral platform upon which we denounce the evil practices of those inside. That's how the game is played, right? But these dynamics always come up. Right. But to challenge that universal participation, you do have to be capable of arguing on the terms of expertise at some level. Okay. And here's where competence comes back in. And this is where we get Jordan Peterson and Roger Scruton. And okay, well, what is competence? What is competence really? And how does it relate to these other things that scale up? Well, competence is can I get the plumbing right? Can I get the electrical right? Competence is a mastery of a technical domain. The difficulty, and again, we can go back to all of the fine work that John Vervecki has done, the difficulty is that reality is so huge and interconnected, and I'll use the word complex, not just complicated, but complex, that combinatorial explosion begins to take off. And so what we like to do is, well, we want competent people, but competence is always a function within a domain. And as domains multiply and as each domain has within it their own complexities, suddenly there is not uber competence over everything. And we can complain about the incompetence of leaders, but to be a leader over something as vast as something like the United States is a pretty challenging thing, which makes ads reason to believe why our current president likes to try to have it both ways, where on one hand he is, on one hand he'll say out in public, I'm the president, I'm in charge of everything and I can decide when states open and close, and then go off with his little phone and say liberate Minnesota. Well, which is it? That's the nature of the limitations of our competencies with multiplying domains. You can't just have voices outside the citizen that say, well, we have some instincts and a certain amount of common sense and we think your system doesn't add up. That's the voice of the populist. We have some instincts and some common sense. Now Eric wants to say, no, we have competencies, but competencies over how many domains? Because you're not going to be able to dramatically change the citadel until you can win some arguments inside it. This is the weakness of populism around the Western world. It has a lot of reasonable impulses and draws a lot of reasonable inferences, but it's not very good at running governments so far. I disagree with this. I think that the problem is that what you're calling populism is not respectful of the fact that expertise exists both inside the citadel and outside the citadel. For example, if you had an expert voice saying, I don't think stress causes ulcers, that person would be a doctor and they might have done studies, but their studies wouldn't be allowed inside of the conversation. It's a combat that you're not allowed to have. That's the definition of the citadel, but we've all had the experience of it's one thing to be a critic. I should know. I'm the pastor of a tiny little unsuccessful church. It's one thing to be a critic. It's another thing to be in charge. I guess I don't. I think even if it's the case that certain things are not allowed inside, you still want to have a doctor making that case. Soon that you have a doctor making that case. My question would be, let's imagine, for example, that you had a doctor who wanted to say something about vaccine safety or somebody who wanted to say something about climate, like that there's too much political pressure on climate science. In general, such people are viewed as dangerous to consensus. Rather than really inviting them in as full-fledged members of the discussion, say we want to hear your perspective, it's really important that if we're going to make progress on climate, we understand what the full range of expert opinion is. That doesn't happen anymore, to the extent that I'm aware of it. I really don't see... I see people... But it can happen, right? This is, of course, the heart of Eric's charge that corruption is so bad that new information is stifled. And that's, again, Jordan Peterson goes, you know, corruption is always a problem for institutions. The larger, the bigger the problem. I think that's right. This is in some ways the charge of Sam Harris against the church that he imagined exists that well, the church is out there and they're so blinded by their Iron Age book from God that they can't learn anything else. And I look around and say, I don't... From the perspective of inside the church, I find people learning all the time. But is there corruption? Absolutely. So how... What are the walls of the citadel? What are they designed to do? What do they actually... What are they able to do and what are they preventing from happening? Now, the Republican Party controls the Senate, the United States of America, and the Republican Party is, to put it mildly, a climate change skeptical party. And so when there are hearings on climate change, the Republican Party gets to invite experts. And it's a big difference whether they invite, let's say, a Judith Curry, right, who is sort of an academic who's basically in your camp, who says climate change is happening, but here are 17 things that are wrong with the consensus as we know it, versus if they invite someone who lacks credentials and expertise and can't engage in the arguments with the defenders of consensus. To take... I mean, to go back to the sort of alternative medicine example, well, to take the vaccine example, right? So the big anti-vaccine study was Andrew Wakefield's study in The Lancet that sort of launched the anti-vaccine movement. And that study, as far as I can tell, was in fact bogus. So if you have people who are defending heterodox views, who are either incapable of speaking the language of consensus, a language of expertise, or who when they do turn out to be making things up, then you're never going to win. You have to get... There has to be some... Because there are... I mean, look, the nature of the Citadel is that it is permeable to politics, right? Donald Trump can get elected president. We've demonstrated that. The Republican Party, which is not at all the party of expertise, nonetheless maintains a lot of power in Washington, D.C. And so... And permeable to politics is a very interesting observation by Douthat, because in a sense, Eric Weinstein's... Weinstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, I don't know. His resorting to a podcast is in fact a political move, because if he can get a platform sufficiently large, then he can get someone from within the Citadel, like Ross Douthat, to come on his show. That's how politics works. That extent, it seems to me that the people who are smart outside the Citadel should be sitting around saying to themselves, well, how do I get the expertise that I have into the sort of heterodox forces inside the Citadel? Which is why ultimately you want to get to a point where you are invited to testify on Capitol Hill about one of these... One of the issues where you have heterodox views and you would be invited by the Republican Party. And once again, you would be... I can't believe I wouldn't... And be dependent on the Republican Party for this, but it's true. But it's on those kind of issues. And if in fact you got invited to Capitol Hill to, as in fact, if I recall, I haven't watched it, but YouTube every now and then the algorithm feeds up Brett's appearance on Capitol Hill, if I recall. Jordan Peterson appeared at the Ontario legislature to talk about C-16. When you're standing outside the Citadel, you think, oh, if I could only get a seat at the table. And once you get a seat at the table, what you realize is that there's ring after ring after ring after ring. That was C.S. Lewis's point. That once you're in the ring, well, now the forces within the ring are bearing in on you. I think it's exactly what you said before, which is that the use of expertise as a gambit to screen out people who are interfering with a pickpocketing operation is monopolized by the left. And it's not the real left, it's sort of the kleptocratic left. There's like this kleptocratic center that arose... Now right there, this insinuation, this, well, we can dismiss this group because they are pickpockets, okay? So there's a reductionism there. And I think it's Eric indulging in these... Well, this is what begins to smell like Alex Jones land. This is what begins to smell like conspiracy theory. The things that are going on underneath are, it's all about the money. It's all about the money. Is it? Sometimes it is. Is it always? The Clintons and the idea being that the Clintons had lots of sort of weird ideology and the ideology did seem to sort of dovetail with wealth transfer. So if you look at what the Gini coefficient does under the Clintons, it's pretty interesting. So at the same time that we're supposed to be concerned about one big planet and making everybody happy and whole, it also seems like there's a lot of wealth transfer going on. And this is one of the key issues that the right, having been sensitized by the Powell memo in the early 1970s, where they were told, look, we've lost the universities. If we don't come up with an alternate constellation or archipelago of institutions, we're going to have no means of defending conservatism. So you get things like the Hudson Institute and the law and economics programs, which are very effective as a counterweight to whatever was going on in sort of this supposedly liberal consensus, which now seems to be anything but liberal. Right. But they aren't quite, I guess, I don't think they were quite effective enough. And I think in certain ways, the decision to form a sort of counter establishment created a kind of temporary intellectual ballast for conservatism. But then because it was itself a bubble, became decadent in its own way very, very quickly. And so there was sort of a 20 year period of a sort of golden age of conservative intellectual work that all happened before I was a teenager. And then it sort of became its own kind of sclerotic and internally closed system. And also the dynamics of the inner ring. These rings keep forming. Now what's interesting here is that, well, so, okay, so the universities all went, on my blog I made a, let's see where we're at, 55 will go a little bit longer. The universities, you know, well, they all went a certain way. And so the conservatives then started these institutes. But of course, what the new atheists understood was that the real institutional heft that gave conservatives their power was the church. Was the church. Because well, at least in the United States, the church has broad constitutional protections. Okay. So maybe you can go after Christian universities which are sort of hybrids in the middle. But it's the church. It's either co-opt it or destroy it. Because it's that other institutional ballast that is really the thing. Again, the new atheists understand this quite clearly. And they'll talk about it regularly. They don't really care if you go off on your own and, you know, pray to God in your house or light a candle or set up a statue or whatever it is you want to do. Flying spaghetti monor, it doesn't matter. But stay out of the polls. Stay out of the vaulting booth. Stay out of the school boards. Okay. This is, and we're going to get into this a little bit later because there's another very interesting part of this podcast that deals with that. But there's a little bit more I want to get to. And ultimately, what's true in politics is also true in academia. You're not going to overthrow the Harvards and Yales, I think, on any discernible timeline. So you have to... Again, back to George Marsden's book about the American university. And I mean, these conversations have been, if you want to see a hot religious fight, watch the religious educational institutions and the fights around those. And I think that's a way to find a way to get back inside them from the outside. And I don't know what that way is, per se, but it's not enough to say, well, we're going to have, you know, just as it was not enough to say, well, we have Hudson and AEI and Heritage and we don't need Harvard and Yale, it's also not enough to say, you know, that we have the intellectual dark web and therefore we don't need Harvard and Yale. If the intellectual dark web, whatever it might be, succeeds, it will succeed by making beachheads at these institutions. As far as I know, there's no interaction between the intellectual dark web and Harvard and Yale. I mean, in other words, I don't recall the government department saying this is an interesting movement. Let's have a speaker. Right. Right. The analogy I often give is like you have UFC and MMA and then you have the WWE is a different sort of a thing and there's a real need to keep the UFC, MMA away from the WWE because the WWE is what governs politics and that you have these staged battles that aren't actually real battles. And the key feature would be is that if you let somebody in from outside, it would completely change the nature of what's being done and what's being discussed. But sure, there's no, there's no incentive. Well, it's not completely true. There are limited incentives to let those ideas in, but those institutions too are vulnerable to various pressures, including the pressures of demographics that, you know, America's college system is about to enter into crisis because nobody had kids in the last 10 years. Well, not only that, the tuition pattern and the bulking up on administrative, I mean, the entire junkification of America's research universities is one of the most threatening parts of your decadent society. And let me just ask about it from this perspective. If we think about institutions, what do you see as being our exit strategy from decadence to the extent that we have one that preserves the institution but might... Well, this keeps going, but... Conservatives counterbalanced to Harvard. Where has Harvard been its whole career? Who founded it? These institutions have themselves continued to migrate. Now quickly everything becomes political and Eric wonders, well, why, why did the Dems lose white Christians? And so plenty of people want to jump in and say, well, this is how Dems can win back the white Christians, but certain parts of their coalition, well, these white Christians can come in, but they're going to have to make some... They're going to have to bend the knee and make some confessions and concessions about some things. Well, religion, politics, and skin, I'll add. And for a while I've been saying religion is always and politics is now, but I think what the pandemic shows is that, well, there's a deeper level of now which is skin in the game. Skin for skin, as the accuser says to God when complains that just wiping out Job's family and money was insufficient to make Job curse God and die, as his wife advocated. But skin, suddenly Gavin Newsom praises Trump in the middle of the coronavirus and Gavin Newsom praises Trump as California awaits coronavirus. Trump praises California's Gavin Newsom. Well, when they're skin in the game and when it's getting tough, well, political leaders will, elected political officials will do what you might expect them to. Now, one of the most interesting parts of this podcast comes in when Eric begins to talk about religious scientists. So, in other words, there was this boring layer that made these topics uninteresting by virtue of the fact that the boring people were at the top saying things that were very general or very... Or things that were true about 1979, right? Part of the problem with decadence is that you have this eternal return to the debates of the 1970s as though nothing has changed since. And so now there's a sense on the right that you can't just go back to 1979, that you actually have to have novelty and innovation and policy response. And that's good. That's interesting. I'm for that. Okay. And what do you see on the left? Because I'll be honest, being on the left, I just see people I don't want to talk to. Well, you're, you know... And increasingly people that don't want to talk to him. You're being gradually tugged rightward to where the interesting arguments are happening. Bullshit. No, you don't think so? No, I think you're being tugged leftward, sir. I think that you're talking about the need to innovate and you're talking about the need for progress because you're waking up... I mean, I'm going to overdo it a little bit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, overdo it. I think you're going to go back to the idea that you can't actually have a conservative movement that's conservative. Anything that just... It's like a shark that won't move forward. It's not going to work. So I think that could be. But then in that case, as you were saying earlier, maybe the right, because it still has some rootedness in traditional forms... I mean, I'm not sure it does, but let's say for the sake of argument, does. Has some rootedness in traditional forms. You've completely given up on the human past, which I think is a danger for the left, that you lose all memory in this just passing judgments on the idea that everything before 1960 was terrible. The right, therefore, as it moves left, becomes more attractive to a certain kind of future neoconservative like yourself. Right? You've got to be kidding. Maybe I'm kidding. I'm not sure how it fits together because I think there's some... We were talking about this idea, or I was talking about this idea, that the religious impulse and the scientific impulse can be fitted back together. And again, that's part of the book that I thought was fascinating. And this again goes back to videos I made a few weeks ago where I talked about going to this meetup in Southern California and essentially this person saying, what if in a sense the ceiling of our imagination is a religious ceiling and the technology and the science can't go above that imaginative ceiling set by the religion? That would take the form of some kind of conservative impulse and some kind of progressive impulse being fitted together. But how you actually do that is a very uncertain question. So that's a completely insane thing to say. Let's take a stab at it because I think it's really interesting. Here's my gambit as to why they're going to end up back together. The first problem is that science has become very decadent and very vulnerable because it now has developed this kind of fetishization of incremental steps and doing everything through an institution that has got speed bumps everywhere to make sure that all credit Now, there's the institutional speed bumps, but there's the fetishization of, and he doesn't say it here, but I think it's competence, okay? Because if you really want mastery of the details, often there's a certain range. It's not the very small and it's not the very large. It's sort of the in-between space where Newtonian mechanics works really well. Okay, so it is diffused. Nothing large seems to want to happen and that careful science is in favor and romantic science is out. That creates a huge opportunity for anyone willing to potentially play Russian roulette with their career. So if you want to swing for the fences, to use another metaphor, a little less gory, or if you've got nothing left to lose, maybe you can do something briefly at the beginning of your career if you get lucky. And who's going to take that risk? It's going to be in general people who believe in something larger than a career. And this is where, in a sense, if we swing back to his conversation with Brett, that's what Brett kind of did in his career. Brett is, now he's not a religious idealist, he's more of a, dare I say, ideological idealist in terms of the romantic ideas of what education should be and where he wanted to do his thing and where big brother Eric comes along and says, no, Brett, you're smarter than this, you're better than this, if you had played the game right, you could have climbed the ladder and won a Nobel Prize and really contributed something to the world. So again, we see within Eric some of the tensions that he has within him about institutions. On one hand, the populist in him is suspicious of institutions. On the other hand, he believes that, well, you can't really get anything done without institutions and so the corruption of the institutions is a major problem. And the group that I see that is, I didn't know that they were out there, it was very surprising, is religious scientists. Religious scientists fall into sort of two main categories. One that allow their religion to doctor their science and these people do not, I don't want to get close to them because it just makes for bad science and bad religion. There's another group that says, you know what, I will... I know what he means and I agree with that. That's one of these 80% things that I agree with that 80% but there's this other 20% and this is where we get into where I think again, Jonathan Pujol is so enormously helpful. When Jonathan Pujol notes that you have the center and you have the periphery and wisdom, the wise king allows both to be part of his kingdom. I was just, for a video that I didn't post, I was reading in Leviticus about the command to don't plow to the edge of your fields. And it's against the will of God that you plow to the edge of your fields. Why? Because you need to leave something for the margin. And actually this will come to fore very strongly in this conversation. I don't remember if I'm going to play that part of the clip or not. Played by the rules of science but my religion motivates me and informs me as to what might be possible. So I'm not going to pretend that things that are true that aren't true or the reverse. I am however going to take a stab at things that I'm curious about and if I have to pay for it with my career and my reputation, I am filled with the spirit of trying to honor something greater than myself. Those people are fascinating to me and I've met a few of them now. And they're taking big risks with their career, poking around at places where scientific consensus has formed. I mean this is very particular in biology. So roughly speaking, my own orientation is that I would say I believe in the theory of selection and I don't believe in the instantiation of the theory of selection particularly around random mutation. I believe that what happened is we had such a need to stop the Jesus smugglers, which is my terminology for people trying to bring that in, at the door. Now we finally get a definition of the Jesus smugglers. The Jesus smugglers, which gets brought up by Douglas Murray in the conversations with Peterson, I think for Eric, Jesus smugglers are people that basically use Jesus to fudge. But here Eric also recognizes that in a healthy human being and in a healthy institution, you need the fringe and you need the center. In other words, the citadel and its walls work not as a separate system from that which is not citadel, but citadel works within the system of what is citadel and what is not citadel. And I think Eric rightly notes that what you need is a healthy relationship between them to go back and forth. And what Eric notes interestingly enough here is that it's the religious scientists that actually are able to do this, which would give credence to the idea that if you don't have religion functioning healthily within the overall matrix and system, corruption will ensue because it's too tight. And if there's a problem with the Sam Harris perspective of the world, it is in fact that it is too tight. And that's what I brought out in my more recent commentary going back to the Sam Harris Jordan Peterson conversation. Because if you look at the model by which Sam offers the world in a salvific role, the model is too tight. You cannot use reason to become a parent. You begin with the rough draft that your parents offered you and you tweak it because you don't have enough time in life to learn everything there is about parenting. And you don't have enough time in life to learn everything there is about anything, which is exactly why you use institutions, because what institutions allow is for memory and projects to go on beyond the scope of what any individual life can muster on their own. The idea was let's just pretend that we actually know what the mechanisms of selection are. And so as a result, we hardened evolutionary theory into a bulwark against Jesus smugglers. And that bulwark is in fact retarding scientific progress within the field. But nobody can even have that thought because it's seen as a great achievement to make sure that no Jesus smugglers have gotten through the bulwark. And what he does there is he exactly lays out what's wrong with Sam Harris's project. That it is overwhelmingly surrounded by watchdogs that prevent Jesus smuggling in that any of the natural overhead you need to actually allow people to do things which are not rational, which is what religion points people to do all the time. And this is where doubt that comes in. The irrationality of people trying things that may kill them or may kill their family or are bad ideas. As a pastor, I see people do that all the time. Within a tradition, we might warn people, but this is also where freedom of speech comes in and individual liberty comes in. That you allow people to make bad choices so that the overall system is able to go. And again, this is where Jonathan Peugeot's observation comes in. That you don't in fact, a little bit, I don't remember if I'm going to play it for this video, but a little bit later they'll talk about Douthat and Lyme's disease and anti-vaxxers and they get into the question of, well, what are we saying when we say people should be vaccinated? Are vaccines 100% safe? No, you're not going to find that in medicine. They're mostly safe. From a public health policy perspective, this is a good idea. And so government is going to do what it can to enforce this. But in a sense, we kind of have what we see as the American approach to the pandemic right now where you're told to stay at home and certain businesses are closed and yada, yada, yada, but the police aren't out there at every corner locking things down. Lee way in there that and that that people can function and you early on you would hear Gavin Newsom make things like, well, we're not going to go out and police this thing. We want to inspire people to do the right thing. But again, this is a system that allows for a central and then a peripheral and it allows those things to operate in a healthy way. There are no gaps for God. There are no gaps for your God, sir. Right. The idea is that you may have to introduce a gap. Somebody may try to put a God there and then you may fill in that gap with science later. But the idea of potentially having a period of time where there is a God in a gap that has opened up is anathema to a particular generation of evolutionary theorists. As an example, same thing happens in cosmology, where the cosmological impulse to understand, well, where did we come from and what is this place? Maybe more animated by people who are willing to take a pay cut to study whatever they they may view as, you know, the Lord's toenail clippings or whatever it is, because it has clues about the nature of reality. Maybe somebody who doesn't believe in God is going to be less animated by that and choose a position at Goldman Sachs. That's a very optimistic perspective. I like no, I like it, obviously. I mean, let's drink. I let's let's let's let's drink to that. I mean, it's interesting. I think about this a lot in. In medicine. Yeah, this is the conversation. Because I've had Lyme disease for the last four or five years. Yep. And this is the subject of my next book after this one. So, you know, I shouldn't talk about it too much. You can have me back. But when you have Lyme disease is famously a famously controversial condition where you have sort of a formal CDC consensus that says, you know, this treatment works. And if it doesn't work for you, then you have something that we can't define as Lyme disease. Right. And so that has in turn bred and tons of experimentation around the edges, some of it among actual M.D.s who are brilliant, some of it among, you know, cranks and quacks who are exploiting people and some of it among amateurs who are, you know, chiropractors or, you know, people who were just who just got sick themselves like myself and started experimenting. And what's interesting is that you can see in that when you spend a certain amount of time in that world, you can see the reasons why official science doesn't, you know, wants to shut that down because that world really is. There are plenty of people, you know, who are quacks or more. It's not that. And believe you me, as a man who lives in the religious world, yeah, there's plenty of pastors I wouldn't want as my pastors. And there's plenty of biblical interpretations that I don't look at. But if you're going to paint a broad brush and push it all away, well, there'll be no margins. There's no gaps for your God, sir. It's less that they're quacks. It's more that they'll believe anything, right? Like they'll give you an herb one day that has, you know, a few studies behind it for its efficacy. And they'll tell you about chemtrails the next. And maybe chemtrails are real. I don't want to judge too much. But my sense is that, you know, or they I'm I've done a lot of reading on the vaccine literature and I think the anti-vaxxers are wrong. The evidence for the sort of strong anti-vaxx position is bad and that kids parents should vaccinate their kids. And the world of sort of, you know, medical experimentation and weird stuff is filled with anti-vaxxers. But I also, you know, you also gain when you have a weird chronic condition, a certain sympathy for, you know, people who end up in those kind of weird anti-establishment position. The establishment weirdly breeds the some amount of nuttiness in the other community. For example, if I say you should definitely vaccinate your children, vaccines are remarkably safe. That's very different than my saying you must vaccinate your children. Vaccines are 100% safe. This is settled science. There's this extra little move that I sometimes see in the establishment, which is to try to say, again, there will be no gaps. There will be no place for you to make your argument. There will be no everything will be center. There will be no periphery. I've studied vaccines. Vaccines are safe. Full stop period. The end. Well, the trick with vaccines is that the there's a view in between. I think the view of the establishment is really vaccines are not 100% safe, but nonetheless, you must vaccinate your kids. Society must you must take the very slight risk of side effects for the sake of herd immunity. But people don't want to say that because they acknowledge that. That's what I'm trying to say, which is that when I speak about climate or when I speak about vaccines or when I speak about trade or when I speak about financial risk or when I speak about adjustments to free speech or the evolutionary the molecular basis of evolutionary theory in all of these, a lot of that's a lot of subject. But there was a reason I just did that, because if I spoke only about vaccines, there's a group of people who are poised. Right. They're going to pounce the instance you say anything about vaccines. Either the group. How dare you support people who wish to tell us what we must inject into our own children versus how dare you erode the confidence that our medical experts know exactly what they're doing and asking for 100% coverage. And so in that story, if I didn't say here are 10 different examples or whatever it is, it's the same. It's the same situation over and over again. No gaps is how we work is how one group wishes to fight the cranks and the nutters. And as a rule, no gaps is how one group wishes to fight the cranks and the nutters. And that's exactly right. And that's exactly how the Jesus smuggling is attempted to be prevented. In other words, if you start with the Jesus smuggling over here and you get over here, you find it's the same dynamic, which is why the religious scientists are the ones that suddenly make Eric very interested, because you need a bigger field of view. To see a bigger world. So they become cranky and nutty themselves. It's one impulse, the impulse to say all gaps must be plugged. There can be no cavities. We must have a filling in every single location. That thing is completely deranging us because in the Internet age, all it takes is one or two smart people who, you know, for whatever spectrumy reasons, don't want to go along with that. And they say, look, you know, what about the following things? And then the person next move is, well, that's a small effect. And please don't drag that in in the public sphere. That's a you know, if you want to settle that in the seminar room, then the next counter move to that is, oh, I didn't understand. There's an esoteric and there's an exoteric perspective and you want me to lie to the public and keep the truth for the experts. We've changed. And I think this has to do again with your decadent society. The phone rewrote the rules where now you can't hold a private expert discussion about these things different from the public, meaning the cell phone discussion, because somebody is going to connect the two. Now, what's interesting here is that, OK, so God of the gaps, the idea of God of the gaps is that, well, here's the fudgy part of the equation that we can't we don't have enough knowledge for. So we take God and we fill it in. That's a post-deistic strategy. And if you understand what I've been saying about God number one and God number two. The reason God is in that gap is not because God is inserted in the gap and God is that small. It's because God is behind the whole thing. And the only reason you see God here is because God was behind the whole thing. God number one. OK, and that is the change of perspective that deism happened, that deism brought to the world, that God was reduced. Oh, God is this little thing that we fill in here to fix the equation and fix the story. Whereas the ancient perspective is no God is everywhere. And this is the portion that we can see him because he isn't covered up by these operations that we understood before. Now, let's get back to Krabby complaining Eric, where he's he's just fit to be tied. He's expressing himself on Twitter. He's out there complaining. And because government isn't right, wakes up and and there's no news desk that works. There's no government that works. Nobody has competency sufficient for this large world. But here's the question. Where is the yardstick? What vision of the good against which are we falling short that is motivating the outreach? Where can you find the yardstick? You need a sense making requires a compass rose. Now, it's been interesting because we've had the Brett and Heather Brett, Eric's brother, Heather, hiring, hiring, hiring. I don't remember. There's an R in there or not. They've been what do you do when your academic career got knifed? And how do you pass the pandemic? Well, you recruit your kid and you have a nice little in-home studio and you have your dark horse podcast. And again, now, suddenly, if you listen enough, Eric, you really realize, oh, Eric and Brett, these are brothers and dark horse. Brett continues to sort of do what, you know, kind of annoys Eric. He's out there on their own. And now they're both sort of locked out of the citadel and and are going to be the be the Robin Hoods in Nottingham Forest and and write ROMs from outside the positions of power. But but we are obsessed with the natural. And now these are biologists. And because we imagine that the natural gives us keys to life. But this goes back to my continual complaint about Brett's posture that we're assassin robots. But how does the assassin, the programmed assassin robot reprogram itself? Where does that extra learning come in? What is the us involved in this? But but here's the thing. Natural can't tell us what life is, what life wants, what life points to, what life is a sacrament of. Because in the same way that Eric is looking around saying, we deserve a better government. OK, well, so let's say that our government has been less competent, perhaps than the government of Germany or the government of South Korea in fighting the pandemic. And so we can compare ourselves to those governments and say here we're doing better. All right. But the difficulty that we have, and I talked about this in my previous big Eric Weinstein video was the question of where do we know the good? And I read from a chapter in GK Chesterton's Heretics. And that's the same question that dogs us now. And this is the same reason why it's so interesting that Brett and Eric continue to sort of step all the way around this religious stuff instead of daring to just say religion is the place where. We look at not just how life works, not just how competency is functioning, but we get into the question of what Sevilla King has been knocking on the door of quality, not just of better, but the good. That life, they both have an indication or an inkling that life is a sacrament of something bigger and greater. And religion is the area of human inquiry that attempts to answer those questions. And you won't get at it from plumbing or electrical work or biology. Biology in that sense is analogous to the technique of plumbing or electrical work, but it can't tell you what the good is. Now, one of the things that I've been, of course, I've read a lot more Lewis than Chesterton, and I've been remedying that slowly. One of the things that always sort of stuck in my mind was C.S. Lewis noting that, well, Chesterton had done all the apologetic work and I thought, well, there's orthodoxy, there's the everlasting man, but Chesterton is an interesting thing. I haven't read as much Chesterton as Lewis. And Lewis considered that it was Chesterton that did a lot of the heavy lifting for Lewis, but I kind of wondered when and how. And so reading a little bit more Chesterton, I'm starting to find it. Now, one of the things that you'll notice right away is that Chesterton became an ardent Roman Catholic apologist, whereas Lewis remained a proponent of mere Christianity. And I thought, as I was thinking through some of these questions this morning, and then thought about this in the context of Eric's quest, Eric's quest for competence, but not just competence in a small space, but actually getting the center and the periphery right, and getting not just competence in terms of the technical, but competence in terms of the big picture, the good, the thing that both Eric and Brett, the video I did on this was Eric and Brett and the end of history, because again, they're both longing for it in their work. And that brings me to the conclusion of G.K. Chesterton's book, The Everlasting Man. Chesterton wants to give a big picture here, and so he begins the conclusion talking about one of his favorite conversation partners, Mr. H.G. Wells, that in some ways typifies the modernist perspective on the world, deism now with God, post-Darwin unnecessary. Chesterton tries to pull back to gain perspective. In the land lit by that neighboring star whose blaze is the broad daylight, there are many and very various things motionless and moving. There moves among them a race that is in its relation to others a race of gods. The fact is not lessened, but emphasized because it can behave like a race of demons, and both Brett and Eric see this. Its distinction is not an individual illusion, like one bird plumbing itself on its own plumes. It is a solid and a many-sided thing. It is demonstrated in the very speculations that have led to its being denied, that men, the gods of this lower world, are linked with in various ways it's true. But it's another aspect of the same truth, that they grow as the grass grows and walk as the beasts walk, is a secondary necessity that sharpens the primary distinction. It is like saying that a magician must, after all, have the appearance of a man, or that even the fairies could not dance without feet. It has lately been the fashion to focus the mind entirely on these mild and subordinate resemblances and to forget the main fact altogether. It is customary to insist that man resembles other creatures, yes, and that very resemblance he alone can see. The fish does not trace the fishbone pattern in the fowls of the air, or the elephant and the emu compare skeletons, even in the sense in which man is at one with the universe, it is as an utterly lonely universality. The very sense that he is united with all things is enough to sunder him from all. And now again this is Chesterton at his brilliance. He makes the point here that, perhaps more eloquently than I ever have, that by studying our biology you're not going to get the sense of what our biology should look like, only what it does look like. And if we go back to the the two visions of the scientific vision, where Odin takes out one eye so that he can gain power over the world, or the manifest image where we have to include the ought and the can be. And of course every time Eric gets cranky and goes on Twitter and gripes about the citadel and those outside that, why won't those inside listen to those outside? That longing for a better world exerts itself and you have to ask Eric, from whence comes the vision of this better world? It's not just this is a little better than that, it's going in a direction. And again look at the video I made of Eric's conversations with Daniel Smaktenberger. Looking around him by this unique light, as lonely as the literal flame that he alone has kindled, this demigod or demon of the visible world makes that world visible. He sees around him a world of a certain style or type, it seems to proceed by certain rules or at least repetitions. He sees a green architecture that builds itself without visible hands, which builds itself into a very exact plan or pattern, like a design already drawn in the air by an invisible finger. It is not, as is now vaguely suggested, a vague thing. It is not a growth or a groping of blind life. Each seeks an end, just like Eric seeks an end. Eric, I would argue, is seeking the city of God, which is exactly what Jordan was seeking at the top of that hill where you have to carry that heavy cross. Each seeks an end, a glorious and radiant end, even for every daisy or dandelion we see in looking across the level of a common field. In the very shape of things there is more than green growth, there is a finality of the flower. It is a world of crowns. This impression, whether or no it can be an illusion, has so profoundly influenced this race of thinkers and masters of the material world that the vast majority have been moved to take a certain view of that world. They have concluded, rightly or wrongly, that the world had a plan as the tree seemed to have a plan, and an end and crown like the flower. In other words, when Eric looks out over society and sees decadence and looks at the interdynamic between the citadel and the outside of the citadel and says, it can be better, there's something in his heart that says, not just a little better, but even more better. Because on the scheme of things, maybe we haven't handled the pandemic like Germany or South Korea, but we've handled it better than Russia or Iran, or we'll see some countries in Africa as they have to deal with it. But there's something within Eric that is longing for this final good, this good thing, and a good thing that allows boundaries and fringe areas in his world. But so long as the race of thinkers was able to think, it was obvious that the admission to this idea of a plan brought with it another thought more thrilling and even terrible. There was someone else, some strange and unseen being, who had designed these things, if indeed they were designed. One of the things that I've noticed as I've been working this thing for the last two years is, where are the lines between the secular and the religious? And it really, in many ways, has come down to two dynamics. One is God of the Hebrews versus the meta-divine realm. Is the universe at heart personal or impersonal? And the second is, are there, or do we afford, or do we allow in our system, consciousnesses that are non-human and above ourselves? Now there are many that we can point to that are superhuman and that they are intersubjective and derivable by people, and there are principalities and powers of the like. But it was from Eric that I really got the language of putting this, putting the secular mind set down and really the secular anxiety and fear down. It is better if there is no God, because if there is a God, you have to worry about what's on his mind. And that's exactly Chesterton's point. And I'll read the sentence again. They have concluded, rightly or wrongly, that the world had a plan as a tree seems to have a plan, and an end, a telos, and a crown like a flower. But so long as the race of thinkers was able to think it was obvious that the admission of this idea of a plan brought with it another thought more thrilling and even terrible, that there was someone else, some strange and unseen being, who had designed these things if indeed they are designed. There was a stranger who was also a a mysterious benefactor who had been before them and had built up the woods and hills for their coming and had kindled the sunrise against their rising as a servant kindles a fire. Now this idea of a mind that gives a meaning to the universe has received more and more confirmation within the minds of men by meditations and experiences much more subtle and searching than any such argument about the external plan of the world. But I am concerned here with the keeping the story in its most simple and even concrete terms. And it is enough to say that here that most men, including the wisest men, have come to the conclusion that the world has such a final purpose and therefore such a first cause. That in fact when, as Eric points out, and I agree when the masters of economic industry decide that we will advantage the Mexican peasants at the expense of the American working class and make a whole lot of money in the process, maybe someone can look at that and say, maybe that's not the way the world should be. We all have this idea of the way the world should be and that longs in our heart. And one of the things I appreciate about Eric and Brett is that in many ways that romantic vision that Eric talked about that he sees in religious scientists where Brother Brett will take a job at a small struggling school instead of climbing the corrupt institutional ladder where he might receive the recognition of a Nobel Prize. We find that praiseworthy and I find that praiseworthy not in spite of my religious upbringing but because of it. Because that very idea has been what religion has always been about, that there is another level, that there is another platform, that there is another world of which this world is a sacrament. You will find that argument at the beginning of C.S. Lewis's mere Christianity, that somehow part of us knows that people ought not to die and people ought not to starve and human beings ought not to be treated the way we've always seen human beings treated. Back to the text. But most men in some sense separated themselves from the wisest men when it came to the treatment of that idea. There came into existence two ways of treating that idea which between them made up most of the religious of the world. The majority, like the minority, had this strong sense of a second meaning in things, of a strange master who knew the secret of the world. But the majority, the mob or mass of men, naturally tended to treat it rather in the spirit of gossip. The gossip, like all gossip, contains a great deal of truth and falsehood. The world began to tell itself tales about the unknown beings or his sons or servants or messengers. Some of the tales may truly be called old wives tales, as professing only to be very remote memories of the mourning of the world. Myths about the baby moon or the half-baked mountains. Some of them might more truly be called travelers tales, as being curious but contemporary tales brought from certain borderlands of experience, such as miraculous cures of those that bring whispers of what has happened to the dead. Many of them are probably true tales. Enough of them are probably true to keep a person of real common sense more or less conscious that there really is something rather marvelous behind the cosmic curtain. But in a sense, it is only going by appearances, even if the appearances are called apparitions. It is a matter of appearances and disappearances. At the most, these gods are ghosts, that is, they are glimpses. For most of them, they are rather gossip about glimpses. And for the rest, the whole world is full of rumors, most of which are almost avoidedly romances. The great majority of the tales about gods and ghosts and the invisible king are told, if not for the sake of the tale, at least for the sake of the topic. They are evidence of the eternal interest of the theme. They are not evidence of anything else, and they are not meant to be. Boy, you can see this, you can see the weaving of Pre-Lewis in this writing. They are mythology or the poetry that is not bound in books or bound in any other way. Meanwhile, the minority, the sages or thinkers, had withdrawn apart and had taken up an equally congenial trade. They were drawing up plans of the world, of the world which all believed to have a plan. They were trying to set forth the plan seriously and to scale. They were setting their minds directly to the mind that had made the mysterious world, considering what sort of a mind it might be and what its ultimate purpose might be. Some of them made that mind much more impersonal than mankind was generally, has generally made it. Deism, the Enlightenment. Some simplified it almost to a blank. The god of the gaps. A few and very few doubted it all together. The atheists who seem to be a very determined minority because when people go beyond atheism, they just go into woo. One or two of the more morbid fancies that it might be evil or an enemy, just as one or two of the more degraded, in the other cases, worship demons instead of gods. But most of these theorists were theists and they not only saw a moral plan in nature but they generally laid down a moral plan for humanity. Most of them were good men who did good work and they were remembered and reverenced in various ways. They were scribes and their scriptures became more or less holy scriptures. They were lawgivers and their traditions became not only legal but ceremonial. And may say, we may say that they received divine honors in the sense in which kings and great captains in certain countries have received divine honors. In a word, wherever the other popular, wherever the other popular spirit, the spirit of legend and gossip would come into play, it surrounded them with more mystical atmosphere of the myths. Popular poetry turned the sages into saints, but that was all it did. And they remained themselves. Men never really forgot that they were men, only made into gods in the sense that they were made into heroes. Divine Plato, like divine Caesar, was a title and not a dogma. In Asia where the atmosphere was more mythological, the man was made to look more like a myth, but he remained a man. He remained a man of a certain special class or school of men receiving and deserving great honor from mankind. It is the order or school of the philosophers, the men who have set themselves seriously to trace the order across any apparent chaos in the vision of life. Instead of living on imaginative rumors and remote traditions and the tail end of exceptional experiences about the mind and meaning behind the world, they have tried in a sense to project the primary purpose of that mind a priori. They have tried to put on paper a possible plan of the world, almost as if the world were not yet made. Right in the middle of these things stands an enormous exception. It is quite unlike anything else. It is a thing final like the Trump of doom, though it is also a piece of good news, or news that seems too good to be true. It is nothing less than the loud assertion that this mysterious maker of the world has visited his world in person. It declares that really and even recently, or right in the middle of historic times, there did walk into the world this original invisible being about whom the thinkers made theories and the mythologists hand down myths. The man who made the world. That such a higher personality exists behind all things had indeed always been implied by all the best thinkers, as well as by the most beautiful legends, but nothing of this sort had ever been implied by any of them. It is simply false to say that the other sages and heroes had claimed to be that mysterious maker, master and maker of whom the world had dreamed and disputed. Not one of them had ever claimed to be anything of the sort. Some of you will find C.S. Lewis's trilemma lurking behind this page. Not one of their sects or schools had ever claimed that they had claimed to be anything of the sort. Does Muhammad claim to be God? Does the Buddha claim to be God? Does Confucius claim to be God? The most any visionary had ever said was that men might catch glimpses of the glory of that spiritual being. You can put a capital B on there if you'd like. Or much more often lesser spiritual beings. The most that any primitive myth had ever suggested was that the creator was present at the creation, but that the creator was present at scenes a little subsequent to the supper parties of Horus, and talked with tax collectors and government officials in the delayed life of the Roman Empire. I think I didn't read that well. I'll read it again. The most that any primitive myth had ever suggested was that the creator was present at the creation, but that the creator was present at scenes a little subsequent to the supper parties of Horus, and talked with tax collectors and government officials in the detailed daily life of the Roman Empire, and that the fact continued to be firmly asserted by the whole of that great civilization for more than a thousand years that something utterly unlike anything else in nature. It is the one great startling statement that man has made since he first spoke articulate word instead of barking like a dog. Its unique character can be used as an argument against it as well as for it. It would be easy to concentrate on it as a case of isolated insanity, but it makes nothing but dust and nonsense of comparative religions. Eric is the one who came up with Jesus Smuggling, which was first introduced to me by Douglas Murray. Why don't we smuggle Buddha or Muhammad or Confucius in in the same way? May. Chesterton has a point here that there's a strangeness to this story of Christianity. I should make a t-shirt that says Jesus Smuggler. The strange assertion that where of the yardstick is in Christ, which was written of course by the Apostle Paul and became his term parallel to what we find in the Gospels in the Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew, the Kingdom of God in Mark and Luke, and eternal life in the Gospel of John. That somehow when Sam Harris says, well the point of life is love pursued by reason and Jordan Peterson says, you've just basically taken Christianity and used different words. Jordan didn't have to smuggle Jesus. He basically tagged Sam as bringing him in the front door, just in different clothing, just imagining that the universe doesn't point to him. I'm going to conclude this with the end of the podcast and it ended in a pretty astounding way. I mean I think this applies. Cartons, you have to put skull and crossbones on it. Somebody put a picture of Hitler on the box labeled leadership. I think that's a good way to put it. Somebody put a picture of Hitler on the box labeled leadership and we keep doing this where every time there's a box that contains important stuff, somebody puts a label on it that says, do not open this box ever under any circumstances because of the worst thing that can be associated with that box. Do you think that there's some merit in that perspective that we're all afraid of leadership leads to Hitler? I think the shadow of Hitler looms over a lot of things in the western world. I think it looms over some of the religious and philosophical debates that are stalled out where basically the western world- If you recall, and I won't pull it up for you, if you recall Tom Holland's appearance on the Deling podcast, Tom Holland basically says, well in the new clothing that we have placed over Christianity, we basically put the Hitler mask on the devil. In a sense, sort of tried to leave Christianity behind, found when it left Christianity behind Hitler, rightly decided that was a bad idea but then- And go back to that Deling pod podcast and go back and do a little bit of research. You can find it in some of my videos where I deal with Hitler. What was Hitler trying to do? Hitler was trying to- I just recently saw that guy who does the travel stories on PBS did a tour of fascism recently on PBS and it was looking at Nazi art and noticed how realistic Nazi art was. Well, why would Nazi art be into realism? Well, if you understand what the Nazis were trying to do and why they hated the Jews, they were trying to get at a natural world where there is no second story. That was at the heart of the Nazi project. We want to take Darwin seriously, more utterly seriously, and get rid of all this Christian stuff that was brought to us by the Jews, because of course Jesus was a Jew, was brought to us by the Jews, so let's get rid of all that Christian stuff and all that Jewish stuff with all that idea and we will be completely natural. We will finally get rid of Christianity completely and the two projects of the 20th century that pursued that with most earnestness, communism, Nazism. Communism doesn't often get tagged for it. When Jordan Peterson brings that up with Sam Harris, Sam Harris, instead of an argument, just goes off the- just basically pops off and says, don't give me that communist thing about atheism. Retreat into this half world looms over a lot of things in the western world. I think that there's a sense, I think it looms over some of the religious and philosophical debates that are stalled out where basically the western world in a sense tried to leave Christianity behind, found when it left Christianity behind Hitler, rightly decided that was a bad idea, but then retreated to this halfway house where it is neither Christian nor non-Christian, but this sort of mix of worldviews that don't make any sense. A sort of Christianish view of the inviolability of human rights joined to a strictly materialist view of the cosmos. I think the shadow of- if we look for consistency, we might become Nazis, I think is a factor. And yeah, it might, I hadn't- If we look for- if we really pursue the project of getting rid of God, why do we start getting the whiff of fascism? Well, because you have to, it's totalitarian, you have to get rid of everything outside the citadel. It's the institution has to take over everything. You don't leave the corners of the field for the gleaners and the conspiracy theorists and the skeptics or all these other people, you get rid of them completely. And whether it's the right or the left, the totalitarian impulse remains. Whenever you try to secure heaven on earth, you bring up hell as a natural product of the process. I think it certainly might play in political leadership as well. That we don't, but at the same time, there's clearly a yearning for that leadership too, right? That you see it in the appeal that Trump has, you saw it in the sort of Barack Obama's one golden year where running for president and giving speeches and getting the Nobel Peace Prize. It's not like the desire for that has gone away. But there's definitely less, you know, conservatives only remember Churchill and liberals only remember FDR. I think there is a broader loss of a sense of what statesmanship looks like. Don't you feel like if Jesus appeared now before us that we would memeify him within minutes, that he would be cheapened by virtue of interacting with the virtue of believing that Jesus was actually the son of God is that I think he's immune to memeification. You do? Yes. Well, wasn't he humiliated in the streets of Jerusalem by people who did not accept his being the son of God in your eyes? I mean, he's not immune to mistreatment and violence. I think he's immune to trivialization. Jesus is immune to trivialization? My point for Douthat here is that Jesus has been subject to everything and it is often the church and Jesus' own people that trivialize him and memeify him and do all manner of things against him. And this is exactly where we go back to the previous chapter of the Everlasting. I'm not going to read it now, but I read it in one of the previous videos that the title of the chapter is the five deaths of the faith. And the point that Chesterton makes is that in fact, Jesus, all manner of things are done to Jesus. And the point of Jesus is that no matter how bad a job you do on him, whether done by his enemies or those of us in the church who say we are his friends, he keeps coming back. That Christianity should have died how many times and in fact in some ways did die. The church in the West was not in a world where things were too old to die, but in one in which they were always young enough to get killed. And the point that Chesterton makes is that again and again and again Christianity comes back. But in all these cases are remote in date and could only be proved in detail, we can see that the fact more clearly in the case when the paganism of the Renaissance ended Christianity and Christianity unaccountably began all over again. And this is what happens. So if Jesus were to come back, he keeps coming back. Now okay, I believe in the Apostles Creed, so I'm one of those inconvenient Christians that believe in the second coming of Jesus. Eric worries about reputational assassins. Well we are all wimps worried about that when compared to many others who have faced a far more bloody culture war. Why does Jesus have credibility? Because he had skin in the game. He had skin in the game and that is the story of him keeping coming back. So Eric's mission to save the world, but from what exactly? Well from everything, but his vision of the good that shines through in everything. The real question is not to save the world from what exactly, because there's always something new to save the world from. The real question is to save the world for what or for whom or for where. The destination of this drama is really what he seeks. I hope I was fair, maybe even to Sam. I know some of you have been commenting in the comments that I'm not terribly fair to Sam all the time, and certainly if I met with Sam I would extend him hopefully the Christian charity that is due according to Jesus for all of our neighbors including and up to our enemies and rivals. But I think this is Eric's mission and so you know despite some of the Twitter skeptics of Eric, I like listening to Eric and he's been making some interesting things and I think that's the real question. Save the world from what? Yeah there's a lot the world needs to be saved from, but I think the question he really wants to answer is to save the world for what, but that's a far harder question to answer.
