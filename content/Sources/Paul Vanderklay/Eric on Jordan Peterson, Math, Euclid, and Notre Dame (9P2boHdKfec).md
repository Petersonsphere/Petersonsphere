 Well, it's gonna be video recorded. I'm gonna put it on my YouTube channel. Okay, good, good. Well, tell me a little bit about yourself. Okay, I'm 28 years old. I'm a graduate student in mathematics here at the University of Notre Dame. I'm a sixth year. I'm gonna be finishing my dissertation in the upcoming months. Well, mostly what I'd like to do is I'd like to join this conversation that you started and I really appreciate all the stories of the people that do post them on YouTube and so I feel like I have a story that people might gain something from so I mostly wanted to share just how I found Jordan Peterson and this whole Christianity thing that I'm doing now. Okay, well go for it. Tell us about it. So I'd say my parents were not very religious at home. My mom's parents were Protestant and Catholic so they kind of had a difficulty figuring out what to do with her as far as that went. So I never really had religion in the home but for kindergarten my parents sent me to Florida Bible Christian School which was a private school. Unfortunately I saw that it's no longer there. I guess they packed up and moved out but so I had a lot of upbringing in Christianity, learning the stories in kindergarten and then it cost a lot of money and I have a brother as well so we started going to public school after that but I still went to summer camp there so every summer I would you know we'd pray every day we'd have Bible stories and things like that and I was always the kind of kid who would look around and open my eyes when everyone was praying kind of like what what's going on here? I don't know because I wasn't very skeptical but I was always a little skeptical and there was a few weird things that happened that are a part of this story so I remember one time on the bus asking one of the camp counselors about how's Noah 900 years old? Something like that right and they would say oh there's these fountains that people would drink water from that allowed them to live that long and I was very skeptical. Interesting. I thought is this adult lied to me? It was you know just back my head kind of and then eventually in this camp which I loved the camp it was very good but once you get old enough there's a certain day where they gather all the old students or the old campers and they tell you about the story of the book of Revelation and I remember them telling us that there's gonna be barcodes on people's foreheads and I thought that was really weird too but I remember also in middle school walking around thinking and then thinking oh God can hear me that I shouldn't be thinking these things right so I think that really at a young age I was kind of living in it as we say in our Paul Vanderklay community we're living in it but I remember very quickly and I remember in ninth grade the moment I became an atheist right I was in my world history class in ninth grade and I remember just learning about the ancient Greek religions and the Roman religions and I put two and two together if there's all these different religions they must all be wrong or something and so that was when I became an atheist I guess and I quickly started just reading science so it's in ninth and ninth grade into high school I I read Richard Dawkins's work the God Delusion the blind watchmaker and actually his best book is the ancestors tale because it's not about religion at all it's like the Canterbury tales uh-huh except it goes backwards in time through common ancestors and it just explains a lot of the theory of evolution and it was his best work I think interesting but it was very scientific and in this formative period of my time I was I've always been like a fundamentalist kind of person so when I became an atheist I would look up the second King's verse about the she bears that attacked the children oh and I would want to debate people I had an atheist shirt from Richard Dawkins with the big a on it like the scarlet letter I had a necklace Wow hardcore yeah it was a big part of my identity but I I was really into religion and I took two religion classes in college which were very important because part of what I want to get across to college I did my undergrad at Florida International University okay in Miami Florida I grew up in Miami Florida okay but I took a college class at Broward College while I was in high school this where you dual enrollment program where you get college credits sure and the the book we used in that course was called the anatomy of the sacred if you've maybe you've heard of it maybe not I've heard of it I haven't read it the the points of the book was to define religion and the professor was Catholic but we were we didn't really learn history of specific religions but what do what the sacred mean what is religion and this is what really made Peterson so salient to me is that the book defines human beings as homo religius and so I've always understood that we're all religious whether or not we think we are God no God it's really we just do religion without him and the second point that really drew me to Peterson was I've always even as militant atheist and even now I identify as a Christian I guess I've always disliked agnosticism because it's changing the question the question is about belief and it's not about knowledge so I always thought of agnosticism as a cop-out either you believe it or you don't so that was tied up in with acting yeah yeah yeah yeah how you what do you do right yeah yeah that's really interesting I'd never thought I mean agnosticism is often perceived as atheism light but you've got a real point there and you know it hinges on this idea of believing and that they could very interesting of course with Peterson's kvetching about believing so keep going yeah yeah so this is some background I took another religion class where it was more of a worldly let's learn the basics of Islam Christianity Hinduism they had a Jane an actual Janus who works at my undergrad come in and talk to us so that was really helpful but I was definitely a scientific materialist you know and I don't know I've got to the point where I mean I'm getting a PhD in math so I'm familiar with a lot of the mathematical stuff behind the physics and I'm at the point now where I can I know enough to see when they're inserting their religious faith to the site or you know I know where the empirical data stops and the speculation begins right I'm not an expert but I know enough but I've all you know I've always been very scientifically minded I would read books about physicists I stopped reading literature just for the token reference for this video I read the Lord of the Rings in middle school but I don't really remember movies I saw the first two didn't even finish all right well yeah it's not it's not good the comments are gonna destroy me I was always into literature and I switched to just pure nonfiction science and and you know I've just been immersed in this and and so I understand some of the the finer points of science but then right before I graduated my undergrad to go to University of Notre Dame I all I did was take math classes and so I had these basic biology one classes to take and at the last minute yeah and I I took a class on philosophy and that's where I encountered the logos and that's what brings me to Christianity is when I understood the logos coming from the math side I identified with that and even outside of Christianity the logos became my religious understanding or how to think about it it's hard to talk about math but I partly I want to bring math into this conversation as Esther O'Reilly and Adam friended were talking about this math becomes important to an alarming number of math graduate students in this journey and not most a number of them haven't post one of their videos posted so it's really interesting to me how many mathematicians are in this conversation and I don't know why maybe you can shed light on that yeah so maybe I should get to that now what I definitely still want to talk about I don't want to derail you so yeah before this ends I want to share the story of me getting to Christianity JP but this is important so understanding that we are homo religious I interpreted mathematics as my religion I would study math to achieve religious experiences of awe and wonder you know there's a lot of sacred symbols math is a wash in the occult historically speaking with the Ithagerians and yeah and I took a class in the branch of math called set theory which is like a metaphysics of math everything in math you can learn it black box but when you dig deep down into what are we really talking about what one thing we came up with this set theory and I got set theory tattoos I'm a fundamentalist like I began so I began to interpret things religiously through mathematics and I identified math as my religion and that I use it to achieve to have a relationship with the sacred something that's independent of time and place and connecting me throughout generations I act the kind of math I do is to identify myself with people of the past this is Carl Friedrich Gauss my PhD advisor was going to throw this away and I was like you're not throwing that away but so for instance and so this is where I really want to get because outside of my religious life I am a missionary with a different book so so my usual talking points is this I asked people what is the most published book of all time the Bible yeah easy especially here at Notre Dame they get that one really quick yeah but here's the question what is the second most published book of all time I thought it was Mao's Red Book so that's the most printed book of all time but in terms of publishers you know independently publishing the book for printing okay yes it's a Euclid's Elements it's a math book that's interesting and Euclid's Elements is in Greek and so a lot of my ease into coming into Christianity is the tie with the ancient Greek world and so I want to talk a little bit why I was so susceptible to Jordan Peterson's work about the Bible was I understood how complex the Bible was by understanding how complex Euclid's Elements is so this is another book where the opening line of Euclid's Elements is an hour-long talk or more if you want to go back to the original Greek and talk about what this word means and so I had some understanding of what what it means to study something so like everyone read Euclid it was required until I guess the late 19th century is when they took it out of schools if you were getting an education you'd have to read this book and Abraham Lincoln wanted to become a lawyer and he told himself I could not know what it means to demonstrate something if I did not study Euclid's Elements and the Constitution of the United States is inspired by Euclid's Elements of having axioms and deducing the rest of the laws of government from the fundamental premises so Euclid's Elements I'm a missionary of Euclid's Elements I've actually fascinating to me for me I usually tinge conspiracy with this why don't you know that the second most published book is a math book yeah why don't I know this why haven't I ever owned this book or read this book or studying this book most mathematicians have never opened this book either and it blows my mind huh consisting of as I just opened up Wikipedia consisting of 13 books attributed to Euclid in Alexandria and Ptolemaic Egypt 300 BC collection of definitions postulates and propositions theorems and constructions mathematical proofs but of course you know here's a thing that so I was I never talked about this I was a failed math major at eventually switched to history I really did enjoy math but I got to it I got to a level of math that I looked around the classroom and I could see that you know I could get I could I could do this but I wasn't going to soar and I could see other people that were just and I thought oh this isn't for me and I went to history and history I could you know I really enjoyed so that I left math behind but I've always enjoyed math and but but so here's the thing math in 300 BC was not math in a secular materialist frame today those are very different those are very different things even though people think well it's just math it's just numbers but I know enough ancient history to know oh no they were they weren't interested in that stuff just you know why would they weren't interested in that stuff because they wanted to build a bridge they were interested in that stuff because for them this was this was this was knowledge and not just knowledge about you know how to get something done but knowledge about reality and philosophy in the world so so what what is this book about Euclid's elements is a compilation of knowledge so it's of course Euclid might not be real you know what do you mean historical Euclid we got to go down that route too okay that's not important but okay it's a compilation of all of the knowledge that was picked up probably from a lot of the Pythagoreans but people who would travel to Egypt in the Greek civilization of that time it's so it starts out the first line is definition a point is that which has no part and this is what a point is this is what a line is this is what a square is this what a right angle is what a circle is it's just definitions there's no fluff when you learn Euclid today I compare it to listening to Mozart on a little MIDI keyboard it's been completely washed away from the original source everyone learns Euclidean geometry but they don't learn it from Euclid and I would rather listen to Mozart play his music and someone with one finger bashing on a little MIDI keyboard I really focus on reading the actual text okay and started to distract you keep going you're doing good so then it has these five postulates which are rules for how to use a ruler and a compass so the first postulate says if you have two points you can draw a straight line connecting them that's an axiom that's a fundamental assertion that is self-evident and we're starting from there then if you have two points you can draw a circle any line that you have can be extended you can imagine I put a ruler and just kept drawing these are the axioms then there's the famous parallel postulate which is a you can talk about that for I mean days about the parallel postulate and it's relationship to general relativity and like Pablo Picasso's work and and the parallel postulate was like dogma in the Catholic Church like when people started discovering that Euclid's elements might not be absolute people were afraid to tell people because Euclid's elements was considered to be the so there's a quote like you there's a poem that says Euclid alone has stared upon beauty bare and that the Euclid's elements was the closest to the mind of God that people had achieved it's this rigorous deduction of all of the mathematical knowledge so like the Pythagorean theorem is proposition 47 so they prove 46 things and then they prove the Pythagorean theorem and it's huge all of high school math is in this book way more I mean this book is already more advanced than the high school math we teach today and I actually this is a foundationalism at its best here's a point you're not gonna get anything below a point I need two points you have a line or a circle so you are you this is a foundationalism that you are built you're building the world from your self-evident non reducible principles absolutely and I mean I I want to hit the major points because if I'm not careful I will talk about you for an hour but so so and I understand that you know this book wasn't true so I want to start comparing this to the Bible now okay Euclid's elements was not written in a day or a weekend this is a compendium of knowledge that is constantly self-referencing itself because literally everything is pointing back to every step in the argument is this is an axiom this is a previously proved proposition or this is a definition and so everything is delineated and I mean this book probably influenced how people read the Bible because they read it like Euclid they start from these axioms and they deduce things so I understood what it meant to rigorously study something and to study a book that is beyond a single human life that this is a compendium of knowledge this is you know hundreds of years of work being consolidated and ordered and put together and structured in such a way that it has been timeless and is still working today one thing I taught at Westfield Penitentiary through the University of Notre Dame and I gave them Euclid's elements with the left side in Greek and the right side in English and so I really say I am a missionary for Euclid because I think everyone needs to read I think everyone's here in the Bible I think everyone needs to read Euclid. See I'm gonna go out and buy this sucker now and a diglot where you've got the Greek and the English I'm there I'm there. Yeah so so Euclid is a big deal and so also neoplatonism was a very important part because even though I was a devout atheist I of course being homo religious I'm still engaging in things and so I got really into neoplatonism and so the Trinity was something that already made perfect sense to me it's related to my tattoos I've interpreted a lot of these mythical ideas and structures into my mathematical metaphysics so so this is the empty set it's everything that is not itself so Leibniz gave us the axiom of logic A equals A and if you can talk about it A has to equal A and this is everything that is not equal to itself and so we call it the empty set but one of my professors said the empty set is not empty its elements are not equal to themselves and I interpret this as everything that doesn't make sense that you can't comprehend we're gonna all put it in here collapse to a point to say it's empty there's nothing there so so that everything in math the metaphysics of math in this branch that I called set theory everything that mathematicians talk about is a set containing a set containing a set containing a set containing the empty set so the empty set plays the role of the demiurge in neoplatonist philosophy or I mean for me I rep I thought of it as God I mean even when I was an atheist I would say this to me represents what God is and I've seen this in other texts the emptiest set of all empties it's an absolute it transcends everything else in this extreme way and then this is the set containing the empty set so this has one thing in it this has nothing in it this has one thing in it and it's this thing and this is awareness of nothing right this for me I interpreted this to mean consciousness the recognition of nothing the recognition of emptiness the recognition of the demiurge the point from which everything comes from and then the two of them so this is the number one this is the number zero the number two is the set with two elements the empty set and the set containing the empty set and so that's what that's what the number two is metaphysically you what is it it's this thing and so that zero one and two becomes the Trinity and and and it relates to you have the demiurge and then it created this thing and then it looks back on itself and created the Trinity which is you know God Jesus and the Holy Spirit all the stuff I was already into is already in Christianity coming from the Greek which is where I got it from from Euclid from all of these ideas and that's an important part of my story is that I'm a Euclid guy ancient Greek guy so there are some people who are gonna really nerd out about this video I know it already and I can already hear them in the back of my head so they'll probably get contacting you so just be prepared so keep going great yeah so the logos was really important in my philosophy class I only he taught us that the logos is a power that human beings possess like the power of locomotion the power of speech and all these things and it's a power to illuminate some topic from all angles using dialogue is an engaging in the power together to understand a single point and to look at it from all other areas but there's also an emergence ethic from the logos is that if someone says something you don't agree with you have to call them out on it and try and work with that because there's a emergent ethic of trying to get at the thing that you're talking about and I was like yeah that's math math is applied logos you know I saw everything is trying to understand my identity as a mathematician and what I'm trying to study and the logos was very important so I think this is we got about half an hour and I this is a good way segue to start getting into JBP and the mentor I'm gonna have some I'll probably want to talk to you more you know schedule another meeting that's fine I know Joe is a returning guest yeah yeah it's getting harder slots are getting harder and harder to come by so it's a competition out there but the persistent the persistent win the prize great so now let's get to JBP so okay back to the narrative of your life so you're you're an atheist and you're in college you're an atheist you're identifies an atheist all the way through undergrad yeah okay so that you graduate from your undergrad about what year 2013 2013 okay so Peterson is you know not really on the he's not really on the radar until kind of mid 2016 he he really starts hitting the news feeds so yeah so one thing I will say is that when I got to grad so I'm here at the University of Notre Dame and when I got here I really thought about starting a math church why did you go to Notre Dame if you're an atheist I was the only graduate program that I got into oh that's a good reason Catholics hospitality every single room has a crucifix with Jesus on it I used to think that was weird but I love it now always there and they don't have cameras anywhere I think the crucifix does enough work that people but so PhDs their statistics 50% of people getting a PhD are depressed large amount of that sidle it's it's you're becoming a monk to study something that no one cares about wow you can't talk to anyone so I mean it's a traumatic experience for most people also I think what's important is becoming 25 years old in that process and your brains finally developed and quarter-life crisis or whatever I was in a really dark place I've actually lost 65 pounds you know I was very overweight I was alcoholic I smoked way too much cigarettes I stayed up way too late I was the bucko living in the basement you know not doing anything with my life and I would spend a lot of time on the couch listening to Sam Harris podcasts about free will not being real and also this guy Max Tegmark if you've heard of him he's a mathematician who has the mathematical universe hypothesis he has an interesting I mean it's it's extreme near its extreme Platonism I guess I was not getting anything from this you know and I could just feel this nihilism eating away at my soul I could see myself not achieving the goals I wanted and so I was in a really bad place so this is an important part of the story that I want to get to is in 2016 my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer yeah and he died last year in March and so yeah it's it all worked out in you know it's as best as it could and this is why I want to share my story and why I identify with Peterson is that my dad gave me this eye of Horace necklace and so I really identify with rescuing your father from the underworld you know I can't hear you yeah that was my dog's my dog started making noise my dog has very bad timing and so I didn't want that in interrupting but keep going I'm listening yeah so you know I was in this really dark place and my dad had cancer you know that's in the back of my mind and I first saw Jordan Peterson on Dave Rubin's show he was interviewing him there and then I was like hey this guy you know I'm an academic so what I like listening to academics and so I googled a YouTube Tim and saw his his first biblical series and I watched it all the way straight and then I watched the second one and I started watching the third one but I had to fall asleep you know and spent I've watched everything he's got I listened to Maps and Meaning on audiobook you know 12 words for life all of it and because of my background with Euclid I immediately understood that even if you know it could be the case that all of Christianity today is doing something wrong but the book is there you know like there's something here in this book it's not an accident it wasn't written in a day you know and so so so that is what really got my interest was knowing what it would mean to really study the Bible and know that everything cross-references itself and the 63,000 cross-references I became like okay you know what one way I'll define my faith is I'm gonna spend my life trying to use this book to gain wisdom about love and like wisdom in action like for Vickie talks about like so I would say I identify as a Christian or I am a Christian it's still weird you know for me saying these things because we need elephants around us to do it so it doesn't feel weird like I came out as Christians and some of my friends and I was really apprehensive but they didn't care at all and I was very very happy about that but so my faith is that I think this book is bottomless Peterson is not bottomless I've listened to it all and it's eventually like okay you know but that book is bottomless and one aspect of my faith is that I will read this book and try to understand it until I got everything out of it and my faith is that I don't think I'm gonna get everything out of it I don't know I identify with that so what so what about Peterson hooked you a lot of the biological arguments coming from my Richard Dawkins reading and just science in general I was really interested in the homo sapiens evolved in the presence of snakes and ripe fruits giving us vision what was also really salient to me was what I think it's really well said by verbatim his first lecture that myths are perennial truths that last forever I I began to see that partly from reading Matthew Pagel's book Jonathan's brother yeah which is really incredible I felt kind of like a tin hat person reading it because I was like what where is he getting this from yeah I know I know the feeling looking at that book it's like okay on what authority like I'm exactly but where are you getting this from because it all makes sense that I don't know if I'm being duped here but like time the number seven there are seven days of creation is related to pie being an irrational number I was like this speaks to me so I understood that the the Garden of Eden isn't just a historical event it's it's an event that happens every day so Matthew Pagel explains how the Copernican Revolution was us exiting the garden again and feeling naked by removing ourselves from the physical coherence with the symbolic representation of rising Sun every day flat earth and things right that there's something to be gained from the coherence of your physical explanation and your symbolic representation and every time we remove that we feel naked we feel nihilist we feel like nothing matters and so like leaving the garden could happen to you every day if you if you aren't trying to do it and I also understand and I started to interpret Cain and Abel happens every day the flood happens every day in someone's life somewhere so for instance the answer to the flood is your family right like for me it really stuck out the flood myth is a story about the importance of family and and laughing it his drunken father is or drunken parents is something that really resonates and so when I first got into this I was kind of hesitant you know to identify as a Christian or anything but I what I started seeing was as I started acting it out these narrative frameworks give me a series of safety nets because I still have an extremely you know coming from the materialist atheist perspective that is the saw cutting the branch that I sit on and it will destroy everything if I'm not careful and so if I get sad or depressed I fall into one layer of the story like no God loves me you know and if that doesn't work or you know it definitely helped with depression just to have these safety nets that depending on how sharp my rational mind was cutting I might be able to land through three of them but the fourth one will catch me and then I can get on with my day you know so living in this narrative is really helpful like every time I look at a person now I try to remember I'm looking at God right now I have to love this person you know this is you know for instance the wise man learns something from everyone you know and that that helps and also just oh yeah so what attracts me about Peterson is the science really got me because I was scientifically minded the myth got to me because I'm a very mathematical person but I also am an artist so the symbolism is really good it's really salient to me I think that a Jungian psychotherapist would be very effective on me because of how I think in symbols and I for instance I read the first chapter of Eric Neumann's book the history of an origin of consciousness and the thesis of the book is that the symbolic representation of consciousness details the individual transformations as well as the historical sociological transformation so you look at the progression of the archetypes from the Ouroboros to the great mother to the father and etc and this represents a fundamental transformations in the state of consciousness that humanity has gone through and each individual person goes through and so that so one thing that I I saw useful about Christianity is that this narrative framework Peterson gave me multiple narrative frameworks I have the art of war and this has a the Dao De Ching in here and I started reading that and I started reading about the archetypes and things and I began to see that I could frame my life in the archetype explanatory oh I'm I'm thinking about a girl right now that is my anima possessing me or my anima you know so it was these interpretive frameworks and so Peterson actually delving in all these different ones gave me the different interpretive frameworks and so I started to really see what Christianity was offering and these safety nets and these different interpretations and you know going between Buddhism and Christianity there's a lot of overlaps but there's differences for me one is the East is about meditating to empty your mind but I see the Christianity is meditating to fill your mind with something so right so for instance up in in late 2017 I came out on Facebook and I said I'm converting to Christianity let's talk about it you know I got a lot of weird mixed people don't know what to do with me because I'm the smart guy with the high IQ is doing math and now I'm whoa you know yeah it's weird but I'm Christian we thought religion was for stupid people that needed help not smart people who don't need help I would definitely wanted to share this with you the person in the United States with the highest IQ has an IQ of 200 he lives by himself in a cabin with his wife who he found on Mensa and he reads the Bible every day and so I'm like hey this guy with the 200 IQ is reading this book every day this is a very important point that Jordan Peterson makes to Sam Harris is he says it's for stupid people and Jordan Peterson says we're all stupid man and you have to be smart enough to know that I mean to a certain degree I mean Neil deGrasse Tyson makes it makes a wonderful illustration that the more you know the more you know you don't know and I think the correlate is the smarter you are you realize how stupid you really are you're just not smart enough because you see so much and you begin to understand how deep things go when you say I can I can never know it all I can never do it all I can never be at all and that then leaves a hole in the universe and what do you do with that hole you got to do something with it and you might fall into it your ego yeah you will always you will always be lacking you will you will never there will in fact the more you have the more you will lack the more you know the more you don't know it that just keeps going and so suddenly you have to do something with that and and I think I think a lot of people just fall into it and then where are you so no it's those are good points so okay so you're already at Notre Dame so you're surrounded by you know probably quite a few Christians because I know there are a lot of Protestants at Notre Dame too and Protestants yeah that's a that's a joke there's the there's the there's a Christian Form Church in South Bend that is it's it's kind of a it's known in the CRC as kind of the Notre Dame it's kind of the Notre Dame CRC Albert Plantinga of course taught at Notre Dame Mark Knoll in history was at Notre Dame and so that tended to be where a bunch of CRC academics who went on to teach at Notre Dame would then worship so there's a there's I might stop by there I'm still in need of a church you should you should stop by there and let me tell Paul Vanderklaas sent you and they'll probably say we don't want to hear that guy's name but Len Van De Zee who's a friend of mine I'm gonna have him on the channel one of these days he he he he was the pastor at Notre Dame for quite a few years and let's speak says nothing but churches are not their pastors and that's something that I really want to emphasize churches are communities and my friend Len Van De Zee says nothing nothing but wonderful things about that church at Notre Dame at in South Bend Indiana so a friend of mine is a seventh day eventist and he told me that churches are hospitals they're for sick people that's true too yeah but we're all sick we're all dumb and we're all sick yeah but that's my Calvinism too so so what so around the end of 2017 I began to publicly identify as Christian partly because I wanted people to know I'm into this and I want people to talk to me about it and I want to learn and people were accusing me oh you're not a real Christian you know and and my my answer is always like how what I didn't know you had that authority you exist right it's very weird but so what really sticks with me so I read the book of Genesis I read the book of Job I read and now I've read four gospels and I have an app you know I read one verse a day or more but what was so impactful for me was like reading the book of Job and watching my dying father so my dad never complained he was on all these medications so that he turned into a yellow skeleton the medication started attacking his liver and like I remember one of the last memories I had of my dad was like coming down at one in the morning and this like skeleton of a person is typing out an email to my mom about his cremation and he never he never complained about anything and I and all I could think of was Jesus and and seeing that you know like are you thirsty Jesus and then they pour vinegar in his mouth and just not I don't know I've seen people transcend death in a spiritual sense and and and what it is here that my dad possessed is what the people when Jordan Peterson is talking about Victor Franklin he's talking about Solzhenitsyn who survives the concentration camps is people who have otherworldly gifts of keeping their dignity and keeping their sincerity and I always think of the image Jordan Peterson gives of the gates of heaven are guarded by angels with flaming swords and as you walk through whatever is left the dead wood is burned off and whatever you have left in your soul will pass through the gates of heaven and and so I see that it's like my dad you know so you start thinking always my dad in heaven is he in hell and God knows my dad better than I did and I'm pretty sure he's he's doing well because he's he saved his immortal soul by I don't know and just seeing the I couldn't have done that you know all that I thought so Jordan Peterson stuck in my mind immediately because I had a father dying of cancer and he says be the person that people need at your dad's funeral and I was like I'm gonna do that if I do anything I'm gonna do that you know and like I gave the eulogy at my dad's funeral that was really helpful it was a Catholic presentation who's at a Catholic hospice you know and I did the father the son and the Holy Spirit to keep it in the Catholic tradition you know I don't know but no that that's definitely I mean I it's not magic you know like a lot of people say you think I'm gonna become Christian all of a sudden something's gonna happen you know and there was nothing magical like from the empirical perspective of watching my father die but I identify with the spiritual nature of his suffering and overcoming his suffering and just surviving through that and so that that to me is what's tangible about like the spirit that you know and Jordan Peterson talks about it with his daughter Michaela right her life could have been much worse if she sacrificed her dignity that of course really got me into this kind of stuff and seeing that it's not a glowing you know LSD hallucination of something going on right like a spirits and stuff it's in real life it's real time it's in the flesh no that's right yeah and so I mostly wanted to share that story like I mean it I just have gained so much by listening to the other people on your channel who talked about like the guy who was you know had a gun to his head and I'm like I you know that this uh wounded people out there but but that's what's real to me is seeing someone transcend death and some righteous moral sense that really helps keep me I don't know but here we are I don't know I wrote down a bunch of stuff about three or four more minutes and then the next guy comes so sure anything you want to get in quick yeah so part of the reason why I did this is I want you to steal from me that's my goal I want right well if you give me permission to this folks are gonna watch this because again I know I mean a lot of the early math stuff we talked about some people are gonna be all over that thing I know that's great yeah I so here's and you're on Twitter so they'll be able to find you on Twitter yeah I'm on Twitter I have a YouTube channel which is math based where I'm trying to do some Jesus smuggling in there because I believe in the logos so so my my YouTube channel is math does not make sense sense makes math because you embody the logos to manifest the archetypes of the mathematical unconscious into your vision like that's my philosophy of math is that at the very least you know I believe math are objective like as there's objective morality two plus two equals four is up there right I believe in that but in the very least math is an archetype that we encounter through embodying the logos so I Jesus smuggle on my on my YouTube channel but so here was something that was really important when I was first getting into Peterson was the notion of sacrifice I thought to myself I need to quit smoking what if I killed my cat what if I took my bare hands and said I'm going to quit smoking and I choked my cat to death in my hands and watched myself do that and I was like you know what I'd probably quit smoking if I did that you know please don't tell me that you did this no I did not I did not I still smoke cigarettes unfortunately I'm fine no she's safe I love my cat oh but this was you know I like it because it's kind of a joke but but it really this is how I understood sacrifice like well as a pastor let me tell you I can laugh about this but part of it can only laugh about this because this is within the realm of possibility but I would imagine someone coming and telling me I asked her I needed to quit smoking I read the Bible and I heard about my cat and so I sacrifice my cat to the Lord with a prayer that I quit smoking I honestly I mean people don't know how strange the world is as a pastor you learn this and so to have someone actually tell me that story is not beyond the realm of possibility so I just wanted to make sure and my pastoral advice to you is respect the cat okay do not offer the cat as a sacrifice find another way I'd also kind of get this coming from Miami they have a center here oh yeah yeah yeah you know yeah yeah yeah yeah the chicken might get it but see it's weird because the idea of sacrificing a chicken to us doesn't feel like sacrificing a cat yeah but you know read David and read David and Nathan's parable to David about the lamb you know the one lamb was a pet in the family and then the rich man took the lamb and sacrificed it to give it to his guests and cats but anyway that's yeah well we'll have to talk again because absolutely we're about out of time but this was this was delightful this was delightful and send me the link to your to your YouTube channel on Twitter and I'll you know I my sense is that I mean I will send this to you and you can preview it but my sense is that you're probably good with sharing it and I think I don't need to look at it I definitely want to join this conversation I've been thinking about talking to you for a very long time and I'm finally doing it you know I'm I'm I'm in Esther O'Reilly's mentions all the time trying to add especially after the math stuff yeah Esther is it's so funny when someone what's what's amazing about something like Twitter is it's like it does it kind of extends our minds I think it was John Buck it was John Buck who said Esther is the she's that she's the annoying kid sister of the IDW and he said that it was just whoosh she's like she's kind of like Daphne on the it's kind of like Daphne and is it Daphne no it wasn't Daphne it was the who is the who is the smart one in Scooby-Doo Velma was it Velma she's kind of like glass and Scooby-Doo that's right and he's gonna probably hate you're gonna I bust on poor Esther all the time she's gonna I'm gonna get snide gonna get snide comments about this too poor Esther she's great yeah well thank you so much Eric I wish I had more time I got someone else after you so and I'm sure I'll see you on Twitter and yeah I've got a I've got a pretty good stockpile of videos right now but I've got some travel coming up so I usually kind of stockpile them so when I have travel I can still just kind of eke out content every day even when I don't have time to do my own videos so so probably next week or so it'll come out awesome I'll schedule another one soon and I'll see you on Twitter okay thanks for all this you do Paul oh my pleasure it's too much fun yeah I've kind of jealous all right have a good day take care bye bye
