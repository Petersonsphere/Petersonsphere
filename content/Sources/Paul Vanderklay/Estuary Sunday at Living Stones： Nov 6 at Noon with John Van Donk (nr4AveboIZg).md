 Hi, this is Paul. This Sunday, November 6, 2022, we after church on Sunday are going to have a little luncheon and John Van Donk is going to be in town and we are going to do a little question and answer about the European trip, about estuary and about a bunch of the stuff that we did this summer. And John is going to share the stage with me and we're going to talk about that. I'm also going to live stream it on my channel. And so if in fact there aren't a lot of questions from the group, we might open it up to questions in the live chat. So Rick will be monitoring the live chat from the back room. And so if you have questions for John and I this Sunday, it will will probably start service. We'll take it over around a 12, 12, 15. We'll probably start the presentation 1230, 1245. So keep a look at the live stream on this channel. We stream the church services and Sunday school on the church channel. But I think we'll stream this on this channel because this will be the channel that has probably the most interest in estuary. So if you're in Sacramento or close by and you want to come in services at 11, you can come for the service. And if you want to come after the service for the for that event, come about noon and we will see you here.
