 Hi, this is Paul. I'm recording this the evening before I do a podcast with Aaron Wren and Esther O'Reilly and on the way on my flight here to Chicago I was trying to listen to some of Aaron's podcasts that would be germane to our conversation and I found this one on evangelical elites and I thought there were a lot of really good and helpful ideas in it and I'm gonna bounce that off another video. Let's start with Aaron on this. Hockeying is the most toxic because there's no real stakes, right? It's like they're pure status. You have no power, you have no control, you're sort of a peon there. But you get into others domains, right? It actually means something, a business for example or a church. There are kind of elites within an individual church and so I think you can look at these individual subdomains as each could have its own elite and obviously the dynamics are gonna be different. I would say evangelicalism itself is a subdomain but is so kind of a large and diffuse it is hard to identify a singular elite. Now one of the things that makes Wren interesting is he's got a lot of sensitivity and a lot of thought about culture in general and he's not afraid to talk about capturing culture and figuring out how that moves on a large scale and so he's not at all opposed to elites. He says basically elites function within institutions and institutions need elites for leadership and so what he's gonna talk about a little bit here is how for evangelicalism especially where you don't have a specific structure and explicit structure like you have let's say in Catholicism or an orthodoxy or in some political frameworks but evangelicalism is much more of a diffuse structure and for that sense it's... Now I'm not using spiritual here to say that evangelicals are more spiritual than Roman Catholics it's not the sense that I'm making but rather the the sense of the structure of leadership and the path to elite performance is much more implicit and therefore non-structural and it's that sense sort of spiritual and sort of an egregore emergent way in the evangelical domain. Instead I think you have to look at tribal or sub domain types of groupings to find kind of elites so one kind of grouping would be you know kind of progressive evangelicalism which you can think of as the sojourners crowd the neo-anabaptists you know the new monastics people like that you know they've got their own little world their own kind of little ecosystem and different people have different status with that. I think there's an emerging tribe which called ex-vangelicals which are distinct from that and they have their own little world their own little tribe. Now part of I was also listening to a just maybe I'll just grab a just just a little clip from this Douglas Murray conversation with John Anderson. Of the so-called gay community which I say so-called because there is no such thing. Yeah I mean you know so this is one of the interesting aspects of this there must be there are a lot of gay people who don't want to be defined by their sexuality. They are a whole heap of other things. They're citizens they might be boilermakers they might be Sydney as you know city executives or whatever you but suddenly there's an insistence that they define themselves. Yeah and this is this has come in very recently and it's come in in each of the ones I just. And so you get this question of how to define and that then gets to questions of elite status and and who are the leaders but the leaders the leaders very much emerge and unlike when you have an explicit status hierarchy the leaders everyone recognizes the leaders but they might not necessarily might be a leader of an institution they might be a leader of a church they might just have a podcast. I mean part of what's happened is that so often now the leaders are media producers. I mean let's think about Beth Moore there's this big fight in the Southern Baptist over women in church leadership and again the part of the argument I made is that Beth Moore has way more clout than the vast majority of formal Southern Baptist leaders and so evangelicalism is this strange emergent struggle to use the word community the strange and use emergent principality in a sense that certainly has power it certainly has agency it certainly has all of these things and then elites function in in a way to move that principality in ways that obviously far outweigh other individuals in the community. New Calvinism that has its own thing you know that was thus talked about Brad Vermeerlin in his book he did this about it and you know he you know he's did his PhD thesis on that become an expert on kind of new Calvinism of it and I think even within this sort of like you know what Vermeerlin labeled mainstream evangelicalism which you might think of as many of these non-denom suburban megachurches there are all these tribes so you know I you know I when I was in New York I visited Hillsong a number of times I went there probably ten times maybe half the time they had a guest speaker and it was always some super dynamic you know evangelist or pastor of another church and you know they do a bunch of conferences and I bet if you looked at who speaks at the Hillsong conferences you know and who speaks at their church that would uncover kind of a network you know that exists around around them you know these different. So you see it at it's implicit and so what we tend to do in these implicit communities is we look at who other people are looking on if sort of a Ren√© Girard mimetic desire sense of identifying who the leaders are and it's it's a very living situation it's a very living complex organic model. sorts of affiliations I bet if you look at different conferences just mapping out conference speakers and mapping out guest pastor appearances probably map out a lot of networks that aren't necessarily as visible and even some of the visible networks it would probably be as well so I think it's tough to speak of an elite except of an evangelicalism at large but you can speak of elites within some of these sub communities. Now it's also I've made this point quite a bit that evangelicalism is in many respects a marketplace it's some of those dynamics especially because so much of the leadership comes from publishing from media either Billy Graham evangelistic organization was an enormous was an enormous institution raised tremendous amounts of money had vast amounts of influence out of Billy Graham of course you had the rise of now this mic is a little hot I have to turn this down I mean all of these adjustments that I don't actually have to make you had the rise of Christianity today of course you had Wheaton College in this area of Chicago quite near it gonna be around Wheaton Wheaton once comes up in the conversation quite a bit so all of these things came out of certain leaders in the in this principality as it were. Merlin again sort of views many of these sub communities as in essence jockeying for position within a broader evangelical field you can read his book if you're interested actually go to my youtube channel and listen to the you know great interview I'll have to find that one that we did he had a lot of fantastic things to say so that's what I say you know when you talk about elites you have to be talking about what sub domain within evangelicalism are you talking about and I think a lot of people throw around a term big Eva and when they're talking about evangelical elites you know I think a lot of people have this big Eva group in mind and big Eva is essentially coterminous with the new Calvinist group or the gospel gospel and I thought this was an interesting point I'm not sure if I agree with him because I wouldn't consider Russell Moore sort of maybe he is part of the new Calvinist group I don't know the new Calvinism in many ways became after that with it with a steady decline of the seeker movement the emergent movement splits off into progressive evangelicalism new Calvinism and in some ways the really still emerging sort of the new neo-sacramentalist where you have Anglicanism and some of those other movements right now industrial complexes other people have called them that sort of thing so it's it's denominational leaders it's big pastors it's wealthy financiers it's seminary people it's publishing executives it's big authors and journalists it's holders of elite secular roles people like that so again I think you could look at the conferences in this sort of world you know look at and I think he's right the conferences you the the organizers of the conferences are trying to figure out who will draw the people now there's been a lot of conversation and evangelicalism about the the gender of the conference speakers the skin color of the conference speakers and some conferences have been trying to balance that out other conferences have said no that shouldn't be the focus of attention some are sort of going halfway but I think I think rent is right and in that sense the it is like a marketplace partly because market dynamics are so important for evangelicalism because numeric growth this is deeply part of you know the American culture numeric growth is so foundational to the future and the political impact and and how this group relates to basically how the group measures success in many respects is is deeply tied to numeric growth get the gospel coalition conferences together for the gospel look at a lot of these conferences and say who's speaking that probably gives you a good sense of the structure of the elites within this field and I do think this group has had more power concentrated at the senior levels than in some other groups like I think that the progressive evangelicals are a lot more distributed I think the ex-vangelicals are more distributed of course they may develop more hierarchical structures over time you know we'll just see the ex-vangelical things kind of new and so you know I so I think that's that so I think they're this who is the elite I think you've talked about you know big other you're talking about a subdomain of evangelicalism that is predominantly new Calvinist that involves all these people who involve these major organs you know parachurch groups like gospel coalition I forgot to throw that in there etc so that's who we would talk about it yeah the parachurch groups non-denominational churches mega churches I mean mega churches I mean Steve Furtick Elevation Church Hillsong which is a network of churches so these these new type churches you know sort of following the seeker the seeker churches sort of expanded that mold Willow Creek Association for a long time you know had a lot of impact was a very big organization and then lots and lots of smaller lots and lots of smaller parachurch organizations and then within that elite it's a network and individuals within that network you know all equal but they aren't necessarily all powerful either you know again you know Don Carson cannot snap his fingers and pick people do things right he may have a lot of power in the gospel coalition still I had a fun conversation with I don't know if I'll name him the guy who picked me up from the airport when Kovac hit he went from evangelicalism and joined the Roman Catholic Church his daughter was going to a Latin Mass Church and I asked him I thought you know the Pope was gonna shut the Latin Mass down he says no but the bishops have a lot of power the Pope can say what he wants but the bishops have a lot of power over their region so if they want to keep the Latin Mass going they can if they want to keep Nancy Pelosi from taking communion in their in the area of their jurisdiction they can so it's it's interesting even in a formal structure like the Roman Catholic Church the degree to which Cardinals and the Pope have power over local bishops I know he's retired from there but like I still have some influence but like this idea like well you know we'll just we'll just make John Piper do what I say they can't do that it's a network and you know your network you're standing within the network all right you know some some people have more solid than others but you've got to have to you have to be in it and some people have more clout than others and again a lot of that in evangelicalism is about money it's about money it's about followers it's about this you know clout is often the word that's used it's sort of this organic sense of of it's difficult to talk about and therefore in something as implicit and informal as evangelicalism those things have a lot of weight which means again you look at conference speakers you look at book sales you look at all those things so that's kind of who are the evangelical elite and you could think about it in terms of different tribes if you wanted to look at it elites you could look at it different kinds of elites in different subsections of evangelicalism I think one reason that the new Calvinist people get so much press is because these folks have been much better at building connections to secular elite media and that is essentially a force multiplier right for you is when you when you have you know byline or a friendly article in call it you know the New York Times or the Washington Post then you know that makes you look pretty good wow that's pretty impressive this I thought was a great point and it very much gets into this piece written by Mark Galli when he was talking about indeed effective evangelical evangelism has been one motive and it's almost it proves to be an effective strategy but I don't think that evangelicals have been sufficiently self-reflective to admit their basic and personal insecurities I think that's part of the numbers game with evangelicals it's just no fun being an outsider to mainstream culture and whereas Aaron Ren talks about I mean what he described in terms of the success of getting in mainstream publications that certainly was true of Tim Keller I think it's far less true of someone like John Piper or Don Carson and many of the other members of the Gospel Coalition it's very much true of Russell Moore Tish Warren is one who's been in the New York Times quite regularly and so there is this sense of validation not just from numbers but validation from the broader culture and big voice elements of Blue Church or the Cathedral validating these crunchy Christians Christians that would say they believe in that the Bible is the Word of God and they would say that they might you know try to explain that as I would because it's difficult for a lot of people to understand exactly what Christians are talking about they might you know agree with they might talk about the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ they might talk about the Virgin and if they get published in the New York Times then somehow they have achieved something and I can very much understand that it's it's at least a hope of a degree of validation and intelligibility into the public now now Galley in this piece he wrote October I think believe he wrote this up October of 2021 I saw this often when I was at Christianity today for the longest time a thrill went through the office from Christianity today or evangelicalism in general was mentioned in a positive vein in the New York Times or the Atlantic or such other leading mainstream publications the feeling in the air was we made it we're respected and I think Galley is right that there's a there's an insecurity down below which suddenly that is validated by these by this Blue Church and I think the Blue Church again is in many ways the heir to the long-standing Christian nationalism that has been the predominant force in public from the time of the Civil War then into the Roosevelt administration where he brings in Catholics and Jews into the mix and since that time has been getting increasingly secular and over the last number of years has has tended to move much more towards versions of wokeism and which has sort of become there the successor ideology or the replacement religion to this long mainline conversation which I've pointed out in previous videos Galley goes on to say this irritated me because I naturally believe that Christianity today's outlook was superior since it was grounded in the truth of the gospel and not secularism so I often commented that we had things backwards New York Times ought to be thrilled when it gets positive mention of Christianity today but again that's where sort of the marketplace dynamics for a long time secular marketplace has sort of turned a blind eye to the power of Christian media I mean the Bible isn't on the New York Times bestsellers list because it would always be on the New York Times bestsellers list and and because the the all of this evangelical marketplace power is often ghosted by the media but not as much by the politicians because of course the politicians are enormously pragmatic in terms of culling or not culling but seeking a following and that then sets up this dynamic of resentment that you see in the media their evangelical ism is synonymous with republicanism and that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and then then you have insecurity by sort of the left or the mainline church which has been shrinking numerically to a dramatic degree but as was true during the Biden election articles would come forward oh you know we're here to Jack Jenkins book American Prophet so this is a live conversation galley goes on this tendency has only gotten worse as now the mark of successful evangelical writer is to get published regularly in the Times Atlantic and so forth what's interesting about such pieces is that a such writer makes a point that affirms of the secular publication on topics like environmental care racial injustice sexual abuse etc. and be they preach in such pieces that evangelicals should take the same point of view this is where we're going to get into this question of leadership especially connected to get this word a Gregor but I don't want to use it I really want to use much more Christian nomenclature and I think principality kind of emergent principalities that arise from communities in terms of the communal conscious thinking together a believing together signaling each other and so you know all of those status dynamics that go into creating a creating a spirit up from below emerging from a community and very much then leaders emerge through this and leaders have both a a sense of being able to articulate the spirit of the community to embody the spirit of the community and then to represent that community to the other spirits and the other communities out there in the world that's what these that's sort of the relationship between the elites and the leaders and the spirits as they emerge from these communities in it now if however you would sort of like to if if you're very interested in saying well I sort of came to the party with these conservative evangelicals but now the New York Times and the Blue Church and all of these are sort of the cool kids I'd rather say upgrade my friend group and go over with them because if I can you know be with David Brooks you know it's interesting like Ross Douthat being a Roman Catholic the Roman Catholic dynamic seemed quite different I'd love to hear from you know someone like Kale Zeldin to see what he thinks about it because Kale is someone I think that pays a lot of attention to this realm or or maybe Rod Rear so this tendency has only gotten worse as now a mark of successful evangelical writers to get published regularly in the Times Atlantic and so forth what's interesting about such pieces is that such writers make a point that affirms that I already read that of these writers are really interested in getting those evangelicals to change their mind the last place they should be is in the mainstream press and this is a great point better try to get a column published and the most and most popular Pentecostal outlet charisma ah but that would do nothing to enhance the prestige of evangelicals among the cultural elites because again for Pentecostals it's a lot different Pentecostalism is in many ways sort of a firm no you know it's it basically it says to secularism read the hand no I don't care you're you know you're of the devil it's it's much more different embodiment of fundamentalism that is much more willing to stand up to the blue church and say no I reject you I don't really care what you think of me you know we have the power of God's Spirit God's Spirit is present we have miracles going on we're just gonna go forward and we're gonna vote the way we want we're gonna believe the way we want I don't really care what is in the New York Times anyway don't even read it so again you have all of these nuances of all of these of all of these different communities and this then gets into the leadership point because again these emergent spirits that people are participating in and people are creating you need leaders you need elites who can voice give voice to the community and the community rallies around them and and so those are the sorts of things that I think you know give them a lot of standing they got they got that a lot of big names there so next question is are they doing a good job and I think this is where like I think and this is the part of the video I was very interested in because of course you have to evaluate them well evaluate them according to what it depends on if your goal is to get the affirmation and validation of the New York Times or if your goal is to get the affirmation and validation of the community that in a sense brought you to the dance the community whose spirit has sort of found the leader and the leaders have been producing the community and up and up and up they've risen within this marketplace of competing communities and competing leaders all very implicit it's highly diverse in terms of you know whether or not they are doing a good job I think you have to look at the individuals I think some people are doing a very lousy job and you know I would use Russell Moore as an example that it's interesting that you know Russell Moore is such an interesting example because of course Russell Moore had a major falling out with the Southern Baptists and he might have recorded this before Russell Moore left but again Trump as we've talked about before Trump was sort of a boundary water or sort of a continental divide with respect to many of these communities now here's part of the dynamic though is that you rise up with this emergent spiritual this emergent spirit that becomes the community leaders always have sort of a dual role on one hand they they need to speak for the community out to the world and engage with the rest of the world on behalf of the community but there's also a role of of trying to improve the community and I would say Russell Moore is probably someone who said you wanted to improve the community but what really happened was a very different dynamic and I think that's what goes into Aaron Wren's evaluation of him and you know in the mere fidelity podcast you know Alistair Roberts defends Russell Moore he's like you know Russell Moore may not feel that his job is essentially to defend his people he feels his job is to declare the gospel you know maybe he feels and and so there's the dynamic so is the job of the leader to represent the people to defend the people to be a part of the people and help that emergent spirit contend with the other rival and competing spirits now when you say sort of present the gospel that it's almost a a churchified monarchical vision well I'm just going to sort of go up above and not be a part of the community because of course all of these communities have their own articulation and expression and ideas about how they see the gospel and they've voiced those and so you know what you had in Russell Moore's case was well this was very common among certain evangelical groups didn't like that many of his people were supporting Trump which obviously should not have come as any surprise and so then came out against them and then was therefore alienated and suddenly you know Trump had more clout than he did it's sort of a heat check you know the NBA finals are going and guy hits two three four three pointers and then he just keeps chucking up three pointers and missing and so and this of course is the rise and fall of leadership and communities sometimes people have to so sometimes people have to well they have to voice their conscience and so this this these two roles the role of of speaking for the spiritual the emergent spirit of this community on one hand but on the other hand there's also the sense of audience capture that once a person and you see this once a person not within the church realm but some people might think about Dave Rubin who's always given a hard time for this type of thing but once a person gets to a certain point if the person sort of has the sense of becoming just an available voice for whatever his audience wants him to have you also lose credibility so what happens with leaders is they sort of maintain that edge it's sort of like an order chaos edge with respect to the mind of the emergent spirit that goes up and good leaders sort of intuitively stay right at that edge and are able therefore to improve the community and continue to let the community not get soft or stale or bored but help the community continue to rise that's really what good leaders do but obviously if they stray too far from the narrative of the community and they violate at least a sense of the part of the community then this mass that has been able to cohere and sort of go up and up and up then it begins to fall apart or it finds another leader to continue its journey through it's that way now but you know back in 2015 when he was writing articles in the New York Times trashing you know evangelicals voted for Trump which by the way 80% of them did you know he was actually the paid representative of the SBC right he ran their policy lobbying arm basically he was the chief policy officer of the SBC essentially so yeah his job actually was to rep his people and instead he trashed him and this idea that now that trashing business we're going to come back to because that's a key thing that has repeated again and again that we have elites who we have elites who hate the emergent spirit that has elevated them and given them elite status and there's resentment there's condescension there's pride there's all of these things and once you once you look down on the emergent spirit that has energized your community well that that condescension you're there it that spirit is going to turn on you turn on you. The elites you know do not have to you know identify with you know represent etc. The people that they purportedly lead I think is arguably the most pernicious idea in America today we have an elite that views themselves as completely apart from the people in many respects very much very few of them make it very clear they do not like you know large chunks of the American people and that's a real problem in our country you know. Now in and of itself that's so I'm thinking about Jesus if you're an evangelical Christian he should be the the big example he's the Sunday school answer what's the answer to every question Jesus Jesus was not captured by his audience he's the son of God so you know he but Jesus was not captured by his audience but then you face the consequences so for example John 6 you know unless you drink my blood and eat my body you can have no part of me okay they all leave that that's that's what happens and you know obviously for Jesus it was the right thing to say only time tells whether or not for Russell Moore it's the right thing today many to say many leaders over long periods of time go through these ups and downs and of course you know Aaron Renns evaluation is this is evaluation. When you have elites that are so disconnected and often hostile to as with you know Russell Moore hostile to the very people whose ties are paying his salary so I think the people who are going into these secular publications. And this is the same with pastors I mean it's exactly the same deal with pastors and pastors rise and fall and and you know pastors have to watch their own conscience and figure out what they are willing to and what they are not and that's the same dynamic. And trashing other Christians are definitely people who are not doing good things and I believe they actually you know do have a duty to think about the people that they purport to lead now not everybody is an institutional leader. Right not everybody's an institutional leader but if they're a Christian leader they in fact do have an obligation to love the people they are leading and contempt is not an expression of love. And you may differ I mean every pastor I know has issues with the flock that he is leading it by nature of a shepherd you you encourage the sheep to do things they don't want to do. But you lay down your life for the sheep you love the sheep and so once the sheep get the sense that you don't love them and you they might disagree with what your opinion of their best interest is but if they have a sense that you are on their side. You might have some differences but you are on their side. They'll stick with you but if you let's say took the church girl to the dance and now you want to go home with the New York Times girl. No they will not tolerate that. More is definitely on the you know far end of the spectrum because he held a position as the head of the policy arm of the SBC but a lot of the people have essentially major roles as well and you need to be able to get the people that you love to do the work. I think other people are doing quite well. Kevin D Young you know send that lifebooks and everything podcast I think he is doing a really great job. I think he is a guy who's sort of starting to discern this new cultural moment which we find ourselves. Okay that's key he's discerning the new cultural moment and because the role of the elite the role of the leader the reason they put him up the hierarchy and Jordan Peterson terms the reason he's pushed up the hierarchy is because there's a sense in the community that he with his voice with his words with his actions and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice and his voice is incarnating and embodying the spirit the emergent spirit of the group and when they sense that they will support him they will buy his books they will go to his conference they will tell their friends I like Kevin DeYoung I like what he's doing they will follow him. Now I'm using emergent spirits as in as neutral way as possible because again there's lots of competing spirits and the goal of course is to figure out well what is the spirit of God and what should we do and they're all vying for that but it's very much an emergent ground up property where they're sensing that seeking that. And he has actually been changing and adapting and trying to speak into it in very powerful ways. And also notice the speaking into it so you're not only speaking for the emergent spirit you're speaking to the emergent spirit and you get an echo back and forth from it and then you know then you continue to rise and that's how the leader catalyzes the movement and helps it move forward and it has to do that of course in engagement. With the environment the competition the allies all of those other elements of it. His profile is rising in part because he is doing that he is figuring out how to adapt to this very different circumstances that we have and you know he's changed it's not just that he's sort of figuring out how to contextualize things he's a guy who's changed. You know when I started the Masculinist way back when whenever that was one of my very earliest readers attended his church in Michigan is like Aaron I got to find a way to put you in touch with my pastor Kevin DeYoung. This guy is so blue pill he's so bad and I've actually many times cited an article that DeYoung wrote back in 2011 called Dude Where's My Bride. Dude Where's My Bride it's got a lot of dude where's your bride it's got a lot of quotable stuff in it but you know I need to stop citing that article I think I'm just going to make it make a note to myself here don't cite that article anymore. And it was first it was 10 years ago I don't know for sure obviously and I wouldn't expect him to publicly disavow it but I think you know what Kevin DeYoung probably wouldn't write that article today. I think he's changed I mean now he's talking a lot about substantive complementarity of the genders I'm like oh tell me more about that I wasn't hearing that out of them back then maybe he was but I feel like he's really upgraded his software right in some important ways and like oh yeah now I see that we have to take stronger stands on these other issues where maybe in the past we were trying to triangulate the triangulation is not going to work anymore. Hey maybe we need to just upgrade our software and be a little more bold and he is he is being bold and so I put you know Kevin DeYoung on the definitely moving in the right direction list doing a good job with an evangelicalism. Then there's another group of people that I think are the old kind of retirement age boomer leaders like Keller and Piper who I think have struggled to adapt to what I'd called the negative world this new cultural moment. And again I think he's right here I think because there again there's this emergent spirit that has elevated them but that spirit is struggling and especially when you have a demographic where your demographic is aging out you have a culture which values the young and the new rather than the old and the traditional and so you're going to have struggles with that. You know the ground really shifted under the feet I think of the church in in recent years and these guys have sort of not been able to adapt to it and so they are becoming much much more the target of criticism that they never received in the past. I mean I've been following Tim Keller since probably 2010 and you know even as recently as 2015 like I never heard anybody criticize this guy anybody and I mean if you criticized Tim Keller people would be like oh my gosh you criticized Tim Keller. And anybody who then did start to wade into a little critical waters like they had to spend 25 minutes affirming all the things they love about Tim Keller before they could make the one little tweet. And you know part of this I think also a lot of what a lot of where Keller has gotten pushback has been on Twitter and Twitter. Be careful with Twitter. Be careful with Twitter. It's one thing if you're spending you're doing a 20 minute sermon or you're doing an hour long talk or you're doing a two hour podcast but 240 characters of a time even if you put in a thread off the cuff it's a pitfall. This guy was really seen as just this kind of super duper good he had no critics. Now he's got a lot of critics. He's got a lot of critics. And I think Piper was always more controversial in some circles but now it's like I'm seeing videos from people like John Piper here my brother Christ man I love you and like what are you doing man. And so people are kind of turning against him and it's not I think it's criticism these guys have you know they've gone liberal they're pivoting laughter doing this and you know I really don't think that. I mean again if you go back and listen to Tim Keller's 2010 Lausanne conference speech I don't think he's changed anything since then. In many ways. I agree 100 percent with Ren. I haven't seen Keller change and again if you understand where Keller comes from he's that cake is baked that cake is baked. You know his writing his speech was prescient when he talked about hey you're going to have perpetual struggles around multiculturalism in urban churches it's just going to be you just better expect that. I think I think he's been incredibly constant now you know he did kind of I think try to incorporate Charles Taylor and some of the things that he read later but for the more or less he's same guy saying the same things and some. And I listened to care to color very carefully between 2006 and 2012 2011 2012 and I did notice you know it was often with Keller before he got to know someone like some of the early things he said about NT Wright were rather dismissive after he had read NT Wright a little bit more he was quite a bit more. Affirming same thing with Charles Taylor first it was he made comments about Charles Taylor that this is a book everybody's reading blah blah blah blah. Later on you know he much more able to integrate Taylor into his his perspective so he has continued he has continued to change but I think Ren's diagnosis here is dead on that the culture changed dramatically. This is this is I think part of what we're going to talk about tomorrow because. When we sort of talk out into the ether. And you realize this having a YouTube channel and you read the comments. And so your perspective of me will be from where you're standing on this planet. sort of talk out into the ether. And you realize this, having a YouTube channel, and you read the comments. People's, your views of me, you can't help but see me from where you're standing. And so your perspective of me will be from where you're standing. And that's always true. And it's very true of someone like Keller. And you know, I'd hate to play the health card, but the guy is struggling for his life battling pancreatic cancer. That isn't incidental either in terms of his ability to perform, I would imagine. It's also that hierarchy's blind and blind. You ride a wave up on this emergent spirit, and you get to a certain height, and you repeat the stories that brought you there. You see this with almost anybody who's achieved a certain degree of status, especially for a long period of time. It's, you know, journey. No matter who's in the band, you play the hits. It's the way this goes. It's on the exact same things as you used to. Piper have been very constant, too. So I don't think these guys have really gone off track or something like that. Not to say that I ever agreed 100% with them, but I think they're really still solid guys. It's just that they have really struggled to speak to the moment. And I've sort of advocated, and maybe this is controversial, that these guys ought to think about stepping back as public intellectuals. That doesn't mean they need to go fishing or whatever, but they're clearly not being effective, and they're actually causing a lot of damage to their own reputations, because they just don't necessarily have, you know, they don't really have the insights. And again, if they thought... This is not a new thing. If you read history, people stock rises and falls. C.S. Lewis by the late 50s pretty much imagined his day had passed. Screwtape letters was a big hit, and the New York Christianity was a big hit, but he gave up writing apologetic work, wrote children's stories, and then the strange relationship with the woman Joy, who would become his wife, and of course C.S. Lewis has never been bigger. So this is the way it goes out in the world of emergent spirits. People were really going off the rails or something. It's worth trashing your reputation. We don't need to worry too much about our reputation if we really think, hey, we're boldly declaring the truth, but stuff like Piper's recent article about if you wanna get vaccinated, but you feel like you can't get vaccinated because you're under all this peer pressure from all these conservative anti-vaccines, I mean, he's speaking into such a niche consideration, and it just doesn't even make any sense, to be quite honest. So at the end, these guys kind of suck all the oxygen out of the room. I mean, everybody knows that America's kind of run by a gerontocracy now, and it's kind of very late silence and early boomers. I've said, I usually say it's the birth years of 42 to 64, excuse me, to 54, 55, 55. They really kind of just run the country. And a lot of these guys have been big shots since the 80s, and they're still kind of big shots today, and they kind of grab the reins of leadership, and they never let go, and they never developed leadership. Here's an error. This is the point Eric Weinstein makes that Rhett is making here. Under them, and I think to some extent, the younger people haven't necessarily asserted themselves either. They've decided, you can't let Tim Keller over function for you for too long. At some point, you gotta stand on your own two feet and take the measure of the time. So I think these guys, to say that they're doing a good job or a bad job, they're not doing a bad job in terms of, I think their theology's all bad, but they're certainly doing a bad job in terms of being able to adapt to the times and find a way to contextualize what they're doing to the moment. They're really struggling with that. So I think there's sort of a big, call it divergence in these things. I don't think we get Tar of the elites. I think you have to look at different people. There's people I think are doing legitimately bad. There's people like DeYoung that I'm very high on because I think they're really stepping up. Then there's some other guys that I think are struggling, and maybe they'll turn the corner. Maybe those guys can figure it out, but it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks. I think having built their whole ministry on a set of operating principles X, it's very hard to come into a completely new era. It's like being an old, I came from a technology background, so it's like being an old mainframe guy, an old cobalt coder, and now you're trying to write web apps on your phone. It's like. All right, I'm gonna shift here because there's another video I wanna bring in. I don't know, this is, this, you know, good old, good old critical drinker. He just, who would have thought I could cross Aaron Wren and the critical drinker? Come on, hotel Wi-Fi. All right, here we go. Gotta get the first words in there. You know, one of the charming little phrases that really seems to be doing the rounds these days is toxic fandoms, and holy shit, are they tearing the arse out of this one. Now, fandoms are not that much different from emergent spirits of evangelicalism with respect to elites and leaders and content creators, if we could call ministers something like that. Seems like everywhere you look, there's a tidal wave of hand-wringing, self-righteous op-eds bemoaning the toxic state of whatever fandom is currently in the news. Star Wars, Star Trek, Ghostbusters, Lord of the Rings. Shit, man, even Halo fans are toxic now, apparently. So what the fuck's going on? Why is every fandom suddenly more hazardous to your health than a two-week self-catering holiday in Chernobyl? Well, I don't think this is a lot different from what we're seeing in the evangelical world. I think a lot of the dynamics are very much the same, and I think the drinker actually nails the dynamics pretty well. All of this stuff came to a bit of a head recently when Moses Ingram, one of the main actors in Kenobi, shared a couple of samples of the abuse she'd been getting on Instagram. Nasty stuff that she absolutely didn't deserve, but what's even more interesting is the media firestorm that erupted in the wake of it. Suddenly, articles started popping up everywhere complaining about the toxic state of the Star Wars fandom, how it's riddled with ists and foes, and how something needs to be done, god damn it. Even the official Star Wars Twitter account decided to weigh in on this situation because, you know, insulting your own fan base and lumping everyone into the same basket is a surefire way to get people on your sides. Now, insulting your own people, telling them what to do. Again, the Blue Church. Hollywood, these are the major religious organs in our culture now. The church is, the church, the church has size in America, yes, but these organizations possess the commanding heights of the culture, and well, the dynamic I think is very much the same. If I was a cynical man, I'd say it almost looks like this controversy wasn't just something they were prepared for, it's something they were practically counting on. Because if you're able to focus everyone's attention on allegations of abuse and discrimination against one of your actors, then suddenly all the actual criticisms of your show get conveniently forgotten about. All the active, all the actual and potential criticisms of the church are conveniently forgotten about. Yeah, yeah. This, I watched this video, I listened to Aaron on the airplane, I thought I wanted to do a video and I wanna talk about that. Came back to the hotel room, opened up the YouTube and top left corner, oh, the critical drinker has a new thing out, toxic fandoms don't hear much about that. I listened to it, it was like, wow. This is evangelical leadership. Because let's be honest here, who cares about the opinions of a group of toxic haters that were never gonna be happy anyway? But here's who cares about the opinions of all of those Trump voters who, yeah, and they voted for Trump because of, yeah, same reasons that, you know, they don't like what's happening with all of their favorite fandoms. Here's the problem, the overwhelming majority of the criticism for this show had absolutely nothing to do with one particular actress, much less the innate characteristics she was born with. Based on pretty much every video and Twitter post that I've seen on this subject, people are annoyed because it's becoming increasingly obvious with every passing episode that Kenobi isn't really about Kenobi. It's just another example of Lucasfilm milking a popular legacy character for their name recognition, then altering their personality, removing most of their agency, charisma, resilience, skill, and intelligence, and generally diminishing them so they can play second fiddle to the new original character that the show is actually focused on. And I think that... I can't tell you how often I saw young pastor come into an established church and it's a whole nother vision for what the church should be. Ha, churches bite back. Infamous tweet from the official Star Wars account gave away more than they'd intended. Now pay attention 007 because this bit's important. They are excited for Reva's story to unfold. I think that tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the writer's intentions here. The show might... And don't overlook the power of nostalgia. I've brought up nostalgia repeatedly. Clay Rutledge's conversation with Jordan Peterson. Clay Rutledge having studied nostalgia. Yeah, yeah. Because, well, I love to tell the story, the old, old story that I have loved so well. No, this is the story. This is what you should pay attention to. But they love the old, old story. They love the old, old songs. No, but we're going to be prophetic. Well, if you're gonna be prophetic, pay attention. Don't they lose their lives outside of Jerusalem? No, I wanna be the kind of prophet that gets celebrated in a Pepsi commercial with a Kardashian or a Jenner. No, that's not how it works. You wanna be prophetic? You're gonna have to be willing to drink from the cup. It might be called Kenobi, but it's actually Reva's story. It's a classic bait and switch tactic to drum up interest in something that most people wouldn't have given a shit about. Lucasfilm have been lying to their own fan base, promising one thing, but delivering something else. And now that they've been found out, what do they do? Well, they could take the criticism on the chin, acknowledge that what they delivered may not have been what was promised, and ask people to judge the show on its own merits. Or they could create a manufactured controversy to simultaneously draw attention away from their devious skullduggery and publicly discredit their most vocal critics. I wonder which one they chose. It was basically the same deal with Star Trek Discovery. A lot of people had some pretty valid criticisms of main character Michael Burnham, namely that she was a very obvious retcon inserted into a storyline that she was never meant to be part of, that the writers diminished and undermined established legacy characters to elevate her to borderline messiah who solves almost every problem single-handed, or that she generally comes across as arrogant, self-righteous, disrespectful, impulsive, and insubordinate without ever answering for these flaws. And the problem, if you're going to bring in a new character, as it were, better pan out. If your new direction towards the kingdom isn't really bringing the new life and whatever it is you're promised it's going to bring, they're not going to keep going along with you. No, clearly toxic fans just hated her because of her gender and skin colour, ignoring the fact that there's been decades of popular characters of every race, sex, and species long before St. Michael was ever dreamed up. Or how about Ghostbusters 2016? Were fans angry because the studio shit-canned a sequel they'd been wanting for years and instead delivered a dumb, cartoonish, painfully unfunny reboot that absolutely nobody asked for, directed by a man with zero understanding of the subject matter? Or did they just hate it because women bads? Or how about Rings of Power? Do you think Tolkien fans are pushing back against the show's very obvious attempts to twist and alter the lore of a classic and beloved fantasy world and infuse it with divisive 21st century sensibilities and ideology? Or do you think they just instinctively lose their minds at the prospect of different levels of melanin being shown on screen? What all this comes down to is another little phrase that started to pop up quite a bit in recent years. Crafting the narrative. See, most people aren't really driven by dry facts and figures and data points because those things have to be studied in detail and understood and interpreted and all of that takes time and effort. And that's a real problem because people today are usually too busy, too distracted by a dozen other demands on their attention or just too fucking lazy to do actual research of their own. What they need. And so if you actually think that the way your emergent spirits vote is a problem, you're probably not going to actually love and help them just by being a jerk to them. In fact, if you want to lead, you're going to probably have to do so. Especially if you're sort of on the winsome end of things. Dealing with the emergent spirit that brought you to the prom, it's not a good time to jettison the winsome. Need instead is something that generates a visceral emotional reaction to get them engaged. A series of extreme sensationalized examples strung together into a simple, cohesive, easy to digest opinion, i.e. a narrative. And if that opinion happens to line up with what they already believe because they've been told the same thing by a bunch of other sources, then so much the better. And that's exactly what we're seeing now. A very obvious attempt to craft a new narrative and use it to shame and ridicule anyone who dares to criticize their work. This movie isn't actually shit. It's just the work of toxic fans who are never happy with anything. This character isn't badly written, unlikable, or awkwardly inserted into a story they don't belong in. It's just toxic fans who can't stand to see diversity or inclusion. This act... And this is what you hear by the, you know, poor elite got canned by his own people. It must be all the fault of his people. But as Christians, Jesus didn't come down to earth and say, it's all the fault of these people. Well, you knew they were in trouble. Isn't that why you came? And really this dance of leadership is to figure out, well, what can you do to help them? After they didn't deliver an unconvincing performance or make a bunch of dumb statements in real life, the backlash against them is just down to a fundamentally toxic fandom. Every single time, the same accusations of bigotry and toxicity get flung around like monkeys throwing their poo at each other. But what does any of this actually accomplish except to piss off and alienate the very people that you're trying to appeal to? Moderate... Yeah. Fans who might've had a few issues with shows like Kenobi, but generally still support new Star Wars projects, are gonna feel like they're being unfairly labeled as something that they're not. People who were already hostile to Disney and Lucasfilm are gonna have their opinions vindicated by a company that seems determined to antagonize them. This constant cycle of social media sniping, suspiciously timed hit piece articles and preachy opinion pieces only serves to contribute to a general atmosphere of animosity and resentment between fans and studios. And remember, it's sort of an emergent spirit that you have to always sort of, can't be too captured or they'll get bored with you and figure out that you're a mercenary sycophant, can't be too critical, but you have to be critical in the right way. Now, what is that right way? Well, that's the secret sauce of leadership. So yeah, Aaron Ren and the critical drinker. Well, it's now after midnight and done two videos today. Like I said, I didn't know how many videos I would do when I was gone. And well, here's at least two. So one for today and one for tomorrow. So let me know what you think.
