 Hi, this is Paul. Yesterday I did a video on Kanye and in that video I just sort of dropped in the middle this comment from Sam from the Discord server. Sam has his own channel. Sam is our resident Christian, sort of evangelicalist Christian, but non-trinitarian and so you know we've had a we had Sam's been a very interesting person in our community. Sam's also really sharp and watches things carefully and knows a ton of church history. That's why I don't debate him on some of this stuff because he's read far more than I have and and he sort of made an offhand comment about Brett Weinstein's moral matrix which rang a bell in my head and so often with these monologue videos I mean this I I know for Jordan Peterson a lot of what he did you know felt like thinking out loud and to the degree that it was and it wasn't I can't really tell you I'm not saying he was insincere it's just sort of his style according to some people who are closer to him and know him well that I've spoken with these videos for me are really thinking out loud and so when Sam said that in the Discord server it really rang a bell and so I've been chewing on it and actually saw Sam wrote up a little bit on it this morning on the Discord server again. Where does this come down to? Well Brett Weinstein talks about evolution as a genocidal spelling bee where it's not even just because each of us doesn't just have one genetic code well we sort of do but there are all these other little elements competing within the genetic code in sort of a fractal way and so and that's a really clever I mean whatever critique I give to Brett and Eric Weinstein these dudes are scary smart you can't sit and listen to these guys and not just realize that they are you know flat-out geniuses now being a flat-out genius doesn't mean you get everything right in fact the smarter you are the more you see hopefully the more you realize how much you're not seeing and the more open you are to learning now not every genius is that way but I've been impressed with these two in terms of their capacity for conversation with people different from themselves and so his his take on evolution as a genocidal spelling bee is really clever but then in his conversation with Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan about his metaphorical truth he talks about this repugnant morality and this this triggers this ongoing atheist Christian debate about morality atheists can't ground their morality and we're gonna get into that a little bit now I do read my comments and a number of you have said I'm unfair to Sam Harris with respect to this maybe I am I don't know I'm trying I'm not trying to be unfair to Sam Harris but I'm listening very carefully especially to Sam's interchanges with Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson because there are significant hours of conversation between Jordan and Sam and Brett and Sam and they all seem to be friends and so I don't think they're trying to straw man each other and I think Brett's conversation with Sam Harris on Brett's podcast was particularly enlightening that Brett can't seem to see through this what I see as a as a inconsistency in Sam's position between the manifest image and the scientific image I think as CS Lewis says of many of CS Lewis's contemporaries Brett just kind of BS is his way through I don't and maybe I maybe I'm not seeing it maybe I haven't read enough of him maybe I haven't heard enough of him but he hasn't seemed to been able to convince Jordan Peterson and Brett Weinstein that there's a massive inconsistency in his system and Jordan and Brett are both smarter than I am they both have read more of his I've listened to him carefully are his friends are not being unbiased are very much not trying to straw man in but they can't seem to figure out the the logic that that Sam Harris brings to his system so yeah maybe I'm being unfair I don't know but based on both Brett and Jordan trying to get to the bottom of Sam's way of getting around the fact value distinction the fact the fact value you know problem that materialism has I think I don't I'm sort of with team Brett and team Jordan on this that I don't think Sam has this figured out anyway and that gets into the question and without a God well why would a God change why would a God afford a certain level of morality because on one hand a God is outside the system and you know get into my conversation with Brett Sockold a God is outside the system in terms of theism and the the God also is is within the manifest image operates fully in terms of normativity has the God picks and chooses and decides what's right what's wrong what he prefers what he doesn't prefer is a judge yada yada yada and that just lights up an entire moral system and so theism and morality go hand in hand even poly theisms and morality but the morality might be pegged on the particular divinities the particular competing divinities for a grander larger moral system and that's where the meta divine realm Christine Hayes Ezekiel Kaufman that's where all that stuff comes into play because in a sense you know as I've said earlier my god number one god number two these are these are sort of boxes on my philosophical theological workbench and and I throw a lot of things into them so god number one is less personal god number two is definitely personal god number one is built into the fabric of the world god number two is transcendent and stands apart from the world imminent transcendent and lately in terms of verve keys agent arena relationship god number one is the agentic aspect of God are the arenic aspect of God part of my promise I always must speak so the arenic aspect of God is God as arena God number two is the agentic aspect of God in terms of the Hebraic Christian formulation of of who and what God is and the difficulty that you have if you only have an arena is that morality for the agents is pegged especially in Sam Harris's view to the well-being of that moral agent in other words what is moral is what is to pursue your own agenda as an agent notice the words coming together agents have agendas agentic agent agenda these things are all lining up and you know this stuff is built into language and and so what is the basis for any morality where success is the outcome of adaptation sort of and this really begins to align well with Jordan Peterson's Darwinian truth where morality and truth sort of come together so part of the problem with morality and individual agents and competing agents now remember these agents us as individuals we pile up and create principalities communities and and so well then you have the the agency of the community and the morality of the community and and basically morality becomes you know that which is best adaptive for the success or the well-being or the welfare of that community in competition with other communities and and so it's and so this is this is sort of where I I bump into Brett on one hand saying you know it's successful but it's repub repugnant morally so his his morality is sort of off-site or offshore of the success and and and so then you know where does Gnosticism come into this well Sam certain and Gnosticism is more of a family of beliefs and and there are lots of different families out there but common is off where often the the assertion that there are that the world is and this is very polytheistic again the world is created by competing different gods and so if you look around and you notice we're living in the age of decay decay is all around us people die people break down things aren't stable well maybe the world was created by a demiurge that is that that was what that was a dumber more foolish copy you know Manichaean ideas get into some of this is a very strong dualism and where you know the world was made by a stupider God but there's a better more moral God that is a higher God and so you need to transcend you need to your physicality and get up now get up out of it now Brett Weinstein is a is a materialist or a naturalist and so there's there's no second level to transcend up into like the Greeks had or like Gnosticism had but but he sort of continues to appeal to it and and again this is where he sort of this is the Christian tell in this or again John Vervecky wrote you know Platonism what do they teach these days I mean come on Brett read a little Plato you want your you want you want some Platonism to afford you morality but you deny its ontology so so that's that's that's sort of where the Gnosticism and again I'm more than open to a a reformulation I'm not looking to straw man Brett here but just to point out an aspect of his metaphorical truth moral argument that that he made with with Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson now this brings us to Daniel Bonavac and his his take on Wilfred Sellers and the manifest versus scientific image that's a powerful take and again I got this via Dr. Jim that's a powerful take where Wilfred Sellers notes that the the thing that the scientific image image doesn't afford is normativity and there's no room for normativity in the scientific image should the speed of light be higher or lower than it is should be j big G gravity be higher or lower than it is should you know and you'd say well it should if you want to well that's right it's tellic it it seeks an end it seeks a tell-off so if you're going to afford human life in the shape that we have then these these big constants should be finely tuned just right to afford these things but there's nothing in science that said it should be this and not that should be this and not that is only living in a world where there is tell-offs where things are pursuing some other outcome or agency and this is where you get the fact value distinction and and this is really the the hard problem you can't get to an opt from it is and this is really the hard problem for materialists because well you know you can't say that you can't say in a sense that human human beings as we know them today ought not to go extinct by virtue of pick your poison nuclear annihilation global climate change you know maybe some supernova too close to us you know whatever human beings should not go extinct there's no place for that in the scientific village scientific village vision just as you know tyrannosaurus rex shouldn't have gone extinct you know that that shouldn't is built within a whole system of things and that's where you have your your fact value distinction now in I played a little clip two videos ago from Jordan has them a B in terms of Vancouver to I usually call it Vancouver one get Vancouver to because the the conversations were Brett that the conversations were Douglas Murray was sort of in between they went sort of in different directions and I think Brett was a really good conversation partner to for this certain realm of of things that they're dealing with and so they had the first conversation in Vancouver and then the second and of course it's sort of like with football or basketball at halftime the coach goes in and you know reassesses and you're gonna come out you're gonna change your game and and so in Vancouver to Jordan really starts going after Sam in terms of in terms of his his well-being the first one he's really making the argument about this a priori structure and the second one he really goes after him in terms of well-being and he says okay and Sam has this riff about as bad as possible take away all meaning but again even how Sam is setting it up he's he's giving away the show in some ways I didn't want to talk too much about Sam in this one but you argue that hell is bad and heaven is good okay but you've so is hell bad if you imagine hell to be a fireplace of white-hot thing well hell isn't bad if you're running a blast furnace and you're trying to create steel what you've done if you if you is you've smuggled in preference telos and consciousness into the system things that are not in the scientific vision because again as Jordan Peterson lays out in in the transliminal videos before his before his rise to fame and if you haven't watched those transliminal videos some of those interviews with another Jordan there's some of the best interviews that Jordan had done and they happened right before obviously his wave you know carried him into new places but but you're smuggling in all sorts of things and so in that Jordan Peterson lays out his his Darwinian truth and and and lays out the fact that part of the way that that the scientific image gets so powerful is it covers one eye so you take out consciousness and you take out telos and you just try to see things for what they are and you try and reduce the variables and get down to you know to discrete processes so on and so forth now this is where well-being becomes tremendously problematic because you have consciousness and you have preference and you have telos and you have meaning you have all of that in the system and that's where you know just look at Buddhism and well what is suffering is created by basically by attachment to attachment to things and now again I really like John Vervecki's treatment of Buddhism and his awakening from the meaning crisis but and I you know in in the discord server today some people were talking and I know this has been an ongoing problem to get into Vervecki you have 50 hours of meaning crisis videos to watch and not everybody can do that and even just going through them once is difficult so I do recommend Andrew Sweeney's blog on medium where he where he takes he distills awakening from the meaning crisis into a smaller thing part of the difficulty and there's a there is a good discord server that's dedicated to awakening from the meaning crisis I think that the difficulty that many on the bridges of meaning discord server have is that John's work can get really esoteric sometimes because John is developing a new vocabulary and the thing is if you want to make progress you need to develop a new vocabulary the difficulty is is that if you want to use that new vocabulary have to learn that new vocabulary and live into the new vocabulary and if you've ever learned a second language as an adult you begin to realize that your your biggest impediment to learning the second language is your first language and so you know maybe I should do a and my adaptation of John's as job calls them fancy vervecki words is is probably bent and corrupted by my own uses just of it and and so you know it's interesting whenever John vervecki and Jonathan Peugeot talk you know when I talk with the first only time I talked with the three of them I went into that conversation with a conscious goal of trying to interpret them for a broader audience because the conversation before when they talked they both just got increasingly esoteric and it's like oh boy you got the Eastern Orthodox and the neo-platinist and off they go up into the heavenlies so anyway so Jordan Peterson in biblical series one with respect to this meaning crisis he notes that okay we watch each other and we act it out and and archetypes are drama plus representation and and these again you get back into the sacrifice and and the the culture net stream and the genetic stream get intermingled with human beings very quickly because all of this manifest image stuff begins to shape the genetics for human beings work very very very very very very very very very slowly and culture that is is enormously fast and enormously powerful and you know you've all Harari talks about this in his books in terms of you know the fiction so he talks about the culture net stuff as a fiction I talk about the culture net stuff as as religion W and I know sometimes I've said L and I'm misspeaking but I don't know why I would say L but religion W that's worldview religion so that's and that moves intensely fast and it's enormously powerful and it it very quickly colonizes the the genetic realm and so when Jordan Peterson really in biblical series one which is the most watched and I think actually the best of the series lays out what religion is for him and it's religion W and and so basically this is why Jordan Peterson I think is so important because he he like Tom Holland is you know he's got the skin knees in the dark cave as he's feeling his way through it and so now evolving we have to talk about evolving morality and religion W which is religion worldview and religion S which is religion from the secular point of view it's all about the should okay what is should it's it's this for that so right right away we're getting into agency so creatures that are operating in the realm of should need to be agents because I should do this and not this which means I could do this and not that and so when you listen to Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris go at it this is where Brett just keeps hammering him and no no Sam keeps saying no you don't understand yeah it's quite clear a whole bunch of us don't understand Sam the easiest way to understand a should is to have a telos I should take I5 and the Altamont if I want to know the way to San Jose okay from Sacramento so I go down the five I go over the Altamont and then you know that's one way or I could go down 80 and do 680 but then I got to go through Oakland and all the East Bay stuff and that traffic it's really crazy and since the traffic in the valley is less bad than the traffic in the East Bay do I know the way to San Jose yes I take five and I go over the Altamont and I weave my way through and then if I want to go to Santa Cruz I go up over the mountain and I get to beautiful Santa Cruz where my son is going to school so that's how you should go that's there's a way you should get through a cornfield all of this should is part of the manifest image and and you know how should we live that's not a scientific question that's a manifest image question hell should you avoid hell well if you're not you know making chromium steel yes because flesh burns and fire the worm does not consume etc etc heaven to achieve and so there's the telos that's it's held to avoid and heaven to achieve and of course this is deeply built into Western Christianity for a very very long time and someone brought up that the because I brought up in my video about primogenitor and primogeniture is the preference of the first born in terms of the inheritance because I told the story of the of the prodigal son and so the first born a man has two sons the first born in the second born the first born will get a double portion of the inheritance and the second born will get you know basically what's left over and if you have more children the first born still gets a double portion and someone mentions quite rightly well and let's do let's do a Brett Weinstein move here and talk about well how would pre-machanical pre-machanical develop well it's not very hard to imagine pre-machanical developed as a way to avoid splitting up farms or estates into unproductive tiny portions if you had too many sons well in some ways the oldest son is the is the longest living image of the father and so the oldest son is the imprint of the father there's lots of layers to this and of course sometimes sons die and so you take the oldest son but the oldest son is always the longest living image of the father that's what an oldest son is by definition the younger sons haven't lived as long as the oldest son and if the father is still alive the oldest son has more experience with the father now sometimes in families the older son maybe is alienated and exiled and he might pre-machanical might be broken he might give the inheritance to someone else yada yada yada all these things happen but pre-machanical makes sense it's let's say it has a historical sociological evolution in that sense not genetic evolution but culture net evolution as an evolutionary basis because if you look at competing groups and one group is practicing and the other group is not practicing pre-machanical and the farms are getting split up into smaller and smaller portions so that the civilization as a whole is not flourishing as well as the other civilization in their competition the civilization that practices pre-machanical will out compete the civilization that is not practicing pre-machanical and the idea is that not only are we as human beings have morality see now morality is a very interesting thing because it's public because people who are moral we we shoot up the hierarchy and and we elevate them and people who are immoral we take them down the hierarchy and that's how status works now we're back into Jordan Peterson lobster land because this is built into our system says Jordan all the way back before we could see trees he says to Susan Blackmore bucko needs a little bit of air but I'm not gonna blow him up right now so so this this gets built into us and it gets built into us as as peoples you know Israel is called Israel named after Jacob who is renamed Israel and and so Israel is Jacob and and this is again symbolically this is how it works so so the civilization that practices pre-machanical is out competing the civilization that isn't practicing pre-machanical because and we can we can look at one factor involved in it and there may be more just as again the oldest son is the is the is the time in which the the son will have the greatest imprint of the father so if the father has been very successful in managing the estate the oldest son will have had more time than any of the other sons to watch and manage the state and so the oldest son is the biggest imprint of the father all right so that's there's another reason but one of it might be the the the size of the inheritance lots another one might be the might be the the the amount of time that the the the second son has or the first son has been imprinted unconsciously subconsciously by the father and has learned from all the father's mistakes and so you have all of this local knowledge that gets built into the oldest son that the other sons have not yet had time to imbibe now there might be another son below who is more intelligent than the other son or for one reason or another maybe the father was a bad businessman and the other son is learning from an uncle or a neighbor and he does better and so you know all of this over long periods of time works out but basically the idea is that elements within religion W get imprinted into religion S and the values get perpetuated and they come into societies and individuals get leveled up into societies and some out compete the other and so the idea that Jordan has which Sam recognizes the validity of is that religion W gets encoded into religion S and and this then has wisdom that gets passed on to others and human beings compete with this so a value in a practice develops people who practice it thrive those who don't struggle it becomes a value and is encoded into the religion S systems it's already present in the religion W systems those are much more implicit and and the value is of survival and competition against the others and so again pre-magenator morality is a behavioral value that moves an individual or community towards a desirable or good goal communities that practice it thrive communities that don't dwindle and this gets into all of our little status hierarchies and so you know this is getting played out in Christian churches right now with respect to Donald Trump because back when Bill Clinton was doing his things with Monica Lewinsky Christians all over the place were saying you won't be blessed by that they're making a religious moral case that that sexual morality gets practiced and then into the religious system this gets encoded into well if you're poor morally then you'll have hurricanes and earthquakes and all of that and so you can see how these ideas level up into the kinds of behaviors that eventually were deeply critiqued by the Enlightenment okay so the idea was that if the president as the figurehead is not morally is is not is immoral then God the consciousness will judge the neighbor nation based on the immorality and you can find this in the Bible so David of course sees Bathsheba bathing I'm getting more and more Bible stories into my little videos aren't I David sees Bathsheba bathing and says she's a hottie and Uriah and David is you know if you read the story David is now sending his armies out and he's becoming a fat and lazy king is increasingly corrupt and so while Uriah the Hittite who is one of David's mighty men who is this this this basically this mercenary private army that David uses to take over the kingdom and saves him from Absalom eventually but Uriah the Hittite is out fighting David's battles and Dave was at home and he's kind of bored at home he looks out his window and oh oh there's Bathsheba bathing herself oh why she bathing herself well she probably is cleansing herself after she's had her period and see this is a subtext because she's gonna get pregnant we're actually in this story we're tracking you know they have ideas about the fertility cycle they're not dumb and so she's bathing well what's that mean you know she's cleansing herself after her period and he looks down and wouldn't mind me some of that and so sends a servant says Bathsheba come on up and now we're now it's a me too moment because Bathsheba really can't say no you have a status differential you have a power differential as we like to say so Bathsheba comes and up David lays with her and that's King really shouldn't do that so let's just keep it on the down low and then you know again I'm preaching and committed adultery this week so these things work in my head so so no keep it on the down low but then Bathsheba comes back and says I'm pregnant no abortion so what to do so well David tries to figure out well I need a cover story so you know send you know send word and have Uriah come back on come back for a little bit of R&R a little bit leave haven't be the messenger so send it back and and tell me how things are going from the front okay so he comes back gives a report on how things are going the front great Uriah you're my guy you're a great soldier you deserve some R&R go home and sleep with that hot wife of yours you did probably just say hot wife that would then you know go go home and you know take a little break you ran all the way from the front so but Uriah Uriah unlike David who was fat and happy sleeping with his neighbor's wife Uriah is sleeps outside his door well why would you why would you sleep on what are you homeless no he sleeps outside his door because he's making a statement of solidarity with his troops that are out at the front fighting and meanwhile David is sleeping in a palace this is a problem for David because sleeping at the door Uriah is making the statement I'm not taking advantage of my legitimate claims to sleep with my wife so you know then David thinks crap this is a problem so what to do so Uriah come on over we're gonna have a little feast and I'll get him drunk and I'll get him drunk and you know he's gonna look at his hot wife and you know and that doesn't work so David says all right calls his general over and says I'm sending Uriah back to the front when you're taking that city send him to the place the fighting is the fiercest now he's a tough dude but you can still do it send him to the place where the fighting is fiercest and when it gets really fierce have his buddies pulled back so David uses his kingly power to not only undermine not only to kill this most faithful servant but to undermine the the bonds between the soldiers and the loyalty that David himself is depending on and this is where you see David's corruption and how the corruption how corruption undermines the people who need the structures in order to to maintain the hierarchy all right King you're the king and they do it and Uriah dies and too bad what happened to Uriah he was such a faithful servant I should really do something for his widow it's so upsetting and she's so hot that she but you come and live with me oh you're pregnant I was just consoling you and you know you know and you know if you under understand Leveright no well we'll have a baby and we'll call him your Raya of course all this is going on under the surface and then the Lord goes to Nathan the prophet where the prophet the prophet seats inside our information goes to Nathan the prophet they go to David tell him a story wealthy man had herds and flocks had a neighbor one little sheep family loved it slept with their children was a pet someone comes to the house and it's out of the house of the wealthy man and he doesn't want to dip into his store of herds and flocks and so takes his neighbor's sheep his servants takes his neighbor's sheep and cuts it up for his guest make him look good David what should be done with that wealthy man who did that David gets on his moral high horse that man should die Nathan you are that man child's gonna die the child's gonna die your son David is going to die because of your corruption well if you understand how corruption works the son is going to die for the whole nation because if David doesn't deal with this corruption if David's corruption continues David's it is going to undermine the kingdom because David's already undermined his own kingdom because his general and the soldiers around Uriah they know the deed that's been done and that spreads and David's kingly authority is based on the idea that he is loyal to his servants as they are loyal to him it's reciprocal and so you see you know these moral systems build up and they come out of behavior and they they have reason behind them and and you can see how having and Jordan Peterson talks about this in his series having a God that is above the system and that's why in Christianity the king himself is not God there's always a God above the king there's always someone critiquing the king there's always something outside the moral system and that is a is a hedge on corruption and that's built into the thinking now here's the difficulty if you don't have God number two take God number two out of it you say oh well and and in some ways the American system does this we no one is no one is above the law where was I just talking to homeless dudes says I do drug and counseling I do drug and alcohol counseling every day and nobody does it better than me because he's not sober either anyway where was I oh yeah when it so Jordan Peterson notes that in Christianity it's above the system and then he has these conversations with with Sam about well is there a difference in now we're looking at competing cultures or competing groups and of course these competitions they fractal they go all the way down and they go all the way up is there a difference between groups of people that believe in God number two and so they're expecting crime and punishment they're expecting punishment and reward all of this stuff is built in and like all of these things come because one of the things is that if you're if it's got number one and got number two your whole system is lit up all of your all of your relational abilities every all of your narrative abilities all of those things and so a group that is a group that believes in God number one and God number two they're they're whole in because as you know Jordan Peterson has with his future authoring program they're both running towards a goal and they're running away from something they're looking to avoid and so it's very powerful you can understand that scientifically it's very powerful sociologically psychologically morality is this enormous thing and part of what we've been seeing in our culture is with the rise of woke religion it's purely moralistic I mean the moralism is just all over the place and now part of what happens with human beings is that we find moralists annoying and so for example in the 1970s and 80s part of the complaint about Christianity was and even during the Cold War Christian so so the the cultural alignment and Christian traditional morality were quite a bit in alignment and so Christians were considered sort of prigs and prudes and and and moralists and they were annoying because they're always nagging about the moral morality and now as Christianity has a sort of you know lost status in the culture now new moralists are in their place and the more moralistic they get about things the more people get annoyed and that's that's sort of a natural check on moralism in the culture self-righteousness and again this is all from Christianity built in self-righteousness undercuts morality because basically corruption gets exposed and and so this was a factor when Christianity was quite dominant and now as sort of woke moralisms get really shrill and moralistic people get increasingly turned off and and this is you know where I'm not saying that some of the woke stuff isn't dangerous for the culture but I think it's I think it's too incoherent I think I don't think it will last I don't think it'll be very stable and again if you I think if you want one of the best treatments of that look at Jonathan Peugeot's parasitic storytelling video because I thought that was just a genius video and he laid it out all right there so so morality is a behavioral value that moves an individual or community towards a desirable goal and and usually towards out competing their neighbors and it gets encoded into the religion and there's a God above and you know so so here you can tell a story you can tell a secular story about how religion develops and you know some of that is behind Jordan Peterson's behind Jordan Peterson's work now now Brett wants to talk about the bitter pill and fair enough it's a it's a it's a good point it might be that the context changes so prima genitor is really a powerful thing when most of your inheritance is farmland and as farm plots get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and some of this is built into the the Israelite system where you have the inheritance and the inheritance to stay within the family but now you've got more and more sons and so in a sense that the system of prima genitor starts to break down actually as you flourish in other words it's a really helpful system if you don't have too many sons or the children the sons aren't living etc etc but if in fact you're flourishing the system starts to undercut itself and we see this all the time in many many ways that that some values and some practices have have real good values for certain in car engines certain the power you know sort of the power curve like with a gasoline engine there's always sort of the hesitation when you put your foot on the gas that you don't have with an electric car and then especially if you have a turbocharger you rev up and then once that turbo kicks in it really goes and so it's unevenly distributed depending on how well your group or culture is doing and so prima genitor is like that and so it's very interesting in the Bible that for the most part throughout the cultures of the Bible prima genitor was practiced but if you read in the book of Genesis there's this subtle undermining of prima genitor and there's all and polygamy was commonly practiced in in in Israel you know and and continues to be practiced in Islam partially by virtue of see religions all are also on this curve in terms of how adaptable is it versus how determined is it and now you want to get that formulation right and that formulation is always going back and forth you want it you you want it slow enough that you're not again one of the best things I've really got to find that again I found it again recently because if you go if you change too much you have a problem but if you don't change enough you have a problem so it's always a matter of trying to get the conservative and the progressive balance right in your culture because you need to change enough in order to deal with the contextual changes but you don't want to change too much because you know all the early adopters are in some ways you know they're all the they're all the experiments around there they're all the guinea pigs and you watch enough of them die and who you get a little bit more conservative of course this this then becomes wisdom gets encoded in your morality you should do you this you shouldn't do this you know sexual behaviors and and why do why why does so much it why why is it the fact that religions keep talking about sex and food sex and food are really basic in terms of the genetic and the epigenetic layers for us and this was true long before we had any knowledge of genetics or epigenetics but sex and food are really important what you eat and the sex life of the community and religious religious moral systems really watch those sexual mores because again the the the sexual aspect is where the culture net continues to really churn and change the the the genetic track and so that's part of the reason why religious systems are always looking at sex and the most the most successful religious systems are really looking very carefully at sex and so you tinker with the family at your peril and again it's really interesting where where Brett can you be uber progressive and all of this stuff but you know Donald Trump has a sex life like an ancient Near East potentate he's just kind of following a an evolutionary genetic track where he's you know trying to plant his seed even if he's trying not to plant his seed to plant his seed and the the hottest women available in as many as possible you know why did Donald Trump have beauty contests you don't need someone who knows as much evolutionary biology as Brett Weinstein to understand why Donald Trump got into the beauty contest business okay Mr. Freud I mean there's stuff going on beneath the system Barack Obama was a virtual Puritan you know faithful to his one life good father look at Brett and Heather long-term marriage faithful to each other interested in their sons they're working a very conservative moral system and and Brett and Heather holding each other accountable and keeping themselves locked into this and you know they're only I don't know how many sons they I think they only have sons and I think they have two sons or something like that I know one of the sons is always helping them with their videos but you know so hey I had five children I'm evolution I might I'm acting as if I'm more of an evolutionary biologist than Brett Weinstein but but at the same time hey you got to struggle to feed all those five kids and put them through college and they ain't cheap so and one of the comp one of the complaints about pastors is they always have too many children pastors often have a lot of at least in the Protestant Church anyway so so context changes and so there's always this recalibration within the moral systems and of course when it comes to sex one of the huge changes is the pill now we have pervasive common childbearing has become a conscious choice and there's less accident in it that really changes things and Peterson is dead on right about that and there's even questions about and and in fact Heather Hein got this question about you know to what degree does the the hormonal you know pumping those hormones in to women for birth control well the hormone levels are smaller but I mean and and Brett and Heather understand these you're asking us to do math we can't do well why can't we do it because we're only seeing this tiny little thing and when Jordan Peterson says we've only had the pillow very little time we have no idea what great social experiment we're doing here and the same goes for same-sex marriage and and and now you know I've seen numbers that generation Z you know a quarter a quarter of generation Z especially the women are gender non-conforming well is it the estrogen in the plastics that is doing this is it because I had a I had a friend who was an environmental engineer and he was studying an invasive snail species here in Northern California Ben if you're listening I'm talking about you he went to my church he played the guitar and that was very sad that he decided to go off and teach college someplace but I'll not out him but when I was talking about how you know put put little organisms in a plastic water bottle and the plastic leeches well if you just if we you know it's how is this monkeying with us we have no idea but morality is in there because well we know we've all these basically every time you go into Costco and you see organic or all-natural or your your keto diet or your caveman diet or all of this stuff that's conservatism we're trying to slow down the changes other ways we're trying to speed up the changes and so even if we're not paying attention that all of this is religious this is all happening around us and and so Jordan Peterson says okay well what are archetypes archetypes are drama and coded you know into representations and then they they they get into the mimetic the mimetic channels and they get repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated and so Harry Potter is like Star Wars is like you know and then we look at all the different nuances and such and the realization is and and Peterson says now this realization that that bread is making here that's already encoded into religions this isn't a new idea religions have been adopting and accommodating all along and that was my point about read very carefully the laws in Exodus and read them very carefully in Deuteronomy and you begin to notice hey wait a minute there's change here and then read the Ten Commandments and read the Sermon on the Mount you have heard it said of old this but I say to you what's Jesus doing Jesus is is is is calibrating he's modulating the ancient text and he's updating it and of course depending on when you well actually these texts go very long back you'll say the Davidic period or the the the exilic period I mean these texts they even as they put the texts together biblical scholars today look at the layers within the text and you can see layers within the text and you can see they're always modulating and and biblical scholars note that the text is talking to each other and you'll get Jordan Peterson's big rainbow hyperlink thing about the Bible that these these conversations are always going and then Brett's like hey the context might have changed or it's like yeah they thought about that like three four thousand years ago they weren't dumb they knew that but they're always trying to get the the the the the the achieve preserve you know adapt they try to always always try to get those those formulations right because we need to now one of the things that he says in his video number 50 I know I haven't done the commentary video on that yet I've just been to any other ideas I wanted to get out Christianity is in the phylogenetic tree of Judaism oh use the biology word I haven't had a biology class since I was a I was in high school in a Christian school so we didn't learn evolution I don't pick that stuff up later so Christianity is in the phylogenetic tree of Judaism and Judaism is basically been mimetically impacted by Christianity and someone made a comment you know I almost did a spit take when I heard Brett say that it's really key observation well that's all that I had to look at the phylogenetic tree and I had to do a little digging a little self-educating and you know Andrea with the bangs her superpower is not particularly oh I know what the phylogenetic tree I don't know what it I better look it up and I better learn it that's that's how to be a lifelong learner is to admit admit to what you don't know it's how to be a lifelong learner it's a little bit of wisdom for you it's one of Jordan Peterson's rules act as if the guy that's talking to you might know something that you don't why is that a really smart rule because you can learn from him or her or them a phylogenetic tree is a diagram that represents evolutionary relationships amongst organisms see he adapted it culturally in that little illustration phylogenetic trees are hypotheses not definitive facts the pattern of branching in a phylogenetic tree reflects how species or other groups evolved from a series of common ancestors now again this is this stuff gets really hard because there's a relevance realization aspect to these systems and of course as now we have access to genetics and genetic decoding you know our science is getting better and better and better in this but Christianity is a branch of Judaism that's exactly right because if you get into the Second Temple period especially the destruction of the second temple in 70 AD rabbinic Judaism branches from Christianity but you have someone like the Apostle Paul and if you're on the bridges of meeting discord servers you all know Jacob you know Jacob doesn't like the Apostle Paul see he wasn't a very good Pharisee well it's because Jacob is a really good Pharisee and at least according if you trust anything let's say from the book of Acts some Pharisees went to team Jesus and some Pharisees didn't if you read the book of Acts some people liked Paul and some people wanted to kill him so how good of a Pharisee was Paul well fairly good enough to convince a whole bunch of Gentiles and and God fears as they would call to go on with team Paul and team Jesus and not the other team so you know obvious and then Christianity gets in then into the Roman culture and just you know actually just kind of spread slowly until you get the Constantine and then Constantine changes it again it continues to adapt and Christianity just keeps adapting adapting adapting but the superpower of Judaism is stay but it's always adapting and this is again why number 50 with Brett and Heather talking about Judaism and some of Brett's ideas about the culture and the practices and he's bumping that into up into God number two that's why that video is so interesting and that's why all by all bunch of you were like Paul you gotta watch that video you're he's poking out what you've been taking a stick to yeah that's right he is and so well but if you look at this and you understand this and understand what Brett has been seeing is that well evolution happens in culture as well and and this is Yuval Harari makes the same point in the culture in the culture net level it goes much faster than in the other level now if you go back to my conversations with Adam Friended Adam Friended always wants to talk to me about Brett Weinstein's metaphorical truth evolution yada yada yada and so Brett's always looking for objective morality now Brett's trying to stay within the modernist frame as most of the people resisting wokeness are in some ways their own conservatives and my friend Joey on the discord server makes the argument that a lot of the woke people have their own kind of conservatism too because they were they're trying to preserve the they're trying to preserve the Marxism of the 60s and 70s and bring it into today so they're their own kinds of conservatives there's actually lots of different conservatives but the modernists are saying we need objective morality well what do you mean by objective objective like gravity objective well the problem is that morality is in the culture verse so you're not going to find it like I've got my cell phone in my you're not gonna find it like you find the lens cap okay it's not objective in that way but it's it's it's it's up in the it's up in the symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary that's where it's located that's where morality is located but again it's it's all coming into our behavior so we can see morality because physical beings acted out but this of course highlights the bias the really defeating bias of the materialist system to to only track what can be put under a microscope when really what's governing and what's dominating and what's most real amongst us is stuff going on in the symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary which is governing all of this stuff which is which takes this tiny little cheap let's see if it'll focus this tiny little cheap lens cap and has these little springs and you know we figured out how to make these little lens caps that make them cheap it's freaking amazing and we're a wash in it that's all the power of the speed of the culture net to colonize and dominate the physical world and that's why all of that is in some ways more real than this stuff I can I don't want to break it because I still use this lens cap but I can break it I can do all kinds of things that's why that which is most real endures that which is most real colonizes what colonizes is most real because it determines and and long ago and Peterson is dead on right with this long ago the symbolic dramatic liturgical imaginary colonized the the physical world and the the scientific revolution and all of that has just been speeding it up but that's what's colonizing it and it colonizes us and that's why we have a meaning crisis I feel myself colonized so Adams looking for objective morality and see civilizations and moral competition working through the things of the big picture and that's why where Adam lays out his argument that well you know if the Nazis weren't you know didn't have the symbolic dramatic dramatic liturgical imaginary they had maybe they would have won the war and you when you look at the history of the Second World War is really touch-and-go often but certain elements eventually defeated them just like if David's corruption had been allowed to continue it would have destroyed Israel now that's all encoded in this story with a prophet and a God and you'd better do this and you better do not and the baby gets sick and the baby dies and it's all interpreted as this is God's judgment against you David and that baby is dying for the sake of the nation because if you keep up this corruption you are going to be like all of the other ancient Near East potentates and that corruption undoes them again and again because those Kings rise and fall because they're corrupt and there's no deep loyalty in their servants beneath them because they know as Donald Trump does how you know what kind of loyalty he wants loyalty but hey guess what Donald loyal is as loyal does and if you're not loyal to the people beneath you they'll not be loyal to you and so you know this is a deep theme of wisdom within that story of David and Bathsheba now again you listen to Christians it's all don't have adultery yeah don't do adultery adultery destroys the moral fabric of the community and so over time it's going to take your civilization down that's why you have all these moral systems and that's why I would assert evolutionarily people who have full blown fully realized fully engaged both hemisphere engaged in religion those those societies win Sun Tzu was right wars are won in the temple not in the battlefield we say oh but that's all of this well once you see the connections well well well I have to really believe in an afterlife and a god well it's gonna it's gonna colonize more of your brain and you're actually going to be able to marshal more steadily all of your life if you do you'll out compete your neighbor it's why religious people well secular people have fewer babies religious people have more babies why they inherit the future the religious keep inheriting the future that's probably why religion is still here and you can look at that scientifically and all that then if you if your science helps you to see that but also undermines your religion well you sort of have a problem but then you have the question of what is you well you're a pattern your narrative you're a story that's what you are so so Adams looking for objective morality and the Nazis and communists lost because they had bad ideas and their cultures lost in the competition yeah file they were phylogenetic dead ends now Adam is a big fan of Jonathan hate Jonathan height well it's often said hate Jonathan height will say it that way because if I say Jonathan hate that everybody thinks it's bad and you have all these funny things within language so Jonathan Heights moral foundation theory says oh we have all these little moral foundations that are built into us okay with Jordan Peterson the genetic stream and the culture stream are intermingled and they play out in civilization in other words if someone is very high status because they do care harm they do fairness cheating they do loyalty betrayal they do authority subversion they do liberty oppression they do sanctity degradation and of course Jonathan Heights book that really annoyed his fellow secular atheist liberals always says well guess what the progressives are really for the most part working care harm and fairness cheating but as it gets increasingly distilled into this woke religion now it's authority subversion now it's loyalty betrayal now it's liberty oppression now it's sanctity purification degradation in other words as it develops into a a more fully realized religion the adaptation continues so it starts filling out the moral taste buds card as it goes that's why conservatives have their card filled out because ideologies are crippled religions Jordan Peterson says well here it all is conservatives are more balanced because their systems are older and so you know Brett Weinstein and Barack Obama might be you know really progressive in terms of the chattering rider but their elephant which is determining whether or not they're saying no to you know other hotties who come along and and yeah Obama girl you know you would imagine if Obama wanted to chase tail huh he's super high status the chale he could take he could chase Michelle what would Michelle do to Barack if he starts chasing tail she won't even let him smoke cigarettes notice what we're doing here and then if you have this if you have this worked out in communities now again there's this is always difficult all these moral systems are aspirational especially when they push against kind of other older systems such as you know do like Donald and spread your seat around or do like Barack and keep close with the family well maybe if lots of people in this family are keeping close and this is where enforced monogamy comes in this group will out compete that group where the men are running around doing as they please it's how it works out this is morality right and the morality gets encoded and it gets coded into mythology and on and on and on and on it's all there so the Nazis built on basically social Darwinism that was very popular in the 18th and the end of the 19th century and you know these things there's always a lag effect in this and again if you read much in the 1930s you read eugenics stuff all over the place and then when we saw it acted out in real life everybody shrunk back at least in the West well built on social Darwinism with a low-resolution understanding of genetics so so the Germans are genetically superior people and they're not that genetically distinct from just about everybody else in Europe or Africa and Asia and so you have the competition of the races and the races will build civilizations I did a few videos a while ago on on Hitler's religion and Timothy Snyder's black earth the races will build civilizations and and and because I wonder why on earth why on earth are they why why always the thing with the Jews and and and Brett and Heather get into that in the video why always the thing with the Jews and and again for me it's weird because it wasn't until five years ago no it's more like ten years ago now that I had whispers of it in the family but oh yeah my father's line was Jewish well it wasn't good to be Jewish so you know hang with the Dutch Calvinists so the genetic track has a lot of Jew in it the culture track went Dutch Calvinist well the Jews keep getting in the way of the pure material genetic racial organic layer because they keep engaging the culture layer they keep winning Nobel prizes they keep being successful up here you got to stop all that because that's destroying the world the Nazis and I wouldn't turn on to this until Tom Holland said in the deling pod the Nazis were greenies what do you mean the Nazis were greenies the Nazis were greenies the Nazis were they were they were very environmental in fact they were philosophically committed to the environment at a level that most environmentalists who are deep-seated humanists wouldn't dare to be you know we humanity needs to to go back into our native self we need to get rid of the state they understood what Yuval Harari saw about the state we need to get rid of the state we need to get states out of the way so the Germanic superiority can flourish now of course it was a load of BS but that's what they were working and that's that's basic racism and it's a dumb dumb thing doesn't hold water now Marx comes along and there's this excellent article not long ago about you know why Marxism keeps eating the Enlightenment part of it is the homey idea that that the distributists just put out on his atheism is really boring video which I thought was excellent more sophisticated theory of social evolution so so at least the Marxist are dealing with social evolution not genetic evolution where the Nazis were Khrushchev of course very famous we will bury you well Khrushchev and the Soviet Union are long buried you have go big state I was just I was I was I was with my kids last night we're talking about Beetlejuice because my kids were looking for Halloween movies and they mentioned Beetlejuice and oh yeah I remember Beetlejuice I remember I watched that when did Beetlejuice come out it's like 1989 oh yeah I watched that when it came out my kid that I was thinking my kids were born in the 90s the 80s for my kids are like the 50s for me and my daughter's like yeah you remember the 80s and the 70s and the 60s you're really old and it was like no communism Soviet Union all of that is lost to my kids they don't they don't understand they didn't grow up watching the our Western propaganda of the empty Soviet shelves you know all of these Soviet ideas sound like a wonderful idea might not work in practice so good and quite frankly you have way too much capitalism in you I mean capital I mean look at China and China's just an example that there are other deeper things underneath the surface that that made communism evolve as it did in China okay so so the idea with Marx is you go really big with the state and then the state will pass away yeah right and then morality justifies egg breaking because you're seeking the omelet and of course as as as Orwell said show me the omelet well they're not showing the omelet they don't have an omelet to show well but that was Marx and you see it's it's it's it's evolving at this layer at the culture layer up there and again it's all morality is entwined in all of this we as a civilization must out compete and bury the the capitalists you know yeah I hear Kanye make make critical noises about capitalism tell me more Kanye really you're not down with capitalism after you've been bragging about the deals that you made and the first word on your wife's Twitter profile is shop oh baby you're way into Calvinism not Calvinism you're way into capitalism really deep and you're knocking on the door of Calvinism with that pastor you're hanging with anyway you have the history problem here's the problem with well-being you have the history problem with using well-being to navigate most of us are navigating this tiny tiny little I mean our lives are these tiny little increments and then our consciousness is this even this living in the now this little tiny little thing we have memories and some memories of of pains and achievements and pleasures and we're always doing all this little dead reckoning in here and we established these more these moralities and we tinker with the moral law and that well it's it's it's mostly wrong to cheat on your spouse unless they're your soulmate well-being is always a judgment made in the midst of time most often in the now most often filled with glands and all kinds of things which is why young people struggle with morality in the way that older folks when well yeah the glands aren't pumping out the testosterone like they used to baby what happened to my hair well-being is always a judgment made in the midst of time and you have the individual problem well right for me but not right for you and you have the societal problem well we're our society is on the right side of history so that's um let's decry colonialism and lean into Africa and make them adopt all of our sexual norms oh well I thought in the 18th and 19th century when we imposed our secular our sexual norms on those countries that that that that was colonialism yeah we're really bad at this stuff because we really live in the now and for American culture which is especially amnesic we're really bad at history and we're really bad at paying attention and and so this all becomes you know the standpoint epistemology the problem of standpoint epistemology gets huge when it when you decide that well-being is your navigator I just listened to Nassim Tlaib again you know this this guy studies much bigger pictures and so he brings out the Lindy effect well what is the Lindy effect if you want to get beyond yourself in your time you need to adopt a very long view of the world where could I find this very long view of the world well you can read history and I'd certainly recommend that you read history but let me tell you about historians historians are always doing what when that historians write history they're doing what I'm doing with my videos right now I'm trying to appropriate some of the shreds of the past to make sense of my present day and to try to locate me in a longer line well history is nothing compared to religion because history is sort of an academic exercise but religion is again full-brained it's both lobes it's intuitive it's it's the right brain it's the left brain it's relational it's sociological that's to do with your heart religion is is employing all the stuff that you have and employing it in a community what a religious community is a failing so you hold the line you have all these pressures to you know they can be corrupting they can be employed that way but you hold the line don't change don't change too quickly and now of course when you're in a situation of rapid change you know perhaps that's the best way to understand Protestantism because what Protestantism afforded was an ability for for for religions as institutions to modulate on the fly and so if you keep you listen to Bishop Barron say we have a name for them Protestants well and so if if it's built into your hierarchy as the Roman Catholic Church well that's a tremendous advantage because we're not changing if you look at the Orthodox we're really not changing but but but the Protestants like we're changing every day we're gonna start a new church we're gonna start a new denomination we're gonna start I'm gonna start a new religion just with me I mean and Protestants change too fast others don't change enough and or or they're not honest about their change and so it's all this modulation and so then when you go into the Roman Catholic Church and they're you know look at Jonathan Peugeot's journey about how he got how he became an icon carver you go back to my first conversation with Jonathan Peugeot he basically basically walks through it he sees he sees the change in art and says no I'm gonna go back and do the old things yeah but he's watching movies he's he's doing all that stuff so I mean this is this is the paradigm this is this is the work we must do as we travel through time and as change keeps lowering this mic and it keeps bothering me and I know I know I know Rick doesn't like to see it in the picture is that bothering you Rick is it bothering you anyway religion is the oldest broadest repository of our cave it archiving and evaluating these systems and living them out and trying them today and so that's what you have in religious communities so you have people who are sort of breaking with the system we're affirming same-sex marriage and people like we're against same-sex marriage we think we're not gonna police sex in church really I don't believe it because again sex is right there with the other evolutionary stuff you're gonna want to keep a real eye on the sex thing because that's sex is like one of the chief doorways in which the culture net gets into the genetic system maybe it doesn't matter maybe maybe maybe Brett Weinstein's right and we're we're we're we're shrieking towards the end of history but not in a good way well and Christians say well what's at the end of history it's apocalyptic so that's built into the system see and that's why the Ecclesiastes you know Kanye West as coal at and Ecclesiastes there's nothing new under the Sun Kanye is just you know it's a kaleidoscope in a blender so religion is well religion is about the best tool you have around and religious communities are about the best things you have around so get into one and start playing the game don't just do it virtually by watching it on YouTube Christianity gets the genetic cultural phylogenetic question right the ethnic which is Greek for the nations the ethnic is the wrong level of relevance realization for your moral landscape human beings genetically long before we discover genetics Jesus looks around it says guess what understand people as a group as a thing make that your group not your ethnic your little Jewish tribe or your Greek tribe or your whatever little tribe you got going there people is the tribe that idea has taken a long time to work through but within the people tribe were all competing you know the Dine the Dine the the people as the as the as the Navajo called them you know you go back through history and we we Greeks are Greek and everyone else is a barbarian we Romans are Romans and everyone else is a barbarian we Jews are Jews and everyone else is a Gentile now okay that sort of works but you're not paying attention that you're really working in the cultural layer and that's why you know that's how these systems work so the ethnic is the wrong level of relevance realization for your moral for your moral landscape the culture net religion w is the proper layer and so that's where ritual and everything really becomes important and moral norms that's where your morality is is really getting into the underside and sacrifice as Peterson notes civilization is at the layer of competition these are these long narratives now civilizations are so massive that you need something really deeply encoded like religion to sort of get at the civilization layer and Jordan Peterson's argument is that the West is the most successful civilization hence it lends credibility to the religious foundation that's Jordan Peterson in a nutshell right there that's his argument and versions sort of demythologize low-resolution versions of that are picked up by various culture warriors like like Dave Rubin and and Dennis Prager and you know it's just fascinating to watch Brett and Heather go there that's just fascinating you know and in a sense that's that that's the story of the IDW right there but this is also very much in line with Christianity itself because as Rene Girard really nicely laid out Christianity is built on self-critique and this comes from the Hebrew prophets and Jordan Peterson lays this out in the biblical series because you know usually what happens with the polytheists is that well you know the gods of Nineveh are eating the the gods of the northern kingdom of Israel and so the king of the northern kingdom does a copy of the shrine in the temple at Nineveh and puts it in the temple of Samaria it makes well that's not a biblical story I paid attention to it's in there look it up why did he why did he copy the shrine of the king of Nineveh in they don't have stealing technology so much in civilization six but in civilization four said stealing technology was a big thing they're stealing the gods of Nineveh that's what they're doing they're trying to and so then they assimilate into Nineveh and what they didn't realize is that they were basically giving up the simulation resistant monotheism that eventually won and if you had said that to to King Ahab and Samaria I stick with the monotheism that's gonna win long term no but but polytheism is really good for my well-being don't copy that don't copy that shrine from Nineveh or Damascus too quickly well-being is really hard to know if you're dealing in the now you know it's it's it's Homer with his mayonnaise jar and vodka that's for tomorrow Homer to work to worry about the founders of the Hebrew prophets their temple gets destroyed and they say what have we done and now modernists will say oh don't blame yourself that's that's Babylon's fault they're the oppressors Israelist says what have we done what have we done that was wrong well you you worshiped foreign God so you gave up you succumbed to polytheism and you succumb to corruption and injustice read the book of Chronicles it's basically the argument to the book of Chronicles this is perpetually a costly improvement but it's but it's a really important improvement because it builds into the society okay we're having a pandemic well well it's Trump's fault that the pandemic is bad and well maybe we'll get to see Biden try to navigate the pandemic I don't know that Biden will do a whole lot better than Trump and actually there's way too many variables that we're not going to get a clear answer from it anytime soon and so the two political parties are gonna keep fighting but but that that perpetual self-critique is a really smart long-term strategy but really hard short term sort of like Barack Obama's mating strategy of staying faithful to Michelle and Bretton Heather's mating strategy about staying faithful to each other instead of once you get to high status hey you're a porn star let me take you for a spin that's a bad mating strategy well we've got we've got you know Stormy Daniels isn't going to conceive and bear a little Trump so you know that's how the pill factors into this and oh it looks bad in terms of these other moral landscapes so let's pair some hush money and but you know part of Donald Trump's genius is he he keeps he says I am Ian he and he and Charles Barkley except Jordan or not Donald Trump never says this I am NOT a role model I think Donald Trump's thinks he is a role model Donald Trump is not a moral role model news flash and so a bunch of the evangelical never Trumpers you know they just look at this and say hey you know fair is fair we can self critique ourselves back in the Bill Clinton days and continue to see the moral problems of Trump but morality is swimming in a very big system and so lots of people who would never cheat on their wife will vote for Donald Trump and others will call them on it and so that's that's part of the reason we have this perpetual food fight in the West about these things and if we can tolerate it we will actually develop and build on it and make progress because what we're doing is working this calculation out massively among human populations so the critics of Christianity use Christian morality to critique it that's powerful and if if Christians can pause and and listen to their atheist critics and say hey you got a point well suddenly you're going stronger you're getting stronger you're you're learning you're listening and you see this with Sam Harris and Brett Weinstein and the woke you know we're you know the woke just kind of came up and realized and now we've got Kendi and now we've got D'Angelo and now we've got James Lindsay and now we've got Neil Shenvi and now we've gotten we're and we got Douglas Murray and we're talking through all of this stuff and we're working it through and and and we're haven't changed the whole society and don't forget part of American genius is it's hard to change things so to pass a constitutional amendment not easy why is that important well we passed prohibition ten years later decided it was a bad idea 30 year run-up to prohibition so so figuring out the change not change thing is really critical and as Jordan Peterson that says it's best to think about these things and let your ideas die so that the physical layer doesn't because the physical layer is a is is part of the is part of the sticky long-term very conservative very practical pattern that keeps perpetuating the other patterns in the much faster realm of the change in the culture net so Brett Weinstein's Gnosticism evolution is a genocidal spelling bee thankfully it works very slowly morality is part of the much faster culture net that is working through what is the basis for morality when success is the outcome of adaptation those kind of judgments rely it require long long periods of time and so again because Sam is such an expert and a lot of these ancient thoughts he watches Brett Weinstein it says it sounds kind of Gnostic don't know if I can quite put that together but this is what I think and he says it to me and I say yeah that sounds Gnostic too because I know some of that stuff like you know Sam and you and I've been talking and so the ideas go back and forth and so his idea colonizes me and my idea colonizes him and we colonize each other and you go back and forth and we try living things out and and and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and it's like yes and Brett Weinstein's got kind of he's got a little strain of Gnosticism going on in him does he think that the world was created by a lesser being and that now morality is somehow grounded where are you finding your morality Sam Brett Brett has no standpoint outside of the system to critique the system that's a real problem that's part of the problem Jordan Peterson's been pointing out he well Christianity said that the every instantiation of the king as did Judaism every instantiation of the king is accountable to now again Jordan Peterson's from below accountable to the the greatest king imaginable the ontological argument was that king real well if you say he isn't real a good amount of the mental social machinery that really determines how you live is not going to be operating and that's why people say they're atheists and Jordan Peterson's like I'm really a little skeptical because all that stuff is built into you and it's built into you so deeply you're not really gonna be an atheist quite so easily and we hear that so I'm a fair Susan Blackmore I'm offended okay be offended so you act like all of this stuff is real you act like there's meaning and purpose you act like this important in fact all of the mental emotional cognitive social machinery is putting you into that system so I'm an atheist oh yeah right that's the chattering rider on top of the elephant the elephant is acting like a very religious being because the elephant wants to live and the elephant knows that rider doesn't wait so much the elephant knows in theism the standpoint is the God who is outside the system okay so God number one God number two the system is authored by the God but the God is not dependent on the system okay God is not identical to the system that's where pantheism breaks down okay the God is outside the system and Tolkien is outside the Lord of the Rings but the Lord of Rings is utterly dependent upon Tolkien again it's a book analogy it breaks down in some ways but it gets at that's what analogies do they get at this they don't cover that that's the beauty of analogies it's the beauty of metaphors so it plays out in the broadest possible population because it employs all the developed human relational narrative faculties to do the processing it's sort of like in most of your computers you have a CPU and a GPU now if you bought just this Intel chip you've got the integrated GPU which my friend Rick says it's mostly just software and Rick used to work for Intel so maybe Rick is right I don't know but so then and when I buy a when I buy a piece of hardware that I'm going to do a lot of video processing or gaming on and make sure it's got a Nvidia or an AMD GPU on it it's got hardware and so basically what atheists sort of do is they say we're just gonna go along on the CPU it's like oh baby that religious GPU that sucker has horsepower why well well look at all the look at look at how religion is all over the ancient wars and the sacrifices and the temples and the and the and yeah because it's the GPU it's because we get fully engaged because we engage each other and it's and the woke kind of got into that but I don't long term I don't think they're going anywhere and again Jonathan Peugeot is dead on right you're not gonna build a civilization on a a reactive parasitic a reactive parasitic thing it can't stand so it's not gonna go that far it might might cause a whole bunch of suffering in the end of a important nations or civilizations yeah but the deeper things continue to endure and come back up you know look at look at what's happened in Russia and the Soviet Union the corruption is harder to get out but yeah you want the CPU and the GPU engaged God number one and God number two you know both you know both hemispheric systems you want it all online and and so that's why Brett and Heather they they live like religious and say no we're not religious okay you just keep being faithful to each other and keep raising up those sons to be moral and and and you just keep working that Western system and say we're not working the Western system okay just keep saying that I don't care what you say I watch what you do and there we have it keep doing it keep doing it this is part of the reason atheists will always be a minority it's underpowered you can't get that far with it there's a functional my they're a functional minority and they have their place in the conversation you know and I think that's really helpful to understand the anti-corruption necessity of the Protestant Reformation the anti-corruption necessity of the Enlightenment the Jesus smuggling I think in the best understanding of Eric Weinstein's term you have to get that out of the system because it's actually a corrupting element and you want things to really function you want to keep purifying your systems so they're a functional minority but will never be a larger player in the culture net religion W it just they just won't because you know they're really good on the CPU but boy I'll tell you if you're playing if you're playing a first-person shooter you need to have that GPU in there it's just the way it is they ignore too much of our really powerful individual and communal processing power and they turn a blind eye to the greatest repository of understanding what is right and wrong and what works in the world that's why atheists they're sort of like geldings they can't produce and we're already moving beyond secularity and that's what I got into deconstructing the naive faith of the Enlightenment living as if there is no God that's secularity and Jordan Peterson basically comes in and says God you're always gonna have one you might as well engage in the full system well he doesn't actually go that far he goes right to the edge as rationality rules notes he and destiny destiny that's that's the atheist name you choose destiny really was it destiny wrong I got lots of stuff wrong India's rebuilding temples Turkey is rededicating the Hagia Sophia when the rest of the world comes online Europe you know are we gonna be a Muslim continent hmm where's that gonna go the world explored the secular exhausted it and is bringing older broader parts of the code back online but again you don't want to lose what this gave us it's back to Daniel Ottavak you have to see out of both eyes that's really hard pattern seeing patterns trying to figure out how that works the helpful enlightenment coding is incorrect is increasingly assimilated and so these conversations between someone like James Lindsay and the woke and working that through and Neil Shen V who is you know who is arguing a very modernistic branch of Christianity still lots of gas in that engine but there that's what they're doing they're working with the assimilation the you know Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson and and James Lindsay are far more postmodern than just these facile labels allow because once you can take a step back and no longer see modernity through naive eyes you're already a to a degree postmodern you're already above the system sort of you're already looking at it and that's that's where we're at right now and what we're doing and the same thing is happening in the church but of course the church has so much more legacy code to work through and so many communities they're actually trying to live out their legacy code and so the you know it's sort of like imagining a server farm and like one of the one or two of those servers is sort of buzzing with the the the atheist atheism plus code and working that through but all the rest of the server form of the eight billion people fully with religion and culture and all of that with the mold there that's all buzzing with the rest of it and now it's going between servers and it's working out in there but that's that's what's happening because it's not just the thoughts that I have in my head it's what I live out in my life and then again why Barack Obama is what you know look at Donald Trump and Barack Obama in terms of their mating practices you're looking at two different systems look at look at Brett Weinstein and Milo Yiannopoulos Milo Yiannopoulos well there's some interesting stuff you know we watched at our we had a little watch party on the discord server yesterday watching Joe Rogan and and Alex Jones and you know Peugeot I mean if you're not watching Peugeot you're missing out because and Peugeot isn't terribly easy to understand sometimes but Peugeot's he's Peugeot knows enough about patterns that he can watch Kanye and watch Alex Jones and say you know there's something shamanistic going on there now you might want you might not want them running your country but you know it's sort of like we have a lot of mockingbirds over by my house and in the summer I'll sit outside and you'll just hear the mockingbird go through you know where's that mockingbird getting that mockingbird is getting all of the other songs from all the other birds so if you want to know what are the other birds in the neighborhood you can go out and find all the other birds or you can listen to the mockingbird you can hear what he has to say and of course human beings are far more complex than that but in some ways Kanye and Alex Jones are mockingbirds and and Joe Rogan is able to pull the threat out from them here's the thing it's always hard to navigate within your little bubble it's why you read history that's why religion is so enormously helpful especially some of the bigger broader religions because you know Roman Catholicism part of what part of the advantage they have is they have a worldwide net and so and even the even the Methodists when they're having the big fight about same-sex marriage well on one hand all of the all of the woke Methodists are like we have to listen to people of color and all of the people of color out of Africa says yeah no to same-sex marriage like well you're doing the processing we will bury you Khrushchev says no no no no no no no no no acknowledge the Lindy effect we've now reached the border of the secular experiment and our venturing forward Christians are Christianity brought progressivism onto the main line in the world if past transitions are any indication this will be painful messy and bloody it's just true these are very long processes take centuries and decades now things are speeding up but the world is very big and so you know what Kanye was saying to Joe Rogan you know we say well what a billion and a half people are on line how many of those people are on Twitter to 300 million how many of those Twitter accounts on Twitter are actually active tens of thousands how many of those tens of thousands do you actually follow a few thousand few hundred we're so full of our own self-importance we're really small we're coming to the end of the Protestant Reformation Enlightenment phase we have centuries to go so how are you gonna navigate how are you gonna break out of your bubble and and not just mentally watching YouTube videos it involves talking to people it involves changing how you live it involves getting into a commitment well why why is commitment so important why is committing to a religious tradition so important because you become accountable to that tradition and that forces you into areas that you wouldn't before it forces you out of your bubbles it changes your behavior and and I think right now because this is the layer that is changing so fast Tom Hollins I lost my faith in the Enlightenment he's he's he's living into the story prioritizing the story verse layer knowing that in terms of his life Tom Hollins life that's the most reasonable later proceed absolutely rational absolutely making sense and and and so here you've got this evolutionary biologist who in some ways is saying well I know things because I look at evolutionary biology yeah but evolutionary biology is only a hundred or so years old Tom Hollins reading history that's thousands of years old he's reading religion that goes way back that's why Tom Holland is like Jordan Peterson more like Jordan Peterson than Brett Weinstein even though he's sort of associated with the IDW and I asked Tom Holland about Jordan Peterson didn't know anything about him that shows something big in the system is moving bigger than Jordan Peterson bigger than Tom Holland bigger than Brett Weinstein bigger than the woke stuff in the system is moving that's God-sized stuff it's moving how are you gonna know how are you gonna pay attention it isn't to dismiss the other layers but simply to understand how they play out in the smaller segments like an individual not and individual and individual life Tom Holland is doing the reasonable thing to do you're just one little life and it matters a lot to you you're like the center of your world in some ways but it's just one little life and we're gonna be gone but we're part of this much larger thing and so you know hey credits to Kanye he's taking his best shot he's got a little bit of time and often if you're in a situation of chaos that's what you learn and I don't think these two are safe from God number two water rolls downhill now maybe they'll maybe they'll maybe they'll just keep keep God out CS Lewis couldn't many many people can't you got to be careful with your reading relating to God number two brings all the faculties online and ourselves as individuals families and communities it really puts us in the game in a way that just a theoretical talking about God number one really doesn't do now you've got to understand God number one and the way that that proceeds otherwise what happens is God number two communities just get very insular and they kind of go off and do their little game and you know they're like the shakers find the shakers today you can't find the shakers why they didn't reproduce so this is why you deal with very long histories and why you become accountable to a religious community and yeah that's gonna it's gonna be all kinds of modulations through that but that's that's actually how you contribute to the far far larger conversation so thanks for watching thanks for listening hope it was helpful I should say these things subscribe support patreon link to the church join the bridges of meaning discord John Van Donk and I did that conversation about starting estuary groups and John's not the worst I know in terms of technology and he said to me so he was in church on Sunday so it was on the Freddie and Paul show and he says to me I didn't get a single I didn't get a single response well maybe you know maybe we don't know anything last night late he sends me a text I just didn't know where to look I got 17 responses so John's estuary leadership cadre is off and running and I'm really interested to see how that goes because again if you're just watching videos and thinking this stuff in your head you're not in the game you want to get in the game and and again you look at all Jordan Peterson stuff make a commitment make a commitment to a woman or a man start a family get a job do something don't just think something because this stuff is moving really fast live into the story make yourself accountable to a group of people hopefully people with long-term ties to deep old things and it's sort of an Akanya way go for broke might be bumpy Kanye's life has been bumpy might get locked up but you're not safe from god number two it's that's a one one aspect of the atheist that they are dead wrong and continued to be wrong and display their willful blindness they think that's gonna inherit the earth no no no won't inherit the earth anyway thanks for watching I'll talk to you later I put out a lot of content this week I know some of you are crying under the load but if you've been around the channel you know it comes and goes so I'm starting to get some conversations stacked up and I might I might dual post some of these days which just makes it worse but we'll see so Friday I'll be in the discord hopefully this week we'll talk about some of these things so if you're interested get onto the discord Friday morning 10 a.m. California time question and answer in the discord I sometimes post some of those recordings here and thank you for your time and
