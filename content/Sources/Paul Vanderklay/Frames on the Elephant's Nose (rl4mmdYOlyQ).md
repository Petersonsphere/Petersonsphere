 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to keep chewing on the new career of Jonathan Pigeot as a celebrity theist. I'd have to talk to Jonathan about this new turn of his YouTube life where he had a very interesting, well, frustrating for a lot of parties conversation with Stephen Woodford, Mr. Rationality Rules, and then another conversation with Adam Frenden, which I think many of us found a little bit more interesting, but probably that's some bias on our part because Adam has been a part of this little corner of the internet for a while. But Adam, in terms of sort of the boundary lines in this little corner of the internet, there's Jonathan Pigeot for a long time was someone that some people that I would talk to did not want to talk to. And Jonathan Pigeot didn't really pursue some of these conversations. And I think there's a degree of Protestantism at work in there. But what was true of both of these conversations was the question of where's the difficulty and then the argument starts talking about frames. Now, that's rather a strange word to use. And so we shouldn't use it unselfconsciously. Framing has been something that has arisen since the rise of artificial intelligence. And I don't know if I have a little camera here. I don't right now. It's over in the other room. But my point that I've made often is that a camera cannot see. Well, a camera can take in light and a camera can transmit and can take that light and put it into electrons and send it into my computer just like this camera that I am looking at right now is doing. But the camera can't see in the way that I see. There is an interior life going on when I look at this camera that we at least assume the camera does not have. If the camera and all of this electronics did have it, I just finished my conversation with Poe the Person and I just posted that. So that's now available before you see this. But we have this strange relationship with consciousness and with suffering. If we were to somehow believe that all of our electronics, I mean this little, I'm working on a Sony a6400 right here. A Sony a6400 has a fair amount of electronics built into it. If we would imagine that this had sufficient electronics built into it that it had some degree of consciousness and that in that consciousness it had some degree of suffering, well we might feel a little bit different about how we handle these cameras or maybe we wouldn't given the fact that we know that cows and other of the animals that we consume, and I am not a vegan or a vegetarian, animals that we consume have consciousness and so we kill them in a quote unquote humane way but we snuff out their little consciousness in order to enjoy a good steak. So there's a lot going on here but the frame question is one of, well what are we even talking about when we're talking about frames in this conversation? Why did Stephen have trouble understanding Jonathan? I don't know that Jonathan has trouble understanding Stephen but I know that Jonathan is frustrated in his ability to communicate that which he is believing and asserting and living within in many ways to Stephen and his audience and I think the same thing with Adam and his audience and so frames is sort of the way that we're talking about this lately and so I think we need to talk about frames. So again what I do with these monologue videos is I think out loud and I think out loud for my own reasons and over the course of these last three years I've developed language and understanding and yeah just trying to figure this stuff out. Now we grow in our groups interpretive pathways. What I mean by that? I mean I was born into a nuclear family, my parents, a religious tradition, sort of Dutch Calvinist Christian reform tradition, a neighborhood, Patterson, New Jersey, a time, middle of the 20th century, on and on and on and on and we absorb, we human beings you know I've been thinking a lot about this non-player character capacity that we have and we might be frustrated and dismissive about it but it's an enormous power how we absorb and manage to integrate the things that we absorb with our genetic systems and this is Brett Weinstein's genetic and culture track how we absorb these things and we integrate these things and we participate in them and we do it automatically we do it from before we are born and then into the world very quickly and we learn and absorb and I mean you it's really important to you know to live in cultures other than the ones in your bubble because you see all of the ways and that children absorb these things and grow in these things and and on and on we go so bit by bit we piece together the world to fit our needs and our wants and we find our way in our communities and that's sort of the process of growing and maturing now Mary Cohen recently had a conversation with Manuel also known as Iron Root who spent a lot of time on the bridges of meaning discord server and sort of gone over to the uh verveki awakening from the meaning crisis server again I started this new room called it the truman show now I'm talking about it as the uh the uh open open studio in the discord server where and right now there's a whole bunch of them sitting there with cameras on it's a little weird I'm sort of getting used to it but I'm also finding some benefits and some stumblings about it but it's just kind of playing around with this new toy in a new way anyway so iron root and and mark lefaber along with mary had a very interesting conversation on parabolic knowledge and I remember when mary first started talking about parabolic knowledge I was thinking about parabolas as in a math and I'm thinking how is this how does this work but it's it's parables it's parables it's parabolic knowledge and she told this little story that again I mean this is why I I often don't I I don't think I'm all that smart because I hear these things and I don't get them right away and they need sometimes the hours and days and weeks and months and years to sort of marinate in my head and then so they bubble up it's all that absorbing thing maybe I don't absorb as fast as I did when I was a kid I'm sure I don't but but but mary notes like a child will say something like this uh daddy is the knife mommy is the fork and I am the spoon and it's like well that's funny or or boys are dogs and girls are cats and now we we hear that and we we sort of get an idea about what the child is saying and we can connect with it but you know mary then goes on to ask well what what what kind of thing are we doing well we're setting up these relationships and we're looking at patterns and again you go into the verveking thing there's there's there's cognitorial explosion and there's relevance realization and this is a four piece of knowledge and and and manuel and mark have done quite a bit of work on the four piece of knowledge and they talked about you know it's like oh I gotta hang out that this guy I gotta hang out at the other discord server more and I gotta really catch up on more of john's videos and and and and and there's not enough time in the day to catch up on all of this stuff but but really good and interesting and helpful work is going on but talked about the the left brain as being propositional and procedural and the right brain of being perspectival and participatory and in many ways mark and manuel are digging beneath verveky's four p's and mary now has her parabolic knowledge which is that another p um I mean how do we integrate these things but they're all sort of floating out there and we're dealing with them but you know where does this knowledge come from boys are dogs and girls are cats daddy's the knife mommy's the fork and i'm the spoon and again you can listen to that well that's just a little fairy tale but that's the point these these parables these fables these these fairy tales they're all trading on something I read a very interesting paper that came out um a blog post that came out when jordan peterson first sort of rode the wave about about Jungian um collective collective oh crap I can't remember corrective unconscious and and then and he was dealing with that in terms of some of the adaptations that that Jordan Peterson had made to it and I really want to read that paper and do a video just on that paper because it's with with all of my renewed all of oh gosh I mean the last three years have changed they haven't just changed my life in terms of a community that I'm around and and you know all of the you know all of the changes in my life that this channel has brought me in a way they've continued to sort of accelerate my thinking and help me think about you know what is it what does spirit mean I've talked about that a lot in recent videos and and I you know we if we're going to keep using this word spiritual we should really do some work on what we're talking about and this gets into the miracles conversation and all of that well we have this we have this parabolic capacity with these we're able to intuit relationships and and there are this gets into well how in fact do we appropriate the world and and create mental maps of it and engage with it and then and create shared mental maps of it and and in fact communicate communicate things communicate things to each other that that we are not able to know that that sort of slide past the consciousness yet get embedded in our minds and you know Jordan Peterson of course with the evolutionary stuff talks about stuff up from the bottom you know lobsters poor bucko needs a little shot of air yeah I should really read that paper but I don't want to distract myself too much in this video to go there but there's a lot going on with us that we're not conscious of and and we see that around us and we see that in children especially and you know Mary you know Mary is would she be insulted if I called her old and wise but she is old and wise and and if if age does not give you wisdom then you've not spent your time well and and Mary is is just such as an astute observer and and she is so wise and she's also a lot of fun now this a while ago I had read this line in Peter Brown's Through the Eye of the Needle where where anthropologist Clifford Gertz was quoted about common sense and common sense really triggered something in me because common sense is sort of like this parabolic knowledge it's this it's this kind of it's this way that we operate that has in some ways lost status against science but in other ways is far more enduring and in that sense is is closer to religion it's going to be part of my argument here that the whole discussion has been generally miscast and that the issue is not whether there is an elementary form of science to be found in the Trobrians or an elementary form of law among the Baratzi or whether Totenism is really a religion or cargo cult really an ideology questions which seem to me to turn so completely on definitions as to reduce without residue a matter of intellectual policy and rhetorical taste but to what degree aspects of culture are systematized at all in such places and so you know this is where sort of Mary's parabolic knowledge comes in how are we systematizing these patterns that we notice and even a little child boys are dogs and girls are cats daddy's the knife mommy's the fork and and I'm the spoon well what about knifeness is like daddy what about forkness is like mommy what about spoon is like baby and you can again there's combinatorial explosiveness in this in lots of different ways and for a particular child and in a particular manifestation to get this in but but but common sense and the little aphorisms and sayings that go along in common sense are are really critical to this and attacking that problem an effort more promising than searching for existential definitions of art or science or religion or law and then trying to decide whether the Bushmen have any I want to turn to a dimension of culture not usually conceived as as forming an orderly realm in the way these more familiar districts of the soul do I mean common sense and now again it's very interesting why well when you think anthropologist what do you think of well just look at the cover of this book you know you've got some masks from another culture basically we we tried to gain perspective on our culture which is sort of this continually this continual network of cultures that consumes and colonizes and it's a very I mean the imperial culture that we participate in continues to consume and destroy the cultures of the world and you find in the bible this idea of one world government and you get the sense of one culture just moving out and consuming and absorbing and and basically it's it's a very genocidal thing that we participate in there are a number of reasons why treating common sense as a relatively organized body of considered thought rather than just as anyone that just as anyone clothed and in his right mind knows should lead on to some useful conclusions but perhaps the most important is that there's an inherent characteristic of common sense thought precisely to deny to deny this and affirm that its tenets are immediate deliverances of experience not not deliberated reflections upon it knowing that rain wets and that one ought to come out of it or that fire burns and what ought not to play with it or to stick to our own culture for the moment are conflated into compromise one large realm of given an undeniable a catalog of in the grain of nature realities so pre-emptory as to force themselves upon any mind sufficiently uncladded to receive them yet this is clearly not so no one or no one functioning very well doubts that rain wets but there there may be some people around who the question of proposition that one ought to come out of it holding holding that it's good for one's character to brave the elements or actually in Patterson New Jersey we had a the we had a house next to us the two houses next to me growing up were condemned at one point and became heroin shooting galleries and all sorts of things but there was a Yugoslav immigrant family right next to me growing up and when it would rain they'd have their whole bunch of them living in that two-story Patterson had these two-story houses had a big lip in their backyard and when it rained they'd come out with the soap in their underwear and bathe in their backyard my Dutch Spencerter neighbors on the other side would look in horror at this but you know why waste the rain when it comes out and you've got 15 people living in a house with one or two bathrooms you know when the when the rain comes down take the bar soap out and scrub it up dub common sense right hotlessness is next to godliness and the attractions of play with fire often for some people usually override the full recognition of the pain that will result religion rests its case on revelation science on method ideology on moral passion but common sense rests rests it's on the assertion that it is not the case at all just life in a nutshell the world is its authority isn't that interesting how this how this works the analysis of common sense as opposed to the exercise of it must then begin by redrawing this erase distinction between the mere matter of fact apprehension of reality which so often certain kinds of atheists like to imagine that well well-being is just obvious well common sense isn't just obvious is it but it functions in cultures sort of like fibers function in rope there's another parabolic idea the analysis of common sense as opposed to the exercise of it must then begin by redrawing this erase distinction between the mere matter of fact apprehension of reality or whatever it is you want to call what we apprehend merely and matter of factly and down to earth colloquial wisdom judgments or our assessments of it when we say someone shows common sense we mean to suggest that that he is just using them we mean to suggest more than that he is just using his eyes and ears but is as we say keeping them open using them judiciously intelligently perceptively reflectively or trying to and that he is capable of coping on page turn with everyday problems in an everyday way with some effectiveness again civilla not enough people listen to civilla including me probably don't listen to her enough but her her i mean her her work on perseg has been you know barking up this tree all along so so we perceive values and then we we we sort of instantiate these values in common sense sayings and we pass them around and sort of like daddy is the knife mommy is the fork and and i am the spoon our boys dogs are boys are dogs and girls are cats you know something something we're seeing through again this is c.s lewis's abolition of man the waterfall isn't just purty it's sublime we're seeing through it to something and when we say he lacks common sense we mean not that he is retarded that he fails to grasp the fact that rain wets or fire burns but that he bungles the everyday problems life throws at him so you see this the thing about the four p's is that they do all sort of come together and probably weigh more he leaves the house on a cloudy day without an umbrella his life is a series of scorchings he should have had the wit not to merely avoid but not to have stirred the flames for it in the first place the opposite of someone who is able to apprehend the sheer actualities of experience is as i have suggested a defective the opposite of someone who is able to come to sensible conclusions on the basis of them is a fool and the last the last has less to do with intellect narrowly defined than we generally imagine as sol bellows thinking of certain sorts of government advisors and certain sorts of radical writers has remarked the world is full of high iq morons this analytical disillusion of the unspoken premise from which common sense draws its authority that it presents itself neat is not intended to undermine the authority but to relocate it if common sense is as much an interpretation of the immediacies of experience a gloss on them as our myth painting epistemology or whatever then it is like them historically constructed and like them subjected to historically defined standards of judgment it can be questioned disputed affirmed developed formalized contemplated even taught and it can vary dramatically from one people to the next this reminds me of oh it was in right where i began with jordan peterson it was neil postman's amusing ourselves to death these these these cultural layers and you see this again this is parabolic knowledge you see this in in the gospels where jesus have these jesus has these parables and these parables go out and these these parables now to tom holland's point about you know the most successful short story writer of all of human civilization these parables go out to radically different civilizations and radically different times and radically different places and they they sort of work and and whereas a lot of interpreters in the in a scientific mode that make want to sort of nail down all of jesus parables into certain things and so we line them up with the old testament do all this grammatical historical interpretation which again i'm not throwing under the bus but but but doesn't lend itself to this much more human way of of figuring out how life works it is in short a cultural system though not usually a very tightly integrated one and it rests on the same basis that any other system rests the conviction that those by whose possession it is of its value and whose whose possession it is of its value and validity here as elsewhere things are what you make of them and then he'll get into some philosophy and and some other things this makes me want to chase down postman ah kindle is wonderful i found it well what are we talking about here um now i depart from fry who um who i am certain would raise no objections but i take the word but i take his word along with me every medium of communication i am claiming has resonance for resonance is a metaphor writ large patterns resonance what resonance is somebody sent me a very interesting video on vibration he said it's all vibrations and yeah vibrations are patterns of of of what and and that's just our our latent materialism they have to be patterns of something well patterns of and we can get all spooky energy or wooey whatever the original limited context of its use may have been a medium has the power to fly far beyond that context into new and unexpected ones of course this is this is amusing ourselves to death where he's dealing with the the rise of in his day the rise of cable television that's gone supernova because of the way it directs us to organize our minds and integrate our experience of the world it imposes itself on our consciousness and social institutions in myriad forms that's what that's what the the media does media remembers plural of medium and pay attention to the resonance of that word it sometimes is the power to become implicated in our concepts of piety or goodness or beauty and it is always implicated in the ways we define or regulate our ideas of the truth to explain how this happens how the bias of a medium sits heavy felt but unseen over a culture i offer three cases of truth-telling the first is drawn from a tribe in west africa that has no writing system but whose rich oral tradition has given form in its to its ideas of civil law when a dispute arises the complainants come before the chief of the tribe and state their grievance with no written law to guide him the task of the chief is to search through the vast repertoire of proverbs and sayings to find one that suits the situation and is equally satisfying to both complainants that accomplished all parties have agreed that justice has been done that truth has been served think about how america for example is going to deal with the conflict over its current election who really won you will recognize of course that it has largely it was largely the method of jesus and other biblical figures who living in an essentially oral culture drew upon all of the resources of speech including mnemonic devices formulaic expressions and parables as a means of discovering and revealing truth as walter on points out in oral cultures proverbs and sayings are not occasional devices they are incessant they form the substance of thought itself thought in an extended form is impossible without them it consists in them this parabolic local knowledge common sense level to our culture that that we that things are sort of based upon well well which is how what is a just way to to deal with the question of did donald trump or joe biden win the election well courts and evidence no it's all fixed i saw the video on tv to people like ourselves any reliance on proverbs and sayings is relatively is reserved largely for resolving disputes among or with of all people children and they are people possession is nine tenths of the law first come first served haste makes waste these are forms of speech we pull out in small crises with our young but would think ridiculous to produce in a courtroom where serious matters are to be decided can you imagine a bailiff asking a jury if it has reached a decision and receiving the reply that to air is human but to forgive divine or even better let us render unto caesar what is caesar's and to god what is god's for the briefest moment the judge might be charmed but if a serious language form is not immediately forthcoming the jury may end up with a longer sentence than most than the than most guilty defendants lawyers judges and defendants do not regard proverbs or saying as a relevant response to legal disputes and this we are separated from the tribal chief by a media metaphor for in a print-based courtroom where law books brief citations and other written materials define and organize the method of finding the truth the oral tradition has lost much of its resonance but not all of it testimony is expected to be given orally on the assumption that the spoken not written word is a truer reflection of the state of mind of a witness indeed in many courtrooms jurors are not permitted to take notes nor are they given written copies of the judge's explanation of the law jurors are expected to hear the truth or its opposite not to read it thus we may say that there is a clash of resonance in our concept of legal truth on one hand there is residual belief in the power of speech and speech alone to carry the truth on the other hand there's much stronger belief in the authenticity of writing and in particular printing the second belief as little tolerance for poetry proverbs sayings parables and other expressions of oral wisdom the law is what legislators and judges have written in our culture lawyers do not have to be wise they need to be well briefed and he continues and it's again well worth reading and rereading now that is certainly a fun and productive rabbit trail but what i want to what i want to focus on in this video are frames and what are they and you can see basically postman's argument is that well even the medium frames the meaning that this stuff isn't particular now part of what's going on behind stephen woodford and adam friended and jonathan pageau is sort of a residual post-traumatic stress disorder in western civilization about tyrannical christianity fair warning if my volume is louder right now it's because i forgot to reset i think zoom always sets my mic levels at a certain level in this computer and before i make these videos i have to turn them up so i won't reset them again it should be fine for the rest of this video or this podcast so sorry if the first part was a little low in terms of volume but we have post-traumatic stress disorder in terms of christianity in our culture and so and i think a lot of this is is behind the fear of christians as if jonathan pageau is somehow going to take your family hostage well if they all convert to christianity and start going to a church and listening to a preacher he very well might have that effect but but the point is that that we're talking about frames and christianity is is sort of seen as a frame and it functions as a frame but we're really not talking about one frame and part of what i thought was helpful about jonathan's performance in both of those conversations is he noted that the frame he is in in some ways promoting is not really christianity itself it's really much more of a philosophical frame that through which christianity and in fact other religions can be understood one of the commenters on jonathan's copy of the rationality rules video made the assertion that maybe jonathan would do better if he simply asserted platonism first and then sort of felt filled in some gaps underneath i don't know that that necessarily would have been more helpful but but part of the reason i mention this is because if you if you want to sort of figure out what kind of frame christianity is and how it functions you really have to reckon with the enormous capacity of christianity to function in a whole variety of cultural frames and philosophical frames peter brown and his biography and i i haven't i don't have that on kindle maybe i should look if it's put on kindle by now because i like kindle because it's searchable for things but but peter brown's biography of augustin that i read a number of years ago i remember reading it and and coming to the coming to the realization that that augustin of hippo became a christian for reasons very different from what modern americans do and and i had the same realization recently when i was reading justin martyr that when you read justin martyr he embraced christianity because it seemed to be the best philosophy augustin did pretty much the same thing well what on earth do they mean by that and we find we find christian apologists today running around with arguments for the resurrection of jesus christ well why well because of how that functions in our present cultural frame of late modernity and and what we assert to be true and so the physicality of jesus leaving the tomb and just again for your um in case in case this comes up as it always does i believe that jesus physically walked out of that grave and i'm not just saying that to prop up my my my points with the fundamentalists out there i believe it for other philosophical reasons but the reason that modern apologists who want to promote christianity keep arguing about the resurrection of jesus and the reason that sam harris bullies jordan peterson in their conversations about it is because that's the way the plausibility structures of our present culture work and the reason jonathan peugeot was was sort of having difficulty commuting back and forth with adam and steven was because jonathan is approaching it from a very different cultural frame but christianity has seemed to adapt itself and accommodate itself quite nice nicely to a whole variety of cultural frames that doesn't always mean that the fit is easiest or easier between or are the same between all but perhaps easier with some rather than others making these frames you know very coherent and this peter peter brown in this book through the eye of the needle which is all about money wealth the fall of the roman empire and the making of christianity it's a fascinating book when they spoke about wealth augustin and preachers like him spoke as the heirs of a very ancient world they the certitudes to which they appealed and again these certitudes are likely based on common sense or parabolic understanding to which they appealed had bobbed up and down for over a millennia and a veritable saragossa sea of um i of e days it's probably french and i don't have the book in front of me so i can't look it up thus basically obvious obviousnesses let's say augustin propounded ideas about societies that were taken straight from the pagan classics we should not think that he was doing this in a self-conscious effort to impress pagans with his culture or to woo them into the city by citing their favorite authors he did it as unthinkingly as we today say that the earth is round that's a very parabolic idea frankly and that the law of gravity is universal it is true to it is it is true truth about the social world in which he lived and which he shared with all other thinking persons of his age he presented much of what he had to say on the topic of azar avarice as on many other aspects of wealth as a matter of common sense let us continue for a moment let's consider for a moment what this means over 30 years ago the anthropologist clifford gertz showed us that common sense of a given society always depends upon a relative organized body of considered thought but this thought was presented in a distinctive manner as gertz wrote in his essay common sense as cultural system common sense wisdom is shameless and unapologetically ad hoc it comes from epigrams proverbs obiter dicta jokes anecdotes a clatter of nomic utterances not informal doctrines axiomatic theories or architect or architectonic dogmas and again as as as neil postman noted these things too change and and so if you want to look at our culture if you want to look at just simply the the basis beneath the intuitive reflections i mean it's a plausibility system that's another way to talk about it that that steven woodford and adam friended are ensconced in they're ensconced in these things and they speak from these things and jonathan has had his own transformation and so he speaks from a very different place now you might say well they're all using electricity and have flush toilets and read amazon books and are incredibly conversant in a lot of similar things yes they are but yet these cultural frames are are very determinative of what they imagine to be good bad right and wrong many axiomatic things within their own systems an ever-present adversary that we have to deal with is what c.s lewis called chronological snobbery and we should look back on let's say the egyptians and their pyramids and their their temples and their their tombs that we open again there's a very interesting program on on netflix about you know about what they did you know this tomb and and and now this again this is it's all these were rulers of the world just look at how powerful the egyptians were in their time now we might look back at at egyptians and and imagine they were fools to invest so much of their gross domestic product on on buildings yet well we travel there and look at them with awe and not quite know what we're thinking so again i just had this conversation with poe you know when i ask her why did you become a mother she's she's exactly right when she says well i can give you an answer but i'm not at all certain that well that what that that's the answer well what do you mean the answer well this is how we are with ourselves and and jordan peterson made the obvious the the observation why do why do we spend you know money traveling to new york when we can and visiting the metropolitan museum of art why can there be a room with with pictures that people painted a few hundred years ago and the room is worth millions if not billions of dollars what's with that we don't know but something is going on and we're not at all sure about what it is and and so we look at those pyramids and we think well maybe they should have fed their people or free their slaves or yada yada yada but they ruled the world for thousands of years and the pyramids and the temples were not incidental to their ruling of it we say well maybe it was the nile well the nile certainly had something to do with it but they considered the nile a god and within if you say well the nile was vitally important for the power of egypt well how did they know that without any science of economics or anything like that they worshiped it as a god well what do they mean by a god is economics a god to us look at all of our tall buildings and all of our bronze statues of of all of things a rather golden colored bowl on wall street why would we think of something like that a bull market and a bear market and daddy's the knife mommy's the fork baby's the spoon what are we doing how does this work why do we do what we do why do we still invest in gold you know tom holland's video if you haven't seen it that sounds terrible but did religion exist in the ancient world everybody in their system believed that the temples were vitals read san su doesn't he basically say wars are one of one and lost in the temple and we think well well that's bad but we're not sure what it was that was the god of war that's because well in in an early modern phase well that's because of the you have to use religion to propagandize and massively mobilize the people and your army is depend on the number of people yada yada yada yada frames work to a degree the sacrifices work and again when jordan peterson starts talking about sacrifices and and how how the how the genetic and the the cultural begin to intermingle and over time these things rule the destiny of the world in some ways if if the if all the people of africa are out producing the selfish people of europe who can't bother to have babies well who inherits the earth it would seem to me they're religious and they're not necessarily looking at it as religion religion s as we find it no this is this is how the world works this is who inherits the earth now we take these tiny little time slices and say well it's my little life well maybe individualism is a terminal disease culturally well people are flocking to america and other places because of individual okay well maybe individualism isn't a terminal disease but but maybe it's sort of like smoking it's a it's a cultural carcinogen so we live in the midst of this matrix of assumptions common sense and beliefs and we do a whole lot of dead reckoning what do i mean by dead reckoning i mean if you're if you're if you're walking through the woods and you don't have any landmarks or you just kind of have a sense of direction and mine is if you ask my family notoriously bad i know what it means to get lost because i'm lost all the time and it doesn't bother me because at this point i've always been found because here am i aren't i so so we inherit group thing because we have to dead reckon and so we watch each other and we listen to each other and we intuit and and and all of this machinery that daddy's the knife mommy's the fork baby's the spoon uh boys are dogs and girls are cats and and common sense and all of this stuff we we do it and and well you know covid kicked up again i knew it was gonna kick up again because i went to cosco and there was no more toilet paper or paper towels and i thought didn't we figure this out the first time but hey sure enough i'm running out of paper towels we inherit group think we inherit values from parents and peers we use common sense we intuit relationships we seek desire security comfort and status just just recently reading something on status where you know people just you know it's it's status we're dealing with oh i'm losing power on my camera or maybe i'm not we participate in this dirkheimian religious dynamic as as groups to cohere to cooperate and to compete this is and we're in the midst of it but you know you might have never heard of dirkheim and you might never heard of this but you sure do it and even once you learn about dirkheim and these dynamics you still do it but if you're deeply religious if it's way down in your motivational structure like a stitch in time saves nine or or any of these other little aphorisms or the the meek inherit the earth well and this is why you get a sense of jesus because anybody hearing that the meek inherit the earth that look around would say hogwash yet we honor the sermon on the mount but then to us as individuals troubles come and they come to all of us desires unmet goals unreached instability betrayal let down abandonment communal or or individual a a depression hits an economic downturn a pandemic a war environmental collapse all kinds of things troubles come if you're a person in the world they do come as i mentioned to poe i've i watched the crown and here's here's this young woman is you know brought into this family and the whole the whole idea behind the family why you know why is charles somehow qualified to be monarch because he's oldest in the family we're working off a culture and a system that is so ancient and that gives it to its gravitas but you know it's so funny talking to those of you who are subjects of the crown talking about your regard for the crown but yet there it is and it's awfully hard to get rid of and why is that and why all the pageantry and why this young woman can be taken into their their place and because this husband of hers you know wasn't allowed to marry his soulmate or what have you that her life was miserable and it leads to this leads to this calamity that was her life via marriage you've become one of the most privileged wealthy and powerful people in the world at age 18 but you're miserable you're bulimic you feel unloved you have affairs like your husband and it's still unacceptable so you get out why are we strange creatures we have demand and expectation well we'll be happy if we get rid of expectation but isn't expectation sort of the joy of life doesn't it kind of keep us moving forward and this great scene from 28 days the sandra bullock movie and that dude was in the wire i didn't know that back then i watched the wire since then no adult human being is happy they are born they have limited amount of time thinking that life is dandy and then inevitable tragedy strikes and they realize life equals loss the whole point of the game is to minimize the pain caused by that equation isn't this spoken just right out of our frame right out of the default public frame the point of the game is to minimize the pain caused by that equation now some people do it by having kids or making money or taking up coin collecting meaning just have a goal and pursue it that's jordan peterson's i mean if you listen to them that's basically okay jordan you have five seconds to say it pick a goal and pursue it the gyroscope of meaning it will propel you into better things than where you are now oh what if that means woke ism um others do it by getting wasted ah but sandra bullock she's not ready to guin her name is in the story she's not ready to buy that no no no she sort of understands it's dead reckoning that coin collecting and making money and having kids and and all of this stuff that we do is somehow meaningful and getting wasted is anti-meaning it's it's reciprocal narrowing not reciprocal broadening and and even coin collection might lead you into history and meaning and and all kinds of things and having kids will certainly get you there nobody gets hurt coin collecting she doesn't have the apparatus oh so now we're into jonathan heightland it's all about getting hurt or not getting hurt everybody hurts every everybody the boyfriend says it's the human condition yeah one of the one of the real high points in the first wave of jordan peterson was the the trip to liberty university and and probably the besides the poor guy rushing the stage oh that was a that was a worthwhile trip that he made no decadence in that stop and then the conversation he had with david nasser which i thought was deeply fruitful because you know here was peterson at his as at his inquisitive best and david nasser speaking i think with with authority and credibility wanting to know about transformations wanting to know as as peterson would often say well how can how can you beat an addiction well often a religious conversion is powerful enough to do it more powerful just than the assertion of your will few of us have will but sort of from the bottom to retrain the elephant once the elephant catches you know catches jesus or something else that the the chatterbox on top can you know will start saying different things so these transformations are profound the physical psychological and social realities may not have changed much now we look at those things within our culture where there's a frame and and say yeah that's that's improvement well that improvement is framed too this vision i just articulated is not neutral it doesn't it isn't self-evident it isn't obvious it isn't by definition well-being we regard it as a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of mind it's a change of reciprocal broadening it is the opposite of suicide which is one response to suffering we look at almost universally continually today suicide is a malady why do we do so well because we've got frames and frames and frames and even the even the secular frame through which rationally speaking suicide should be a very valid and there are people out there that'll say that a very valid response to suffering well but that's conditioned on far deeper things far deeper things in the frame and so when just recently not very far from here an 11 year old boy shoots himself during an online class we say there's something wrong with our culture you're not saying he was precocious and I agree with you you're as Chesterton and many others noted you're outperforming your frame there's ghosts and common sense and parables and things beneath you that that you might not be able to find reason for but there they are and speaking for myself thank god the culture gives to the young what they haven't had a time to get on their own and so when we start seeing children and teens killing themselves because they suffer well when we say that shouldn't happen don't just there pies it away that well there's therapy involved and there's medicine involved yada yada yada but we have more medicine and therapy now than we had 20 years ago and more of this what's with that it's not simple now where are these frames located and notice those of you who are looking at the video so you might be thinking picture frames and that sort of works but these are framed glasses okay why do we use frames around glasses and why are we using glasses well what we see through glasses these these frames are not physical where are they located they're spiritual like school spirit and go all the videos that have talked about school spirit it's you contribute to it you're a dependent upon them they are real enough to kill you they command governments economies climates future markets they hold they command markets markets are very sensitive to these frames they're not subject to your direct volition you don't choose your frames they chose you in the way that you grew up etc although you do participate in their change you do participate that's where if you if you notice the rise of this world word participation it's sort of a middle voice word where where there's some of it out there and some of it in here and it's not all in here and it's not all out there and again the the metaphor sort of arise at the at the at the at the affordance of the of the present technology that we're dealing with i'm i'm recording this on my pc but i'll soon upload it to youtube and where does this video live well what is this video it's not a videotape that that goes in someplace so it's all these zeros and ones and it's going to go out onto library and lbry.com if you're curious about that and it's going to get block chained all throughout all kinds of people's computers on the internet and store there instead of servers on youtube that can be taken down well frames are where are they located well they govern well where are they well information that's weak you see the world through them now as jonathan peugeot noted ethics are downstream from them all of them steven woodford rightly noted that while these goals steven woodford rightly noted that while these goals these telos they they sort of determine your shoulds and and jonathan peugeot keeps saying okay then what's your telos and and he couldn't say it well why couldn't he say it because either because he doesn't know it or he doesn't know it very well or because if he said it he knew he'd know that well he's experienced enough debater he'd know that he would be vulnerable to all sorts of other attacks because it's not terribly well formed because it's too new the ancient ones well they're they're sort of like open source software the vulnerabilities have all been out there for a long time and has have all the the the the attacks and responses what should you do depends on what is what is what you are identity notice how that comes up again read charles taylor where you live within the frame determines the good to strive for and the bad to avoid there's a bunch of dead reckoning and we can most of us agree on a whole bunch of things like bad is being homeless and and and and drug addled or addicted well you know you can reframe those things too and good is well what well it depends on the frame and and this stuff is enormously nuanced enormously complex but well-being as jordan peterson asserted right from the start is a non-starter because it's way downstream of frames and basically what what a lot of the celebrity atheists like to promote is that all the big questions have been answered have they really it doesn't appear so to me you know and and you know that's why james tours in some ways a revelation because he says you know he's a organic chemist and he says you know people say that oh we know how life evolved no we don't who do i believe well now we're back to trump biden land all conceptualizations of well-being exist within a frame and are dependent upon it remember the frame is not physical it's not purely psychological either it's spiritual it lives in the heavenlies in a sense you are dependent upon it not directly so it's not directly subservient to your will you don't really just go out and convert yourself and look at all the world views and say oh i'll pick that one it's a process that takes real time the worldview colonizes you not the other way around you feel dependent upon it you believe because of the frame the frame owns you you don't own the frame you sort of are stewards of the frame with the other people of your frame tribe that you inhabit but again these are frames and frames and frames and frames nested with frames communally you inherit it you participate in it and the real it can kill you or give you life status privilege joy happiness or despair these are the things that govern us to imagine that we're somehow rational and can decide what we believe and go on and make ourselves happy is one of the most stupid things i've ever heard because why watch people i again as a as a as a pastor i observed that i'm not talking about atheists i'm talking about christians talking about normal people we don't work this way why do we get on stage and pretend that this is utopia it's a it's a bankrupt effort so we're all looking for a better frame and that's true and this includes christians because well some christians sort of sit still but many don't they continue to look at me three years into this thing and i'm my my thinking is still evolving am i still a christian yes do i think i'm a better christian yes some of you might disagree who knows but you know the video that i made about the great puzzle well what is the great puzzle well cultures are always looking for a better frame a frame that fits and so jonathan peugeot adopts a new frame why well he grew up evangelical and and but he wrestled with all sorts of things and you can talk to jonathan about that and his you know he pursued art and began to realize that some of this other art was bankrupt and he needed better art and he needed better story and he traveled the world and he saw a lot of life and and he and his brother worked on these things and well they came up with their frame and his articulation of it it's a it's a very ancient frame but in some ways it's a modern adaptation i'm sure of it but the world is glorious the world is painful how do we navigate science won't tell you how to walk through the cornfield it won't tell you the best way because the scientific image has no value in it value rests in the manifest image and that's why for every human being the scientific frame is nested within the manifest frame because you're a human being and you know i was joking on twitter the other day there's a a tweet basically that said sam harris made me a christian well sam harris before was making christians non-christians because sam harris brought me to jordan peterson brought me to jonathan peugeot to jon verbecky into paul van der klee and now i'm a christian going to church i blame sam harris he says this thing got retweeted and retweeted and retweeted it was a count i think he less than a thousand but probably less than a hundred twitter followers but off it went we do it whether we know we're doing it or not we're always working on this frame and we're always using this dead reckoning to try to figure out a better way to view the world and and so again it builds up with with common sense with little aphorisms and little bits of bits of evidence and but but again it's not just simply this referential evidence as in one to one thing out there it's sort of an intuitive fittedness and and and again daddy's the fork daddy's the knife mommy's the fork baby's the spoon boys are dogs and girls are cats a stitch in time saves nine that which goes around comes around and we use all these things to sort of piece it all together the search is always religious whether or not we recognize it to be now some of i know some of you don't like philosophy and some of you do this this video by by paul maxwell on his old on his old channel self wire is is i think it's just a super helpful video daniel bonovac has another history of philosophy video in an hour this is a history how any idiot can memorize the entire history of philosophy and it's about a 30 minute video it's a great video he walks through things clearly and and if you begin to understand the framework of this philosophy which is the love of wisdom that's what philosophy means filo sofia um this love of wisdom well what is wisdom wisdom is knowing how to get through the cornfield wisdom is knowing how to walk in the world wisdom is knowing how to navigate this this world that is too large and too complex for us and so wisdom has all of these little sayings beneath and we we we build up from there so you have metaphysics which is metaphysics it's beyond the the physics the things that go on their own it's ontology ultimate being epistemology knowing axiology ethics ethics is far downstream from it well we well how are we supposed to know the top level oh we've been working on this for thousands of years and is it ever anything we will grasp in our hand fundamental to christianity and the idea of god says no it is not something you will ever wield it is not something you will ever exhaust with your little brain and the amount of time that you have to work on it and and in fact if you look at christian understanding it is something that it will take you an eternity to pursue and joyously go into further on and further up deeper and deeper into god not a super thing floating around in a meta divine structure but god and and of course the the the the crying game moment when stephen woodford had to realize what kind of a person he was talking to and and that's when woodford just was totally disoriented now again i hope that he goes back and thinks and watches more of jonathan has another conversation because you're going to discover some things that are really amazing of course philosophy is less mythological and more esoteric which is why just a tiny little segment of people pay any attention to it everyone else is just going out and living their philosophy for the better or worse now i want to give you a story that talks about the power of frame and illustrates it well now this this might seem a bit of a mercenary thing because it's from the christian it's from christianity but hey this is this is what i got to give this is from john ortberg's i've read this before on my channel john ortberg's the life you've always wanted and you can find it on my blog and i'll put the link below i put it on my blog in october 2009 this is from john ortberg's book the life you've always wanted it's an amazing story he got from tom tom schmidt it's on pages 24 to 28 the state-run convalescent hospital was not a pleasant place it is large it is large understaffed and overfilled with senile and helpless and lonely people who are waiting to die on the brightest of days it seems dark inside and the smell of sickness and and it smells of sickness and stale urine i went there once or twice a week for four years but i never wanted to go there i always left with a sense of relief it is not the kind of place one gets used to on this particular day i was walking in a hallway that i had not visited before looking in vain for a few who were alive enough to receive a flower and a few words of encouragement this hallway seemed to contain some of the worst cases strapped into chairs and into wheelchairs and looking completely helpless as i neared the end of this hallway i saw an old woman strapped up in a wheelchair her face was an absolute horror the empty stare and white pupils of her eyes told me that she was blind a large hearing aid over one ear told me that she was almost death one side of her face was being eaten by cancer there was a disc there was a discolored and running sore covering part of one cheek and it had pushed her nose to one side dropped one eye and distorted her jaw so that what should have been the corner of her mouth was the bottom of her mouth as a consequence she drooled constantly i was told later that when new new nurses arrived the supervisors would send them to feed this woman thinking that if they could stand this site they could stand anything in the building i also learned later that this woman was 89 years old and that she had been there bedridden blind nearly death and alone for 25 years this was mable now again someone might say oh suffering we should put her out of her misery was she miserable wouldn't any of us be if we heard this description of ourselves i don't know why i spoke to her she looked at she looked least less likely to respond than most of the people i saw in that hallway but i put a flower in her hand and said here this flower is for you happy mother's day she held the flower up to her face and tried to smell it and then she spoke and much to my surprise her words although somewhat garbled her deformity were obviously produced by a clear mind she said thank you it's lovely but can i give it to someone else i can't see it you know i'm blind i said of course and i pushed her in her chair down the hallway to a place where i thought i could find some alert patients i found one and i stopped the chair mable held out the flower and said here this is from jesus that was when it began to dawn on me that this was not an ordinary human being later i wheeled her back to her room and learned more about her history she had grown up on a small farm that she managed with only her mother until her mother died then she ran the farm alone until 1950 when her blindness and sickness sent her to the convalescent hospital for 25 years she got weaker and sicker with constant headaches back aches and stomach aches and then the cancer came and she was sick again and then the cancer came too her three roommates were all human vegetables who screamed occasionally but never talked they often soiled their bed clothes and because the hospital was understaffed especially on sundays when i usually visited the stents was often overpowering mable and i became friends over the next few years and i went to see her once or twice a week for the next three years her first words to me were usually an offer of hard candy from a tissue some days i would read to her from the bible and often i would pause she would continue reciting the passage from memory word for word on other days i took a book of hymns and would sing with her and she would know all the words of the old songs for mable there were not merely exercises in memory she would often stop mid-hymn and make a brief comment about the lyrics she would have killed on youtube they would make a brief comment about the lyrics she considered particularly relevant to her own situation i never heard her speak of loneliness or pain except in the stress she placed on several lives insert on several lines in certain hymns it was not many weeks before i turned from a sense that i was being helpful to a sense of wonder and i would go to her with a pen and paper to write down the things she would say during one hectic week of final exams i was frustrated because my mind seemed pulled in 10 directions at once with all of the things i had to think about a question occurred to me what does mable have to think about hour after hour day after day week after week not even able to know if it's day or night so i went to her and asked mable what do you think about when you're um when you lie here and she said i think about jesus i sat there and thought for a moment about the difficulty for me of thinking about jesus for even five minutes and this guy's studying to be a pastor and i asked what do you think about jesus she replied slowly and deliberately as i wrote i think about how good he's been to me he's been awfully good to me in my life you know i'm one of those kind who's mostly satisfied lots of folks wouldn't care much for what i think lots of folks would think i'm kind of old-fashioned but i don't care i'd rather have jesus he's all the world to me i feel a song coming on and then mable began to sing an old hymn jesus is all the world to me notice how these little sayings just bubble up i've seen that so often in visiting people with dementia or or aphasia i remember one member of the congregation his wife would be in horror when she'd take him to church because he'd walk into church she'd say bullshit bullshit sgp no pastor i can't take him to i said let him say it in church i had other jokes that popped up and he would he would he would often at the end of a service like to come up and tell me a rye off-color joke at the end of the service and that was that was him but he lost much of his speech but if you'd go and visit him with a hymnal he'd sing jesus is all the world to me my life my joy my all he is my strength from day to day without him i would fall when i am sad i go to him i go no other one can cheer me so when i am sad he makes me glad he's my friend is this high poetry is it dumpy campy homie this is not fiction incredible as it may seem a human being really lived like this i know i knew her how could she do it seconds ticked and minutes crawled and so did days and weeks and months and years of pain without human company without explanation of why it was happening and she lay there and sang hymns how could she do it the answer i think is that mabel had something that you and i don't have much of she had power well we like talking about power now don't we and you would imagine that she is the least privileged person certainly far less privileged than the than the princess of wales mabel had power lying there in that bed unable to move unable to see unable to hear unable to talk to anyone she had incredible power there was an ordinary human being who received supernatural power to do extraordinary things miracles her existence was a miracle her joy was the miracle here was an entire life consisted of following jesus as best she could in her situation patient endurance of suffering solitude prayer meditation on scriptures worship fellowship when it was possible giving when she had a flower or a piece of candy to offer imagine being in her condition and saying i think about how good he's been to me he's been awfully good to me in my life you know i'm one of those kinds who is mostly satisfied this is the 23rd psalm come to life the lord is my shepherd i shall not want for anyone who really saw mabel not like this camera could that other seeing who was willing to turn aside a hospital bed became a burning bush a place where this ordinary and pain-filled world was visited by the presence of god when others saw a life in that hospital bed they wanted to take off their shoes the lid was off the terrarium then the train then the turn came with a catch of the breath and a beating of the heart and tears they were standing on holy ground do you believe such a life is possible for a normal human being where does such a life come from her life was framed by something her power came from that frame now langdon gilkey wrote really i really enjoyed this book shang tung compound i've referred to it before because eric he's called eric ridley in the book but the whole book is is well worth reading it's a short book it's not very long it's been around a while it's the story of men and women under pressure here basically these were the business people and the diplomats and the missionaries that were in china during the um the japanese attempt to consume china and they were put together in an internment camp basically by the consular branch of the japanese empire and they were treated much more humanely than prisoners of war or or people in those kinds of conditions but they were confined to a place too small and it's really a remarkable book if you enjoy shows like the walking dead this would be a good one because it's a it's a it's it's in some ways the same type of mental exercise what do people do with each other under pressure and gilkey's a keen observer he took notes he was able to keep a journal while he was there and right after the war he wrote a lot of it down it's really a really a very helpful book with a lot of wise observations but frames are of course nested and in the moments of time rise and fall in our consciousness field here these people their lives were interrupted by war internment camp but the normal normal textures of life come to the fore and and so all of the questions of character and personality and belief all the matrices sort of come together consciousness is sort of a framing and consciousness is sort of a field let's say and notice how we're using metaphors and and other frames sort of surface and recess and you know if if our if our you know hunger will drive you to do certain things and you know there's lots going on with these frames coming up and coming down and and and so many ways in order to sort of navigate from sort of the dead reckoning i mean the i always tell my dog his god is his stomach because my dog is very easily manipulated by food and and people are very easily manipulated by something and so in fact the the the aspiration to grow a frame which is large enough in which the other frames will will nest is actually a formula to live a life with directionality and meaning and purpose and and to accomplish something now again you don't need to know the word frame this framing metaphor has is relatively new but basically that's what religions have been doing for people throughout the history of the world and philosophies and and whether or not you you're conscious of your frame or your philosophy of your or your religion you have one it's the basic operating system to manage the enormity of the world now there's an amazing part in this in this story because this story is really about moving between frames and and so their their external conditions created frames which which which tested people and and when the war ends there's really a very apocalyptic element where suddenly the world looks different and and the prison camp that the guards are different in the prison camp and they know it and the people know it and and all of the rules change and you might imagine well physicality and bullets and threats of and threats of being shot are sort of the ultimate layer but all of those guns are held by people and frames hold the people it seems to be no more obvious thing about this world and and then these american soldiers soldiers come parachuting down and he talks about the fact that they are like gods in the camp you know all of the men wanted to to to live in their approval and all of the women wanted that and more and and suddenly there was a new reality in the camp and and you've got all these layers of culture and power and and everything just comes together but the the only terms gilkey could use to to actually talk about this were religious terms those were the metaphors that were at hand and the ones that worked the best there's this wonderful point in the book when a lot of the people swept up in this were missionaries and monks and this one guy was the best he was the best black market smuggler he was a trappist monk and the japanese eventually caught him and and you know again the penalty penalties weren't too severe but they warned everyone they were going to make an example of them so they sent him to solitary for a month and a half and the rest of the monks just laughed their heads off because for for many of these monks life in the camp was actually presented different challenges than from what they had before the minute i heard the news the whole camp looked and fell and smelled differently this was the end of the war now it was over and all that was left was getting out and much of that worried much of much of that had worried and much that had worried us for the future receded quickly into the past burt and i hurriedly discussed the political possibilities of our future would they land at at sing tau would gorillas take over the camp and so on i went back to the kitchen as in an unreal as into an unreal world i found men debating as we had done endlessly for two years how long it would be now that the attack on on q so seemed certain to come the news of course um seeped around quickly enough so don't tell anybody the war's over yeah anybody's going to keep that secret it on wednesday evening more or less by unspoken word all of the adults gathered outside the commandant's office hoping to hear some bulletin if one came if one did not we intended to demand official word of some sort from the japanese for they had refused to utter one syllable on the subject since the first tidings had come in on monday while the whole camp was standing there jovial but very tense and excited remember the guards still have guns and bullets they're still barbed wire around the camp while the whole camp was standing there jovial but very tense and excited mr watanabe came out of his office he was a well-hated but secondary official small arrogant and mean at one time or another about everyone had swarmed to himself to beat him black and blue when the war was over when mr watanabe saw this immense crowd he turned ashen then all in unison bellowed there he is get him what had changed what had changed everything had changed nothing had changed they were demanding that the words match with the framed the changing of frames struck with terror watanabe turned in panic and fled towards the japanese quarters with his small sneaker clad feet twinkling white over the ground the sight of this hatred tor this hatred tormentor transformed before our eyes into a fleeting rabbit caused a howl of delight and laughter to rise with that metamorphosis of our rulers all threats on the lives and limbs of the guards vanished nothing was said officially that evening but watanabe's terror terrified flight was generally regarded as the most promising clue to the real state of things that we could have that we could have had although the coming the coming victory had been a glorious event for which all longed it had also in its had serious implication to those few who dared to ponder them who knew how an enraged japanese soldiery might behave on the eve of certain defeat allied forces were a thousand miles away by land we were hundreds of miles from the nearest seaport did the allies know we were here did anyone in authority care we were here could troops get to us in time if they did thursday the day after watanabe's flight was weird everyone expected the end of our world to come yet in the moment we were still absorbed in the trivia of camp life then on friday the end came as a as glorious a per perusia now he had christian training and he became a theologian eventually but you can read langdon gilkey's wikipedia to figure out how that went for him glorious perusia as the wildest biblical um scenarist could have devised the day august 16 1945 was clear blue and warm such as a day should have been we all began our chores by cooking stoking and cleaning up slops as usual about the middle of the morning however word flashed around the camp that an allied plane had been sighted the clouds are going to part two or three during the course of the war we had seen one of our planes flying up in the upper atmosphere a fast moving silver speck far out of identification range we felt sure they were allied because of their solitary height and their speed of having contrast to the japanese planes that chugged along overhead burning as one wag put it coal balls the plane had been sighted on friday was was evidently quite different or so a boy who spread the word came clear as he ran through the kitchen screaming in an almost insane excitement an american plane and headed straight for us we all flung our stirring paddles down beside the cauldrons left the carrots unchopped on the table and tore after the boy to the ball field get visions of the book of matthew with one will be taken one will be left that's the same idea it's the same imagery isn't it this miracle was true there it was now big as a gull and heading for us from the western mountains at this point the excitement was too great for any of us to contain it surged up within us a flood of joyful feelings sweeping aside all of our restraints making us its captives suddenly i realized that for some seconds i had been running around in circles waving my hands in the air shouting at the top of my lungs on becoming aware of these antics i looked around briefly to see how others were behaving it was pandemonium more so because everyone like me was looking up and shouting at the plane and was unconscious of what he or she or anyone else was doing stayed folks were embracing each others to whom they had barely spoken for two years proper middle-aged english men and women were cheering or swearing others were laughing hysterically or crying like babies all were moved to an ecstasy of feeling that carry them quite out of their normal sense as the great plane banked over and circled three times this was our plane and then he talks about the american soldiers it was however the women or first well first we'll talk about the men when gods came to visit the children of man it was only to be expected that the men would readily obey their slightest wishes and also that the women would be enraptured with them taken for granted in the pliable realm of mythology such fantasies also turned out to be true in our mundane world when the moment was ripe these seven men who ruled the camp for the next two weeks were like gods among us they were in fact as a group large and physique handsome and capable i suspect that whenever they had whatever they had done as our rulers they would have been the same had they not come from the clouds to save us had they not braved incredible dangers to do so did they not represent massive and unbelievable power they were not the fight them were they not the fighting men who had won the war for us while we were cooking and stoking behind walls were they not tellers of wondrous tales of marvels undreamed of rockets and landing ships of radar and atom bombs to us who knew nothing of the technology of the war did they not look so strong and healthy so virile so different from the shrunken humanity we knew and finally they did not promise did they not promise us that we would all be flown to our homes in china america and england as soon as the planes were available the salvation for which we had yearned the only frame of reference in terms of which their status among us and their effects on the camp can be understood was that of deity one result was that the experienced british leaders of the camp who in other circumstances would have little use for such youths and american youths in particular treated them like emperors they these usually impressive figures could be seen rushing about doing silly little errands compiling useless statistics ever ready to accede to the slightest need or wish of the liberators middle-aged bankers who were in frequent contact with the heavenly court could be seen retail retailing the wonders of their wisdom to the little group of odd fellow internees who were not fortunate enough to deal with the newcomers directly it was however the women of the status who instinctively recognized their divine stat their divine stat the women of the camp their divine status of all ages whether from high society or low married or single proper or not so proper all wanted nothing better from life than to adore they followed the pleasantly surprised soldiers everywhere staring at them in rapture edging up to get a word from their fighting for a chance to wait on them pushing their equally adoring children aside so as to be able slyly to touch or stroke them as always it was wonderful to have gods in our midst unless like the writer and a few others you lost a girlfriend in the process but apocalypse brings strange reversals oh i thought i'd just found the just had found the spot here we go on a chilly gray day in mid-september some four weeks after our rescue a british colonel showed up to address the british subjects as he said at the beginning of his speech the word um this would be a sobering hour for them since his purpose was to tell them with all possible candor that the reality they had now faced would be like your small businesses in the cities of china in the three years since you left have been almost all destroyed beyond repair shops have been looted of their shops have been looted of their stock chinese merchants have moved into the premises go downs have been ransacked wrecked and abandoned and are also and are almost useless everything that has not been shattered was passed into chinese hands there is little or no hope of reparations with which to get started again above all i must say to you with all the force and authority of my command that the days of colonial life in asia are over our rule in the treaty ports is a thing of the past favored treatment of foreign firms under british law is gone our control of residential areas has become impossible those of you who had worked for firms worldwide in scope can probably find work in your company's other offices although you too must move from china you are among the luckiest overseas british those of you however whose roots lie in china alone had best resign yourselves to the loss of your old life we cannot force you now to leave china you may still find work here and there for the first time in in tates in taint sin in shanghai or as advisors to chinese firms but the future there is a bleak one for the self-employed britisher our official advice to you is to give up east asia find refuge where you can with relatives in england or seek new jobs in australia new zealand canada and other places where the british life is still going on an era has ended and with it has ended your own past lives i'm sorry but those are the facts and they were right what changed what rules the world peugeot in both of those videos again and again where do you stand his primary image or representation here is spatial he called out brett weinstein on this in that video back in 2017 with jordan peterson and and jonathan peugeot and brett weinstein brett weinstein kept saying hire and jonathan peugeot kept calling what do you mean hire the point is well it's it's well it's exaptation of the it's well it's exaptation again hire we're referential creatures but you cannot use you always use metaphor when you're talking about the super sensible reality that's why we're talking about frames where you're thinking about a window frame or frames on a glasses and this basically gets right into c.s lewis's point and i've read most of this chapter in a previous video you can find in his book miracles in the chapter on horrid red things language can only the only kind of language available for super sensibles is metaphorical when you talk about metaphorical truth well talk about someone a super spreader throwing the virus it doesn't mean they get it in their hand and they throw it it means they're throwing it this is this is what we use for just about everything else exaptation to employ this parabolic capacity things didn't start physical and later evolved to be mythical or metaphorical they started united wind and air was the same thing if you try to work backwards you're not going to get back to the same place later a fork developed and well we're on this side of the fork but the fork itself is always framed within other realities that's why in some ways wind and spirit still can sort of mean the same things but we really strain to figure it out what we're dealing with is again the loss of modernity and you know dr jim was the one in a previous conversation really brought this to the fore that's why the celebrity atheists arose when they did they arose in many ways like fundamentalism arose in the in the end of the 19th century as a way to somehow try to cling on to receding christendom they felt it going away and so what did they do they you know let's let's bring in the walls and let's try and let's try and hold ourselves off here's the tweet by matthew farley how did i end up listening to christians again 2016 sam harris sam harris to jordan peterson jordan peterson to rebel wisdom rebel wisdom to john verveke john verveke to jonathan peugeot and paul vanderkley i blame sam sam harris paved the road to me go figure jordan peterson the you have the jordan peterson allergy which by the looks of the some of the employees of penguin canada seems to be alive and well celebrity atheists while they get nervous about him the rationality rules jordan peterson's been making him itch for three years and woke fundamentalists and in many ways they are fundamentalists because in some ways they're sort of the wave to come but they're the old wave part of what joey said early on with our meetups here is that a lot of these wokesters are really conservative what do you mean they're conservative they're trying to preserve what their parents learned well what is that well think about that through it's it's a good idea and so when jonathan peugeot rises it's really the lindy effect it's really the re-emergence of very ancient things and if you look at well the religion that's not a religion and the work that that that john verveking is doing it's very ancient modern it's all very ancient modern the work of jonathan peugeot it's very ancient modern well when when when modernity which is a long slow wave sort of begins to recede well then all of the things that were below begin to emerge and you begin to see them from beneath the surface so you have icons and stoicism and religio and and all of those kinds of things so i hope this helps understand a little bit of what we talk about when we talk about frames and basically how this conversation is working i should have a big conclusion to it but um yeah wanted i wanted to get this out because again how can you understand these two how can you understand these three how can you understand the conversations as they're happening look at what they're trying to do look at what is implicit figure out see if you can go back and you know sort of what jonathan peugeot says see it phenomenologically don't be too concerned about the pictures the pictures are there to try to inform your imagination you're not going to be able to see it without the pictures that's the only way we can apprehend it but these things we are trying to apprehend well they're way beyond us but they're built into us why did you know why was that language of langston gilkey so evident to us and why does that language communicate to us were those american soldiers gods how were they gods what does that mean if you meditate on these things you can perhaps gain wisdom
