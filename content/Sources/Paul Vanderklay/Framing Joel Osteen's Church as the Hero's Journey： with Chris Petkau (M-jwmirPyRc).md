 I'm doing well. This is this is the first time we've had a chance to talk unless we've talked on the discord before I don't know. Not really I um probably not I like don't really do like I'm I don't take to discord very well like I I'm not much of a typer you know what I mean like what I like about the podcast is we can like you know I can talk and I'm like you I like to just let it fly and start talking and see what comes out of my mouth and take it from there you know what I mean if I write I start thinking you know I can't do too much thinking it gets me in trouble well let's let's um let's start with your story if that's okay with you yeah um it's a long one man oh um I guess I mean I'll tell you um um I was raised in uh raised in the church um my grandma was um Irish Catholic came off the boat from Ireland when she was like 18 um do you know who Catherine Coleman is no she's like a Pentecostal revivalist who like was seen like miracles and signs and wonders and stuff like that so she was Irish Catholic turned Pentecostal and so that's kind of like my background I guess like all my my mom's name is Teresa and like all my all her kids were named after saints and I was named after my uncle who was named Christopher and um yeah so grew up like that uh grew up like in like Pentecostal movements and stuff like that with like you know all the all the like bodies on the floor like people like falling under the power and stuff like that um and then um I became a Christian I did too many mushrooms when I was 14 and then uh that freaked me out man and so that kind of brought me towards the um the Pentecostals because they were like they kind of had like language for me and like how to understand that type of stuff so that was really interesting um I want I took like got really like serious about um being you know being a Christian or whatever went to a Bible school once I graduated in North Carolina I'm from Vancouver Canada originally but um yeah I went to Bible school um and like wanted to be a minister for a long time um what I started running into was feeling like um what I was sensing and feeling I wasn't really able to express um theologically and so as like a minister like every like even like like I was just saying with like typing and stuff like that like I don't know I'm a very instinct driven person I guess and so I like to just go off instinct and so Bible school was like you have to like back up what you say with the scripture and I don't know I wasn't I didn't know how to do it right because I mean like I actually read the Bible a lot because because I took that seriously but there was something about it that um just wasn't working for me and so that got me into music and like more of an artistic path of trying to um express myself um because the thing about music is that um it's open to interpretation and um you know I can I got I got the creative license to kind of say what I want to say you know what I mean and if it's wrong well it's art even if it's wrong as long as I as long as I made you feel something that's all I really care about right so there's a potential title right there yeah well yeah you know and like and like you know like Picasso said the art is a lie that that tells the truth and like I I think that's very true like like we're we're all like you know we're all looking in the dark right trying to figure this whole thing out and and what I really appreciate about you and everything that you do is you're making so much room for people to be wrong you're making so much room for it and like and like like the thing that like the thing like that's so interesting about like your estuary and everything is you got people from all different perspectives and they're all they're all like clashing and whatever but the conversations are healthy and helpful and productive and and stuff like that and there's and there's room and then like you know and then you don't just have Christians in there you have like non-Christians and whatever and like one of the things that was most empowering for me that you always uh or that I've heard you say before was like we gotta we gotta even have some heresy in here because we gotta be able to separate the good ideas from the bad ideas and so um one thing that I've really respected about you and your project is the intellectual courage to and and and confidence that that if you're wrong you're okay with that you can learn and and and we can find out how we're all wrong together right you were just saying that even with um your talk you were having with uh the the third lobe quartet you were saying you know like they won't tell me what they won't tell me what they really think in church yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a problem do you still go to church or not so i go to joel osteen's church do you really in houston texas oh my that's a big church well you know man like it's very interesting because i'm like really interested in like you know there's like a big like orthodox thing happening right within in this online community and it's super super interesting and i'm very interested in what the orthodox have to say and so i've got this on that one side but to be honest like i really like a like i really i really like a lot of things about joel loesteen's church and if if you can get you know it's a 16 000 seat um stadium yeah and usually it's probably half full most services and maybe maybe a little less than half but if you can get that many people in a in a in a church all worshiping and by the way like incredibly diverse oh yeah and like like houston's incredibly diverse i think it's the most diverse city in the world and man there's something really powerful even about like you know it's got to be probably like 8 000 of us all like singing together worshiping you know like and and then like you know the message is very simple i've gone to bible school so like i'll me and sarah pointed out like my wife she she went to we met in bible school or pointed out like that's not what the bible says like he got that wrong like he's misquoting scripture we love it and like i don't know it to me it's almost like my it's like i got i got i got the estuary and like and like some of like the interesting like traditional orthodox thoughts in one sense and i've got like to me like wherever church is is has been going which is this as you've talked about at great lengths this mega church style for better or for worse which you know is very interesting and there's something there is something yeah something about it so yeah so i go to church i go to that church um part of what i like about that church to be really honest is uh that i can hide in it that i can that i don't have to that uh that uh that i've that i've even and i think a lot of people can relate to this is that um people people people take liberties and uh people and people like take um people take liberties in terms of um well i remember like being in bible school and people telling me that me and my wife weren't supposed to be together for example which is okay you know you can have your opinion but there is something about having having like this coming from a spiritual place and then and then and then tell and then making statements like that and and i don't know so i'm i'm like i don't know i i don't have a i don't have like i'm i'm a christian and like i understand that like i really like a lot of the conversation that you guys talk about about how christianity the even the idea of like the the earth being made in seven days or whatever maybe it's just like a heuristic right like maybe it's simple symbolic and maybe it's a heuristic and simple way to for us to understand it and for me like i understand how that heuristic maybe has to just be be all there is for some people but but i know for me like i i want to ask all the dirty questions and i want to get into all the dirty details and i want to ask yeah and because i think it's like the same thing like the same like um confidence that like i think that you have which is like if i'm wrong i can find out and i can learn and i'm not afraid to ask those big questions so that's what i really appreciate about you well thank you well how did how did you find me um have you heard of this guy his name jordan peterson oh yeah yeah yeah um yeah i was listening to him and like what what attracted you to jordan peterson so like after bible school like i i i i left i left bible school and it had a bad taste in my mouth about a lot of like stuff like that like um just different things and and like you were even just talking i was just listening to a podcast you did with a guy who like counted like helped with like counting the offerings and stuff like that like i've done that i've seen how much money comes through sometimes and like i don't know i also like knew people who um who were like missionaries that were supposed to be like funded by this church but they didn't have the money and i don't know there was things where i was and so i went through the same phase that i guess everybody else went through where i like started deconstructing and asking all these questions and trying to figure it all out right and like and so jordan peterson was like you know kind of the the same like one thing that like a guy like sam harris came through and did for so many people was make us feel make you make people feel intellectually insecure if you're a christian do you know what i mean yeah like i don't i want to like i don't want to look stupid i don't want to i don't want to believe this and and it's just because like my parents told me or or or i'm dumb or something and so and i and it's funny because i've actually come full circle on that because jordan peterson was actually the the the guy that started giving like giving a lot of intellectual credibility towards christianity and kind of drawing me towards that but one thing i've also kind of determined or whatever is like well really the crux of christianity is about the resurrection of jesus christ which is never going to be an intellectual claim that you can that you're ever going to be able to take seriously you're going to have to be willing to take that hero's journey leap of faith and just choose to believe it and trust it if if you want to if you want to go down that road because it's never going to be something that you it's literally like it literally is i think the story is even designed that way to to offend your mind what do you think about that do you think i'm right about that i um let me finish typing because i take a lot of notes and things like this because you'll say things and it goes by fast and i want to be able to if if later on in the conversation i want to pull it up i could pull it up then it's i think that's i think that's right in that i i actually don't think you can when we think about proving something historical i think we have sort of a modernist fantasy about proof that we're propagating but i think that i think between human beings the deeper story is what you said the sentence before when you said sam harris made people feel intellectually insecure if you're a christian you don't want to look silly so much of what we believe and don't believe we do in fact crowdsource from each other and this is this is why i tell people if you want to believe you need to go to church because and i i think about that scientifically if that's the way people want to think because if there's anything that we've seen to be true about human beings they believe in community they believe in groups they believe what the herd believes and i mean that deep down belief that the elephant has not the stuff that the rider on top is chattering about and so if you want to change your beliefs you have to change your herd and so something like the resurrection i mean there's plenty there's obviously plenty of skepticism about the resurrection immediately after it happened you know the disciples are like oh you know jesus is risen and the authorities are like let's cover it up and say jesus you know that's in the gospels but you know right from the start there's plenty of skepticism about it and even you know even things that well let's take a look at the storming of the capital on january 6 we can't get our story straight about that let's look at covid we can't get our story straight about that human beings can't get their story straight and that's because reality is too big too complex that we can improve at it we can strive at it but i think you're right in terms of belief in the resurrection is probably only going to come if you live in community with other people who in fact believe it that to me doesn't mean that the resurrection is ahistorical it doesn't believe it doesn't make me think that there you can't have good arguments for against the resurrection or the physicality of the resurrection but what it means is that when it comes to how individuals live it out that is going to be dependent on the community that they are surrounded by and how in fact that belief in the resurrection plays into the rest of their lives because that is the kind of credibility we tend to believe people we find credible and the judgments that we make about other people have everything to do with all of the little nuts and bolts of their lives so having the people imagine you know it's the same thing with arguments about the supernatural and miracles because the the position of let's say the the materialists or the naturalists would be that well miracles don't happen so then in theory one miracle should destroy their worldview and c.s lewis at the beginning of his book miracles made that point when he said the only person that i know who has seen a ghost doesn't believe in ghosts so we we this this whole business about belief and verifiability and credibility it is not anywhere as simplistic as modernism likes to make it sound so that's why that's why you know that's sort of how i put that put that together they are going to people are going to believe in the resurrection if people that they find to be loving and credible also believe in it and that's where i get my belief in the resurrection because my parents were loving incredible and so why would i doubt my parents just because somebody named sam harris has a big following and i'm i'm disagreeable enough that everybody can if once everybody else has their story cooked up i tend to get a little ornery and contrarian and i want to go the other way so i i i need it to be true and i and i have to reach out outside of the of rationality and i have to i have to reach out and and and and and even in my darkest moments i have to choose to believe it because i i needed that to be true like when like i'm going to jordovstein's church and he says and he says today is is the day for your miracle and i'm not i'm and 8 000 people around me are cheering and and saying today is and today is the day for your breakthrough and today is the day for your and and there's 80 000 people all around me and we all need that to be true and and and believing that gives us the strength to get through the week and and and and like that's why i've kind of like framed it as like a hero's journey like you have to you have to like it's that it's that taking that leap of faith like you talk about like modernity a lot and and i love how like you framed it all and like and like a lot of people have like asked like what's after modernity and and this kind of stuff like you made this really good point about january 6th or covid or we can't get our story straight and it and and like we're also seeing like it seems like all the weak weak aspects of the church you know have been pointed out but we're really starting to see the weak aspects of what it means to be a person because you can't really blame a lot of a lot of what's happened the last two years on the church can you yeah yeah it's true where i mean you can't blame it on them that's true you can try but and and so that means that it's a human problem yeah and so and so it's it's it seems as though like i even heard gris say i think today in a podcast or i think whatever you want to call what he does i love what he's doing and i love what you're doing i mean that's why i wanted to talk to you because i'm watching what you guys are doing and i think this is this is terrific did you know gris has a patreon you can you can uh for five dollars a month you can help him uh i still gotta go there because i am gonna support him because i guess that that's just gonna be way too much fun um but he said that all things are are are an act of faith like even the idea like i'm not good enough to to to do something is something he was saying even that is an act of faith because you're focusing energy on what you can't do and and and like what i'm what i've been asking myself is like is after modernity is it something like a like a post rational are we going into an age of post rationality where the limitations of rationality the enlightenment all of these things where we thought we could trust in our mind in order to to to we thought that that we thought that that we could rationalize our way into a utopia and all we're creating is hell and we need something outside of ourselves or we're never or it's all it's it's only going to get worse yeah i i think you're right i think that's exactly where we're going we're going into a post rationality and then you've got you know you've got modernist types who are saying no no no we can't go there because it won't be rational but everybody's looking at them like i don't believe in your rationality i doubt your rationality just like you doubted that god and of course then the then the rationalists are exactly where the christians were and they're like you know i don't know what to say to you and but then the hard questions are okay well how do we live but but the problem is we've never really lived upon this rationality and i think that's where the meaning crisis conversation gets interesting because the meaning crisis is sort of a dawning of a deep dawning of the implications of this rationalist world that we're going to lose ourselves in there too and we can't do that like like we're we're so rational but we've invented a word called chest feeding i mean how's this going for us yeah right like like you know like for me like after 2020 things kind of got really simple like like i've i've always i you know i watched my jordan peterson videos and and i thought i i started in peugeot and you and people who who are giving a different way of looking at the whole thing right and and that and that that's great but after 2020 and like some really difficult stuff and me needing to like me needing and needing a miracle me needing like good like needing needing me me realizing what the hell i was able to create all around me and and if i wanted to take the jordan peterson thing seriously i couldn't blame anybody else for it i had to blame blame myself and then just decide okay then if then i then then i if if i can mess this up like god you can help me fix it and i had to reach out outside of myself and like and like that that that's something that like like you know how they say like there's no there's no atheists in in the fog of war you know what i mean like it's there's difficult moments like the atheists don't exist like because because you you you can't afford to you have to you have to you have to reach out outside of yourself to to stay to keep going to you know as a pastor i mean this is pretty much what you do right you you help people go on yeah yeah yeah right that's exactly what you do you help people go on because they get stuck and you have to help them get unstuck and so often when people get stuck they i love that that that video that was on the internet a while they pulled the sheep out of this trench the sheep bound that everyone back into the trench that's what people are like what we do so so when and why did you get started playing with youtube um you did a podcast with sherry harkins yep and around the same time jonathan peugeot came um out with a video called a call to artists and it was during the time um it was kind of so this would have been probably around march or something yep and we had just gone through an election and a bunch of stuff um and we you know we we went we went through um all kinds of stuff in 2020 yes we did and and i i based off of what jonathan was saying in that video i just knew that i had to do something so that made me join the art group um and then um you know what my favorite scripture is hebra's 1110 um abraham went not knowing where he was going looking for a city whose builder and maker was god and so i've always kind of felt like i'm following my nose a little bit following my instinct following and not knowing where i'm going and following it and so so much of what youtube is for me and it seems like that's very pretty similar for you is really not sure what what we're doing but we're doing it and we're and we're but but it it it's it it's it's something to do with participating it's something to do with participating with whatever's happening and um you're you know there's youtube channels sprouting all over the place in your in your estuary and um and and and i'm able to do this because you're i'm able to i've got some nutty things that i say in some of my podcasts okay and i'm able to do that because pastor paul made a made room for it said it was okay now that doesn't mean you endorse everything i say of course not but you're letting me you're you've created an estuary for dirty fish to swim and you're letting me swim and i and and and that for for a person like me and i think there's a lot of people like me who if i think i'm too dirty of a fish uh to work in most most churches because because i'm i'm i'm um maybe that's not even true but but but that's how it feels a lot of dirty fish working in churches trust me well i'm not good at pretending well that's that's to your credit but it seems as though i gotta do some pretending yeah that's that's that's a that's an issue that's an issue that's an issue so did you have any experience working with youtube or videos or anything or did you just dive in completely no like it was it's been it's just been an interesting process i mean so the i basically just dove in not really knowing what i was doing i i talked to uh james corteeds you know who he is um the roosters crow podcast no he's a cool guy oh yeah okay i know who he is yeah he's he's got a podcast he was he was doing randos conversations and so i went on one of his and uh i talked to him a little bit i even asked him like because sometimes he'll just read out of books and post it on youtube i'm like yeah well what are you doing and he's i'm just i don't know i'm just it's kind of the same thing he didn't know he's just reading off reading out books and one of them is actually a book that i really wanted to listen to but the audio book speaker the guy was too boring to listen to yeah and he like i just didn't like his voice and james has got a great voice so i listened that whole book uh the the um i think it's called christ the eternal dao or something it maps daoism onto christianity in a very interesting way and um so that kind of inspired me like well this guy is just uh just reading his book and i've been writing music for a long long time i sold all my music stuff because it's a long story but i got mad mad and sold it all and um but i had all these lyrics and poetry and stuff i'd written so i just started like recording like acapellas and stuff like that and just posting it and like not knowing and then uh tried a couple of podcasts with people within the art group and um that i find i find that i'm finding these conversations to be super engaging and and i'm learning so much as i'm doing it and so i started doing more podcasts and then recently i've been messing with uh just uh remixing some big pvk and some other these rappers that nobody's heard about well and i i've really you know i gosh i wanted to you did you had a video a couple days ago and i you know i've i started my clips channel a while ago because i wanted a clips channel where i could reliably find i wanted to use a clips channel the way that i've used my blog for years which is a place that i could reliably find things i find because i see something and i think i might want to use that but with the internet it's going to be hard to find it again because i know myself and i've lived with myself for a long time now and so you make a clips channel you just put it all in one bucket and there it is and so i started that but then i got distracted and i left it follow for a while and and so you know a couple days ago i saw a couple things that grizz did so i had to throw that on my clips channel so i could find them again and so i saw some stuff of yours that i thought oh i want to throw that on my clips channel i want to find that again i thought your i thought your the other symbolic world that and what i've really enjoyed is you know watching you collaborate with a number of the other people in this estuary in this online estuary space at least because i see i see that kind of creative collaboration as productive and i you know i declared on twitter today that my new favorite youtube channel is is uh is grizz's youtube channel now new favorite for me is is not necessarily too high of a praise because i tend to have a new favorite every week or every month but you know for today it's it's my new favorite because he's doing some he's doing some really creative things with it and what i love about small channels is we can do what we're doing now that we can actually have a conversation and the problem i immediately saw with you know jordan peterson only had 300 000 subs when i found him you know something in that ballpark was that was already too many and in a lot of ways my channel is already too many and i don't even have 20 000 and so scale is a scale is a huge problem so i am i'm just absolutely pleased at what i see with with you and grizz and chad and the randos and karen and um and nate heil and you know all all the people in this corner of the internet doing this stuff and we nobody can possibly watch all of the videos that are being produced at least i know i can't some people have depending on their work have more time but i i see this kind of collaboration as there's a lot of potential i and but like you i don't know where any of it goes and that's kind of the fun of it right yeah yeah it may it may all just sort of die or whimper out or it might evolve into something else or youtube might say ah we're sick of giving the world free bandwidth you know that's an that's an astounding thing that youtube has been doing now it's got its price but they are giving us free bandwidth and well well i mean i i think your channel is going to get bigger um like there was a story i was i was wondering like if this would come up in like like today so uh my wife is pregnant oh congratulations yeah yeah it's wonderful man it's amazing it's actually a miracle actually like honestly it's a miracle that's too long of a story anyways so today she's looking up on youtube um parenting stuff okay and the first thing she looks up is okay we're doing a podcast about um um children and raising children this is uh whatever and she's and she's going to talk about um you know parenting what would you like to say your pronouns uh she her and and so she says her pronouns and my wife said aren't y'all just about to talk about having a baby and you need to distinguish your pronouns and this is what my wife said to me i was laughing because it was an audio text you know and so i'm listening to it at work and she says to me what's next you guys got to talk about chestfeeding that's why i brought the chestfeeding stuff because i was like okay so that's not helpful so then she goes to a different podcast and we both grew up christian and we're we're both we're both um a little bit cynical about what uh uh christians have to offer sometimes one thing i really liked about jordan peterson is i didn't think he was a christian and i guess we're still trying to figure out if he's a christian or not right but but like but like that's because because of how frustrated it's it's it's sometimes it is and and and so she puts a podcast on and reluctantly right because these guys are nuts so who am i going to listen to she puts on this guy and he's really soft spoken and whatever and he's and he's saying like and it's and it's okay to uh do self-care when you're a parent and take some time for yourself she's that's not what i want she's like i don't i know i need self-care like that doesn't help me either and she doesn't know what to do and she's not into jordan peterson man so but she puts on jordan peterson and just stuff about stuff about like the the symbolic mother and and and like stuff like that because she she needs good information she needs information like don't let your don't let your uh don't let your kids do something that makes you dislike them which is a politically incorrect statement right which is something that oh well maybe we shouldn't do that both both the christian the both both a lot of christians and now we've got these other guys that are both making sure we don't offend and we don't hurt anybody's feelings and i just need to know what to do because i'm going to be a mother yeah i just need somebody to tell me the truth so to me pastor paul your your channel has to grow it will because there's a deep deep deep deep deep need for somebody to make sense yeah well it's i i'm not alone out there in the world making sense and i i know that others don't share my ambivalence about my channel growing um i just i just see growth is a very growth and success are are very tricky things and if there's one one takeaway we can take away from the jordan peterson story it's that beware of growth beware would beware of fast growth because it nearly did him in and um it's it does a lot of people in actually and actually and if it doesn't actually outright kill them it destroys something in them that most of us non-famous people take for granted and share and so it's we'll take we'll take we'll take things as we'll take things as they come i'm not going to worry too much about that one way or another but i think that i think there's a lot of people that that that are that that just appreciate this space you know like like what the heck is what the heck is chad the alcoholic doing here who what the heck is mark lefave are doing here what these people aren't going to go like chad's going to a church but like these people but he's not going to go with that mask on right like he's like the like there's some like you they they and they can't in a sense like i feel like they can't and and and yet and and i think they can't because they want to be intellectually honest and and and i'm not even trying to like like be mean or disrespectful or whatever right like i what i want what i'm i'm really trying to say is like like my dad was a worship leader and um he um was really into like um trying to get all the churches in his area to do a big worship service together and it doesn't matter what denomination let's all get together and it was a really hard thing to do it was really hard to make that he couldn't really do it and um somehow you you are somehow you're doing it yeah yeah yeah something's happening something's happening so you're making room yeah making you know where the where the stable or the stable is uh where there is no ox in the stable is clean yeah but yeah so you're making we got some dirty fish swimming around but like what what you're doing what you're doing like where else do they go right like i said to chad i said the same way that you're like you're letting homeless people stay like on the front of your church you're letting spiritual homeless people stay at the front of the church yeah you know like that's because i i feel like i have to stand at the at the edge i feel like i have to like and maybe i'm like i'm very interested in pageau's like dog-headed man way of thinking and perhaps that's just my role right like perhaps it's and perhaps that's what i'm supposed to do where i'm supposed to be but um whatever it is like um all i know is that is that it it seems as though like i can i can hear and i can be i can and like you know even the idea of corner of the internet like that that implies fringe like implies yeah off of off of and and and and there there's so many people that like like that that fell away from christianity because they felt like they were on the fringe and they felt like they couldn't fit in and and like you're just letting it letting people duke it out and let it all hang out and some people stay and some people go but but but i think that's the best we're ever going to get is disagreeing but but but disagreeing in a in a disagreeing together well and we've always had disagreements in the church i mean you can't read any church history all the way up to and including the book of acts and the letters of paul there's always disagreement and that doesn't mean that we give up the search for truth but we understand that disagreement is part of the process of the search for truth every time paul of tarsus went into a synagogue in the eastern roman empire and said things like jesus is risen and he's the promised messiah of israel there was disagreement and that disagreement is messy but that's better than this conformity that leads to people who are disagreeing quietly now you can't you can't always vocalize all of your disagreement and i certainly don't but i've i've the most gratifying thing for me of this whole experiment that i've been doing not even knowing i went out to launch an experiment i mean this is just me has been has been you know this this community these little communities that have formed like sherry's you know arts project and you know it's just i've just always as a pastor i i just began to know that in church people sort of kind of shut up and conform and play nice in order to make the make the community work and that's okay at a certain level we not everybody not everything needs to be vocalized not everything needs to be aired by no means yet at the same time this sense of duplicity where you have to sort of where you have to betray something in yourself in order to participate is is fundamentally counterproductive even to the work of the church which in fact wants to lead people into truth and light because if you don't give people the space to process then they're going to wind up playing games and you're not actually going to help people get to a point of you know integrity authenticity i hate all those buzzwords but those are the words that we're using these days so i i i i've i've stayed protestant because i've asked the question if perhaps perhaps the idea of of breaking like being a protestant and breaking away from the church perhaps like there was an aspect where maybe we should have just hashed out our ideas and maybe we shouldn't have left right i've thought about that and i don't know but all i know is that as we've gone forward and and things have played out what what's happened is that we went from a catholic church to catholics versus protestants to protestants like breaking into a million different categories and now and now like in so many ways i think that post-modernism is the ultimate like the church of one we're all the church of one and we can make we can say that that's a bad thing i could definitely see why that's a bad thing but what's very interesting about being the church of one is that now instead of ritualistically in a in a procedural knowing kind of way of walking it all out we we can have we can have more we can it seems as though the individuality for good or for bad that is here now is it is get is empowering people as individuals to in to engage with with christ's message and i wonder if that could be an incredibly powerful thing that that that we're all disintegrating into into churches of one but then if there's a way to come back together isn't that much more much more powerful right that would be the body of christ right because instead of us all pretending to be arms i don't pretend i am not an arm i am a leg but you're an arm and i need you you know and we and and and and i wonder if like that's that's the good that like protest that the the good work that protestant has done is like we've we've fought against but we've but we fought for truth and we fought for what we thought was true and like and like i wonder like like you know i i think now i think now like as as you know like jonathan peugeot is saying that the church has to die is like is like if it dies like like that that to me would be like the only thing the only only way it resurrects is is everybody as individuals all all owning it i don't own it because you say it's true pastor paul i own it because i know in me that it's true and and and so that that that makes me ask a lot of questions like like even about the church structure in the first place but i don't know no that's that's a good point c.s lewis actually has a quote similar to that which talks about you know basically see i don't i don't see what you just described as something antithetical to the the process of the life of the church and in a sense you know thomas is our patron saint because you know he says to the apostles you know i don't i don't believe and jesus you know jesus says well okay well here i am and then he says blessed of those blessed are those who have not seen and still believe but but yet there is a process that we go through of of taking this and appropriating it to ourselves and that process is always messy i think to a degree we look back in history and because there's so much information and we have so little of it we even reduce that to a lower resolution and we just imagine well all of them think the same thing and i see that all that time in the way mass media talks about the church in america it looks at these churches and just imagines everybody in that church is voting the same way everybody in that church believes the same thing and i'm actually in a church and i'm looking around and especially as a pastor when you get a chance to talk to people it's like no they're actually all over the map yeah they're more like sheep you know hey you know sometimes they move together as i heard but a lot of times they wander off and get stuck in which is why you have a pastor around to sort of say okay oh let's get you let's get you untangled from this and get you back with the rest of the crew but still each of those sheep are individual and and especially now that you know i made a comment that actually grim picked up when i was looking at the randos conversation about mars hill you know the the amount of wisdom knowledge that i see in just out there in the internet among people is astounding and you know we sort of had the idea that at least this was to a degree in some places that well the pastor is the only one who's ever read any books or knows anything that's certainly not true today and i suspect it hasn't always been true and even if the pastor is the only one reading books especially now that we're simply so awash and you know we've got a ton of propaganda and a lot of misinformation and stuff out there but a lot of people know something and if you can actually help those people who know something share what they know and if it can be processed together and sussed out and tested in a reliable way the whole community will be stronger and it's it's just a terribly messy business to move towards that but i don't see any other way right now because the the the monolithic institutions of mass media modernism are broken technology has destroyed them and so now we have social social media micro media and so we're in the messy process of doing all this work to hopefully believe truer know better but also know more fully and know more passionately in some ways i think i think that the best thing that's happened to christianity is it it becoming the is it not being the dominant religion now like this like this this woke ism religion like i think it's really good for us i think it's like like for christians because because like like i've been saying this thing of like what so much of like what 2020 and all this time is has has i think has taught us like i said you can't blame this on the church and what we're finding out is what we didn't like about religion it's something we don't like about ourselves and so we're seeing this secular religion emerge and we're seeing this whole and so okay go ahead and try to do it without god go ahead and try and and like okay like not all of us sam harris can meditate for 12 hours in order to in order to rationalize your way back into your irrational you know you know gobbledygook and like and like people have to have meaning and they'll go and and and and you know do whatever they got to do to do it and and to me like so much and i think that so much of what the new religion is like it learned it from the from us from the christians it it it learned it got censorship from christianity it got um used to have a list it had it got um what are they on now i had a bunch of but um they're the um they're they're telling you what to think they're telling you how to be they're telling you all this stuff and it's like okay so this is just something that that people do is they is they they think that they got it all figured out and then they tell you what it is what you need to do and and and i think that that that all christians have to do is not do that now so we'll be good we don't have power anymore so it shouldn't be that hard yeah yeah yeah well there's a lot of there's a lot of truth to that and christianity almost always does better from below um it it has more credibility it it helps it when power is just a dangerous thing for people and the problem is that when christians get the certain kinds of power and use it in a certain way they discredit the label and the master that they put in front of them and we've seen that many times we've seen that many times through history so and and most christians know that and actually christians know that a lot better than a lot of secular people who are a little spooked by it because we play it out in church and so actually part of what we do is we try to learn to use the power that we have well with each other and then to model that and actually a lot of what christ says is very much about that you know those there'll be no masters among you you're all brothers and you have one master and yet at the same time i mean it's if you if you read the new testament with an eye to these dynamics you can see that there's a tremendous amount of wisdom and knowledge given in the new testament about questions of hierarchy and equality because it's just up and down up and down up and down all the time so we've we've only got i've only got another 15 minutes yet and so i didn't want to you know usually i've got a little bit freer schedule but um monday afternoons i i i call my family i call my mother and talk to i i call my family i call my mother and talk to my extended family so that's important that is it's very important now that my my father died a number of years ago and my mother lives alone and especially during covid you know can't can't miss out on the zoom call with mom she she needs we need to see each other and she live far yeah she lives on the east coast so i'm on the west coast she's on the east coast and i don't get back there yeah as much as i like or should so my mom's in vancouver and um she's not getting vaccinated and they're making it that uh you can't fly if you haven't been vaccinated and so she has to make a choice um um you know what she's going to do and and it's crazy world we're living in man yeah but you know but i don't know like it's yeah you know we're i i i'm she she's trying to yeah she's trying to she's trying to figure out what she should do and like it's interesting because like that's like a rock in a hard place right and and all i know is like if that's her conviction i think she should stick to it and i think that and i think that the grace the grace will reveal will come you know like one way or another even if it's the grace to endure yeah maybe it's the grace for something to change yeah but but it will yeah yeah it's all the rest of your family up in vancouver you know my mom and my mom and my sister and my brother but they're not worried about the vac so i just saw my sister she just visited canada seems to be a little stricter on a lot of these things than the states yep yep that's where i'm from and um and um that's what i really like about the u.s is like is is you know it's freedom like as much as i mean it's it's and it's not what it was but but it it's still it's still i mean i'm in texas now which is you know like one of the last uh uh places you know they still there's still a lot of rednecks out here right that still believe in their freedom man right i'm all about that right um i vibe with that for sure can i say one thing more thing before we go oh absolutely yeah we've got a few more minutes i just wanted to give you a little warning so because people often have a list and they're like well i wanted to talk about these things and so i don't want the i don't want the end of the time to slip to to sneak up on you well i i i i kind of wanted to embarrass you a little bit okay i'd like i'd like to make the i think i can make a pretty strong argument that you that you'll go down in history as a church father because because i don't think anybody's ever brought all different people from different denominations and atheists and non-theists all together in a conversation and and and in a sense like you're forming the new thing like after after like pentacostals and it was charismatics and it was non-denominational and now after non-denominational it's some kind of non-non-denominational estuary that's been formed and to me this has to be the future i know i know it is for me for my for my faith is existing with people that can that can um that can um that can can swim in dirty water and and and so yeah i think you are and i think jonathan peugeot is and i actually think that maybe jon vervecky is a church father i think i think i think in jon's way he would um i think he would be i think he would be truly uh flattered and appreciate the comment and he the good canadian careful you know academic that he is you would that's why i'm saying it that's right yeah well and you won't say it either but like but like and of course and you shouldn't even but like but like i i i i think yeah i think i think it is gonna grow man because i think that i think that like you know like there's there it you know it's it's it's i've been making this joke that we should make chad pope we should make chad the alcoholic the pope and it's because he doesn't want to be and i think it'd be a really good idea to get a guy that first of all doesn't want to be and then second of all is an alcoholic and like wears a mask like i think like it's something that we could all like be offended together on and agree and then we could all unite and and it's the fact that he doesn't want to which makes me think that it might be a really good idea because if you don't want if you want it you probably shouldn't get it well i i don't know i i what i if if in fact our little corner of the internet it's not really whether it'll grow because it is it is it is growing i can see that it's growing it's growing slowly but i i have a mistrust of growth that's too fast and cancer is a growth that grows too fast and what you really want in in a healthy growth of a movement is is pacing because what what pacing and healthy a healthy growth rate affords is actually leadership development to sustain the growth because that's what you need you need that you need people who are growing in their knowledge you need people you need a community that is growing in trust with one another you need people who are growing in wisdom and skill so you know the kind of growth that jordan peterson had i i actually wouldn't wish that on any anyone because that is it is disruptive it is disorienting and and what you have to do in cases like that is you have to sort of staff up and you have to do all of these things which in some ways undercuts the future of your movement and so the world is very big and i i'm i'm pleased with i'm pleased with the rates of growth that i've seen and because i'm not really looking as at growth as validation i much more look at what are the relationships like between the people what is there how is their level of wisdom growing and how can we watch that and are the different players playing their part and i see that in the different aspects i look at that and like today i was teasing hank hank cruz who you know left evangelicalism became roman catholic and anselman you know kind of went at it a little bit in the comment section now hank because i know you know i talked to hank semi-regularly hank is a bit of a troll and anselman probably doesn't understand how much of a troll hank is and so if my kind of guy if you're gonna if he if hanks gonna get a rise out of you he's from chicago he's gonna get a rise out of you he's gonna do it just to do it but um you know different people are playing their role and saying their piece and that's helping the entire community get a better sense of who we all are and once we have a degree of transparency and honesty around the community then we can actually have more productive conversations and i think that's good and that's so hum that's so hum that's in such a spirit of humility you know like it seems as as though we we were making too many propositional absolutes and and and and we were and and and and the enlightenment really got into our heads i think that that we could figure this all out and this is the truth and and you repeat these words after me and then it's done because we know that's true for sure and and then you know people are like well and and and i think that you're coming at it with such yeah with such a such a grace and and such a uh uh uh uh uh you're i mean like john like john like john like people pastors don't talk to john for veki man like not like most of them don't man you know like they're not why because it would because it might it might because i think then then it would break the frame and i think that i think that that that our our frame is our idol you know for all of us not just christians all of us our frame is our idol our frame is how we make sense of the world we need to make sense of the world but we also need our frame to break because um i think that uh i think that the world is in trouble and i think that christians uh really can be the ones right now to really help but uh not not in the frame that we're in not in the frame that we're in but but you know the butterfly he it goes into the cocoon and it turns into liquid in that cocoon it dissolves into liquid before it goes in it becomes a butterfly and like all of this being destroyed and all of this it is good because it's breaking all the frames and it's breaking us we're we're all finding out how wrong we are all of us are wrong but we're still here and we're together and we're fine and and the people and like right now there's a strong movement of people who don't want to hear anything other than what they think and then there's this other really beautiful flower growing of people who are really curious and interested and want to interested and want to know more about things that they don't believe that that they would never have thought of that they weren't taught and and find out you know what's going on with that and so well i'm really glad when i first started talking to john verveke i got a lot of messages from people like don't talk to him and you know i don't want to hear you know blah blah blah and a lot of those same people now respect him are interested in the conversation engage it and you know to me what that what that says is fundamentally if we want to see something grow in the world we have to model it because there's there are few things quite as powerful as modeling all the yakking we're doing which of course this is the internet and this is youtube and we can't do a lot of things on here but talk but it's the modeling that that is is vital for people to see and say okay that's good and i think people have had to take a long look at john and say okay he's not a christian he's a non-theist but he is in you know the words of the gospel he is a person of peace and this is a place we can start we can have a conversation with him and it can be productive and so let's do it because we've got you know part of what's happened with the globalization that the internet has afforded now we're all around here and well first of all let's not kill each other okay can we agree to that okay now let's not try and you know play games and rob each other can we agree to that so talking is better than all of these other things but we're going to have to learn how to do it in good faith and so if in this little corner of the internet we can model this kind of thing with confidence you know again nobody i mean i'm i'm sure people would look some people would love for me to give up my christian faith or my belief in the in the physicality of christ's resurrection or my belief in the divinity of christ you know that they can love they can want that all they want if they want to talk to me to try and convince me i'm not at all offended by that but we'll have let's have a conversation and let's find where we agree and where we disagree and let's see if we can to one degree or another you know love each other it you know like like it the the idea that you can you can have a conversation with john vervecky and it's not going to shatter your face that is it that is a that is a that is something that you don't know for sure and you walk forward anyways and that's what faith is yeah that's what actually christianity is and that's even what it means to believe in the resurrection and you know like it's the it's the idea that like i don't know and i'm gonna go forward anyways i don't i don't know if this will ruin my world yeah you know and that's hebra's 11 faith yeah you mentioned hebra's 11 that's what the chapter is about is a faith is on one hand a certain confidence about things that we have not seen yet it's a it's a leaning into that confidence into an unknown world you know i love this place in in samuel where jonathan and his armor bearer come upon this group of philistines and he says let's go get them and who knows whether or not the lord will deliver them into our hands and there's just something you know that we might die that that could happen but but we're gonna die yeah we're all gonna die at some point too it's just a matter of is it now or is it a little while from now but at some point it's gonna happen and jonathan died young so no well this has been wonderful chris i'm so glad we had a chance to talk i'm sorry you couldn't make the little uh third lobe quartet we make it a quintet but we'll we'll be able to do some stuff like that because i do you know i also see that you know the part of the reason i wanted you guys together was i see that you're bouncing off each other but you're all different too yeah and you're all on youtube right now i mean mark is just very straightforward logic chopping this is the way it is of course grizz is all over the place and and chad has got his art and his mask and his jokes and and you've got you know you're you're very clearly extraordinarily high in openness and you're very creative and you know i love the stuff that you're doing with music on your channel it's you know in some ways it's sort of like akira the don but it's also your own thing and so i i just wanted to encourage you and say keep doing what you're doing i want to get a chance to talk to you and meet you a little bit oh you you know i will man i mean i've got my three first my three uh church fathers i'm gonna keep remixing them because the world needs to hear it and they need to hear it in a modern way in a 2021 way with big fat ass beats behind it man well freddy would love to hear what you're saying and i'm sure i'll just speak for freddy i'm sure he would give you permission to remix any of his raps that you want he would he would there's a channel out there sacred hogwash that did some of that to some of the freddy and paul show and i played it for freddy and freddy loved it so it's that's what the that's what's fun about the internet taking stuff and twisting it and the u.s has to really get a grip on its copyright stuff because some of you know it's such a pain on on youtube sometimes you want to use this stuff you want to remix it you're not infringing on that intellectual property right you're enhancing it but you know i get so annoyed every now and then i'll i'm very careful about the clips i'll put in just because i've had you know this video swatted down it's like oh you know i don't have time to i don't have time to fight youtube over intellectual property rights i mean i don't have time for what i'm doing anyway so anyway i got i got my first video taken down on the the moderate protestant song i made uh because i used uh black lives matter footage and and i guess i they didn't want me to wow so yeah yeah it was funny because the you know the the largest video on my channel is that video i had with peterson right after i posted it somebody took that video cut me out of it and played the whole video there and people said oh you should give them a strike and it's like no let let them let them go let them go and you know when jesus i love the story in the gospel that's you know what how i see peterson as the unauthorized exorcist you know the disciples are like that guy over there is casting out demons in your name we need to we need to protect our intellectual property right of jesus name jesus tells his disciples to back off if he's if he's casting out demons in my name he's with us all right that's a pretty open statement huh like that's that's that's making room that's making room in the end yeah it it really is it really is all right well i've i've got to go it was it was so good talking to you chris and uh keep doing what you're doing and um i'll post this on my channel i gotta i still have kind of a glut of material and i try not to post i try not to too often post more than one thing a day because i could just the channel of my size can't really handle it so great great grim gris has a patreon you can subscribe to and hashtag make chad pope paintball for jesus paintball for jesus all right take care chris bye bye bye
