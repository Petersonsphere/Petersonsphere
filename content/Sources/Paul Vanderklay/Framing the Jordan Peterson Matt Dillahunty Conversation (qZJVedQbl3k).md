 Hi, this is Paul and I want to make a couple of videos on the Jordan Peterson, Matt Dillahunty debate or conversation. Really more of a conversation that wasn't set up as a debate and I think we should call this a conversation. I've watched a few times and each time I watch it some of my thoughts about it get clearer and one of the things that I think it's important to recognize is that a point that I've made is that hierarchies filter as much as they enable and by enable I mean enable access. These two would not be talking to each other if they hadn't both reached a certain level of celebrity, of visibility in terms of their own respective hierarchies and I think that in some ways often disables a good conversation because while Jordan Peterson is preparing for his conversation with Sam Harris, he hasn't digested all of Dillahunty and Dillahunty hasn't digested all of Jordan Peterson and so a lot of what we see in this conversation is because I don't know that these two are knowing where each other is coming from. I think just because of the relationship between materialism and phenomenology, Peterson probably has a little bit better take on where Dillahunty is coming from. I don't know about Dillahunty here. Right away the conversation begins on the question is there a God? Jordan Peterson regularly responds to do you believe in God with it depends on what you mean by believe and it depends on what you mean by God. Dillahunty and many others are responding and saying you know that's a dodge. You know very well what we mean by these things and I think Peterson does very well know what we mean by these things but because of Peterson's own philosophical convictions to use those words in that manner would say would be in Jordan Peterson's words it would kind of be lying. It would and that's not the conventional use of the word lie. It would be misleading to say I believe in God and to have that understood in what I would say would be the majority case assumption within our culture which I think continues to be a primary materialistic conception of epistemology and ontology and with Jordan Peterson's phenomenology that's impacting his epistemology and his pragmatism which is impacting his ontology this is where the confusion lies and so you know many say you know dispense with that and answer the question directly and in a sense this is where we go if we don't take a step back and Peterson says well this is what I mean by believe if he put in the pragmatism. This is what I mean by God put in the pragmatism and the phenomenology with the agnostic open ceiling. Now what does Dillehunte mean by God? Now he regularly talks about himself as a formerly a fundamentalist Southern Baptist and so I haven't listened to a lot of Dillehunte's things and if any of you are big fans of his and there are one or two videos of his that you would recommend me to hear I'm very interested he says you know I was going to give my skeptical was it a skeptical case for morality I'd like to hear that so if that's out on YouTube I'd you know point it out to me and I'd like to watch it but I'm going to assume kind of your typical American evangelical assumption of God within kind of the dominant philosophical assumptions of our day for most people that God is an omnipotent he can do anything he's omniscient he knows everything he's an all good actor in the world this is assumed to be a definition of the Christian God. Now if you take a look at say a lot of David Bentley Hart David Bentley Hart is from the Orthodox tradition writes some very long books is very good writer very interesting guy does Dillehunte get the Christian definition of God right now I want to avoid a lot of intramural Christian bickering about things because here's part of what makes this complex Christians always live within a cultural frame and those cultural frames have within them philosophical assumptions a lot of the history of the church and philosophy is the interaction between the Bible and those philosophical cultural assumptions that people bring to the Bible and read the Bible within that is a really big part of what goes on in my opinion with these kinds of atheist verses Christian fights that we see happening on YouTube all over the difficulty is if the two groups have different philosophical presuppositions and they are not owning those and they are not aware of those philosophical cultural assumptive presuppositions will basically mean that people talk past each other and that is something of what is happening in this conversation so now David Bentley Hart will say you know as will see us Lewis as will Christians throughout the centuries one of the things that you can usually count on orthodox scholars to know is a lot of church history which is really helpful many Roman Catholic scholars will too many Protestant scholars will too but Americans tend to be less predisposed to studying history than a lot of other cultures Americans like to be pragmatic looking forward we've got a can-do cultural assumption whereas many other cultures are quite a bit better in tune with their own histories so David Bentley Hart and actually C.S. Lewis will say things like God is not just another thing in the world and so this is something really important as we get into De La Honte because a big part of the argument against the existence of God is we can't lay our hands on him or we can't lay our eyes on him and he is invisible or he is hidden or you know we can't locate him okay David Bentley Hart C.S. Lewis will say you know God is not just another thing in the world God is the ground of all being you will hear this said now this is gonna you know is that pantheism we're gonna have to talk about that you know C.S. Lewis makes the comment that trying to find God in the world would be like trying to find Tolkien in Middle Earth you know as much as Bilbo wants to find J.R.R. Tolkien Bilbo never will know J.R.R. Tolkien unless Tolkien writes himself into the story and actually actually Dorothy Sayers makes that point in a wonderful book of hers and then actually one of her stories Dorothy Sayers writes herself into the story to kind of make that point in other words God is not just another character on the stage God's relationship with us is very different from my relationship with Neil Postman's book I can pick up Neil Postman's book it's accessible to me it's now we're gonna talk about realism a little bit it's real to me well why is it real to me well let's let's keep going God is also a person or in the Christian faith three persons who acts in the world and relates to humanity within time and so now if you take let's say the Dorothy Sayers analogy of you know the author two characters in the story God just like Dorothy Sayers writing something in her you know in her mystery novels or Tolkien writing something in his in his fantasy novels well Tolkien and Dorothy Sayers have a tremendous amount of power and authority there's the word comes from within those stories but everything that the characters see is part of the story and now I'm thinking about also doing a video on natural and supernatural because that also that also gets into this the difficulty that we see is that there's no reason to believe that we could comprehend anything supernatural other than seeing it within a natural frame because our eyes are natural our minds are natural in other words even if we're to take a look at this this differentiation between natural and supernatural we have no conception what supernatural would look like so we're going to have to talk quite a bit more about that what do you mean by God well you know pantheism the sum of all things but Christianity holds that God is three persons so you have a personal God now Islam and Judaism also have a personal God he is the source of the world we experience he can do with it or in it as he pleases and this is distinct from deism deism is the sense that God made the world but he made these laws in the world and it just kind of it's much more of a deterministic manner where you know the world just kind of runs its course or it's more like a machine if we are actors in the world we can poke at the machine and the machine will poke back in predictable ways now deism and providential deism I mentioned that in my frame video about the Ben Shapiro Jordan Peterson conversation Charles Taylor believes that part of how we got to where we are over the last 500 years one of the intermediate steps was a deistic universe and there's a book out there the clock you know basically the clock works universe and so Charles Taylor believes that there were stages by which we got here and that was one of the vital stages so this is distinct from deism God does act in the world and a faithful Christians believe a faithful record of his words and deeds are in the Bible as special revelation and again de la hunty would he knows this about Christians now I'd love to hear de la hunty engage more with the question of God as being an object in the world as different differentiated from God as the ground of all being or for example God as the author Tolkien how Tolkien relates to Middle Earth obviously it's a special kind of story because Bilbo talked to authors about their characters and how their characters become alive for example C.S. Lewis when he was writing Narnia he'd been actually trying to write this children's story for a long time and it never worked and once Aslan came in and that's the language Lewis uses now this is a little phenomenological once Aslan came in he pulled the story in with him what does that mean well how does that work well now we're talking phenomenology and psychology which were much more in Jordan Peterson's camp now the assumption of materialists is that existence are basically objects in space and this is different from Peterson this is the fundamental divide materialists will say ontology or existence what is here are objects in space and these objects are durable they seem to exist on their own in other words if I close my eyes the book is still here I can touch it I can feel it I open it I see it it's exactly like it was the world seems very durable in this way and that's a good thing and the world is very predictable especially in this let's say this Newtonian frame where actually at coffee break someone I haven't eaten these things yet I don't know if I'm going to eat them but the coffee break ladies have this little party in February and they had little candies and little gifts for everyone and so I always show up and eat their food so there you know I got a little gift that's been sitting on my table my room is a mess because things are durable my office is a mess things are my bedroom is clean my closet is incredibly well sorted but but things are durable because that's how the world is and so that this is kind of a common-sense realism that you know well here are things here are things right here so so Delahunty assumes a realism objects or beings exist in and of themselves now this is exactly where CS Lewis begins the book miracles and I haven't given up on this book but you know I want I want to continue processing this because the main leap that Lewis takes in this book is really hard often for materialists to conceive of and so chapter 2 he begins the naturalist and the supernaturalist gracious Mrs. Snipp and is there a place where people venture to live above ground I've never heard of people living underground replies Tim before I came to giant land came to giant lands that called Mrs. Snipp why isn't everywhere giant land and and that little that little I forget what those things are called above that above the chapters this is you know this illustrates that well a function about we human beings we live within our own cultures and we're embodied within our own cultures and our assumptions are within our own cultures and I'm I'm you know I'm a pretty determined presuppositional list these presuppositions govern things you know all the way up all the way down and so if you know this one of the people at our last meetup said you know I think everybody should live live for a year in a third-world country a year at a minimum it's it'll it'll tremendously change your assumptions about the world to live in another culture see as Lewis begins I use the word miracle to mean the interference with nature by supernatural power okay so in a sense Lewis is adopting the language that is a very debatable language but is adopting the language for the sake of the argument say this is what we're going to talk about unless there exists in addition to nature something else which we call the supernatural there can be no miracles some people believe that nothing exists except nature I call those people super now I call those people naturalists others think that besides nature there exists something else I call them supernaturalists our first question therefore is whether the naturalists or the supernaturalists are right and and here comes our first difficulty we have difficulty with the definition and so if you look at the Jordan Peterson Dillahunty argument Dillahunty is in a sense approaching this kind of in the same world as Lewis and Dillahunty is saying hey all there is is nature we and he in the in the video says I can't I don't know that we can measure the supernatural so technically I have to stay on the agnostic side of the supernatural but I think for that reason the assumptions about knowledge of the supernatural or from the supernatural are impermissible in public thought and are not justifiable philosophically or rationally that's in a sense the argument now there's a lot behind that argument one of the courses I one of the courses I hung around Calvin College to take from from Nick Waltersdorf back in the 80s was the work of Nick Waltersdorf and Alvin Plantinga where one of the things that they do is they say but that argument presupposes some ideas about justifiable knowledge and those look much more like presuppositions than something that you have reasons for and this is why again you'll see Peterson in this video often challenging Dillahunty you know you say you need reasons for everything well I I'm thinking you're sneaking things in that you don't have reasons for and there are some things that you there are some things that you believe are are self-evident well what if I doubt that those things are in fact self-evident well well then suddenly you're you're like this again so there's an ontological presupposition below here and I'm getting a phone call well it looks like they gave up good there's an ontological presupposition here and is reality this thing that exists on its own now now remember from C.S. Lewis and he's exactly right and Dillahunty wouldn't agree this this book is in a sense on its own now but this book has been dependent historically on this long chain of events that we can take all the way back to the Big Bang okay now we can't explain the Big Bang we can try to figure out where it got there but that's like that old adage you know give me one miracle and I'll explain the rest so this book came about after a long history of things and there's all the technology and the learning and and you know it's all here but but now that this book is dependent on on that huge chain of events that that we call history and this book is durable if I die my children can inherit this book if I close my eyes and open my eyes the book is exactly where it is this is in a sense a a referential realism now now the difficulty we have here is the relationship between my experiencing the book and the book itself and this is where in a little bit we're going to get into Descartes could I be dreaming right now could I be having a hallucination you know maybe I'm in a coma maybe I'm in a we had a debate like this in our our Jordan Peterson meetup group could I be in the midst of a tremendously powerful virtual reality program where I'm strapped into something or could I be plugged into the matrix and I'm only imagining I'm experiencing this whereas I'm really being a battery for this great machine and I'm being fooled and can I really know the difference when you know this the sense of realism I'm touching this book I'm smelling this book but all of those things have to be mediated by this not so non-complicated mechanism my eyes my touch my hands and and this is where this is where materialism started to die a philosophical death it's derived its existence from the singularity it's durable in and of itself not dependent upon anything else except that from which it derives its existence in moments x minus one so if now is moment x x minus one regressing back well that's that's the whole history thing we have the capacity to see objects as they are that's the monarchical vision but now you cue Descartes now Descartes said things like well what if I'm under the influence of a of a demon and now we listen to that we say what kind of argument is that well what if I'm in the matrix we tend to buy that argument a little bit easier than we buy the Descartes demon argument now don't have to ask if there is evidence that there is a being that we call god with those attributes that we've mentioned that is out there um with all the other things is does god exist that's in a sense the the idea of the question the question is is there a being out there named god can we have evidence for such a being can we have sufficient evidence for such a being now this is we're going to start a creep into peterson territory can we have evidence for such a being so as to impact our public world see it's that's that trail around the question that usually doesn't get mentioned because if i would sit down with Dela Honte and say well i believe in the tooth fairy and i believe or i believe in santa claus and he lives in the north pole and you know he's up there and and you know every time the satellite comes over santa hides or he's underground or he has the power of invisibility or i mean i can make up i can make up arguments forever why we can't find santa claus because he's hidden well this is this is in a sense the argument but i would say santa claus is out there and Dela Honte would say hey if you want to believe in santa claus go right ahead but don't let santa claus determine how you vote or whether children should be taught evolution or whether we should do sex education in schools or whether gay marriage should be legal because right away most people they don't really care what you believe as long as you don't bother anybody and you leave it to yourself but you start monkeying around with politics they get annoyed and if you go back in my old videos to the one where i talked about what i where i showed um richard dawkins on on justin briarley's unbelievable program listen to that podcast and you'll hear richard dawkins talk to a a jewish scholar and an evangelical christian and you'll hear richard dawkins say well i didn't really write my books against you because you seem like nice reasonable christians it's all those people in kansas and in the um the deep red states that that you know want to have that don't want to believe in god and want to ban abortion and and want to uh criminalize criminalize abortion and ban sex marriage and not teach evolution in schools those are the enemies so in other words believe what you want but don't take it out into the public sphere when you make that move you already give up some of your game to the pragmatists because you say you know what you can have your beliefs just don't act on them well now we're beginning to open the door to peterson because now peterson is saying oh we're going to talk about how you should behave or how a person should behave or what kinds of norms we have in society for whose speech is admissible and permissible and who's going to be called out and who's going to be silenced and who's going to be deplatformed and all of these kinds of things that we're raging right now jordan peterson's god um now jordan peterson is going to stick to his phenomenology and his psychology and if you listen to jordan peterson's stuff he is always giving this disclaimer i am reading the bible psychologically and i am talking and you'll find it here in this video i am talking phenomenologically well what does peterson mean by that and again this is kind of how we listen if if we're not really up on all of these things we just kind of listen and things that don't impact us they just kind of wash over our brain so we don't listen to that and then we pay attention when they raise their voice or when when the rest of the the audience applauses i mean as as watchers we are not that sophisticated or you might say we practice a high degree of filtering and we while we're listening we are always listening for that which interests us and this again gets back into peterson's college lectures where he'll talk about the fact that we see what we want to see what what about that well it just shows that our filters govern what we're what we take in and so this is why for example alan jacobs in his book out of how to think repeats what many other people have said is that we should think more slowly well what does that mean it means that if you want to understand this video you should probably listen to it a number of times now you might say well i don't want to listen to it a number of times well that probably means you're not that interested in it so if you really want to learn from it you should listen to it a number of times and if you really want to understand it you should probably study and you might say well that's going to take a lot of time uh yeah it will and now we're into malcolm gladwell territory that if you actually want to be an expert on something it's going to take 10 000 hours and so if you want to be an expert on jordan peterson get working or if you want to be an expert on celebrity atheists get working because this takes time and so the benefit of hopefully you're listening to me and listening to this youtube is well maybe i can learn a little bit from paul and watch it through his eyes and maybe i can learn something and elevate what i see and so on and so forth so jordan peterson is sticking to his phenomenal his phenomenology and his psychology and dill hunty is asking an ontological question that we can't answer because he supposes this is what peterson would say a specific ontology that dill hunty hasn't owned and jordan peterson has reasons for doubting that we can justify knowing this ontology knowing this existence and again this gets back to jordan peterson's stock answer do you believe in god it depends what you mean by believe and it depends what you mean by god because if you're assuming you're listening to me in a modernist frame where these words have particular meaning my answer is just going to confuse you well here basically you have about an hour of this kind of confusion that he's warning you about because he's saying dill hunty has a specific ontology here he when he asked do you believe in god he is presupposing that we're sitting in this material world of objects that we see and interact with and that there's a being out there a person out there now he's not so naive as to imagine he understands christian theology enough to know that most christians don't you know would assume that god is a spirit a la epistles of john and that okay here's the here's the does that spirit exist and does that god or really a lot of the skepticism that will tend to come from the atheist celebrity atheists and again we're opening the door to pragmatism in this we'll say believing in that god doesn't work well what do you mean by work when i pray and close my eyes and say lord i really want a candy bar does one appear and and there's the old joke of there's the there's the poor woman who's just ran out of bread and she's praying and praying in her room you know lord i'm hungry i can't eat please send me bread and a couple of mischievous little boys are outside listening to it and they go get a loaf of bread and they throw it in the room and she's like my prayers are answered and the little boy says what a dupe okay but were her prayers answered it depends on the frame and and this is where these conversations get tricky and so peterson would walk into this story and say phenomenologically her prayers were answered from her perspective phenomenologically god heard her prayer and god was very real to her and pragmatically it worked now the ontologist will say yeah but i don't believe that this message that she had went all the way up to god because what because bread would be produced yeah because we're kind of thinking stones to bread but okay but could it also be that the author of the story wrote those little boys into listening and hence the bread came and answer faith was reinforced when you say yeah but but bread doesn't always come ah but christians don't believe bread always comes christians don't believe that answers prayers are always answered as we would want them to uh jesus in the garden of gethsemane asks for to be delivered from the cup meaning the cross that he's about to endure and it doesn't happen and so well if god's not gonna listen to jesus prayer why should he listen to ours well that's an argument but again it's in a sense peterson always says the celebrity atheists aren't taking christians seriously enough well okay you can you can be the judge of that peterson comes at it with husserl and again i've mentioned matt thorsby and his his youtube's on phenomenology basically phenomenology comes along with the problem with decart's problem and says okay so i'm having an experience of holding this book right now and um i believe that i'm holding this book i believe i'm talking to my computer and i'm going to post this on youtube later and i believe people will listen to it and and it seems i've got a lot of reasons to believe in this but what i'm not paying any attention to is the very complex chain of mechanisms by which i am experiencing this that go far beyond just it happening i mean there's there's complex things i mean is the color is this book black well actually or is this is this shade blue well actually that area physics will tell us are all the colors except this that is the only color that's not being i hope i get this right um that's the only color that's not now being absorbed so that's how i can now being absorbed so that's how i can see it so huh well what am i to make of that in other words this is this experience i'm having is is very complicated and again if you listen to peterson stuff he will go on to mention yeah and when i'm telling the story like this i'm focusing on this book you know what i'm not focusing on at all my hand and in other words in a sense i see this book because i'm looking for it and i see things in my office according to what is meaningful to me what are obstacles and tools and this again do we see objects or see do we see tools now again the materialist will say well you can believe whatever you want to believe don't just take it into the public square don't just act on it well um okay but that now you're saying it's what's really important is what i'm acting on well now we're again we're opening the door to the pragmatist because now peterson is going to say yeah but what is really real here because this can be a hallucination this can be in the matrix this can be a whole lot of things your materialism is built on a lot of assumptions that quite frankly a lot of science has really undercut and this is why peterson calls them newtonians um in my natural supernatural video that i'm contemplating i'm going to bring in some course in 20th century science where we're going to talk about you know what happened in terms of the quantum and how that gets into the conversation and on one hand i'm sitting here holding this book and i believe well this book is very solid well 99 percent of the uh the 99 percent of an atom is empty space well why does this book feel very solid well when actually all the atoms and that's a really a rather outdated um term in and of itself all the atoms are 99 empty space yet i this doesn't feel like empty space at all in other words can i trust my experience of holding up this book philosophically can i justify it is it real and i think a lot of materials would say hey it's real enough and peterson would say gotcha it's real enough it's real enough for what well okay well now we're now we're into it so what is real well what can we know to be real if you're a thoroughgoing skeptic you could say not a lot in fact almost nothing so now we go all the way back to the cart i'm i'm having experience so at least there must be something that's having the experience there must be a subject here upon which something is happening well what is real is that which causes me to act and so is matt dillahunty real now maybe matt dillahunty is an actor whose entire life is a lie well let's talk about um milo yanopoulos i think a lot of people look at my my loyanopoulos and say he's not real he's a gay roman catholic jew it's an act he's not real well upon which do we say he's real well he's a i assume i've never met him in person i've never shaken his hand i assume he's a real person i assume matt dillahunty is a real person now i've seen jordan peterson on a stage but i've never shaken his hand hopefully i'll shake his hand in june when he comes to sacramento so you know what's real is matt dillahunty real i have no idea um was the was the lunar landing real um is my experience of sitting in this room real and what peterson goes into is that well let's think about something complex like your marriage your relationship with your wife well is my relationship with my wife real well what happens if i go home today and i find my wife in bed with another man and i say wait a minute and they sit up and say we've been lovers for the 30 years you've been married boom was my marriage real a marriage is a pretty consequential thing in someone's life what does it mean for something to be real and and obviously um a marriage for example is not a material thing it's a relational thing and so does the marriage have ontology if so how so and this is in a sense where phenomenology and pragmatism come in and they'll say marriage is real enough to have dictated your behavior and apparently if my cheating wife my wife is not cheating to the best of my knowledge um a little disclaimer there but the man who comes and discovers his cheating wife will say the marriage was a sham it was never real and people regularly have experiences where they say such and such was never real well what do you mean by real do you mean it was material what about relational and in a sense what phenomenology does is say well this relational world is very real and very important and in some ways more real than the material world why do we say it's more real because we pay more attention to it well the um the dissolution of your marriage when you say it isn't real is going to have a lot of material consequences but what is driving what so in a sense what is real is that which causes us to act like adultery like a marriage so in this sense god is real even if he doesn't have the ontology that dillehanty is assuming and and i think even dillehanty would acknowledge that that even if dillehanty says there is no god belief in god has been a very real thing throughout the history of the world so in what sense is god not not real now peterson again and again and again will give his disclaimers and saying i'm speaking psychologically i'm speaking phenomenologically and people will say i want you to speak ontology and peterson will say i don't know well what does that make him an agnostic now again there's a fierce debate out there is he is he being coy with his agnosticism my take i'm not jordan peterson i'm gonna have to take a mat what i've seen in his videos and what others have told me i think he's being honest i think he's living within this pragmatic this pragmatic epistemology which i've drawn in my videos before and saying i can't leave this box i can only know what is real okay um you can see that their presuppositional division is yielding a division in what they talk about so dillehanty could say is god real and dillehanty has his materialistic ontology ontological presupposition sitting there and jordan peterson would say real enough real enough for us to be having this debate and dillehanty would no no no that's not my question and peterson could very well say i can't answer your question and someone would say well then why are you two talking well it's a good question jordan peterson continues to maintain agnosticism about the ontology of god and in a sense so does dillehanty when he says we can't measure the supernatural but what dillehanty is saying is that we don't have enough evidence for god to justify acting as if god is real in the public sphere this is where the division is because peterson would say we have to act as if god is real or we're going to lose the benefits of western civilization and dillehanty would come back and say oh but no i don't believe god is real and peterson will come back and say i think you act like he is and dillehanty gets offended hey you want a quick summary of that video there it is still watch the video but that's essentially what happens what the phenomenologists say is that materialism is obsolete it is a failed project because it does not adequately account for the problem of potential deception that i'm in the matrix holding this book or that i'm in a simulation i'm a computer game see again elon musk's one in a billion chance that i'm not in a simulation okay and it fails the test of even of pragmatism that again dillehanty would say well you can believe in a god if you want to just don't take it into the public square your belief isn't justified well justified for what well justified for public action okay that's a frame can you account rationally for that entire frame well there's there's a debate so phenomenologists will assert that the materialist assumptions are not justified and that they need to be skeptical about their experience and begin with the phenomenon that can't be doubted so we're back to day cart only it's a few hundred years later and day cart who quickly runs back to say god wouldn't let our senses be fooled well dillehanty says i can't go there with you so where are we at now again if you listen to the ben shapiro thing a lot of theists will kind of side with day car and say and even alvin plantiga and say you know god built into us an ability to know truth and that's what's functioning when we're using reason and being successful at constructing this world now i would maybe at some point i will have a conversation with alvin plantiga and find out where he stands on phenomenology that could be fun what do you mean by exist well here's a little story a woman kills herself because she believes her husband has a mistress let's assume no such mistress exists the woman is um the woman is paranoid she's insecure and so she's just so doggone certain that lying cheating man of his is is cheating on her now maybe her father cheated on her mother and so she's reading into all of these things that this is happening and so she kills herself well was the mistress real well the mistress was real enough to prompt the wife's suicide now obviously you see that's a different sense of ontology matt delahunty would say the mistress doesn't exist well that's using one philosophical system whereby when we're using these words the mistress doesn't exist in the same way this book does exist that's what delahunty's saying peterson will say well the mistress really kind of does exist because the mistress prompted the suicide or at least the thought of the mistress so so she was real enough to cause the woman's death and you know think about that in terms of let's say um close calls in the cold war the the the computer glitch that the russians had imagining an american first strike was could have been real enough for them to order their missiles into the air real enough real enough for all of us real well depends what you mean by real depends what you mean by exist now jordan peterson god in western civilization god has been functional enough in the history of ethics of sam harris and matt delahunty to shape it significantly and jordan peterson believes celebrity atheists have not owned up to this evidence i think peterson has some pretty strong evidence because their ethic isn't significantly enough different from the rest of the culture in other words you've got we look at american culture and we say our american western culture let's say sam harris's ethics aren't all that different from my ethics let's say you might say well okay you know there are some differences i'm sure if sam harris and i were to sit down and make a checklist but right there when it comes to the checklist we would begin to see the problem because let's say sam harris and i are going to make a checklist of our ethics and we start listing things well here's the problem ethics is much more about action than it is about being able to make rules now in the in the peterson delahunty video there will be a long section on rulemaking well this is exactly what is getting into this peterson i think quite rightly says we action is a better expression than any list of rules we make about our ethics and peterson's justification for this would be peterson and delahunty and sam harris can sit well on a stage and they're probably not going to throw throw sam harris off the stage uh sam har they could get angry with him but they're probably not going to throw him off well where did this come from well it came from being little children and what peterson would say is that you know all of this has been built into us for hundreds of years and just because we flip a switch on within our materialist ontology saying we don't believe in this god doesn't mean that that god isn't already embedded deeply embedded in all of the systems of socialization and acculturation that we have been working out since we have been young now this actually wanders over into the culture war conversations too because one of the big arguments is well patriarchy has spoiled everything or racism has spoiled everything well okay well i'm sure they've spoiled a lot but we're not going to be able to disentangle it very easily and so that then leads to what john mcwarter says is that what um what has happened for for leaders um for what has happened for black leaders in america is all they've turned into is pointing out race racism racism here racism there they find racism everywhere and if you listen to glenn lowry glenn lowry will say yeah but you know what but they're not really working on um building the basics of what it would mean for the black community to thrive okay so where does that leave us well where does that leave us this again is peterson's point that sam harris and i are me and matt de la honte i would say god exists matt hila de la honte said god doesn't exist but you know what he grew up southern baptist he grew up in the same country he grew up in the same period look at how much agreement there is in fact there is so much agreement to make a list of all the agreements would be difficult in fact probably our minds would go to the disagreements because that's kind of what's in the back of our head but the reason we can agree is that we're acting together and that's why peterson says well i'm not so sure you don't believe in god and of course del honte no i don't believe in god materialists continue to live according to all sorts of things that are real like mistresses in the wife's imagination their god-shaped hole is not real enough to change their behavior therefore peterson will call them atheists in denial and again peterson with peterson when in the debate peterson says you've got to deal with young you've got to deal with nicha you've got to deal with dostoevsky you know right there i think peterson probably should have paused now playing coulda woulda shoulda for something like this is pretty unfair because i've been in enough situations like we were watching on stage to know that having the presence of mind to say in the moment is is really really hard and if you roll the tape back and watch it well this is why the nfl watches their games and looks at their games all the time you can do that and in a sense when i'm when i'm twitching these videos that's what i'm doing them okay let's slow down and take it apart and try to understand so when peterson says hey look you're not listening to young you're not listening to nicha you're not listening to dostoevsky what you know especially i don't know young enough but nicha dostoevsky are basically saying what peterson is saying is that christianity has been so built into our practice at the level of our behavior that you know you're just imagining you don't believe in god anymore if that doesn't really change your lifestyle you don't believe now what's interesting about this argument it's the flip side of arguments that you will hear pastors make all the time you know unless god gets into your wallet unless god gets into your life unless because you believe in god you change dramatically who you are you don't believe in god there's a story of augustin augustin had a you know had a very active love life became before he became a a serious christian and one of his mistresses comes up to him and says augustin um augustin don't you recognize me he's completely ignoring her and blowing her off and finally she gets in his face augustin it is i and she looks at her and he looks at her and says yeah but it isn't me i'm not the same man i used to be oh okay now put that into a materialist world is augustin the same man he used to be under a materialist perspective well well what is augustin well he's this body he's this brain now we're into this question of what is a human being with with x plus one um a materialist has a harder time dealing with what human beings are and this is exactly why phenomenology and psychology and i think this is exactly why peterson is in many ways in terms of the watchers in our head kicking out the slats from under the materialist and this is why he's increasingly going to be debating the materialist and this is why a lot of people watching him are now much more open to religion than they used to be because the the materialist world just all seems weaker because when augustin says it's not me well the materialist would say of course it's you you were born to your mother and your father and no but i am a different person well what do christians say i am a new creation and well how is matt dilahunty's life different since ethically since he you know left christianity um you know maybe he does more drugs maybe he drinks more yeah what i know plenty of christians who who drink and do drugs and some of them feel guilty about it and some of them don't and now you might say of those christians well they're betraying their their faith by their actions ah but again ethics is far more than a list of rules rules can be very helpful things because again as peterson say we abstract the rules we look at the rules and once they're out apart from us we can say okay this rule about adultery is that a good rule or a bad rule this rule about marriages between a man and a woman is that a good rule or a bad rule this this rule about income tax is that a good rule or a bad rule yeah but we act out what we really believe again pragmatism so what kind of productive conversation can these two have well i would have liked to have seen them open up a little bit more some of their presuppositions now i think peterson was trying to do that but that's this this is really hard to do especially okay peterson also makes the comment in the video the frame that we're doing this in is so important and this i think is easy for us to see who are watching the video from the outside these are two guys on stage they both have high status um and again status filters as well as it provides access but um it also in jonathan hite's words it binds and it blinds what does that mean um in terms of their statuses they're in terms of their status alone they've got a lot of reasons to not give points to not acknowledge now this game is very subtle and we always all know how this game is played we'll we'll admit to some things and we'll admit to other things why because an element of this game is looking for influence with the crowd and if someone never gives in on a single point or never says they're wrong we look at them and say they're a liar because that's untrue to our experience but they're probably not going to cave on their big points and so then you might say well why are we so excited to hear them talk well we're excited to hear them talk because another element of the game is who wins and who loses and okay well now let's talk about bias because we'll tend to be biased for one or the other and so that's why in a sense before presidential debates before the debate everyone does these these games about expectations they all try to lower expectations because if you perform above expectation in the moment you feel a certain way now again this is this is part of the reason the materialist grip on our culture continues to weaken and there are this is a huge huge thing and there are many many signs in our culture that it is weakening could our current presidents let's call it selective appropriation of factual material be part of that we'll look at the Jonathan look at the Sam Harris Scott Adams conversation so it seems to me culturally this is a Jordan Peterson moment and culturally the culture is a little bit ready to hear him and culturally Dilla hunty's on the downside now you might now that might annoy some of you say how but you Christians are losing anyway oh okay um you know i let's try if i want to be a fact-based modernist let's try to own up to the evidence and i think there's evidence that materialisms grip on the culture is waning and other things are ascending so is that my last slide nope further questions does belief in god matter in the materialist conception well that's a long conversation and again how in what in what critical expect respects does Dilla hunty's life change since he gave up Christianity well i think that would involve probably a long conversation with Dilla hunty someone could flip the script on that and someone says suddenly i'm a Christian and other people look at them and say you don't behave any different well are you a Christian well again read the beginning of mere Christianity for some of Lucia's Lewis's perspective on that culturally we want to say someone is defined by their action but we also know that with many of these systems we are all um traitors to our confessions and it's a very strange thing as C.S. Lewis points out that um we make these rules that we know we can't keep now what's up with that um because if someone only makes rules that they know they can keep we don't have any respect for them well why not again we're looking at action here and behavior um what does the Christian god really care about in terms of how the cultures we are nested in impacts how we imagine god to be and how we relate this is a question that has been rumbling around in my committee of watchers ever before Jordan Peterson and and the reason for this is because again i was a foreign missionary in the Dominican Republic and i've had significant cross-cultural experience in North America the African American church the Dutch CRC church evangelical churches and again getting back to where we started so we come to faith with these cultural presuppositions now another way you don't have to move overseas to read this just read a lot of history and read primary sources and and read really good historical scholars do is my conception of the faith like Augustine's that's really hard it you could make a good argument that my conception of faith is more like Dilla Huntys and Dilla Huntys says he's nothing like me because i'm an atheist and he's a Christian but i could argue culturally we're a lot alike and and and Dilla Huntys and i might have a lot more in common than let's say Augustine and i and nobody's challenging Augustine's credentials well what about Augustine's wedding with with with neo-platinism and what about some of these you know what what bit of his manichaean part of his life didn't he sufficiently divorce himself from and from what neutral position do i imagine i can go through these things and so again in this sense we are all increasingly postmodern in some senses in that we see the power of the postmodern critique of modernity and say they've got some real points but then the question is where do we go beyond that and it's in that way that i think Peterson is having an impact on many many people who are digesting his videos and beginning to say huh so Dilla Huntys says that all those people who want to believe in God can believe in God but just don't bring it into the public square in other words believe in God but don't act in public like you do okay so does that mean how much are you really conceding to the pragmatists in that how critical is this belief or unbelief does this just make all of your posturing against the existence of God within an ontological framework of modernism that you know is it incidental and now maybe you're saying that none of you really maybe Dilla Huntys is telling me i don't believe in God and actually i think he and i could have a really interesting conversation about that because this is what pastors say to their parishioners all the time you don't believe in God enough you go back and listen to my sermons over the last number of weeks i tell all of us we don't believe in the resurrection enough what do i mean by that i mean we don't act as if i really believe in it well what do i mean by that jesus for example says do not worry about your life what you will eat or you know or what you will wear um god takes care of the lilies of the field and aren't you much more important than them but i might say yeah look how long those lilies live and all you need is somebody walking around trampling them ecclesiastes said god has planted eternity in my heart well i want to live forever well as you know again here we all go so okay i can sit down with matt dilla hunty and say well what do you think do either of us believe or are we mostly just products of our culture now let's imagine the kind of christian god who is both the author of the world now it's a very special authorship because then we get into and actually again when i listen to dilla hunty i think you know i have a lot of commonality you know when we talk about agency i mean when i listen to his description of agency maybe not in connection with his determinism he says when he said i'm a compatibilist at that last all my but i'm a calvinist compatibilist and he's a materialist compatibilist so well here we are so okay um what does belief in god mean well now we're again we keep sliding down into peterson's territory which is again why i think well peterson is not only pushing a movement forward but peterson is riding a wave that he himself didn't make and this is why with all of our internal watchers people are watching peterson and they're saying things like he's saying what i always believed why because well is it a is it a a communal consciousness that we're all participating in is it cultures of us watching each other is it um i mean how does culture work do we really know and and here's the the the vital question how does god really manage our different cultures well and fortunately we have a bible that was written in at least two dominant culture groups you have the culture of the old testament the culture of the new and two different languages christianity is an unusual religion in that it has i would argue more successfully crossed cultural lines than any other major world religion that's really something to think about so anyway this is my framing of jordan peterson and dillahunty i'll probably twitch their talk and uh we'll go from there
