 Hi this is Paul and we have Burn Power back again when I talked with Burn a number of weeks ago I knew that we'd have to talk again and I've been watching Burns channel and see here's here's the nice thing about being old that you've been around and you've had a chance to read and you've seen stuff and so Burn and I we're gonna talk about all kinds of things we're gonna talk about oh go ahead Burn let's start why don't you tell us a little bit range conversation free range conversation no but no it's just I just wanted to mention I just I have two YouTube channels one is the anadromist sorry I'm getting my own words mixed up the anadromous life and anadromous is a word from biology which means going against the stream that's what salmon do and the second one the newest one is called the anadromist and that is he and that is more for me talking and I've just got way too much stuff in my head I need this unspool so I figured I you know actually watching people like you I mean I've just been seeing so many people talking and I said I gotta get in on this talk and it just seemed like a good I mean I'd been working on these other YouTube videos which are more like documents but I said let's let's see what we got here so okay so what did you you were gonna let's talk a little bit about Francis Schaeffer because part of let me ask you what what's your impression of Francis Schaeffer and Lebrie as far as like how you've seen what they were what you might be seeing of I mean I know you've been bumping into more people who have claimed some sort of Lebrie lineage how are you seeing that phenomena and and it's been in conjunction in some ways with the Peterson phenomena so how are you seeing this well so I bumped into you Ron Dart spent time at Lebrie Warren Mills who's the guy who brought me to Australia who wrote this little book he and his wife Elaine spent time at Lebrie I'm bumping into a whole bunch of people of your generation who spent time at Lebrie and I know so what in the 70s I was a kid all right so that I might be bald I might be gray but I was a kid in the 70s and yeah you're about ten years younger than I am or so yeah so I'm like 55 you're what 1963 yeah so so so I was I was a kid when Francis Schaeffer hit my house and my father and my father's church and I remember because as a kid you know you just see these books come through the house my parents were book lovers they were always reading and so these Francis Schaeffer books start coming through and I just hear my father talking about Francis Schaeffer with some of his friends and some of the people at church and everyone was all excited about Francis Schaeffer and and my sense was that there was a moment where Francis Schaeffer and Lebrie and Switzerland this was a this was this was the place to go and the thing to do and in my household because we were you know basically in an African-American community an African-American church once the culture war hit in the 80s Francis Schaeffer was gone you know because Francis Schaeffer and if you listen to Frankie Schaeffer on his on some of his YouTube talks you know then they got into the whole Jerry Falwell thing flying around the abortion issue all of this stuff so Francis Schaeffer disappeared and Francis Schaeffer went from being a a really cool place that young Christians who wanted to explore Christ and culture and all of this stuff suddenly became American religious right culture war stuff and then of course the with the with the second coming of the first you know second coming of Frankie Schaeffer who makes a career writing in a sense a number of things but tell all books about the weirdness of Lebrie and his father and his mother and how he discards this and then he has you know intriguing talks where he's both an atheist and a Christian and he joins the Orthodox Church so there's just a whole lot of weirdness about this and then again when I started the Jordan Peterson thing Francis Schaeffer just kept coming up and I kept bumping into people like you who are part of that early that those early pilgrimages to Lebrie and so I'm very curious about that especially with respect to why am I getting echoes of this with the Jordan Peterson conversation right right yeah well so why did you go to Lebrie oh well that's a that's where the big story starts and I'm not gonna go all the way into it but essentially I had been in in 1970 at the age of 15 I joined what turns out to be one of the ground zero Jesus people groups of the Jesus movement and ended up right out of high school living on a farm commune the Jesus people eventually started to tighten up and the group we were part of eventually became kind of culty and the reason for that was because we were drifting and we were looking for a way to bring order into our chaos and I could go into that this is where the strike is huge anyway I meanwhile had discovered literature and was reading I was starting I made a couple attempts to start University around that time and I spent a year between high school and University rather between high school yeah I took a year you know my year off and and then when I went back I'd seen so much craziness on these farm communes and stuff that when I went back school already seemed just completely unreal to me and I remember well I don't want to go into it all but it just seemed rather pointless almost and so what I did is I dedicated myself to start learning on my own and so if you were to see me walking around the streets in those days I might be I don't know reading Moby Dick walking around like I just walking and reading because I was just so like trying to read as much as possible of course I read cell phones yeah yeah and before then I was really good at navigating so I no problem never bumped into anyone with my books never read while I was driving but no what it was was I started to get the feeling the group at the beginning was more open to ideas I would say politically we were neither left nor right and but we eventually started drifting more to the right and I started seeing some of those early meetings where people were talking about praying for the country there was a guy Derek Prince who put out a book about praying for the country people Derek Prince, Don Bash, Bob Mumford and other people were all kind of united together under this thing that became called the shepherding movement that's where things kind of got culty because everyone was you were supposed to report in to the people above you and report about the people below you and who you married, what you did with your money, eventually I had to get my demons cast out of me which I really regretted because I was like one of the last people in the group to do it and about two months later another kind of sister group related to us got in trouble for just doing some wacky exorcisms and I just felt like darn I wish I had waited two months and I wouldn't have to you know like blow it up everything I've eaten since high school yeah so anyway I meanwhile was reading like you know I discovered GK Chesterton I was reading the the literary criticism and historical writings of CS Lewis like that was really an eye-opener I had discovered Solzhenitsyn someone had mentioned him he seemed important and suddenly I found myself wading into the Gulag Archipelago with with gusto and there were three volumes and I remember waiting for the third one to come out in about 1980 or so but I was just like eating those up especially once I figured out he was he was a Christian and what's interesting is that no one could criticize me I was reading like classic literature and Christian really important Christian stuff and no one could criticize me for what I was reading within the group we weren't that crazy but soon I found myself not really being able to communicate I had a lot more going on in my head than anyone seemed to want to talk about so I mean I got so desperate that one of the elders of the group told me to yeah God had showed him I was going to be a missionary in Mexico and I just said okay you know just like random you know I had no interest in Mexico apart from eating good tacos and burritos prior to that and and I even went through and started doing a bit of Spanish language training it took some more university classes and basically I'm sitting here reading the Gulag Archipelago and I'm reading this stuff about communism and what it does to your minds and I'm looking at our group thinking and then I'm saying why do I want to go to Mexico now meanwhile I had discovered Schaeffer and I one thing is they don't think Schaeffer is the greatest writer in the world that is to say his prose is is functional it's not like Seas Lewis's that you really remember the turn of phrase however he was the only person at the time that I knew of in any kind of evangelical kind of world that was discussing art and culture and in 1977 at the beginning of the year Francis Frankie he was he's now Frank Schaeffer Edith came through on a seminar tour showing parts of their film how should we then live and someone gave me free tickets to it they gave me free tickets because they had used some when they were shooting they used our street and we helped them out so they gave us a few tickets so someone said burn do you want to go I said yeah so yeah it sounded interesting so I went and that really had a big effect on me and particularly the films had an effect and I think the film those are the only films of Schaeffer's I still recommend because they're kind of funky and the funkiness works because they're not super commercialized I think by the time they did whatever happened to the human race they'd are Frankie took over that one and he was already dipping into the propaganda back and he was you know using thousands of little baby dolls on the Dead Sea to demonstrate saline abortions and things like this and my feeling is like and the music itself was like sappy and I and and even then I was a little bit like felt a little bit off about that but anyway that was that was that but actually the the lecture Frankie gave at that seminar was really affected me because he talked about how Christian it's ironic now how Christians had given into propaganda and made utilitarian messages out of their art that is enormously I just listened to the Frankie's Google talk and it's like oh that was their message until they began to do the propaganda it's like like talking yeah Nick and Santa Cruz who you know oh let's you know they're all against culture though let's start our own well there is a tension right there right bye there is a tension right there oh yeah yeah it's pretty warm here but it's nighttime there is a tension right there and this and it's essentially I think Frankie used Frank used his guilt that because of the way he was brought up because Lebrie became such a hot spot some of his childhood was kind of left on the wayside and and so he was able to press these buttons get dad to make these films like I said the first one that he what didn't fully direct is the best one because it is the most honest version of Francis Schaeffer's ideas whereas eventually you know the things that come after that feel more and more propagandistic and it's not Schaeffer himself doing it it's it's Frankie pushing towards you know and part of it was unfortunately Frankie was making a living off of this stuff making the living changes how you approach things and I actually spent quite a while talking to him during those days and I could already sense that he didn't have any love for the basic evangelical world at that time he was seeing it at that point through the the Lebrie glasses which is to say he was seeing their hypocrisy and such through through through an understanding that might have been gleaned from people like well his father but Oz Guinness or Donald Drew an English teacher who came through Lebrie Ruckmacher definitely influenced him particularly Ruckmacher influenced him on his ideas about art it's he didn't go all the way though and unfortunately around that same time Ruckmacher passed away at the beginning of 1977 which I deeply regret because of all the thinkers of the brick he's the one that really all his I read his books but more importantly his lectures which can be found on the Lebrie ideas library there's a website called that and you can find most of most of Ruckmacher's stuff there anyway I had gotten this whole meanwhile this whole thing with being a missionary to Mexico and and I was sitting there going you know I'm really interested but what's happening in Europe and communism and and the gulags and all this and I'm sure Mexico's a great place and I would certainly getting more interested in the culture but I didn't have any particular burden for it so I went up to the team leader they had happened to move me to a less strict part of the church another town where the people kind of like looked at the Christian communes less as being like an organizational discipline structure and more as being kind of like people just hanging out living together and not really watching each other so it wasn't quite as strict in this particular locale so I started going to movies at that time and watching movies thinking about things I'd watch movies like taxi driver I won't go into my first view of that but that essentially was like someone put a gun to my head and said do you think you can communicate your faith at all anymore look at this and the answer was no and and and why this because we look like him we look like the taxi driver we're going crazy because we think life is full of me and that's how they're going to look at me and I sat well when I first saw that movie I sat there and just and I said I just got put in check you know they just got me because I realized we use you know what we had developed had come out of the hippie era but things have radically changed and so but I'd already started listening to punk rock I'd already started trying to understand what was going on in film and 70s film was particularly weighty and interesting but also very dark and pessimistic often and when I I told the team leader I don't want to go to Mexico I don't think God's calling me I use the right phrase I don't think God's calling me to go to Mexico and he immediately said okay and suddenly I was left with to do and my dear mother said what about that Libre place you've been talking about how would I even get there and I talked to someone who knew something and then I went and worked in Glacier National Park in Montana for a summer and then I went not before being kind of put down by the team leader saying you shouldn't go to Libre because not the team leader but the the pastor the main pastor because when people come back they don't want to do evangelism well I found out why when I got there is because they did Libre doesn't do you know that kind of street kind of evangelism nor does it do the invitational sermon evangelism they more just like be a Christian talk about things you know hey if you discover it's true it's true you discovered and who knows your Christian brother and sister you also may discover you're not a Christian at Libre so anyway so I arrived there in October of 1978. 75 you said? 78. okay yeah and Schaeffer was not there when I arrived he just they just finished filming whatever happened to the human race and he had been diagnosed with lymphoma so he was off in Rochester Minnesota so meanwhile I was kind of sent over to French Libre which was across the lake at that time from Swiss Libre and I got to come over to Swiss Libre every now and then but they gave me these lectures to listen to particularly lectures by Ruckmacher but Schaeffer and all these other people Oz Guinness and many many other people and books to read and I had a tutor to talk with and I was supposed to do half a day of work and what happened to me was at a certain point in late November the Jonestown incident occurred where almost a thousand people died of suicide in the jungles of Guyana I had run into some of these people before I had met a man who had lost his son in the Ukiah Jonestown camp and so this hit me really hard and I you know what's funny is I'd spent a lot of time thinking about cults prior to this because we used to try to go into cults and rescue people which is really ironic too but then again this is the kind of life we did where I was just thinking today of how much harm is done by people who claim to know what love is you know so whether it's the SJWs or Christians or you know I'm sure people in almost every religion the people who know the most about exactly what love is get in the most trouble because we should tread carefully on those kinds of subjects and admit how how much our motives are mixed up thank Jordan Peterson so but so what happened was there was a French woman I lived in the small French village and there was a French woman who lived next door and she was an atheist and a communist as many French people were and she came over and she asked us she said this place she'd heard about this place Jamestown or something I said Jim Jones Jonestown and then the news started coming in we were all horrified but the French woman asked a question that I I couldn't shake off what makes you different than them and I looked around at Lebrie and I realized that it was they were actually telling me things that were telling me to question what I was learning you know I mean you couldn't listen to Rookmacher lectures and walk away at all comfortable in what you believed you know he just simply wouldn't let you. Schaefer himself was not a person to let you know people just kind of comfortably believe whatever they believed. It's just like why do you believe if you don't have a good reason and once I got kind of say arrested when I was trying to give a glib definition of faith during a lecture and my very good friend John Sandry who's alive now he's in his early eighties he was giving a lecture he doesn't even remember this last time I talked to him you know but for me this was like a huge moment I had said something about you know faith is the assurance of things I've seen blah blah blah and you know you just believe and all this stuff and he said really where did you get that idea? I got it out of the Bible! Except he pointed out that you know you don't just believe because you believe. There has to be reasons for why you believe what you believe. And this is a complicated subject but but that was an arresting moment but this the Jonestown thing this was huge so I said well okay Labrie is not like this they're really teaching me the question even then and then I applied the same question back back home in California and I just felt the bridge collapse behind me because I knew and by the end of I couldn't go back so I spent almost a year there and I wasn't even legally there after a while I was just hiding out in Switzerland from the gendarmes the French section and and you know I just couldn't go home I wasn't even officially a Labrie worker or helper or anything I was just in the area keep coming back and forth eating meals and talking and stuff because I couldn't go at that time Labrie was huge there might be between a hundred and a hundred and fifty people passing through in any given moment in the summer whereas now it's capped off around 35 max it's off in between 20 and 30 but I started getting eventually started getting letters from people back home saying burn what's why aren't you coming back and you know and then people saying well you always did kind of live in your own private fantasy world and I said haha you know and there were a couple people who started saying things you know it's just and I just very courageously wrote back saying well this is exactly because we became too involved with each other and think we know what is best for each other at all times when often we don't so I stuck around there for a year went back and I made up my mind at that point that I would eventually go to New York City I had started the thing I had got Schaefer eventually came back I eventually spent a little bit of time not a whole lot talking to him and I had realized that I was very interested in music history I had been kind of sneaking punk rock cassettes into this job I was working at a little cassette recorder a player you know and but I felt like no we don't need another little book you know written by Christians about the problems with rock music you know we don't need that we need decent scholarship on the subject so I said I'm gonna go to New York City which is kind of my my feeling told me it was kind of the heart of everything and I think I was right for that period I ended up going there in 1980 but I once talked to Schaefer and I said you know if I boiled on boil down everything you've ever written about music yeah I get about three pages worth you didn't mean that to be any sort of final statement on anything did you know absolutely so I said to him so I'm gonna go and I'm gonna work on the subject in depth particularly trying to understand what happened in the 20th century with music all the different forms particularly the American forms but which had such an effect throughout the world that was my goal so that's why I went to New York so anyway that's another story so interestingly though the tensions of Lebrie were starting then and so and it was exactly I was with the Schaefer's and as they were traveling and going on the next seminar for how should know whatever happened to the MRAs and things were different then and it started to feel more propagandistic and I kind of wondered about it but they just kept going that direction and my feeling is it was Frankie pushing dad along that track trail and I'm sure that there were times when Francis just was like you know what am I doing you know and near the end he kind of just I think got off that train particularly because his health made him but but I think he just lost heart in that kind of process and unfortunately the damage was done so that when he passed away I think there was a Newsweek article on him that called him the guru of the new right to the evangelicals and such and I think he would have been horrified to have been classified like that I think always he would have been horrified because when you were there Schaefer and other people at Lebrie I mean any any topic was on the table you know if someone came in and wanted to talk about Satanism if someone wanted to come talk about why shouldn't I commit suicide today if someone wanted to talk about I brought up a couple of subjects which no one's I was proud of myself because I brought up a couple of subjects no one had seemed to discuss one of them was what about comedy let's discuss comedy and I've had an active interest in comedy ever since but but no it was like Schaefer was always pointing at art and culture and and he felt very deeply about the sorrow that a person with an existentialist worldview would have to feel living in a world of such absurdity and because that is how the French existentialist saw the world and in fact Schaefer went through a period in the early I believe it was the very early 1950s where they had they were already in Switzerland they went over there in 1948 they met Ruckmacher Hans Ruckmacher at that time and Ruckmacher became involved I think Ruckmacher already started to also have an effect on him Ruckmacher had become a Christian in some sort of prisoner of war camp in World War two and Ruckmacher was very unlikely comfort and as soon as he he became a Christian and then he said I went into the church and I have never gotten over what I saw in the churches because it was not you know and and Ruckmacher made it very clear it's just like well something's wrong but Ruckmacher was also brilliant on the subject of art but I think Schaefer in the early 1950s basically said to Edith one day I can't go on this way he'd been going along he was a presuppositional apologists following Cornelius Van Til whom you will know but no one else a few people might know but yeah but basically what happened was he said I've got to rethink what why I believe what I believe and he says I can't come I I'm gonna go off I'm gonna go hiking and wandering through just think about things and he told Edith Schaefer and the family I said I can't promise I'm gonna come back a Christian when this is all done and so he was very honest and and he went through what he believed why did he believe it what was absurd what was not I understand that because after being at Lebrie I went through a similar process and got rid of certain parts of that I just felt were somehow corruptions that had landed on my faith but that's what Lebrie comes out of that and also Edith Schaefer's work which was very important as well but it was the honesty of trying to wrestle with things and I think that's where the Peterson connection is is that both of them are honest to the point of genuine emotion you know both of them will ask genuine questions and will take any question that comes to them both of them will emphasize the importance of learning and reading and and I think those kinds of things I hate to say it but for everyone in this who lives in this world it's like a desperate drink of water that people don't get enough of and you can see that with the Peterson it's just like someone says yeah you can think there is a point to life try to think about it and it's just like thirsty people are just sitting there and and Schaefer had a similar effect the 80s at Lebrie was in particularly in Switzerland there were different Lebrie's by this time but the 80s was a rough period I visited the second time in 1987 I quite frankly didn't think they'd be there when I got back in 1990 I eventually showed up in 1993 again and they were good and they've gone through some some changes particularly Swiss Lebrie but and and since then they have more or less continued to serve their function and they've gone through good times and bad times but but they have when I go back there I often am left with the feeling that no Lebrie really still serves a function particularly Swiss Lebrie I've gone to the Rochester Lebrie and I know some of the people from the other Lebrie's and I'm sure they serve a function too but Swiss Lebrie really I think is there as a place where people can wrestle with ideas whether Christians or not and I recommend people go there and they've just gone through another kind of change and things when I went there in 2016 yeah yeah because I was there in 2012 the next time was 2016 that was the time when I also started to have worries and the reason was is they started to get the really politically correct students there and it was rough because they were they were the kind of people who felt you could tell there was a kind of a self-righteousness that got kind of spread and that prickly offense you don't offend me kind of thing but I'm happy to report that my next two trips 2017 and 2018 yeah they're back on track you know and and they've kind of swept the cobwebs a bit there and things are going well so anyway there you have that well that's that's that's really helpful I we just had a we had a meetup we had a meetup Sunday night here and we had a new person in for the meetup and I had a conversation we always have our regular meetup which is about two hours and we have the after hours which is people break up into smaller conversations and we just keep talking until I have to kick everybody out otherwise otherwise we have Libre in Sacramento and I'm not ready to start that but but what what you said is I mean this is what struck this individual who came he said you know you well it's in a church and you're doing this but we're we're talking we're having honest conversations and people aren't you know in the people aren't bullshitting each other this isn't propaganda and you know I know some sometimes people in the church have get a little uncomfortable with this not this church but you know the church generally and I you know just I'm grateful for a place like that now it's it's really interesting what you said though about the dynamics between Frankie and Francis in terms of because listening to Frankie's Google Talk which is easy to find obviously it's it sounds like that's you know the it's the money I mean Frankie talked about that it's money and the influence and the I mean that we should never underestimate how that affects us if you have if you have a million people applauding you and cheering you for a particular thing that you're doing you know it's like the old psychological experiment where the kids smile every time the teacher turns you know makes a step to the left and you just keep smiling that teacher all the way over into the corner I mean in a mass scale this is what attention status money influence fame this is what this does to us and I I really liked your comment about this you know this kind of this this narrow edge between this openness that they had and then the propaganda because you know that we've got this deep hunger for openness to you know can I explore but then in a sense that openness itself can become propaganda and that's when of course it's lost again so I thought right and it's easy for anyone to lose it yes and and and part of the problem is this and I can see this happening with Frank he had several children at a young age got married young he was supporting himself with first his paintings and then his films now you don't want to upset the apple cart so you keep doing and saying the things that will keep the bread you need for your family coming in and that's the problem is right there and you know what can I say it's like it's difficult I mean I've never quite had that problem because I've always been like on the poor side of the fence but but no it's it but at the same time I've done things that have you know caused me to lose jobs and stuff because I you know did the wrong thing for the right reason or the right thing for the wrong reason and it's it's complicated these things and I think the temptation once you start a system I think Peterson is is tempted by these things to just simply now you've got a bullhorn and people are listening and now I think Peterson's probably got enough money to you know survive for the rest of his life so that's not an issue but what happens when you start getting the ideas for this institution or that place and such that's where the temptations start to come you know so I think that you know I just say you know I'm grateful I've never had to face that in that kind of a way but at the same time I've often the reason I haven't made a lot of money is because hey I could have made a lot of money doing rock record reviews back in the 80s 90s whatever or you know because I'm good I know my stuff but I I said yeah but I watch well how these people end up writing and they use the same language and then the and the editors and the publishers they want the same kind of things and I can't do that so I and at a certain point I said to myself I'm gonna understand the music but it's not gonna be about you know trying to get into the industry and be an insider it's going to be more honest work trying to understand these things and that's how I looked at puppetry as well I'm both an insider and an outsider you know and it's not about making money it's about exploration I mean there have been plenty of things I could have done to sell myself but I'm more about the exploration and and having come across the ideas of Jacques L'Oreal about propaganda that almost I'm so aware of it all the time that I'm just very much aware that you know challenge what I say don't believe everything I say a real conversation a little said once where discussion begins propaganda ends real human discussion and you can't be a propagandist in that form but I've had discussed talks with people who are propagandized and what happens is and they can be any kind of you'll be talking to him and there's a click you can almost hear it where they just suddenly start going off into what they're doing I mean Christians do it when suddenly they click and I'm trying to get you saved you know and they cease to deal with each individual and and they start worrying about well this is going too slow we're not reaching enough people you know and one of the big the technological society according to Jacques L'Oreal is efficiency and the more we seek to be efficient the less human we become because you have to you know McDonald's sells a lot of hamburgers but are those really good hamburgers they're just they you know they have taste they but they don't have substance the substance of a decent hamburger that I would think no I love you know I I'm so oh there's so many things I want to talk to you about you know because I watched I think it's so when you told me you know you were in not the state of Georgia but the country of Georgia and you're interested in puppets and then I watched some of your videos and I watched your video on texture I thought that was that was so helpful and you know I I talked to a guy yesterday and will probably depends on if he wants to release the conversation but but one of the things that he said he sees the conversation he says yes people have things to lose but you know it's it one of the things he commented he said you know I see it I see it in YouTube in terms of once people once people get a certain size you know and I think it's exactly that situation and as a pastor in a church you deal with that all the time because on one hand you're supposed to the institution says you're supposed to speak preach prophetically from the word of God and that's supposed to unnerve us and disrupt us and change us and transform us on the other hand the people that you're talking to are the ones that are supporting the ones that are putting checks in the plate and if you tick off some of those people and in the 80 20 20% of the people are putting 80% of the money in you take those people off well it and and it slowly becomes propaganda and I so so in terms of my little channel I I'm always thinking about this in terms of you know for a while I was watching metrics a lot and because I just kind of want to figure out how the YouTube thing works there I there's social blade is this program where you can compare like five channels and you know watch how many new subs they get each day and you can see how many views they're getting and so I'm thinking about this and and then I'm thinking okay well well what what what exactly is my channel about what what am I doing on YouTube what what what is this for and should I be you know I very quickly realized that when I talk to people who have fame I get way more subscribers just boom you get this big hit but then it's well that's what everybody does with their YouTube channel and and I thought if you're honest you must know that the word Jordan Peterson drives more people to you I I never would have nobody would ever watch my channel if I hadn't started talking about Jordan Peterson so so then I I mean I think about this stuff and it's like conflicted about the whole business and sometimes I think I'm not gonna make any more videos and then someone says oh Paul thank you for making videos you've really helped me and that's like so you know it's but this this these temptations you know this stuff is real and I oh I love I love your story because it has so many of these dynamics in there and you know are we got the short version and I want you to I you know you're making your channel keep telling your story because I think yeah well eventually I will get more personal right now I will occasionally bring in things but yeah part of the reason I'm doing the channel is because I do have I have a lot of ideas I need to write about and do things about but I'm also very slow at it so I've got you know my writing is over on the anadromous life essay side so I'm very serious about stuff but I'm I realize how slow I am at getting to things I I mean most of what I've written there is not even the stuff I am mostly interested in I mean I've written I it's often things I'm discovering like Georgia which I am very interested in enough to live here or American gothic culture not to be confused with God or you know these other things that kind of come propaganda well that's important to me but I haven't hardly written about music at all I do have a whole other site for puppetry but even that's more exploration than my ideas about puppetry and then there are big ideas like my ideas about time and I've been working on that for a long time and I found it interesting that you have been diving more into the subject of meaning in the last few months and that is really crucial to me and that's been something I have been working with for a long time and I really it was Rook Mocker's lecture which can be found at the Libre Ideas Library on reality that is one of the things that really kicked it off because he talks he at one point says I used to say that reality is fact plus meaning but he says what are facts it's it's at best a little scientific you know thing reality is meaning you know and I would say I would take a little bit more of a nuance there and talk about some other things but I I think he's basically right and so for me I followed the breadcrumbs he laid down there and some of the breadcrumbs are well he mentioned C.S. Lewis's the discarded image I had already read it got that breadcrumb by the time I found his lecture which that lecture I have listened to I figured it out the other day about at least 40 times since I first heard it because I keep finding more in it and Rook Mocker is also a really interesting speaker and sometimes really funny there's also a four-part series of him talking about art which I highly recommend because he has a whole section in there he talks about how you can recommend but he's got a whole section where he starts talking about nudity and art and you can feel the Christians in the audience and it was like I think Westminster Seminary and this was like 1976 their backs just you can feel everything tensing up and then there's what some woman there who's early Christian feminist and then there's some other people talking about you know pornography and stuff and Rook Mocker finally says you Americans are so stupid why you I love it they left some of that out of the complete works of Rook Mocker I have that edited by his daughter Marlene who I've met she's wonderful but she left out the some of the parts I love the most because him just like blowing up but he the he then mentions Barfield several times and Barfield is quite amazing there is a quote I love from Barfield that's in one of his essays in the book the rediscovery of meaning which is a series of essays now not every essay in there is worth reading but some of them really are and in one place he talks about that we have this problem because we have become these individuals in a certain solitary sense and to the degree that we are individual we are also alienated and isolated from each other so and you can really now he wrote that probably back in the 60s you can really see it now technology has made us more individualistic than ever everyone that's you know got a t-shirt that says I'm this they've got tattoos that say I'm that they're all trying to say there's something and yet they are more individual and isolated and alienated from each other all the time but Barfield's saving the appearances I read that book the first time I read that it was like oh that was difficult but not nearly as difficult as his book on Coleridge which I read which took me about four months to get through I stopped and read Einstein's theory of relativity in the middle for a break and he talks about the subject of polarities and all this other stuff is just really complex writing but then he also mentions other interpretations oh one of the great things about Ruckmacher's art lectures is he has a whole section where he talks about the meaning of scholarship and how we can understand anybody and and he has four points they're really interesting but I would suggest going to the library hunting down some Ruckmacher they're old recordings from the 1970s and they've cleaned them up not not to the best of my taste sometimes that you get that digital kind of plastic sound almost but but they're still audible and you know the material in there is like gold but I started in a sense I kept following people so you know through CS Lewis I found GK Chesterton but then I found a barfield but then I found you know of course Dorothy Sayers Charles Williams Charles Williams figure Beatrice amazing discussion of the image of Beatrice in Dante's Inferno absolutely he's got another book on the meaning of the city these are our fantastic works then I discovered oh Ruckmacher mentions Michael Palanis personal knowledge now personal knowledge to me when it comes to taking Michael Plany was a chemist he was hardcore scientists Hungarian he ended up moving to to England and particularly during the communist period he died I believe in Brown 64 but and there are four lectures of him audio only if you type in Polanyi with the with mp3 after it do a search you can find his his lectures they are amazing because he talks about the nature of reality and the thing that Planyi says and once I read this I never had a problem with you know you know scientists and Christianity and evolution again and and it was hard to tell exactly what his his faith was but he definitely had a faith but he was very much the scientist and but he said it basically his thought was this knowledge is personal that means everyone's knowledge that means the scientist who says that what he's doing is absolutely objective is not absolutely objective but he also points at things like this where does the scientists get their ideas where does the hypothesis come from the hypothesis does not come from the substances it doesn't come from matter it doesn't come from simply it comes just pops into your head looking at something and you interact with it and suddenly you get out I wonder why you know are there any colors besides the three primary colors and all their friends you know these kind of questions but no and personal knowledge is another very difficult book he's got equations in there it's just like it's but one and then he's got several other books a logic of liberty and the tactile dimension these are all great what happens when I discover someone I just okay we're going all the way down and and but Planyi is monumental when it comes to the idea of meaning and it's particularly if you put them and then there's a little who I was Guinness mentioned a lot back in the 1960s and 70s and a wool is a totally different beast entirely because he is French very logical French and the French when they get into rigor the rigor of their logic it's just like well watch out for these guys they're not like flimsy and and he's got a sociological writing the technological society in the technological system technological bluff the political illusion particularly scary book that remains relevant and how he basically said and propaganda the formation of men's attitudes and when you put particularly the first three that camera trilogy were technological system propaganda and the political illusion and you suddenly once you got to the political illusion so oh George Carlin was right they just shuffle the faces around you know it's not about conspiracy theories it's about hardcore knowledge and and understanding and I could go on for that but then there's Walker Percy Walker Percy is interesting because well the most accessible book by him is lost in the cosmos which is his parody of a self-help book yes yes and it's wonderful yes but his his book of essays lost in the cosmos is really great particularly his one called what is it the loss of the creature and he talks about how we've lost our things and it goes perfectly with I mean a little talks about the whole how technology causes us to lose meaning and such and in fact alone has a very interesting point he says that technology okay he says our first the first environment that humans grew up in in history was nature the natural world but we get everything good from there so we get the Sun we get you know rain waters are crops we get you know food from the animals and and you know the nature's you know everything it seems except it also provides all the worst things as well so that Sun can destroy you if you don't get enough water rain can destroy you weather can destroy animals can destroy the sea can destroy all aspects of nature can kind of get revenge and in order to fight that we created the second environment and the second environment he says and this is all in the technological system the second environment is society the social world and so what we have in the second environment is we have okay we've banded together in cities we've learned to you know crop rotation we've learned how to plant harvest in the fields we've got you know things are but so that we're protected from some of the worst ravages of nature not always but often enough but then he says we have what is it all the problems that come with the social world which range from the problems of love and all the things related to you know the heartaches of love and back and forth and too many people and everyone wanting the same people and whatnot to the problems of war and disease and diseases spread particularly when you get a lot of people in proximity and war basically will take us out and so we've been slowly working at creating the environment we now live in which is technology and he says we live inside of technology it's not a question of being against technology you can't be that everything you do now is through technology and he was writing this in the 1960s when his last book the technological bluff he wrote in the 1980s he died around 86 87 interestingly enough CS Lewis died on the day that JFK was shot and a little died on the day that Jackie Kennedy died really I didn't coincidence but the interesting thing is we are still in the process we you know of finding out what the damages from our technological world particularly the shift into the internet in this collective hive right and and it's kind of like nothing else after that in many ways to answer those questions so my feeling is this putting all these together plus Tarkovsky's writing a sculpture in time Solzhenitsyn's work Dostoevsky I mean there's lots more people I'm just cherry-picking at the moment but is that essentially we are at war with reality we want a perfect world and the more we try to get there the more we're putting the gun to our head there's an interesting line in TS Eliot's four quartets where he says we'll finally come back I'm not quoting this exactly but he says it near the end of the whole poem cycle he says like the the last place will be the first place in other words it's almost like this picture of returning to the Garden of Eden and I thought about that for a while and I said yeah and you know what will happen when we get to the Garden of Eden we're gonna finally find out what the sword was that the angel had it's the thing that won't allow us to become perfect that won't allow us to know everything that won't allow us to to get back to the garden and and I think it's it's real I don't know what it is but there's something within humanity that that sword is keeping us from ever going that way back but that is I think one of the central temptations of humanity if you look at fascism or communism you know the idea of a perfect society but even today there are ideas of a perfect society whether the ideal free market or the ideal social justice or you know the ideal Islamic state or the ideal Christian you know if we can only get America back to being a perfect Christian you know it was you know it never was it never will be and if you were good enough Christian you would know that and stop sucking at the perfection straw this is wonderful I love that's a that's a that's a that's a I took a lot of notes I'm glad we got it recorded that's a great that's a great we didn't even get to talking about the texture talk about texture but I got it you know I got I want to touch on that just briefly I know we should wrap up but I had never so I was listening to that talk that you gave at Lebrie and I had never thought about the fact that we we think almost nothing it's not that we don't think about it we we don't think about it when we're thinking about things but right so so look at how much abstract I forget I forget for Vakey's word for using basically using the using the the brain mechanisms for example using Peterson talks about this to using the brain mechanisms for sight for you know I can close my eyes I can imagine I can foresee I can plan we so we have all these visual metaphors well feeling has become in our culture the the the substitute for thought I feel this I feel this I feel this and it trumps thought it trumps incontinence what's that emotional incontinence yeah but it's it's it's actually texture so that's the that's the stuff that we're using as putting it at the top of our of our knowledge hierarchy right now well I feel this to be true all that intuition I mean one of the one of the things that one of the things that I heard you know part of what makes us amazing creatures is that we have so much feeling all over our bodies and yet and I know if you know this one of the people in my meetup showed me these there's this entire movement of there's entire genre of videos and and internet channels where people have a microphone oh yeah yeah yeah and they're all about it and it's like ASMR so yeah yeah ASMR I had never I saw it and and I was looking at I was just I was thinking what on earth is this but but yet somehow yeah and and no and and so I you know I and when you open that up I thought well here's a whole continent that I never even thought of and well think about you probably remember when we were younger they had those sound effects records like environments where you play just a forest in the background or something of course they have these kind of things on YouTube and whatnot but that's because we're missing it yeah yeah you know and and the ironic thing is these days when we're missing some kind of texture we tend to create plastic or digital imitations of it yes which is really weird but that's where we are you know by the way besides the the the lecture there on there are three more lectures from Lebrie on my first YouTube channel the anadromous life and one of them is my first puppet lecture there which was puppetry as an antidote art and the other one was a history of puppetry so obviously you should listen to the one on art first and don't bother with the other one unless you get interested in it but then the third one is the propaganda and social media and I've got some other words that are sitting around that I have to I've got one that's probably the one that's the most I'll probably get in the most trouble for it's called conceptual humanity and it's about the fact that basically if we no longer define ourselves as being in the image of God and if everything natural can be supplanted by technology and so it's just our choice then is it any wonder that people are having their tongues split and their bodies tattooed or they're getting a breast reduction or you know breast surgery enhancement or or you know when they're 16 years old because there is no definition of the self and so this is but that lecture has so much visual material with it I've got it all and I'm just waiting to kind of put it all together and there's other stuff too I think yeah I don't have my lectures on time with you have my lectures on images so I'm gonna eventually get some of that stuff up and I might transfer the other ones to the other one but it's good fodder so but yeah no texture it goes with meaning it's like what kind of world do we actually live in do we live in a world where for instance you could live inside of a room that had say the the texture of the average white refrigerator could you live in that world you know there's a lot of science fiction movies that show us living in that world but the world we live in is a lot trashier yeah it's almost like when you create that flat hollow world people then break out the spray paint can't they have to deface it they have to leave more garbage on the streets you know it's like it's just too nice it's and who wants to live in it you know we want wood we want stone we want textures that have some sort of meaning to them and that brings us to the point of what is the meaning of things well is the meaning generated in myself exclusively or is the meaning already there and I somehow can access it because I am part of the same matrix of meaning and that's how I think because otherwise how could people discover the things they have within science if the patterns weren't already there yeah and and these are not illusory patterns you know we can predict these patterns to the degree that we can send someone we can send things to Jupiter you know little objects to Jupiter to take pictures you know we can we can determine the structure of DNA within side of ourselves how can we do that if there is no meaning to these things you know and did the pattern just generate itself I mean there's questions of God here but then there's questions of just simply I think a lot of Christians for instance are practically atheists that is to say they live in the same dead world as long as they go to church on Sunday and get a few prayers in listen to a pastor who is talking in such a way as to please people so that they will keep coming back and paying his bills they're not gonna raise too many questions and and in fact the first time I ever raised any of these questions was in a I was getting licensed to preach through are the church I was in prior to going to the break and so I talked about certain things and one of the things I talked about was the texture of refrigerators and the deadness of them and people the the the pastor came up to me and said what are you talking about this is what you're supposed to say yeah you're not talking about refrigerators and a sermon what are you talking about anyway if you listen to the the whole texture lecture then you can find out why refrigerators might be a problem and what I like is they used to actually have wooden handles and doors and things back when they were had those curly round cooling coolant on top those are really cool refrigerators I wish they still look like that yeah yeah but but then chilled things like our modern refrigerators now we've just got buttons and now we're putting screens on our refrigerators you go to the I know I'm sung refrigerator and it's a big screen and soon they'll be it won't be a clear door it'll be a big door with a screen the size of the door with cameras inside so that's the weird thing is that is that we are giving ourselves over more and more to the to the algorithms you know that is our lives increasingly what's nice about living in Georgia is I am free it's like yeah there's some computer stuff here but it is like it in a way it feels like I've returned to the 70s although not as chaotic but plenty chaotic and what I mean I am constantly banging my head when you know the electricity goes out or I lose my water or someone doesn't understand or the traffic and I just did a drive for my first drive out of town in a rented car that's this weekend and tried to get up into the mountains but I chose like the weirdest road I could possibly find and we didn't make it we ended up getting a flat tire it was wonderful you know it's like yeah this is life you know trying to do things real things meeting people real people having real conversations listening to people who actually sing I mean I saw a piano recital in a small room museum room last week or about a week and a half ago that was just like I couldn't believe what I was hearing the pianist was so good and you could just see her as she was it was like yeah she'd practice this these pieces by Liszt or Scriabin or or these other composers over and over and over again and she had forgotten it all and was like playing it for the first time you could just sense that I said like that is music there's no microphone here there's nothing between me and the music some old technology in the piano but this is real this is this is why we can talk about that sometimes well I shouldn't keep you up all night because I know it's it's late morning here but it's late it's getting late night for you so eventually talking and we will talk again I'm sure there is more to discuss I'm sure there is so hang on I'm just gonna I'm just gonna stop the recording and and and we can and we will see each other again okay
