Anyways, episode 11. Episode 11. We're doing pretty good. My kings lost the other night by four, but they did come back and they almost beat the Clippers. But they got Blake Griffin, they got Paul, what's that guy's name? Oh, you're talking about who the Clippers got? Yeah, the Clippers got him. They got Paul Pierce. Paul Pierce. And then they got, what's his name, the point guard. Remember who I'm talking about? Oh yeah, I know who you're talking about. His last name is Paul. I know who you're talking about. You want to show the Canada shirt? Oh yeah. We got fans in Canada. Philip got me this shirt from Canada when he went on his trip, and I thank him very much. He's a noble man. Alright. So another shout out to Canada. Okay. Now we did have a question from a viewer. Her name is Diane. She asked about what do we do with disappointment? So do you ever experience disappointment, Fred? Once in a while, I mean, once in a while there is disappointment, but I look at the good things out of the disappointment. And wipe out the disappointment and look to the pros instead of the cons. Because you've got to look at positivity because laughter is the best medicine. And if you understand these things, it will help you in your way of your life that you walk in the Christian way like a cadet. Like a cadet. Okay. I think that's good advice, Fred. That's good advice. Oh, we've got a minute. Okay. So anything else we want to talk about today? There was something you were going to tell me, but I thought what it was. Okay. And you wanted to teach me how to rap. Yeah. Let's do a rap. Fred wants to do a rap. We're going to talk about what was the sermon about today? David and Bathsheba? David and Bathsheba. You remember what happened there? One of them was married. They both were married. Oh, okay. David had lots of wives. Okay. Uriah had one wife. David takes the guy's one wife and has him killed. So that's not good. That's not a Christian way. That's not a Christian way. They were not leading the scholarship of the second hand mostly. Scholarship. No, they were not leading that. So okay. On a future episode, Freddie's going to teach me how to rap, and we're going to rap a C.S. Lewis rap. Right. But I'm going to teach you how to rap. Okay. So, we're going to start with a rap. Okay. All right. So, on a future episode, Freddie's going to teach me how to rap, and we're going to rap a C.S. Lewis rap. Right. But we're about out of time in this episode, so look forward to that. On a coming episode, Freddie's going to teach me how to rap. I'm going to have to... This is going to be awesome. We're going to do C.S. Lewis, and oh, I need you to write me some lyrics. Okay.
