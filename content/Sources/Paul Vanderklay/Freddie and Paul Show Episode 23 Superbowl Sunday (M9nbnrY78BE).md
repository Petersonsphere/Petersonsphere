Julio Jones and Matt Ryan. You want Brady to do good right? I gotta be for the Patriots because otherwise I got family problems I know I don't want family problems we don't want that no we don't want that but but Freddie and many people here rooting for the underdog or the Falcons. Falcons yeah. Looking forward to a high scoring game yes hopefully a lot of scoring that probably helps the Falcons right on yeah Matt Ryan and Julio Jones are gonna have a good game and the real question is what color hoodie will Belichick wear a lot of people are hoping for the blue not the red because folks are superstitious about Belichick's hoodie so I think it'll be blue blue okay so the blue hoodie all right and we're gonna talk a little bit about the Kings the Kings yeah Kings baby Kings beat the Warriors yeah beat the Warriors awesome but the Kings gotta figure out what to do with the Marcus Cousins right you think we gotta keep them yes he's an awesome aspect he he's worked on his behavior and he's not acting up no more and he's a team player because Rudy Gay got hurt he tore his ligament okay so he can't play for the rest of the year so but I think we might make the playoffs if they keep up this I don't think they're gonna make that their record is really not good they could they could get the AC because they're an AC right now Paul okay I'm not kidding okay they beat the Warriors that's a plus yeah but they're not gonna beat all the Warriors have like eight losses and the Kings have like I don't know okay you would know you would know so anyways anything about the sermon today what do you remember about the sermon today about righteousness you were saying righteousness like righteousness is when you're pure grateful loyal industrious and cheerful when you're a cadet yay or a Calvinist cadet yes and I also heard your sermon and you said if you ask for help people will help you in a good way if if you're helped out if you walk the basic line basically if you do good others will be good to you because you treat others the way you would want to be treated you should treat others oh yeah and then you were saying help me out because I remember what you said you said something about um um dang it forgot I forgot what you were saying we're talking about righteousness how no but you said kind of an invasion no but you said righteousness beyond the scribes and the Pharisees right but you were saying something about um was it Daniel you talk about Daniel we're just Daniel in our Sunday school class start next start in a few weeks okay but um anyway uh how many minutes we got we're doing pretty good Freddy's thinking about you want to talk about thinking about a new job maybe you're thinking about a job you want to talk about that at all no I'm okay with that okay not until it's done not until it's done okay okay but um I would like to see the Kings do good just just to have their season do good and I'm serious it's possible they could make the playoffs in a wild card but anyways enough about that all right Atlanta should win today because I think they have a good team and I'm for the underdog and Patriots already won enough games with Brady and and um they've got a lot of wins they got a lot of Super Bowl rings you remember when Chris remember when Bledsoe played for the Patriots yeah I do he was a good quarterback he was all right he was decent yeah he threw for a yard yeah Bledsoe was a good but you got to give it to Brady because he's a team player too yeah but Matt Ryan's a good player too he's consecutive he throws passes and he throws to the receivers and hands it to the running backs and they get a lot of yards and um sometimes they score they got two good running backs Atlanta does and they have they have a good they had a good season I mean they beat a lot of teams okay they did I don't know how Philadelphia will be next year maybe they'll be good yeah we'll see they have that quarterback number 11 so what about Alex Smith what well the the chiefs had a good year wait a minute I have a question for you okay I heard about the uh 49ers are gonna have a new coach oh really yes they got rid of um what's that guy's name you know who I'm talking about um um well usually if you have a bad anyways they got rid of the coach and they're having a new coach and I think they might be okay next year if they work on their hope for the 49ers yeah hope for the 49ers all right so hopefully the Raiders will do better they had a good season this year yes better next year yeah okay maybe maybe Alex Smith will come back I don't know what's his name again number four the quarterback for the Raiders oh the um uh car car yeah no no he'll come Alex Smith plays for the all right we're at 520 where all right okay I won't do a wrap this time and I hope you guys tune in because I did a good time a good job singing in praise time and I enjoyed your your uh word okay word of wisdom and let's close the show as you close the show all right one love yay 23
