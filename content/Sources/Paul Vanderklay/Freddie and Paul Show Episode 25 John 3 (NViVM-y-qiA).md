 Freddie and Paul show this is episode 25. Hey how's it going Paul? I think we're doing pretty good. And we are and I told Fred, I said Fred he doesn't... If I had hair like Fred I wouldn't wear a hat. I understand. That's just my motto you know. It's just like the cadet code. Trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious, and cheerful. And I feel good about the season when I wear a hat. It just makes me feel good. About Michigan? You follow Michigan? Yeah I like Michigan Wolverines man. They're cool. All right so we're going to talk about the sermon today. Freddie's got some notes. John 3 and I came up with being special is hard but Jesus is special. He's a good guy. He died for us. And he's the well the sermon John 3 he's the he comes from above right? Jesus comes from heaven so he's got authority. Yeah yeah. And what else you got in your notes? Acts 1 6. Are these your mom's notes? Mom did it for me. Oh okay. But I'm gonna do it next time. That's fine that's fine. I just didn't you know. No that's cool it's no problem. Anyways Acts 1 6 it says is Israel going to be special? Nicodemus came to Jesus by Baptist. Like John the Baptist. But no no no Jesus didn't come from John the Baptist right? He didn't follow John the Baptist did he? Well Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. Okay okay. And Nicodemus probably was having some wondering about. Altercations? Having some altercations. Nicodemus was wondering about you know these Baptists and what was going on with that. Okay. And then I got how can we be born again? And the easy thing is we can be born again because we're one in the Spirit and we're one in the Lord. And if you're one in the Spirit and one in the Lord you have Jesus on your side. And with Jesus you can do all things through Christ that strengthens you. Let's just say I'm one thing to the next. I'm doing all right. You're doing great. Thank you. And then I got believe in Jesus you will go to heaven of course. If you believe in his word and go by the cadet code and go by the church equities. I know Paul I'm making you laugh I'm sorry. No that's fine I like to laugh. And then I'm just saying you know if you're one in the Spirit one in the Lord you are with God kind of like a joint progress but at the same time you're following Jesus. So you'll be born again. Jesus says if you want to enter the kingdom of heaven you must be born from above. So we talked about that in the sermon. What can I do with my practice to be a good Christian? Well there's misery. There's misery, deliverance, gratitude. I don't want the misery though. I want to be happy. None of us want the misery but life has full of misery. I know but that's not me. My personality is since I treat others the way I want to be treated. But that doesn't mean you're gonna. I know but I want God with me. Jesus was perfect and he had misery. I want perfection in it. That's true but we all suffer in this world. Okay. Me, you, everyone. I know but what can we do to not suffer? No just to take the best in. Okay put the pros in and take the cons out. How can we focus on just being perfect? Because you're my friend. I am your friend. And we are perfect. We go to Vone Crown. We go to McDonald's. And you know I think I'm somewhat a sliver but in God's way you know. But I give God all the praise for everything that happens with me. Because I've came a long way. You have come a long way. I've done good in the church and I have been doing better. And you're my great pastor. Hi CJ if you're gonna watch this. Hi CJ. I just thought I'd say that. But wasn't that funny last week when we were bagging? You got a kick out of that. That's what we do. We do that and then we do music. It's just like comedy. It is comedy. It's just cool. It is comedy. So. It is comedy. This has been comedy. So any last things we're reaching five minutes here. The Kings. The Kings need to work on their practice. They need to practice up so they do better. And the Warriors lost to the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs are good. But yeah they got Janoby. Hi Janoby. No I'm just kidding. I'm sure he appreciates that. I don't know. I'm just kidding. I think most NBA stars watch our show. I have a question. Yes. How can we get more people to watch our program? You tell me. So that's for the audience. How can we get more people to watch our program? Freddie wants to know. I want to know. And I know Paul wants to know. I want to know. Okay five minutes we're done. Go ahead and say a prayer.
