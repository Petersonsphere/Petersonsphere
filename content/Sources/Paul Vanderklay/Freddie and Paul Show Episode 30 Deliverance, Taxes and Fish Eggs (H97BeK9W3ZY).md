 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show this is episode 29 or 28. Oh 30. We're doing good. That's a lot of weeks. A lot of weeks and we've put you know Freddie and Paul of course we've got Nancy the regular guest on the show and Kenny is back again. Hi everybody. And today what do we want to talk about we've got a few things. Deliverance. Kenny wants to talk about deliverance. When you hear deliverance what do you think about? I don't know what it means. Oh I got one. What do you think? You think you're delivered. You're delivered by God's grace and God's abundance and God's formality. Well I always say misery, deliverance, gratitude. What deliverance means is that Jesus rescues us. For misery. If you ask for forgiveness he will forgive you. Gratitude. That's right. Forgiveness. So deliverance basically means rescue and it depends on what you need rescue from. Because sometimes we need rescue from different things. So deliverance basically means rescue. Jesus rescues us. I got it. So that's deliverance. And you want to talk about taxes last week? Yeah. What about taxes? You think they'll start putting taxes on soda? They already have taxes on soda don't they? Oh CRB. Yeah that's the deposit thing. They were talking about putting more tax on soda. Like putting an extra tax on soda because it's so bad for you. I love soda. Soda is my friend. Hi soda how you doing? So Fred is against the sugar soda tax. Get that on record there. And the cigarettes. That's another thing. That's my only bad habit people. I only smoke cigarettes because it relieves tension and frustration sometimes. Because you got to walk in the way of God. Amen. And Jesus loves you. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. No. No. We got Nina on the show. She's out there contributing. Okay what else do you want to talk about? I got notes. You got notes? Yeah. I want to say something. If you're taxing cigarettes, why can't you tax alcohol? Alcohol is specially taxed. It is? Yes it is. Yeah there's pretty significant taxes on alcohol. I don't touch that stuff. I don't like alcohol. What about marijuana? Let's not go there. That's not good. I'm pro-choice against drugs. I hate drugs. Drugs are no good. Say no and be down for the OPB hit. I don't know if that means Fred. If they legalize pop. No they better not. I don't like being around that. They will tax it heavily. They tax gambling heavily. Okay. Okay. Alright next topic. What you got there Fred? You got notes? I took notes. It says three layers of reality. Objective. Peter 2 verse 9 and 10. Set your hope on coming of Jesus. And partially live out our lives. Green card. Temper for a while. What lasts in life. Love one another. Deeply by living stones. Grow up. We're living stones in God's way and we're also fishers of men. That's right. We're both. We fish and we use salmon eggs because God wants us to have salmon eggs. That is one wildly mixed metaphor. We're fishers of men with salmon eggs. Oh and my fans out there. I'm going to my doctor and I'm going to get a fishing license. And I'm going to fish with my good friend Greg. Hi Greg. I hope you're doing good out there. Because he has a boat okay at the lake and I go to the lake with him and we sail sometimes. But he told me if I got my pamphlet and have my doctor sign it I can get a fishing license. Oh good. Fish for free and that would be good recreation. That would be good recreation. Because God likes we're fishers of men. Paul gets the kick out of me. God gave me this gift Paul to be funny. I know. I get it from my mom. Your father is pretty funny too. Yeah I love you dad. I love you father. Okay anything else on the call show? Got to wrap it up. So any last things? Deliverance, taxes. Kimmy just told me she plays the guitar. She played the keyboard. So we got to do a performance I think. You're resting now? If you ever think of not resting we could always use more music. You're here early for Freddie already. Freddie's singing. Okay that's it for the Freddie and Paul show. See you all next time. Everybody we got to do one love. One, two, three, one love. Amen. Christian Reformed Church. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
