 Welcome back to the Freddie and Paul show. We've got Reggie in the studio audience. And we have a special guest today, Forrest Barnes. Enchanted Forrest. The magic man. The magic man. The Big Daddy. Freddie wanted to talk about how Forrest preached a sermon a few weeks ago. Freddie wanted to say something about that. Yes, I thought he did an awesome job. He was talking about, basically he was talking about how he brought magic into his life and how he uplifted other people. And I thought it was very good for us. And thank you for being my friend. You're a cool person. Thank you very much. Anyways, I just wanted to say that he showed me a magic trick and he asked me to come forth. And he brought... Come forth? Yeah. He brought, what you call it, he brought a cap from a bottle, you know? And he brought it right through the bottle. Really? I was like, wow, man, how did he do this? And then I was just like, it was cool with sermon because he said magic brought him, I mean his life brought him to magic. And he shows his ways of dignity and transgressions that work good in his life. And he likes to show other people his wondrous ways. Whose wondrous ways? God's wondrous ways. No, God's wondrous ways, but he works in his life and he's a very nice guy. And I've known Ford for a long time. And we're going to talk about the Warriors now. And he made my hair disappear. No. Made mine too. But the sermon was about having Christ be Lord and Savior of your life. And how family, how my aunt brought our entire family to the Lord. And so all the aunts and uncles who were saved shared Christ with their kids. And so they're all saved. And so it's all about salvation and Christ being Lord and Savior of our lives. Right. Okay. Anyways, I guess the Warriors do very good. The Warriors play today, game two. No, but do you know that Kevin Durant... You guys speak up, they got to hear too. You know that Kevin Durant had 35 points. I didn't know that. Yes. And they won against that. And Curry had 25 points, I think. And Thompson had 15. And we all did good. And it was cool. So they're going to play today. And let's hope they win. Your prediction for the series? What do you think is going to happen? Warriors and five. Warriors and five, Freddie says. Warriors and five. Any other predictions for the basketball Warriors? Are you for the Warriors? I'm for the Warriors. Thank you. Okay. How about you? Yeah. Why not for the Warriors this time? The three amigos. There we are. And what you talked about today. What did I talk about today? Today is... I heard you talk about Peter. We did talk about Peter because today is... Resurrection. P... Oh, Pentecost. Pentecost. Pentecost, yeah. And you got to be trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious, cheerful, and connect code. See, every sermon for you, Freddie, has the same application. It makes it simple. That's my thing. That's your thing. That's your thing. All right. Well, thank you very much for tuning in. And I'm going to do a rap real quick about Pentecost. Here we go.
