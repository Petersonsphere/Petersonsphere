So we talked a lot about fantasy football I want to hear more about the sermon though Fred. So Heidelberg Catechism help me out. Who was the founder of Heidelberg Catechism? Ursinus and Olivia wrote the Heidelberg Catechism and can you do you know what city they wrote it in? Michigan Heidelberg oh I knew where's Heidelberg that's in Germany Germany okay that's where I had a look at it stuff like Italy and stuff really it's like the lean child of a pizza yeah it's it's in the same continent yes cool man that's right right on yep and um we were talking about football you said you played Ben last week that's right I lost to Ben Gaitis lost by one that's not bad and I'm playing your mom and Reggie this week and Reggie says I'm gonna win so that's a good thing well Reggie we'll see what Reggie if see if Reggie's consecutive yeah we'll see if Reggie's consistent okay we were talking about uh Derek Carr how he's a good quarterback we're talking about how the Raiders are gonna have a good year yeah the Niners are struggling Niners need help Michigan was on a Matt Newton boom he's a big Michigan fan too yeah as is Derek Zile call to Derek Zile who's a big Michigan fan Derek Zile remember Derek when he's here Zile Z-E-Y-L what does he do now for an occupation he's he's pastor in my mother's church in Massachusetts yeah I'm serious oh great good job and my mom watches this too can I watch some of his um clips sermons I don't know Derek you have clips I'll make sure I link Derek in with this and we'll let you know because Freddy's interested in watching some of your clips do you have a greatest hits reel there from Pleasant Street Church Derek I don't know so I think we should have one of these one of these years we'll have an anniversary issue and we'll have greatest hits from the Freddy and Paul show how about that that'd be fun wouldn't it like you said we're an episode I think we're an episode 38 or 39 I think we're around there 37 to 38 for a while they were doing them all the time but I just couldn't make it all the time but I will be making it now because this is my therapy church is my therapy I enjoy church I enjoy what it has to do and I I believe in being one being as one like seeking first the kingdom of god asking thou shall be added on to you right and how's the rest go I forgot are they you're thinking about the song seeking first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added on to you oh alleluia that's how the song goes yeah comes right from hey I had a question for you yes did you ever make it to Mount Hermon I've been to Mount Hermon yes you did I've never been to the Bible conference how'd you like it it's a pretty place like I said I've never been to the Bible conference yeah it's very nice forest and yeah it's very pretty area branches and trees yeah yeah we talked a little bit about Mount Hermon how on the Bible story Mount Carmel wasn't quite like Mount Hermon no Carmel is just a mountain where this happened where Elijah and the prophets of Baal or that whole story happened I have a question okay go ahead what what does that cross represent just got just Jesus yeah Jesus dying for our sins oh and the cross is empty do you know why the cross is empty because he's watching us in heaven that's right that's right am I wrong or right you're right oh okay because the tomb is empty yeah and Jesus has ascended and he'll be back and we will see him that's right we will see him later in a different life well we'll see well we may see him yeah if he comes before we die we'll see him here that would be good that would be good but anyway um one more thing about football okay can um who's the quarterback for the broncos now is that um I want to say blunt not blunt but blunt does play for him no no he plays for he plays for the Patriots blunt no blunt is playing for the Eagles this year oh they traded him yeah or they let him go oh okay so blunt is playing for the okay so Matt Ryan did good last week I told you he threw for 78 yards something like that you did all right Tom Brady did terrible last year last week oh he did all my all all Tom's fans in New England all my relatives in New England they suffer when the Patriots lose oh they suffer wow because Patriots never lose they're not used to it not like a Raiders fan or Niners fan you guys are used to losing Patriots fans not so used to it oh wow so so it's kind of like a complex thing to get used to now yeah yeah they're losing that's right maybe they're not having enough practice we'll see if they won't that's what I'm saying we'll see if they win this week yeah there she won't be on the show but we thought we'll mention her name you're not even gonna look at us okay well let me do a rap about football and then we'll close the show sounds good okay you got Matt Ryan as you can see he throws the ball 50 feet and he throws a touchdown G he's the one in command on the Atlanta Falcons he's on the mic and he might even brow them he might even take them to the top like last year they played the Patriots but you know who won that one as you know Paul will tell all his relatives really though that it's good to go without a word to say fantasy football watch out for Paul and mom's plays amen amen all right ready good one love amen
