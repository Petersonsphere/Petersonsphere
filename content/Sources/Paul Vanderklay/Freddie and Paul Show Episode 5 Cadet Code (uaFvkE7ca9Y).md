We just listened to a sermon on the Reformation. And we have some children in need of reform here. Freddie what did you think of the sermon? I liked it. I thought it was very trustworthy. Very pure, grateful, loyal, industrious and cheerful. And it was a good message. And I just wanted to let you know our Sacramento Kings won against the Timberwolves. Did they really? By three points. Wow that's good. What's their record so far? Now they got two wins. Two wins, how many losses? In the appendix they beat one loss. Two wins, one loss. So two in one. So we're doing pretty good. Now I want to go back to this, to your review of the sermon though. Faithful, industrious, cheerful. You know where that comes from? Trustworthy, pure, grateful, loyal, industrious, cheerful.
