Mother's Day. Mother's Day. Love your mom in every way. Mother's Day. Mother's Day. Love your mom in every way. Love your mom because she put you on this earth. She was the one that gave you the birth to be in this kingdom. As you see, her name is Nancy and I'm pretty deep. Coming up like this. Coming up like that. Enough to the chest or something's bad. Like Philip. Philip Bass drives in his RB. He loves my mom Nancy. I love my sister. Her name is Sherry. On the microphone and not a darn thing scary. Rocking them on to the top. Mother's Day.

If I'm rocking down to the top. People living and giving singing on top. My mom is number one. As you can see, thank you very much. And I thank the consistory. Shasta Paul. He stands tall. He loves my mom and that ain't all. He is the man in command. But really Jesus is the one that does it all, man. Mother's Day. Mother's Day. Love your mom in every way. Mother's Day. Mother's Day. Love your mom in every way. Amen. Hallelujah. On Sunday. Thank you, Tommy. Okay, let's do our interview. We're going to interview? Who are we going to interview? No, me and you are going to talk about the sermon. Then we're going to land on the plane. Okay, what I found out about the sermon is if you treat people the way you want to be treated. Bye, Tommy. I'll see you next week. Thank you, Tommy. Take care. Alright, I found out if you treat others the way you want to be treated, you're treated right. That often happens. And you were saying like, okay, you have earth and you have heaven. But Jesus is still on earth in his spirit because he looks upon us and he guides us in the right direction. And if we do right, well, he will be good because God is out of sight. Now, what I'm saying is Jesus is the reason for the season, like I said. And fishers of men will reel a man. And I think I'm a character, but I'm God's character. That's why this show is so awesome. We've got 350 views. And your comments are greatly appreciated. And I'll be doing music with CJ soon, so that'll be a treat for them, Paul. So thank you for episode 60. And do you have anything kind of words to say, Pastor Paul? I liked your rap, Fred, and Fred did a special rap. Actually, you're on the service today. Fred did a little rap to his mom. Well, my mom asked me if you guys didn't know it. Didn't you, Mom? You didn't ask to do that? She came up to me and told me to do it. Oh, my. You did, Mom. But I thought it was very sweet. But it was short, though. It was short. It was great. It was one verse. That was good. I think everybody appreciated that. Now, Paul, I had a question. Okay. I talked to Pete. Okay. And Pete said, if I practice something, one of these days I can do a solo for one of the songs that I could practice. Okay. Because I think my music is coming along. And I like doing this. And it's very nice. It is nice. All right. Happy Mother's Day to all mothers. Happy Mother's Day to everyone. Happy Mother's Day to my mom. And thank you very much. Number 60, ready? Okay. One love. Amen. Hallelujah.
