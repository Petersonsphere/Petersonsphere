 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. We are in a kind of a rush today. We're a little behind schedule. It's okay, but we'll get it going on. You'll love this song. The Warriors are going to game seven. Warriors going on play! Freddie's really interested in doing the song. Gigi and Tommy are ready to go. They're going to sing. Yay! So who wrote the song? Tommy. Tommy wrote the song. But I'm going to be in it because it's so beautiful. I think we actually sang it before on the show. Yes, they did. This is a repeat. I love it. Everybody wants to be in it. Go ahead. Let's do this. There's one thing I'm dreaming of I can call it mine It's the fact that we see the stars above In the sky I'm sad I'm so lost I'm so lonely I can't walk It's the night I'm feeling so right I'm trapped in a blue space In the same place In a different sky These stars fall And I'm bored to be A random soul that is about to leave I am tired of happiness In a dizzy world I am sick of loneliness A colorless world There's one thing I'm dreaming of I can call it mine It's the fact that we see the stars above In the sky In the sky I am tired of happiness In a dizzy world I am sick of loneliness A colorless world There's one thing I'm dreaming of I can call it mine It's the fact that we see the stars above In the sky Thank you very much for tuning in. This is Tommy's song. Tune in. 250 views last week. Pretty good. Good job you guys. See you next week.
