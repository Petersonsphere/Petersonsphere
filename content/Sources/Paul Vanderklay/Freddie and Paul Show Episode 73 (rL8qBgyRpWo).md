 Hello Sacktown, it's me Freddie and Paul and Paul how you been man? I'm doing well Fred how are you? I know I love this program I like all the comments and all the gestures we're getting and it's like cool and basketball starts in October so look out for the Kings because they got Bagley now and they got Aaron Fox and they got this other guy this European guy he's really good and the Rivercats have been doing alright and you can tune into my program the Freddie Shuler on YouTube and you can check out all my jams because Paul's helped me with my jams and I'll be at my own show so you can check me out there too so yeah this will be really short because we got another church coming in and so basically your sermon was is you should do things God's way and you will get a lot further in life but if you do things your way you can do it that way but you reap what you sow and basically if you don't follow Jesus it's not the right way because Jesus will bless you in transibility and trustworthy if you're grateful loyal and that's your sincere for okay Paul so we got to wrap this up let's do our one love. One love. Amen.
