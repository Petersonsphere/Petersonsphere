Today, Pastor Paul talked about Jeremiah 33, 10 through 11, and 14 through 18. For those of you that are watching, if you want to go to the Bible and read it, you would understand more about the sermon. Okay. Now, we started out with why enemies chastise the chosen people. Now, why? Why does God keep the bad people? And people like my husband, the good people who are servants of the Lord, he lets die. We have an answer. How many people aren't dying? Well. Really? Really? No, I know. Yeah. So we are not talking about the prophet Jeremiah. Jeremiah, unfortunately, had a story that started out with doom. Use the word doom. Doom. Doom. What is, okay, what is the definition? Of doom? Uh-huh. That's a good question, Nancy. I just always use the word. I never pondered the definition of doom. Doom is predicting bad tidings, evil things, despair, brokenness, calamity, collapse. Yeah. Doom. Now, the doom that he was talking about was coming. So it came. And Babylonians came and took control of Israel. There was a rebellion. But at that point, there was no miracles. It got ruined. The Lord did not save them. The Lord did not heal. Right on. But then, what happened? I don't really know what happened. But God came to the mind of this. And he healed people. And praise came to Judah and to Israel. And people were saved. Now, Job, you can't buy God. That's, he is in, God is in the driver's seat. Okay? He runs the show, if you want to say. And sometimes we want that show to get run for us. And for us to get what we pray for. You've got to pray just to make it today. That's why we pray. Pray! Jesus is our Redeemer. Ice, ice baby. And thank God for that. Alright, your turn David.
