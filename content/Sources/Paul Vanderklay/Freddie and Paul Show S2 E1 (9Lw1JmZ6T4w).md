 Welcome to the Freddie and Paul or the Paul and Freddie show. With a lot of debate as to what the name of the show should be. I don't know, it's just what the fans want. If they like the Freddie and Paul show, I guess that's what we'll do. But I'm going to make sure I'm righteous, pure, grateful, and all that great stuff. And all the nine yards. And if you want to see me, I'll be in charge. If I do it like this, and I do it like that, enough to chat, my stuff is fat. Alright, and Nancy's on today. Hi everybody. Nancy is Freddie's mom. And what are we going to talk about today, Fred? Well, the Lakers beat the Clippers. Lakers beat the Clippers. LeBron James plays for the Lakers. LeBron James plays for the Lakers. Rondo, that used to play for the Kings, plays for the Lakers. Oh does he really? I haven't been watching much basketball. So Rondo and LeBron are on the same team. Yeah, and then there's... Oh, the Kings are doing good. Kings are doing good. They're doing exceptional. Yeah, I'd like to see the Kings make the playoffs, because that would be good. That would be good. And I think they deserve it, because they're listening to their coach and corresponding and doing what's right and minding their coach. Minding that's good. I think they can go a long ways if they mind their coach. And if they get the good... If they have... Practice makes perfect, Paul, you know? Practice does make perfect. Ain't that right? Ain't that right, Gordon? We've got Gordon in the audience, we've got Rick in the audience. So we've got hopes for the Kings. Yeah. Hoping they make the playoffs. And then the Giants should be pretty good this year. The Giants should be good. Yeah, because they've got some good rookies. Okay. But I can't remember their names, Paul, but... Okay. But anyway, yeah, I came a long way, man. I appreciate all the prayers and all of the correspondence and the settings and everything was cool that you did that for me and all my fans. I'll probably do one song today and Paul, I think you need to give me some lyrics. Do we have any lyrics? Do we have any lyrics? I don't know. Maybe, maybe I don't have any right here. The bomb of Gilead. Give me a song I can sing. A church song. There is a bomb in Gilead. I don't know that one, Paul. Do a several ones. I don't know. Okay, I'll do Living for Jesus. You do Living for Jesus? You ready? Go right ahead. All right. Lord, Savior, Savior, come I worship you. I love you, Jesus. Amen. Hallelujah. Yeah, I got it rocking. I'm not sure how many songs that was. We started out with one song and then I don't know the second song and I didn't know the third song. We had Lib. We did have Lib. I hope you have fun on your trip, Paul. I really think you'll be a blessing. You can pick me up a shirt that I'll be cool with. I'll look for a shirt for you. But we'll see. And I'll show you a shirt because I like different continents. My mom found my Canada shirt and what was the other people's? No, I just have one Canada shirt. That's right. Anyways, I think your mom wants to say something. I'm hoping for a very safe trip for you. Yes. And may God give you the wisdom and clarity and what you're going to do. What are you going to do? What am I going to do? He's going to minister. I'll just be doing some talk. I'm going to talk about Jordan Peterson and I'm going to be having some meetups and that kind of stuff. Was I too loud? Were you too loud? I don't think you were too loud, Fred. I enjoyed it. I just read his rap. Did you think it was your band like that? Now I got to bust a rhyme. No. Rhyme it. We'll find it. A new state of rap. It's me, Freddie D. I'm hurling over the map. I'll make you clap your hands. It's so your feet because your body is moving to a hip-hop beat. But you can't compete or try to compare. Sucker, you best not stare. I glare. I walk down the red carpet because I'm on the mic like a market. Jesus, it's the right market. You see, he won't do you wrong anyway. He'll be. You see? Okay. Good. I like it. Did you want to say something? You're all done? Go ahead. We're at about five minutes. Basically, we're in the mid season and that's a little bit of what we're going to do. And that's a little bit of what the sermon was about today. Friday's coming, but Sunday's coming too. And so those three days, those things helped us. Jesus paid it all. And then he was risen. Okay, we're going to do the one love. Okay. So two of the Freddie and Paul show. You want to be called Freddie and Paul show? It's up to you. Just tell me. I like Freddie and Paul show better. I kind of got used to that. We'll keep it at that. But we already had episode two of the Freddie and Paul show, so it's got to be like episode 80 or something like that. Because we have lots of them. Or do you want different numbers for the new? We changed it up. New. This is a brand new segment. Brand new segment. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. So two of the Freddie. No, this is episode one of the Freddie and Paul show.
