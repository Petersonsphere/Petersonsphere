 Hi, how's everybody doing now? Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. Yeah, doing pretty good. Doing pretty good? Yeah. Got my hair done. Only cost $4.99. You can't beat that. Can't beat that. I go to the center of play and I go, $5 haircuts. Yeah, pancakes, shuffle. You can get pancakes for five bucks and do the funky chicken. Eeeep. Anyway. Want me on the show, Rog? Oh, it's alright. You gonna pass? So we best come up like that, you know, because I got my purple, you know what I'm saying, for the Kings. And I got my Kings coat because they're gonna be doing good. They got Fox and they got a couple other up and running representatives. Okay. And I'm very pleased to say Bill Walton's son is gonna be the coach. I really don't like the Lakers, Luke Walton. I really don't like the Lakers, but it's okay because he's gonna know what he's doing because he was a good player. He was a good player. Yeah. What's with the voice? I'm being funny right now. Oh, you're being funny right now. Alright. Anyway. How are the Niners? They're doing good, but they played Monday night. Reggie was telling me the Raiders were winning against the other team, so that's good. Okay, okay, okay. But the A's, sorry. They didn't make the playoffs? Sorry, people. No, they were in a wild card. Oh, they got eliminated. Yeah. The Yankees beat the, what you call it, I forgot who they played. Maybe it was the Braves. I don't know. Oh, Oregon beat Berkeley. Okay. That was a good up and coming game. Okay. And I think I said Mute beat Tulsa. Yeah. Okay. I see that. Hi, Gordon. Alright. What was the reason why Gordon can't go out? I didn't want to go out. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe something came up, so. I need to talk to you. Yeah, so. Yeah, we need to talk, Gordon. Alright. So. Anyway. What else going on? I'm going to bust a rhyme and then we'll be done. Okay. Bust a rhyme. Go ahead and talk if you want. I've just been talking all morning. Oh, you're good? Okay. I had Sunday school. Alright, I'll bust a rhyme. You bust a rhyme. Kicking the sock with the rhymes of Duflo. Pastor Paul, not Romeo. He's a manic, a man doing it like Shazam. Coming up real tight on the YouTube man. Doing it like this. Doing it like that. Enough to the chat. My stuff is fat. I bust platinum tracks. Out your speaker. Nine months later they announce me as the preacher. One, two, three. But I can't be the preacher, but I can sit by Paul. Can't you see? I got my purple and my hat down. Looking like this and I do get down. Philip fast. He's got his own Jesus signs. Don't you know? I gotta bust this rhyme. What's up, mom? Can't forget you. Cause you're from the new school and I'm the new dude. I kick hard. I kick right. Don't forget about T. Grizzly cause he's doing out of sight. Yo, it's just like that. And yo, I love this rap. Jesus loves me and that's a fact. That's a fact. How was that? That was good, Fray. That was good. That was funky? That was funky. We're gonna get some comments? I'm sure we'll get some comments. Oh, I had a question, Paul. Cynthia's gotta get back to the copy. Okay, I just wanted to know. CJ told me you get endorsements for doing YouTube. Is that true? Sometimes people get endorsements. Yeah, because he says you get like a hundred looks. You get like maybe ten dollars or something like that. Look at that. It's usually like if a company wanted to sponsor the program, then they would pay you to be on the Freddie and Paul show. Nobody's approached us yet. But you'll let me know if it's like that. If someone approaches me and says, I want to be a sponsor on the Freddie and Paul show, then we do that. Okay, thank you, Paul. Alright, ready? One love. Amen, hallelujah. Thank you, Paul.
