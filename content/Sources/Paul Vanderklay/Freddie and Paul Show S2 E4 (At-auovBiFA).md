 Yes, yes, yes, it's better spontaneous. Welcome to the Freddie and Paul show. Hey Paul. How you doing Fred? I'm good. Good. I'm feeling good. So what's going on? Last week we talked about... The warriors, the warriors, they're good. People ask, you know, hang on, hang on. Last week we talked about looking for housing. You got a little bit of hope this week on a new place, right? A little bit. A little bit? Yeah. So you and Forrest found a place? Yeah, maybe, maybe a place. It's not for sure. Bye Philip. But anyways, but it's looking good. It's looking good. Maybe my friend might come too. Maybe Justin. We've never had Justin on the show. Justin is kind of camera shy. Yeah, yeah. Anyways, so what's going on is that's what would work good. And I saw that the warriors did really good even without Kevin Durant. Yeah, they're gonna... Are they gonna sweep the trailblazers? I don't know. I think the trailblazers are gonna win too and then they're gonna have to play the rest. You know who's got a good team this year? Who? The Bucs. Yes. They've got a good team. I don't know the players. I don't know the players either, but they got a good team. The Milwaukee Bucs. They're playing good. Yeah, so... We need a good team from the A's. How about those... The A's are doing really good. Are they? Yeah, the A's have won three in a row, Paul. Oh, that's pretty good. They got this guy on there named Davis. And he's already got like 30 home runs. So that's pretty good. It's May. How can he have 30 home runs? I don't know. I'm serious. 30. He's just remarkable. He's a good player. I don't know. Anyway, basically what I'm saying is now the sermon was about age is just a number. Really? Yeah. Oh, I must have missed that one. Age is just a number. Right. Well, what else did you hear in the sermon? You were in and out quite a bit during the sermon. Let's not talk about that. Okay. Anyways, I had too much liquid. Anyways, basically what's going on is... Basically what's going on is... That's what I learned, though. I said age is just a number, and treat others the way you want to be treated. And... But you say all my sermons say that. Because it's part of the thing. And Christ is the light of the world. Christ is the light. He's the one that brings this world to a positive tip. Because I'm all about the positive tip, Paul. I like people out there that are... If you pat my back, I'll pat yours. Because I am in a Christian... Okay. Pat. And then basically what I'm saying is... What you said was interesting. And that's just what I got out of it. I said treat others the way we want to be treated. And then age is just a number. And if you ask for help, you might be helped. You didn't remember about the throwing everything into the lake of fire? No. I'm Joel's permanent chef. Alright, Paul, let me do my... You got a wrap? Yeah. What are you going to wrap today? Just to... Take your garbage off. It's not on in that. The table's way over there. Anyways, let me think what I'm going to do. No, I'm not going to do a wrap. We'll just... Really? Yeah, the wrap is the best. You've got to have a wrap in it. Will you take me to give to Walmart then? No, we don't play games that way. I know one, okay. You don't have no money in the way. Yeah, I do. You got more than a dollar? Yes. Then you like dinner. No, I have one dollar, that's all. That's all I need. No, I think you caught one dollar. No, it's not. Alright, we're not going to have a fight over Freddie and Paul show. Okay, no, no. Alright, I'll do a wrap real quick. Alright. Seek ye first the kingdom of God. Ask for rhythm and you will be Todd. Rocking on the mic like Romeo. And when I'm on the microphone, I'm good to go. Jesus Christ is the one that did us right. And yo, I'm not vanilla ice. But I come too. And I come tall. And I love Jesus and that's all. That's a good wrap. Alright. It wouldn't be a show if you didn't have a wrap. Okay. So, alright. I'm just, you know. Anything else? What you got planned for this next week? Nothing. Nothing planned? No. Alright. Let's close the show. The show. One love. Alright. Let's go, Phil.
