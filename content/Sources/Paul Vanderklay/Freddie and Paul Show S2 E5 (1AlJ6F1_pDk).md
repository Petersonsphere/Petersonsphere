 Welcome to the Freddy and Paul show. What's up now? What's happening there buddy? How's things going Fred? I'm doing a little bit better. Special welcome to Fancy Nancy once again on the show. Hi. And how about those Warriors? Love them. Even though they don't have Durant, but guess who's coming back? Who? Our old Altamarte. How do you say that word? Altamarte. Altamarte? Our old player for the Kings. Cousins is coming back for the Warriors. Is that awesome or what? I'm the main source of sports. Cousins, you are a good player. If you want to comment, that's fine. Anyways, leave a comment there. Basically what I'm saying, Durant, they said it's going to be out for four games and then he's coming back, but they can do it without him because they got Curry. It's already going to go four games. Don't interrupt me Paul. Please. I have to remember what I'm going to say. I didn't mean to be out of pocket like that though. Anyways, I am saying that, okay you got Clay Thompson, Steph Curry, Ikka Dhaka, Draymond Green, Boogie Cousins, they call them Boogie because they're Boogies, and Boogie on down, down, down, all the brown. Anyways, I'm happy today. You are happy today. I'm going to go look at a place today. Alright, good. And if everything works out, I'm going to talk to the Consistory and see if we can afford for me to have a private room. Alright, we'll find out. So we'll find out for all those people who have been wondering about me having a place to go. Right now I am an okay place, but they locked the door at night and that gives me the creepers because I can't get out of, I really, really need to get out for some reason. But anyways, I don't know why I'm sharing all this, but it's okay. But anyways, and baseball, the A's won yesterday. You know, last week you said how good the A's were, and then I looked it up. They're in the basement of their division. No, but they do good, they have been doing good, I said, for the last three weeks. That's what I'm saying. I know they're the bottom of the line. So I think they started the season, but they're doing better than the Giants. Are they? Yes, the Giants aren't doing rank good. And I don't know how the Rivercats are doing. How are the Rivercats doing, Mom? I don't know. Oh. Nobody's following the Rivercats. Minor League Baseball. Anyways, I wanted to know how your trip was to Australia. We didn't really, you know, grasp the measures. I mean, explain a day in Australia to the listening fans. A day in Australia. What was a day in Australia? Well, you wake up in the morning and you fight off the crock of the saltwater crocs. You really saw one? Oh, I saw plenty of saltwater crocs. Did it scare you? No, because I was on the other side of a fence. Good. Good. And then you catch a wallaby and you cook it over the fire. What? Heck no, you ain't doing that. Come on. You know, Australia is a lot like California, but they drive on the other side of the road. But you didn't see kangaroos, right? I didn't see kangaroos. You see some hopping? They're mostly laying around. Oh, okay. What about the koala bears? We did see a koala bear. My kids got to hold a koala bear. I got pictures of my kids holding a koala bear. Did you hold one too? I didn't hold the koala. I did pet it though. Oh. But they're pretty slow. They're coming? They're very slow. If they're not all drugged up from eucalyptus leaves, I hear they can be pretty violent with each other. But they won't touch a human though, because they're bigger. We're bigger than them. We're a lot bigger than a koala. Yeah. Not a lot of people are fearing the koala at night. See a gar-shu-su? But the saltwater croc and we couldn't, you know, we were right there on the ocean, but you couldn't go in the water because of the crocs and the jellyfish. You don't want to be in the water anyway. No? I'm not contamination-like. I made Paul laugh. Did you make me laugh? Paul, did you notice I was back in the choir today? I did notice how you were back in the choir today. That is good. I shouldn't have had to go, but you know, that shouldn't have happened to me, what did happen to me. But in a way it made me a better person probably. And I'm okay now and I'm back to myself pretty much, right? I think so. I think you're back to the old Fred. We're doing our show, you're singing with the choir. I just want to do better, you know, do things better. Yeah, I know. But my mind is fine. Mom thinks I'm disabled or something, but I don't think I'm disabled. I think I just have a flaw. We all have flaws. And I learned from my mistakes and everything and stuff like that. Okay, let's hope for the Warriors. Hope for the Warriors. How long have we been going? We've been going, the thing doesn't have a clock. So maybe a quick wrap and then we'll land the plane. You're going to wrap this? Yeah, and Mom's going to sing the chorus and I'm going to sing the chorus. But I want you to wrap it. Yeah, I am. Okay, good. I like it when you wrap the hymns. Okay, beatbox Paul. I don't do that. You go right ahead. You could be the boss. Ricky, you know how to... Okay. No beatbox there, Rich. Alright, alright. I can do this. I got this. You got this, Fred. I got this. I can do it. Alright. Here we go. Let me tear my glasses off so I can read better. When peace like a river attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea bills roll, Whatever my lot doubt hath taught me to say, It is well, it is well, In my soul, in my soul, It is well, my sin, O bliss of this glorious thought, My sin, not in part but whole, Is nailed to the cross and I bear, It no more, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul, it is well, It is my soul, it is well, It is well, with my soul, Through Satan should buffet, Through trials should come, Let this blessed assurance control, That Christ hath regarded my health, Blessed and shed his own blood for my soul, With my soul, it is well, It is well, with my soul. Alright. What number is this? I think this is maybe number five of the season, second season. I think it's number five of season two. Number five, so it'll be about an 81 total since we did it. Yeah, you should probably count that. Number 81. Something like that. Nancy's running off the... I know. Ran right off the show. He didn't even give one love. Out she goes. We're gonna do one love, Mom. Respect the show here, Nancy. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Alright. One love. Amen, hallelujah. Amen, hallelujah. Have a good Memorial Day. Bye, Mom.
