 Welcome back to the Freddie and Paul show. How y'all doing? This is episode 8. Episode 8, we're doing pretty good Paul. We got it going on. We got a lot of viewers. We hope you tune in because your your opinion means a lot and to let us know how we're doing and if you have any ideas of what we need to talk about let Pastor Paul know because he's the man in command. Okay, so we're gonna talk what are we gonna talk about today Fred? We're gonna talk about you can disagree to agree. You mean agree to disagree? Agree to disagree. You agree to disagree. Can you give me an example of what that would be like? Like I say the Raiders are not going to the playoffs. Well, look look at the results. Look how many they've won already. That shows they can go to the playoffs. Remember because you said remember the other day you said that the Broncos were gonna lose to the Raiders. I mean the Broncos were gonna win to the Raiders. Yes, I did say that. And I said the Raiders are gonna win. That's right. And the Raiders who look who won. The Raiders. The Raiders won. So my opinion was something. Yes, that's right. That was a terrible loss of the second hand motion. You were right. I was wrong. No, it's okay. Okay. So give me an example of what two people can agree to disagree about. You can agree on where to go to eat. You can agree on what to watch on TV. Okay. You can agree on what to listen to on the radio. Okay, what should you agree to disagree about? I don't know. Okay. I guess apparently not the Raiders. No, I love the Raiders. So the Raiders are doing good. So that's good. But the 49ers lost. Who did they play again? I don't remember. I don't remember. Oh, Arizona. Arizona won against the 49ers. Arizona's good too. Okay, now we're going to talk about politics. Now we got Trump running now. The election's over. Yes. Trump is, yeah, so I'm saying Trump is running and now he is the president. He's not the president yet. He's the president-elect. Okay, he's the president-elect. So how do you think he's going to do? If he becomes the president, there'll be some pros and some cons on the situation. Okay. In other words, his pros are he treats others the way he wants to be treated. And the cons are if he takes away financial ability for people to have financial aid, we might be not good and he might put up taxes, Paul. I don't think Donald Trump is going to, Donald Trump didn't run on putting up taxes. He ran on reducing taxes. Oh, good. That works then. Right on, brother. Okay, so. We're not done yet. I got to do a rap. Okay, okay. Here comes the rap. All right. Treat others the way you want to be treated. On the microphone every day and every weekend. Doing it right, doing it cool. I got Paul on my side and you know he's a cool dude. One, two, three. You know it's me. The boy they call Freddie D. The white boy. But you know I'll be getting down, G. Because we're rocking like this and rocking like that. Enough chit-a-chat. My show is fat. Show is fat. All right, set us away, Fred. Tune in every Sunday or whenever you can tune in. And this is episode eight, right? This is episode eight. Episode eight. Keep tuning in and we'll have some more topics and some. Let us know how we're doing. And thank you very much. And one, oh, one more thing. I'll let Paul with no problem leave a tip. There was a K-11 Dallas, Texas dollar and a F-6 Atlanta, Georgia dollar. The K-11 was 2013 and you had double eights and double zeros. And the K-11 dollar was double fours and that's it. And then the lady Betty got her tip. And I think we had a good day. We had a good day. And it was very productive. Very productive. And thank you very much. Amen. Hallelujah. Okay. And. We've got to close the show. Okay. And tune in. One Love. One Love. Yay! Yay!
