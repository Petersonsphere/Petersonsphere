 How y'all doing? How you doing Paul? I'm doing good Fred. How you doing? Oh I'm doing tremendous. I'm doing alright. Good. Had the first week of football season this week. My 49ers they did good in preseason. Now they're back in regular season and they won their first game. The Chargers won, the Raiders won, and Dallas won. I didn't like that. They beat the Giants. I don't know how I keep track of this, but I can just... Well what do you have against the Cowboys? They're just the rivals of the... They're the rivals of the 49ers because I used to like Clark, Rice, old school, Joe Montana, and Steve Young, and John Taylor, and who else played for that team? Yeah, that's who I like. Okay, let's see. How'd you do in fantasy football? Who'd you have? I lost. But who'd you have? I have... The football program says I have the best team in the league and I had the lowest score this week of anybody in the league. But which players do you have? I have Jared Goff as my quarterback. I've got Gurley as a running back. I've got Connor from Pittsburgh as a running back. I've got Sony Michelle as a running back. I've got Travis Kelsey. I've got an All-Star team and nobody came up big for me this week, so I lost. Oh, that means I get a good waiver while I play this week. Julio Jones did. Julio Jones didn't do so good and the Falcons didn't do so good. Who has Rivers? The quarterback for the Chargers? I know who has Rivers. Maybe my son Philip. He might have. Maybe you should check with him this week and then Sunday we could talk about how Rivers is doing or whatever. Okay. Okay. Or I could Google it or whatever, you know. I mean, it's cool. It's cool. And the A's... Okay, the Giants lost last night. The A's won. Oh, okay. Okay. The A's won against the Astros. Okay. Okay. And the Tigers lost to the A's last week. So I know Leon likes the Tigers, but I always bring them up because they used to have a real good team. But anyway, we won't go there. I like the Angels too. Okay. Because Mark used to be an Angel of the Outfield. Yeah. Yeah, Mark from church. That's so awesome, man. Yep. Yep. Anyway, I had a question. Okay. This is what I wanted to know. Are my glasses too big or do they look okay? I think your glasses look good. You don't think they're too big? I don't want people to make fun of me. So... I think your glasses look fine. Okay, they're not too big. I don't think they're too big at all. Because if they're any smaller you see out of the side of the lenses, right? Yeah. Yeah. And that doesn't work out right. These are just as big as my old ones. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway. Okay, what else do I want to talk about today? We don't have a sermon review because it's a middle of midweek program. Oh. We don't have your mom here telling us what we should do. So... Yeah. Well, I guess we can end the show. Okay. All right. Nothing else. So we got a sports report and Freddie and I had lunch at Taco Bell. Yeah. And you had a Chalupa with extra sour cream. Right. And I had one of those pocket things. And a taco and a supreme burrito. And cinnamon crispies. And cinnamon crispies. I guess I'll do a rap. All right. Do a rap. What's a man? What's a time a man there was a man named CJ. I give props to him every day. He's just like my brother from another mother. Don't you know? Good to go without a word to say. CJ is like Dr. J. Kicking it once, kicking it twice. We got Pastor Paul and he's always nice. He is a cool brother in command. He loves Jesus Christ and I'll say amen. All right. We'll see you Sunday. All right. Ready? One love. Amen.
