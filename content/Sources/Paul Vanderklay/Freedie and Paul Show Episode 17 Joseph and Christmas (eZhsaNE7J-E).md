 Okay, I just, I just by accident didn't record our whole episode. We did it. So this is episode 17. This is one Sunday from Christmas. And so this is Advent and the sermon today was on who? Joseph. Joseph, Joseph. And, and who was Joseph? Jesus' dad. Jesus, Jesus' father. Jesus' stepfather. Jesus' stepfather. Basically. Yeah, they're gonna laugh about that. And the sermon was Joseph, the angel appears to Joseph in the dream and names him Jesus. Mary named him Jesus. Or was it, or did Joseph name him Jesus? Joseph named him Jesus. The angel says, name him Joseph. Okay, I got it. And that's where you get Emmanuel. Treat others the way you want to be treated and be right. Okay, so when you, so Emmanuel means God with us. God is with us. God is with us. What does that mean to you? What do you think about that? No worries. Just be happy because God's with us and he's got everything handled and everything is good. That's good. Yeah. That's good. That's good. So what kind of things are you gonna do for Christmas, Fred? I'm not sure yet. I'll probably spend some time with my mom and I'll probably just have a good Christmas. And I know Christmas isn't Thanksgiving, but I'll just be thankful for what I got. And I'll be thankful for what I get because it's the thought that counts, not what you get. It's what you make out of it. And be thankful very much for what you get because that is what you should be thankful for. Because Christmas is kind of like Thanksgiving. Some people have ham and some people have turkey. And it's just like Thanksgiving all the time. And it's just a meaningful thing because Emmanuel God is with us. That's right. That's right. That's very good. That's very good. Anything else you want to talk about today, Fred? Anything you have to talk about? No, I just did a lot of talking. I just asked you a couple of questions. I want to know what Christmas meant to you and what kind of things you're doing for Christmas. I thought you said that very well. I think you had a great thing. I think this went very well. So I think this is good. Let me do a rap about... I'll do a rap real quick about... Joseph. Okay. Jesus. I mean Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Yeah. That sounds like a good one. Go for it. Here we go. Here we go. Mary and Joseph made Jesus Jesus. They named him that and that's a fact. My boy Paul's gonna take me to Starbucks. Really though, good to go. On the mic because Jesus Christ is doing alright. Mary and Joseph named him Jesus. Emmanuel, God is with us. Merry Christmas and a ho ho ho. Thank you very much and our show is a fact though. Alright, that's a good one. Alright, so everybody have a Merry Christmas. We might do one next week if Freddie's here. We'll see. I'll try to make it. Alright. Thank you very much. Really? Okay. One love. Thank you very much on Sunday. Alright.
