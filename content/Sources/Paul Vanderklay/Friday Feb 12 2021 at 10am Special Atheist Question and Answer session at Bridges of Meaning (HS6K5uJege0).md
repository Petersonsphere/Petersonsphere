 Hi, this is Paul. I just wanted to do a quick announcement and reminder that tomorrow morning on the bridges of meaning discord server at 10 a.m. Pacific I should probably put now put it in the title. I will be doing pretty much every Friday We have a little question and answer on the bridges of meaning discord server and that's become sort of a tradition Sometimes we do different things with it we've been live streaming it to YouTube lately and that's fine a lot of people are confused because There's a live chat that you can participate in but I don't really take questions from the live chat I pretty much take questions only from the bridges of meaning discord now a couple of weeks ago someone asked can an atheist ask a question and I felt really bad because I Want the bridges of meaning discord server to be something of an estuary where people can come together and talk across some of these lines So I because I get so many questions from Christians I thought it would be good to have a week where I'd ask the Christians to sort of hold back for another week atheists can ask questions any week as well but this would sort of be a special week and again, I'm only taking questions from people either in the voice chat on the server or who have placed a question in Joey made a special little area where you can ask questions. We've got a few questions already in store. Maybe enough I'll try to answer as many as I can if not I can always answer them other week some other week some people ask. Well, what do what do I have to do to qualify for? This well, I think you kind of get the point It's give some people who are perhaps less energetic and aggressive in terms of getting their questions out there so that others who maybe have other questions Get a chance to ask them. So February 12 2021 10 a.m. Pacific It'll be live streamed to YouTube but if you want to get your question asked come over to the bridges of meaning discord server and either ask it live or or Put it in the comments or put it in the question section
