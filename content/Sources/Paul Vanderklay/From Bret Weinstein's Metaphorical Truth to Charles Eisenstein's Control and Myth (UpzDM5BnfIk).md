 Hi, this is Paul. A couple of weeks ago on Twitter I had a little brief exchange with Brett Weinstein. He had tweeted that he'd looked at Rationality Rules video about metaphorical truth and liked it. And I probably unwisely but just sort of reactively tweeted, oh boy. And he responded. And I'm always amazed when some of these six figure Twitter follower people actually look at their at replies. And he said, I don't know, Paul, rationality rule seems on board with metaphorical truth as it relates to religion. I know this is not where you come out, but I wonder if the needed conversation isn't taking place. So this video is in the spirit of continuing that conversation. So Brett can watch it, rationality rules can watch it, anybody can watch it. It's on YouTube. It's there free for the watching. So let's walk through some of this and add some stuff that's been in the conversation lately that I think is super helpful. So his metaphorical truth argument basically goes like this, and I hope I represent it faithfully. That's what I'm trying to do. And he's discussed this on Joe Rogan, the conversations with Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris just recently. He's been doing live streams with his wife and he discussed it briefly in one of those. Usually whenever he talks about it, someone will send me a note or something, say, hey, he talked about metaphorical truth. So I appreciate all the little Twitter. Actually, I've grown to appreciate Twitter. It can be a valuable tool if you don't get caught up in the drama, which is hard to do. And I know I have in the past, but it's valuable because it's linkified, it's brief, and it works fairly well. Anyway, his metaphorical truth argument goes something like this, something that is literally false. This is what he'd call metaphorical truth. And some people don't like the reason that he uses truth there. Something that is literally false but offers an adaptive advantage. And three, I've mostly heard him use three illustrations and I think they're good illustrations. Porky Pie's throwing their quills, they don't. They detach easily and the quills have little barbs on them, a little simple Wikipedia search or YouTube search will show that. So they tend to, they get in you, but they don't actually throw them. Gun safety, double checking to make sure that the gun is, even though you just unloaded the gun and cleaned it or whatever, before you hand it to someone, you always check and make sure there's no bullet in the gun and it won't fire before pointing at someone, so on and so forth. I'm not a good person, so yeah. Boxing Day Tsunami that he uses as an illustration, and we'll look at all three illustrations in this. Religions are filled with beliefs and practices that offer adaptive advantages like these metaphorical truths, even if they're not literally true. And we're gonna deal with this word literally because there are some big issues with it. Now along the way someone had pointed me to the video channel Dark Matter 2525 and he's an illustrator, an illustrator, he's a cartoonist, let's say. And he has a lot of cartoons ripping on religion in the Bible and I know I'm not supposed to enjoy them, but I did. I enjoyed, I thought it's clever. And so here of course you have the Christian God or the Hebrew God or the God of the Bible, however you want to do. He's the guy with the robes and the hair and the beard. And then this particular one you have, you have Saruman. And then you have Jeffrey who's sort of a little angel that flaps by and they have conversations and they talk about passages in the Bible so on and so forth. And this is a channel that again sort of mocks religious people and mocks the Bible and tries to make it seem simply ridiculous, okay. And word of warning, not all religious people are as easily triggered or offended or reactive as others. We're all sort of on a spectrum here. But it's a kind of a good illustration to get at this question of God, capital G, lowercase g, gods, angels, demons, spirits, etc. All right, so these are the kinds of things that certain kinds of atheists will strongly assert do not exist. So let's define some terms. An atheist would say these things don't exist. Some secularists will say that. Non-theists, John Verveckia had a talk on the Awakening from the Meaning Crisis Discord this morning. I had some questions about that. Non-theists are in a little bit different camp and I'd love to see John Verveckia talking in the space a little bit more. Not that he isn't, but I'd love to see him depending on if John wants to of course in some of these conversations. John and I have spoken a number of times. I'm a theist. John is a non-theist and I think we've had a number of really productive conversations and one of the things we're doing in our little corner of the internet as we're sort of calling it is having a lot of I think really productive conversations over some of these lines. Now celebrity atheists will often bring out something called a hyperactive agency detector and in the subtraction story it goes something like this that well we have in us well basically the cautious primate evades the stalking leopard because the bush moves and the primate immediately thinks agency well maybe there's a leopard in the bush and this is an adaptive advantage that has afforded our ancestors the capacity to outlive others who don't have it and this hyperactive agency detector sort of gets its gazes cast up to the sky and so when we see patterns we see movement we see agency and we project agency up into the sky even when there is none all there is is the movement of nature okay that's also not as simple of term as people would like to imagine and if you're been on my channel a while you know we talk about these things. So we're imagining agents in the sky and this affords an adaptive advantage and so what God at what we imagine God or the gods or angels or demons or spirits and all these kinds of things are simply projections of human beings with their hyperactive agency detector and that's how we can account for all of this personification this projection if you'll see the little picture of God here he sort of looks like an old man so on and so forth but today we know better because we know these things don't exist how we know these things don't exist can't really answer that because they're not they don't exist in the way that my cell phone holder exists and well sometimes they pop in and out so on and so forth but the assertion is they don't exist okay fine that's sort of the argument now for those of you who are who have not been following wrong in my voluminous catalog of videos as I think through these things out loud ideas come up as I make videos which is actually why I make them because every video I'll think of something new that I didn't think of even when I planned the video and I want it recorded and I share it and for some strange reason there grateful reason for me there seems to be a small and devoted group of people out there who like thinking along with me and one of the things that I came up with once was sort of group a and group B two types of things in the universe now things in group a are things that are colonizable they're non intentional agents they're they're sometimes dead things like my like my cell phone carrier now panpsychists need not apply to this panpsychism I'm gonna lay it over someplace else because that's a whole another conversation I'm not a panpsychist materialists think the whole universe can be reduced to a long causal chain of these things even living things so anything that we might experience as group B type things colonizing agents intentional agents living things well are really just group a things that have sort of scaled up all right now CS Lewis addresses a number of these issues in his book was written in the 40s so some of it is dated but basically CS Lewis says well that's the whole show that's basically certain kinds of materialists assert all there is is matter and matter is the whole show matter and physics define everything everything can be explained by matter and physics okay and if you want a more detailed description of that read CS Lewis's book miracles and even though some people have read it have said it's challenging because it is a bit philosophical it is written for lay persons and CS Lewis really excelled in trying to make some of these philosophical ideas approachable even if you yourself are not necessarily given to enjoying these things so that's the whole show and in previous videos I talked about the two blaze Pascal the mathematician talked about two spirits in a sense there's the spirit of geometry which is sort of the mathematical mind which is sort of the left brain and dyslexic so I often get these things confused and which is in the Ian McGough Chris idea sort of the the part of the brain that takes that that tries to bring order tries to get things down to propositions tries to get things down into causal relationships that are clean and certain and reliable and then of course there's the right brain which is the kind is the side of the brain that looks at the broad patterns and as Jordan Peterson talked about you've got known and unknown territory okay so we can use some Ian McGill Chris brain mapping on some of this so group B again are these things in the universe that colonize other things on purpose and for purpose for example the creatures that creatures are beings or human beings or whatever label you want to give because all of them are loaded in one way or another so the ones that made the cell stand that could that could mine that could mine I think this is made of some kind of steel it's a little it's a little it might be aluminum I don't know I don't think so but it's but could mine the minerals and shape it and form it and in a sense these minerals these dead things these group a things were colonized by group B things such as human beings and we bring purpose to the conversation we bring intentionality again you might look at Whitehead's famous I didn't put the link in it but see this thing is I think of things while I'm talking Whitehead's famous essays on rationality Alfred North Whitehead many of these things are complex okay and along the way started talking about principalities which are sort of non-physical hard to describe them again principalities Uncle Sam is one of them okay how real is Uncle Sam well Uncle Sam makes you pay your taxes Uncle Sam mobilizes people to do different things and so what we're where we're really gonna stretch in here is okay what what's included in this group things that we call group B and they're fractalicious I like to say because they Uncle Sam is sort of like a human being but you know you can't go anywhere and lay hands on Uncle Sam yet Uncle Sam has power and Uncle Sam has dominion Uncle Sam is sort of like a human being but not exactly like Paul van der Kley doesn't have skin on him sometimes people sometimes people will instantiate Uncle Sam I remember as a kid and 4th of July celebrations someone would come out and there is Uncle Sam Jonathan Peugeot likes to use the example of Santa Claus so you know these are group B type things that are operating in our world so group A are colonizable things and group B are colonizing things and and you'll if you think through these categories you'll see that well there's there's some things going back and forth between these categories now I talked about some of this in the very long my one of my longest videos I've ever done religiosity is the IDW's final frontier and so we're gonna get into this word religious a little bit not too much in this video then we come along this word persons and increasingly this word is getting is a subject of interest for me and you know it's it's sort of interesting how all of these conversations that have been doing and the people that have been following the conversations and engaging in their own conversations how Trinitarian issues arise it's been very interesting so so persons are group B persons are elements of our group B consciously okay so we're not fully conscious but we're consciously and purposive agents I immediately you know want to pick up my cell phone and hold her and I can move it around and I can tap on it I'm doing all these things on purpose and these things some of them have hyperactive agency detectors and they're always on the lookout for threats and again if you look at Jordan Peterson in personality 2017 number 12 when Peterson talks about really the phenomenologists and Heidegger that's really a nice condensation of a lot of Jordan Peterson stuff because he talks about the fact that basically cognitive science or at least what Jordan Peterson is studying makes the makes the observation that we even though we think we see objects objects come relatively late in the perceptual game what we see much more directly are threats and opportunities and objects get colored with those kinds of ideas a simple illustration of this is if I remember when I was a kid I was playing on the school playground and a kickball or something came through the air and hit me in the head and I didn't see it and I didn't duck but if I had seen it I would have flinched but that would not have the conscious mind comes online set a little bit longer in other words built into me are these mechanisms that keep me safe and consciousness comes a little bit later okay so we react we see threats and opportunities before we see objects before we have a lot of cognition about them and in fact Jordans and Jordan will push this further that the truth is when I came into my office this morning if I've used this illustration before too if there were a Bengal tiger in the office I would see that before I would see maybe a statue of gold that was sitting on my desk why because the Bengal tiger would have been immediately perceived as a threat and the statue of gold as an opportunity but I jump back and same with a snake let's say there's a coiled up snake on my office nobody get any idea please I jump back immediately and you people have this all the time I live out in the West in the US and you're you're you're scrambling around you see something you jump back or you know go to YouTube and find the cucumber cat videos you know slide in a cucumber the cat jumps back it's just a cucumber why is the cat a fate of a cucumber well something in the cat makes it interprets it perhaps as a serpent jumps back chimps that are raised as a fun Jordan Peterson illustration chimps that are raised in captivity are afraid of snakes even if they've never seen one and you think what the you know somewhere there was a public service announcement telling chips about the dangers of snakes no stuff is wired into us and the imagination that were somehow these simple rational observers who observe the world science doesn't afford that anymore and actually if you look at the conversations Jordan Peterson had with Sam Harris especially Vancouver one Peterson continues to try to lay this out for Sam and Sam basically either denies it or says it doesn't apply or that's not what he wants to talk about we didn't see the relevance of these little facts for this conversation okay and they're very relevant when we get into this conversation well metaphorical truth so we bring purpose into systems and again Jordan laid this out in Vancouver one and this is it was in Vancouver one towards the end when I saw Jordan Peterson well what God do you believe in and he starts laying out these things and as a classical theist I recognize many of these things that he's talking about there's newfangled attachments to them but they're not unrecognizable for someone who's had a little bit of education in theism Sam Harris as doesn't have an education in theism he says oh that's not God and that's where you get God number one and God number two and go back over my videos and you'll find them or go to the discord server they put together a little glossary and here's the thing these persons we usually approach with the spirit of finesse and you can find lots of YouTube videos about these kinds of things one of my favorites was the dude sitting on the couch and there's a pile of laundry there and he's like well I always put my dirty clothes on the coffee table and they come back folded and clean and of course the wife scowls at him dude you want a little bit of marital advice approach your wife with a spirit of finesse because she's awfully subtle and awfully powerful and if you don't respect her things will go poorly same with a coiled up snake there's not a lot of danger in the old cell phone holders just kind of here but persons and agents we would say that snakes have a degree of agency in them approach them with the spirit of finesse that's the most appropriate way to approach them now to clean up a little bit of anticipated celebrity atheist fodder the god of the Hebrews I'm using a Jewish book here the god of the Hebrews is not like Thor or Zeus that's I know that's a that's kind of a 300 level class here but watch Christine Hayes at Yale lecture about Kaufman's Medi-Divine Realm she lays it out pretty nicely how biblical monotheism is not exactly just a reduction of common polytheism which means that the god of the Hebrews has aspects of the agent and the arena and that if you look at Greek polytheism Babylonian polytheism Egyptian polytheism almost all of these polytheistic systems posit what Christine Christine Hayes professor at Yale if you want a nice secular credential or Ezekiel Kaufman notes are well they're subject to what they call a Medi-Divine Realm the Hebrews don't have this system and once you see this distinction and you read the Hebrew Bible it becomes clear now the Hebrew Bible is complicated and so Ezekiel Kaufman had to write a lot about this but and I by the way a number of you have said that you've wanted to purchase this book the book is out of print and unfortunately I think the people who are watching my videos have raided all the cheap copies so the only ones used that are available are for a lot of money on Amazon so sorry about that it's not mine to you don't really have to read the whole book watch Christine Hayes is just one one-hour YouTube will give you a sense of what Ezekiel Kaufman is saying about all this stuff and a number of people have said well there's a lot more going on and I'm sure there is but to get this point that the god of the Hebrews is not Thor or Zeus is a really important point and something that when celebrity atheists sit down with someone with some knowledge like a Bishop Baron, Roland Williams, people with a little bit of knowledge about Christian theology and history and philosophy will usually very calmly and politely make this point but this is just such a happy point that celebrity atheists can make they just keep making it but it's bogus it misrepresents what the Bible and the Hebrews and the Christians and the Muslims I don't know much about Muslim theology but believe and so cartoons of an old man Michelangelo calling you out buddy I don't think that very famous image of God as an old man is helping the situation the now and maybe sounding like a Dutch Calvinist iconoclast but that that commandment you shall not make a graven image you know to my knowledge Jonathan Peugeot is not going to make an image of God the Father Jesus well Jesus is a different story biblical characters angels sure but what we're referring to with the Hebrew scriptures of God the reason you shouldn't make a representation of God is because it will also be a deduction of what the Hebrew scriptures are talking about and that's why they're even careful about the language they're even careful about the words because they understand that all of these representations are a reduction because of what they're trying to communicate when they're talking about this and so hence my God number one and God number view number two terminology now Adam Frendit has been trolling rationality rules for a while now and now just lately on today on Twitter he's been trolling Bausch but one of the points that Adam continues to make about about the celebrity atheist now Adam considers himself an atheist but he's not an anti-theist Adam thinks religion is good for people why I've not watched as many celebrity atheist videos as a number of you who have watched but I seldom heal here celebrity atheists deal with Durkheim because they want to sort of condemn religion for a list of reasons that they usually trot out but they don't usually contend with Durkheim and this is why this is sort of where Adam fits in because Adam always brings a Durkheimian sensitivity to religion later into his videos and let's read some of these quotations and summaries of Durkheim according to Emil Durkheim all religions divide social life into two spheres the sacred and the profane there's nothing intrinsic about a particular object which makes it sacred now we're gonna you know watch John Verbeckis awakening from the meaning crisis to get into some of these questions about category and he nicely walks through a lot of history in that an object becomes sacred only when the community invests it with that meaning now that's a fairly modernist materialist frame but the reason I bring Durkheim in here is because he shouldn't scare off a lot of materialists or atheists his his arguments are basically atheist safe okay he is looking in many ways he's the father of sociology and he's looking at human beings and thinking about this strange word religion and thinking well what what are we really talking about what from a from a scientific evidentialist perspective when we look at groups of people rather than individuals in their beliefs what kinds of things do we notice religion is an eminently collective thing of 1954 it serves to bind a community together which is something that Adam keeps bringing up again and again a religion is a unified system of belief and practices relative to sacred things that is to say things set apart and forbidden beliefs and practices which unite into a single community called a church or not always a church look at my look at the observations by Robert Putnam and American grace in terms of how religious groups when they come to North America and the United States tend to congregationalize okay so so Durkheim's writing you know a number of years ago but the points are good even if the language is a little outdated all those who adhere all those who adhere to them the believer who has communicated with his god is not merely a man who sees truths of which the unbeliever is ignorant he is a man who is stronger he feels within him more force wither to endure the trials of existence and to conquer them here's something that Jordan Peterson could have written okay because even though I don't hear Peterson talk about Durkheim a whole lot don't do what makes you weak do what makes you strong and so there's some alignment there thus there is something eternal in religion which is destined to survive all the particular symbols which religious thought has succeeded to envelop them there can be no society which does not feel the need of upholding and reaffirming at regular intervals the collective sentiments and the collective ideas which make its unity and its personality in other words even if you take all of these things that we associate as being religious irreligious people that want to group will do many of the same things that religious people have done but substitute different symbols for them and this is something that a lot of honest atheists have been noting for a while now that when people give up their religious things that are associated with religious formal religions organized religions traditional religions however you mention them they begin picking up other ideas and they act religiously okay and lately in my videos I've been spending a lot of time getting at that because there's some issues we have to work through and now in a sense as societies get more secular things other things come in that people begin to act religiously about just on twitter a minute ago i was having some conversation with Esther and some others that in fact people who denounce purity culture very quickly wind up setting up purity cultures of their own over different sacred things and and we're finding this with me too with a whole bunch of things that have sort of triggered responses that well you know me too about Donald Trump well what about Joe Biden and Tara Reid is it is it is it is it valid on and on and on and on you can go and and what you find is that people keep tripping over these things now I've been finding and I made the comment on twitter today that it's interesting that it seems easier to understand this kind of thing if you do the kind of symbolic thinking that Jonathan Peugeot has been promoting things seem these kinds of dynamics seem to make more sense if you approach them symbolically rather than sort of linguistic rationally it because you find these these sort of inversion moments and what Jonathan tends to be able to do is say well here's here's here's an image that kind of sets at the heart of it and you can see how this image has two sides and two faces you can see that the conservative youth who are the rebels become the authoritarian adults who abide no rebels and and those who are most pronounced about sexual liberty very quickly create their own purity cultures around and you begin to look at them and think you are just denouncing purity culture but the thing you're setting up looks an awfully looks a lot like a new purity culture and we've seen this with you know in my conversation with James Lindsay really turned me on to the idea that what happened with celebrity atheists is sort of there there was a division in there some of those following them sort of went to the mythopoetic Jordan Peterson strain others took the branch towards more social justice warrior stuff well why well I would argue that there's meaning in both directions and it's sort of the weakness of Jordan Peterson's meaning as an internal gyroscope um and and I think in some ways this follows yes thank you for you who sent me this book lots of people send me books now can't keep up with them but the gift is nice um I haven't read it yet man search for ultimate meaning and so Viktor Frankl who of course endured the the terrors of Nazi death camps founded a psychological school that invited people to find meaning and pursue your meaning so you know Jordan Peterson exploded on the scene but many have noted that well there's some Viktor Frankl in there there's some Joseph Campbell in there there's obviously a lot of Jung in there there's excuse me there's Solzhenitsyn there's Jordan Peterson is using and he'll name those names fairly regularly uh Nietzsche um Piaget again watch his class lectures they're really good and there's a reason he um you know he deserved the attention that that he got so again back to my main point of this slide Adam Frenz trolls rationality rules and the other anti-theist by basically saying um Durkheim are you really going to talk about religion and not talk about Durkheim and those who have followed him like Jonathan Haidt religion is the mechanism by which communities cooperate in order to compete and prevail over their ones and Adam and I talked about Adam posed the bold hypothesis that Nazi Germany failed lost world war two because their society was deficient was deficient in its now he didn't say religiosity but in its worldview um it kept tripping over some of the core tenets I would argue of Nazi of Nazi ideology but go back and look at my some of the videos I've done on the Nazis up your resolution read someone like Timothy Snyder and know that they weren't just racists there's stuff beneath Nazi ideology assertions a lot of it's social Darwinianism okay um so religion in the broadest sense of the word and the platform upon which their political philosophy and behavior was formed uh the last monologue video I did Monday I released Monday talked about how there's religious language and there's political language and one of the things that we're I'm continuing to work on is upping the resolution on the dynamic interchange between politics and religion or very interesting new one for me progress and religion thanks to Eric Weinstein and Russ on Ross Douthat and and I noted that Brett has been talking some of these same things okay back to Brett yeah if my videos take a little while to unfold they're not three three minute things people on the discord server the bridges of meaning discord server are trying to figure out how to make Paul VanderKlay a little bit more saleable and little bite-sized chunks of my stuff so that the learning curve isn't so dramatic and this is something John Vervake and I have in common okay what are my issues about this word literal literally true I understand the term I understand the turn of phrase has some real difficulties in because because well what kind of picture are we conjuring up when we think about this well I'd say usually what people mean are a limited variable non-complex causal relationship that is reasonably transparent to empirical investigation and reproducibility in other words the kinds of things that science is really good at figuring out how do you know whether or not a porcupine throws its quills well you get a porcupine and you study the porcupine and you learn that even though if you brush up against it that quill might get caught in your hand and maybe cause an infection didn't really throw the quill but that rumor that metaphorical truth of throwing the quill keeps people safe same thing with the gun these are things we can predict and even sometimes reproduce depending on the kind of thing and the point I'm making here is that the kinds of things that we imagine this label literally true can be pasted onto is limited in fact it's scarily limited all right and usually we're thinking about in terms of association and so we say well it's not literally true that a porcupine can throw its quills true I would argue that it's not physically true and now we're sort of dialing up the resolution and saying okay well laws of physics at least the laws that we know and we're talking about the physical space so it is physically true that porcupines the best of our knowledge according to all the porcupines that we've known and studied and they don't throw their quills they just really easy to get stuck in people who try to do things or animals that try to eat them okay it's a defense mechanism gun safety it's it's really important metaphorically true but not physically true that you indulge in this useful fiction that always double check a gun before you point it at anyone or so on and so forth and I'm sure someone in Hollywood who works on this kind of stuff could run me through all the stuff that goes on behind the scenes for all these cop shows because they have people specially trained and certified to handle these kinds of things because they're very dangerous and of course a good conversation that I had talked about in the scene to leave and risk management into all of these things okay but let's look at the boxing day tsunami case because the assertion is that it's not literally true that spirits are moving the water that's not a claim science can make science there's no limited variable non-complex causal relationship that is reasonably transparent to empirical investigations and reproducible in a case like that that you can't know you're going to have to be agnostic you might say I don't believe it that's fine no or not know about any of these imagined causative spiritual forces these are matters of assertion not science and I think most honest scientists will at least say well there's no evidence one way or the other so we can't weigh in I'm willing to live in that little space and we're going to talk about spirits a little bit more the traditional belief system but here's an assertion for you the traditional belief system outperformed the scientific belief system in terms of delivering predictability and survival adaptation to the culture all right so let's imagine there's these little tribes of people that have this idea about the spirits and the waters and all of that and then there's these other people that don't share that belief system well a lot of people drown there but none of these people that's the point of the illustration it's metaphorically true that the spirits move the waters okay I can live with that it's metaphorically true now when you go say it's not literally true now you're saying more than you know at best you can say we can't talk about the spirits we'll only talk about the metaphorical truth so in a sense in that room we'll talk about this but the spirits probably won't show up in court okay and so here in the west we have these ideas about public space private space you can talk about metaphorical truth and private space public space well you might have legislation about practices with respect to guns you might have legislation with respect to physical things taught in classrooms I'm not a I'm not a culture warrior on a bunch of these prayer and public school things never have been so I'm willing to talk about those different those distinctions it's not my area of specialty but I do want to note that if the purpose of the story whether it's your scientific story tectonic plates or your religious cultural story spirits moving in the waters one outperformed the other according to the purpose of the story who chose the purpose of the story like it's really hard because we're not thinking in those terms very often but science cannot address spirits but the traditional story outperformed the secular story if the goal of the story was to provide well provide for the welfare of those who inhabit the story and I want to bring in a little John Vervecki here he has his 50 episode hour-long series awakening from the meaning crisis some of those episodes are return watch episodes for me and of one of them 26 and 27 are of awakening from the meaning crisis problem formulation and in 26 he sort of pivots from history of philosophy into cognitive science and he talks about what a problem is and I found this terrifically helpful and the longer that since I've watched these videos the more it ruminates in my head and that's sort of how I think okay that's a really helpful thing for me to think through so then I go back to the videos and I rewatch you have your initial state in your goal state how do you get from one to the other now of course cognitive science sort of came up along with computing and robotics and artificial intelligence and all of these things because people have goals group b things have goals snakes have goals animals have goals does a tsunami have a goal so we have group a and group b so you have the initial state in the goal state the goal state now purpose is embedded in that idea because you're trying to get to this goal on purpose is man is a manifest image thing and we're going to be talking about wilfred cellars ideas of the scientific image in the manifest image and look at daniel bonavax instructional video on that which is often linked to a lot of mine it'll be linked on this one too and i'll mention a little bit later so goal states are purpose of things they're things of group b okay they're chosen by group b type things all right and it could be a bird looking to nest and so finding the right things and why do crows you know pick up shiny things so on and so forth there's there's some purpose going on in there and so these are group b type things now between the initial state and the goal state there are path constraints maybe if you want to get rid of covet 19 and you notice that there's alcohol in hand sanitizers and you know that there's alcohol and vodka maybe if you drink vodka it'll kill the covet in your body just like the alcohol in the hand sanitizer will kill the virus kill is the virus alive will deal with the virus on your hand true or not true well these are these path constraints drinking a lot of alcohol might help you forget the pandemic lockdown but it probably won't do much for your health if you look at saturday night live cold open graduation yeah you know what i'm talking about so path constraints and when it comes to medicine there are a whole lot of path constraints yeah you can give people stuff that'll kill the virus and it will kill them so doctors and the scientific community spend a great deal of time and money working on these path constraints how can we get rid of the virus and not get rid of the host all right combinatorial explosiveness and vervecky illustrates that there where actually the world is enormously complex and things start getting explosive very easily when you start trying things and so it's not the case that we just try everything sort of like the mythic idea of thomas edison thomas edison tried a lot of things to make the light bulb but he didn't try everything okay so and so what we do is we narrow things down and that's what happens with our cognition we narrow things down and so when we think well what can i take to maybe fight the virus vodka no maybe vitamin d maybe i should go out in the sun maybe maybe maybe so again we're dealing with some of these things but we're talking about general intelligence for general problem solving this is where consciousness comes in because consciousness is able to be aware of path constraints on the fly all right and this is where training and culture and of course brent talks about we have these two tracks and i think that's a terrific way to talk about it we have the genetic track and then we have the culture track and the culture track is really helpful in limiting the big world down and saying well alcohol maybe uh now maybe eat an orange or drink some vitamin d milk that might be even better than than the vodka you might you know try use the vodka on your skin but down your gullet not so much with the coven consciousness is able to be aware of path constraints on the fly as they emerge because the world is too massive and we are too small to know in advance and so well these kinds of things work these other kinds of things again look at verveckis categorization and we do these things and of course he walks through this stuff with in his course about cognitive science let's get back to this funny word spirit now you know what this word means and because i'm a pastor i grew a sensitivity because i'm working with people in church and we get high resolution with these kinds of things and people would often kind of lob the well that's a spiritual thing and eventually i begin to become a bit of a nudge with people say well what do you mean by that word spirit and i find people don't know what they mean by that word spirit well do a little bit more thinking you do a little bit of historical reading and you find we kind of know what this word means and we kind of know it like a lot of people know it well remember we had group a and group b spirits are kind of group b these are causal agencies beneath or behind the material world we observe now again if you go back to some of the earlier talks with vervecki he talks about aristotle and a formal cause i don't know it gets a little philosophical no adam doesn't like philosophy but but you get into the thing that says well well how is this formed the way it is now we wouldn't say there's nothing too terribly spiritual behind it unless we started talking about why all of a sudden americans need cell phone holders some spiritual going on beyond that it's an owen barfield again a name that comes up probably not often enough in my videos gets into these questions about spirit and when he makes the observation that he's got these ideas about evolution of consciousness anybody who reads even let's say the greek new testament or the hebra scriptures ruach notes that spirit and wind are the same word that's kind of funny why would spirit and wind be the same word in english we wouldn't be in danger of getting these words confused unless we were speaking terribly poetically speaking terribly poetically but right there in the new testament any first year seminary student learning greek for the first time if your seminary still church in greek which it should begins to notice why does wind and spirit and then maybe go over to john three and notice that jesus actually talks about them at the same time and differentiates the sense of them even though they're the same words in greek and we all sort of know what he's talking about just like the wind the spirit and in the english bibles it'll be two separate words but not in the greek the spirit blows where it wills you see what it does in the world but you don't see it you don't see wind you only see what the wind blows now this sunday's pentacost so i'll be thinking about these things so and this is this idea of spirit is still lurking beneath our common use of the word and once you become aware of it and you begin to realize the importance of this you start hearing it it's the salience thing you know like when i bought a subaru i began to notice how many other blue subarus there were on the road didn't notice it before i bought a blue subaru then i noticed it well once you start to realize this funny thing about this word spirit well we use it all the time and atheists use it all the time and non-theists use it all the time and people use it all the time even when they're trying to debunk christianity and things like this so read c.s lewis's the discarded image there was well aristotle's the spheres and all of this stuff that the medieval sort of translated down from the classical period and this image has been discarded and lewis will note rightfully so but a lot was lost when we lost this and a lot of our language built around this and so as brett weinstein will say we have a lot of legacy code here and here's the thing with legacy code um so there's a guy in my church who's looking for a job and he's not looking for a job in this but he noted that he's about my age and when i was going to college people studying computer science studied cobalt a lot of systems still use cobalt these old systems that are still out there in the world and people don't necessarily want to replace these systems or recode all of this because the stuff still works and that of course keeps dos lurking under windows and so on and so forth so all this legacy code is built in now you might say well abandon this legacy code you're gonna have to abandon the english language because you're not gonna get rid of this stuff it's not going anywhere and in fact it's still useful if you begin to think about it illustration of this i bet you the celebrity atheist never paused a moment when they thought about school spirit and they would be hard pressed to think of a new word besides spirit when they're talking about the thing they're talking about when they're talking about school spirit now the beauty of this now i'm a pastor so i engage and try to engage in metaphors that are broadly understood culturally because ideal pastor i'm a generalist i deal with broad groups of people not just people who can make it into college but people who work with their hands and people who've never been to college and people who are mentally disabled and people who are all levels of people that's what i work with because i'm a pastor let's think about school spirit why do we use that word that way well let's ask a bunch of questions is school spirit something we control i think a lot of high school principals and teachers would love to imagine they control school spirit but they'd readily admit that they don't is it something we influence yeah you have pep rallies you decorate the school in such a way you in fact architecturally design the school in such a way as to impact school spirit when you look at when you start making a list of all the kinds of things that influence school spirit well you can be working on that list for a very long time indeed and every single school will have different components of this idea of school spirit that influences it and yet we use this word spirit it's not something we control it is something we influence is it something we participate in oh yes we certainly do and so the stewards of school spirit whether they be the class president or the principal or the teacher or the parents or the police commissioner will do things in order to participate in and move it in the now values are creeping in we're in the manifest image right direction you're not going to talk about the right direction in the scientific image is it something that moves people and changes behavior absolutely that's why school administrators and principals and teachers and parents and students are all very interested in school spirit and why they devote money to it and why they devote time to it and why it's an item of concern for them because go to a school with a healthy there's another metaphor school spirit and students will be blessed by that could be for their lifelong go to a school in which the school spirit is unhealthy it's a tough thing one of the things that formed young clive staples lewis's life was he went to schools that had an unhealthy school spirit and we're not exactly sure the kinds of sexual molestation that were allowed and practiced in those schools but school spirit was a very bad thing for c.s lewis and he very much wanted out of some of those schools that he was subjected to is this something that that can be deeply consequential for individuals absolutely i think almost any of us if we sat down and we thought long enough about our life path or maybe sat down with a with a good psychologist would start talking about the schools we went to and the spirits that formed and shaped us for better or for worse more often for both formed and shaped us for better or for worse more often for both marshall mitchell is a woman in my church she is in her 80s she's an african-american woman who grew up in the deep south and during jim crowe the state of louisiana was undergoing some heat about well board versus you know brown versus board of education separate is not equal i'm undergoing some heat because of this and so the state of louisiana decided to build a model school for negroes and she went to this school and she learned horticulture and marshall mitchell sometimes my kids would have an assignment from their school that they had to find an older african-american person and listen to their stories and marshall's a great storyteller and so marshall will tell her stories and marshall eventually went on to become one of the first african-american school principals in the sacramento area she's members of two churches even you're not supposed to do that she's a bolton secretary here she's um she's an amazing woman she was shaped by that model jim crowe school and having conversations with marshall about jim crowe is a very high resolution thing to do but school spirit shaped her in very complex ways is school spirit alive that's kind of a hard question is school spirit a person that's kind of a hard question now it's easy to say no and no but the longer you work on these things the tougher these questions get is school spirit part of group b spirit versus tectonic plates you have two models of language and conceptualization both have advantages and disadvantages advantages of our scientific model are obvious to many of us today it's a powerful model okay and its power makes its value obvious to us the disadvantages of those models were exposed by the loss of life in that tsunami what are the advantages of the traditional religious model it's clearly durable through many generations even rather impervious to secular systems i'm sure there were a number of people who were holding that model who were quite cross-pressured by secularity disenchantment whichever way you want to talk about it but in the back of their minds had the spirit stories working and thought better safe than sorry run to high ground and were saved by it afterwards might not have been so quick to dismiss these stories there's a model and a system there that proved dramatically durable and reliable that proved dramatically durable and reliable secular systems notwithstanding the secular system was less able to save than the traditional religious system you see part of that power of that old religious cultural spiritual system was that it was embedded within story and embedded in a worldview that afforded meaning community survivability ecology of practice a bunch of the terms that i can use of verveckis religion that isn't a religion that he's working towards and it endured for many generations in fact it obviously afforded a survivability advantage which is why brett weinstein picked up on it and it exposed the weaknesses of the scientific model the scientific model is very young the scientific model is not well storified the scientific model is very expensive what i mean by that year after year people were formed and shaped by the spiritual model very easily very commonly very inexpensively school is expensive school pulls you out of life in really good conversation between benjamin voice and brett weinstein brett was complaining about schools a lot of what brett was complaining about the alternative system has and brett knows this he's well traveled in the developing world but we the scientific secular people with all of the power on display from our systems have been a little blind to the power of these traditional systems and i wouldn't count these systems out just like well look around chernobyl see how fast the weeds started to uproot the modernist architecture and cement slabs i hate to sound like morpheus or maybe i don't hate to but uh morpheus makes the point to neo in the matrix that you have been groomed that's usually religious people groom their children two tracks remember everybody's groomed everybody's set up everybody's educated and for the best of intentions often here's this powerful system that we wish to train our children in but as brett noted to benjamin voice well actually i had this conversation with my wife a couple days there was this pass along going on in facebook and someone made the comment about those born in 1900 look at the suffering they saw i was talking to my wife about that she made the comment that her grandmother was born in 1900 my grandparents born in like 1903 1905 her grandmother was born in 1900 her brain her grandmother knew she was really good in a garden so were my grandparents her grandmother knew how to make her own clothes her grandmother knew how to can stuff because the garden produces all kinds of stuff at one time and you're gonna have to eat that throughout the year so you're gonna can her grandfather built houses i don't know how to build a house her grandfather and her grandmother you know when the when stuff goes down here they're awful good pandemic buddies because they got skills and you know what by the time i was born in the 60s my parents didn't teach me canning my father my father wasn't real good at some of this stuff my father was an intellectual my father was a preacher we differentiate in society my grandfather now he was good at gardening because during the middle of the depression when a lot of those churches couldn't pay him cash they'd give him a part of a hog they survived off their garden which isn't very different from the kinds of Haitians i worked with in the hills of the Dominican Republic who got a little bit of money from picking coffee or cutting sugarcane but they ate their garden and sold the extras i'm not a good gardener why not it's not the skill set that i've been i'm living in this tiny little narrow slice of history and and my formation has afforded me and disabled me things because of it so how do we evaluate the relative strengths or weaknesses of these systems that are in competition in some ways with each other and i talk i'm thinking about the illusory momentary debunking detection because you've been groomed to hear some of these stories and say there's not an old man in the sky we are circling around the earth and the space station has not seen any is that really christianity has taught it's what a lot of christians believe and christians are a little fuzzy on it and that's no surprise to me i'm neck deep in christians all the time i've got a pretty good idea of what they do and don't know how well or well not they've been formed the ways that this society has formed them and truth be told many christians i bump into carry more ideas from hollywood producers and writers than they do from bible studies and bible and in any given church any given pastor could say these people know their stuff and these people are just kind of coasting along but their community is affording them some things and they have other things to offer the community we all have our place and are doing our thing but this little debunking trick that goes on if you know a little bit more it's kind of a cheap trick but it takes a little bit of work to undo the debunking well scientific models are tremendously powerful but possess some clear disadvantages compared to traditional religious spiritual models scientific models are equally metaphorical i can put that in a tweet scientific models are equally metaphorical tectonic plates so look up the word tectonic tectonics from latin techno um technocus from ancient greek technocus oh my the latins borrowed it from the greeks borrowed a lot of things from the greeks pertaining to building that's what we're talking about the process that controls the structure and properties of the earth's crust and evolution through time please tell me any of those words that are not metaphorical in dealing with the things themselves and here's the thing what is the thing itself now you've got combinatorial explosion because in fact to isolate it now you have the category problem what's the category problem watch vervecky he'll tell you what the category problem is a lot better than i will that in fact there's this enormous metaphorical model that talk about tectonic plates what like dinner plates no they're like these flat things that's why we picked the word and some scientist that was looking at these things had a gestalt moment built on the metaphorical world he listened tectonic plates and i'm sure if you go back over the science people had other names for these things and this one stuck why because it sticks in with the rest of the language that we're embedded in it's that other cultural track that's going through the system your scientific model science it's all metaphor boys and girls it's all metaphor you're not going to get away from it at all truth do a little word on do a little study on that word do a little study on almost any word this is where you go all the way back to the jordan peterson stuff we act things out before we can speak them logos all the stuff jordan peterson raised is connected here but he said something about pronouns and we lose our minds come on people we can do better than this scientific models appear highly subject to cost corruption corrosion and decay and we see this we lose scientific type thinking we lose procedural thinking i can't do what my grandfather did now i know some things my grandfather didn't i can do some things my grandfather couldn't do i work on a computer i work on a smartphone my grandfather could garden and again i really appreciate what brett weinstein said to benjamin voice go to a youtube channel learn how to garden here's the thing why are schools shaped the way they are and brett was complaining about schools and rightfully so and again i've made this point in previous videos i have nothing but esteem for brett and the reason he went to evergreen to evergreen what is it is it uh evergreen state university if that's whatever college i don't know which it is he understood some of this stuff and he wanted to form students professors where does that word come from why a hundred years ago did some school still today demand that professors profess religious belief read george marsden's book on the story of well why theology was the queen of the sciences a hundred plus years ago religious spiritual models are better suited to human group psychology more durable that's why there are so many of them and that's why thorough growing atheists are always a minority takes a lot to be one so congratulations but i'm afraid from a darwinian perspective from an evolutionary perspective unless we decide to cull those who can't handle it you'll always be the elite so if you find some comfort in that there you go you'll make lots of money doing it too then i had a conversation with my friend brett oops i still have the porcelain that's two two t's in that brett and i met brett when the publisher i publishers sending me books now because my channel gives some people a little bump in their book that i'm not telling publishers to send me books he had more books sent to me than i can read brett wrote this little book on transubstantiation which was like oh wow oh really educated me a lot in terms of some of that theology and history and philosophy and i found brett to be a really good conversation partner so he's been on the channel a few times and it's going well i'm sure he'll be on again he wanted to talk about conspiracy thinking like so then he and i started to talk about conspiracy thinking and he was quite he was kind of more of the pastor he was very practical about this is how we'll help our people not think in this way and i immediately began to think i was watching rebel wisdom and began to think oh these these connections go long and deep there's a lot to think about here and the more i talked to brett the more i realized there's a lot to think about here this conversation really got me thinking about agency community motivation and durability within the scientific frame the scientific frame or image always imagines itself durable because it's public and open you know water keeps freezing more or less at the same temperature more or less the speed of light is within certain variables big g gravity is within certain variables again i go back to rupert sheldrake saying why if these are constants do we need an organization that tracks them boy that's a scary question we don't see what we have our pretenses of a monarchical vision there's another little vander clay ism what is the monarchical vision well it's the view from nowhere it's the imagination that we can see the world as it is it's biased towards imagining we see objects and not threats and opportunities it's a particular way of thinking now this is something that scientists strive to achieve in order to inform knowledge sort of like odin they pluck out one eye and they see only with the scientific image and that's a very powerful thing but what philosophers are beginning to realize is taking out the subjective means certain blind spots in our view of the world and you have to put it back in if you want to see the rest of the world and so in brent and heather's 16th dark hold podcast livestream again someone very after he says stuff people i got a lot of overlapping constituency here people send it right to me brent was talking about conspiracy theory so of course i gotta go and listen trying to use scientific tools and language and brent's trying to clean up some of this stuff and i thought it was helpful but again now let's pay attention to our biases he is a scientist and so he's using these scientific tools trying to sort of smuggle them into the manifest image and say well maybe this can improve our language now that's fair because science is always smuggling the manifest image and tectonic plates you mean like dinner plates so there's a lot of smuggling going back and forth but if there's jesus smuggling one way there's scientific image smuggling the other way a lot and you kind of have to pay attention to spot it and you kind of have to have an idea of wilfred cellars and this grand distinction he offered and it's you know all models are false some models are helpful and figure out what are we what are we missing here when it comes to massively complex systems you're living when it comes to massively complex systems you're living in massively multi-variable interplays mitigated by statistical analysis what do i mean by that horribly written thing that i should have proof read and i didn't catch it when i did that's what we're living in massively complex massively multi-variable when it comes down to me the question will i die if i get covet 19 i don't believe i've had it will i die if i get it an honest doctor will say i don't know and what's he gonna look at statistics okay uh diabetes no blood pressure not on any blood pressure medication but always tends a little high in my family try and keep it down with diet and exercise um lung stuff all seems good uh age mid-50s um they'll put a little number as to whether i would die well how about viral load well how where are you working very quickly the the variables come streaming in and there are many many many many many variables to try to answer and predict predicting is a big deal here predict in the future if covet 19 will take me out and if someone wants to run the math well they got asked me a lot of questions now while we know that some things about the virus and some binary ways of killing it on surfaces and avoiding droplets yada yada yada bleach wash your hands wear a mask on and on even the question of morbidity is complex so someone goes into the hospital and dies of and dies of coronavirus and gets tallied that way well why well because they went into the hospital and they had these symptoms and they died of it what about age well yeah they were older what about diabetes yeah they had diabetes why did they have diabetes well now suddenly the multivariables stream in was their family history of diabetes how much coke did they drink huh how many sugary beverages did they put down how large were the serving sizes how many times a week yada yada yada yada yada yada were they a smoker were they killed by covet or by the cigarettes they smoked or by the cola they drank or by how often they went to mcdonald's or by how often they sat in a chair and talked at a computer and lived a sedentary lifestyle because people are demanding more hours of video to fill up their little days it's multivariable and the scientific tools are really cool but pay attention to what we're doing when we're using them we're in a sense sort of remember back in the old days and i am old enough so i remember and maybe someone on a tv show would meet a hollywood director and they do something like this you know let me try and do it oh yeah make a little square oh look around well what are they doing when they do that they're limiting the field of view and saying well if it's just covet or if it's just diabetes or if it's diabetes plus covet or if it's diabetes now we're going to branch out family history and lifestyle choices and very quickly the combinatorial explosion just boom so what killed them everything why do we focus on coven well relevance realization again go back to vervecky relevance realization well the covet was relevant and i agree but notice the limitations and notice the science and the manifest image now lucky for us we're in the middle of a salient massive multiplayer pandemic simulation it's a good time to talk and think about these things because it's all pretty salient to us okay i'm going to throw another line on you myth is the jpeg is a jpeg of being well why is that well stron who i'm giving a little bit more fame to all the time he's the one that put me onto the vervecky stuff um he sent me an article which was a clipping from charles eisenstein's work and i bumped into his blog before and i've read his stuff good writer good thinker and then i noticed he's been on rebel wisdom a couple times and son of a gun if david fuller isn't posting videos that are just sort of keeping track with mine why would that be what spirit is at work behind the scenes so two popular blog posts asking penetrating questions about the whole frame the first one about control an epidemic of control and the second one about myth or agency which will be very relevant to what we're doing he makes the point in the first article coronation in the face of world hunger addiction autoimmunity suicide and ecological collapse we have all these problems taking killing hundreds of thousands of people or millions of people a year and now suddenly covet comes along and stop heaven and earth get the planes out of the sky stop going everywhere we're going to lock down because we're going to stop this thing why why this why now he wrote this back in march i'm not saying it's a bad thing it's just a question it's a good question why all this why now why don't we stop all this stuff for all these other threats that we know well that's because there's nothing external against which to fight nuance that a little bit but important point our go-to crisis response all of which are some version of control aren't very effective in addressing these conditions well covet might be killing people because we didn't stop them from aging we didn't fix their diabetes we didn't stop the well behavioral thing maybe they had a bad childhood so they eat at mcdonald's i don't know we didn't stop it we can't it's too granular our go-to response of all of which is some version of control aren't very effective in addressing these conditions now along comes a contagious epidemic and finally we spring into action it is a crisis for which control works quarantines lockdown isolation hand washing control of movement control of information control of our bodies hey i've been locked down just like everybody else i come to my little office well i've been making so videos i can't do house calls now because most of the people i do house calls with i shouldn't visit they shouldn't be opening the door so here i am making videos for all y'all that makes covet a convenient receptacle for our incho-cate fears a place to channel our growing sense of helplessness and the face of the changes over making overtaking the world covet 19 is a threat that we know how to meet gavin newson kept saying that we're going to meet this moment we're going to meet this moment well there we go this is a threat we know how to meet unlike so many of the other threats covet 19 offers a plan our civilizations established institutions are increasingly helpless to meet the challenges of our time how they welcome a challenge that they can finally meet and a life-threatening challenge i'm not a skeptic here and he was accused of being a skeptic because of this but he's just asking the questions how eager they are to embrace it as a paramount crisis how naturally their systems of information management select for the most alarming portrayals of it how easily the public joins the panic embracing a threat that the authorities can handle as a proxy for the various unspeakable threats that they cannot today most of our challenges no longer succumb to force our antibiotics and surgery fail to meet the surging health crisis of auto-immunity addiction and obesity our guns and bombs built to conquer armies are useless to evase to have to erase hatred abroad or keep domestic violence out of our homes our police and prisons cannot heal the breeding conditions of crime our pesticides cannot restore ruined soil covet 19 recalls the good old days when the challenges of infectious diseases succumb to modern medicine and hygiene at the same time as the nazi succumbed to the war machine and nature itself succumbed and so it seemed to technological conquest and improvement it recalls the days when our weapons worked and the world seemed indeed to be improving with each technology of control notice how quickly people went into war language when the pandemic happened and yeah the pandemic has killed more people in the vietnam war more americans if again all the other things we've talked about what kind of problem succumbs to domination and control the kind caused by something from the outside something other capital o when the cause of the problem is something intimate to ourselves like homelessness or inequality addiction or obesity there's nothing to war against we've tried the war on drugs the war on poverty we tried those and guess what poverty won drugs won now we're still fighting those wars but for the most part we lost when the cause of the problem is something intimate to us we may try to install an enemy blaming for example the billionaires vatamir vladimir putin or the devil but we miss key information which is the ground condition that allows billionaires or viruses to replicate in the first place if there's one thing our civilization is good at it is fighting an enemy we welcome opportunities to do what we are good at which prove the validity of our technology systems and worldviews and so we manufacture enemies how do we manufacture them what did we do when we locked down what did people immediately begin to think like religion they thought religiously what they began to use was their very capable imaginative abilities to begin to imagine is there covid on this surface do i need to wipe it down that person looks scary they might have covid why because they don't look real good because they're poor or homeless or you know we got to immediately got to do something with the homeless well i think all the guys sleeping out here are bathed in sunlight doing social distance all the time i'm not sure these guys are really covid threats out here although they're pretty scroungy and there's feces around and they're drinking a lot of alcohol which isn't helping but there it is i don't think they're covid but all those triggers we begin to think religiously and we respond according to all of these things built into these systems from a very long time ago thus we single out covid as as a call to arms reorganizing society as if for a war effort while treating as normal the possibility of nuclear armageddon ecological collapse and five million children starving because covid seems to justify so many on the totalitarian wish list uh-oh there are those who believe it to be a deliberate power play it is not my purpose to advance that theory nor to debunk it although i will offer some meta level comments and he does read the article but notice how it was just a medical emergency triggered something else in us what where did we get this machinery why are we thinking about covid and we sort of do we talk about it this way and if we're talking about it this way we're thinking about it this way we kind of personalize personify the virus don't we watch your language control obscures the massive work on pathway restraints we normally do it obscures the jpegging we are always doing with the acceptance of coca-cola obesity mcdonald's heart attacks and the fallenness now we're into religious language of the world and our agency detectors are going off like mad if you know anything about religion it should be no surprise but then suddenly well we're going to try and make everybody into a copyright scientist tom holland in an unbelievable broadcast with an australian theologian and an anglican cleric and justin briarley basically said i can't believe the way the churches are responding to this they're just out there giving medical advice now you can go to my channel and see what i've been saying i've been giving medical advice too but point well taken tom holland what's going on here now suddenly we're going to correct everybody's thinking by making them all scientists day late in a dollar short baby conspiracy thinking is engaged and it's not going away our agency detectors are going off and we're trying to figure out agency and that's exactly where charles gets things right so now a second video with david i'll play a clip and i'll do some commenting on that the most persuasive explanation that i've heard of that kind of the institutional decay that i think has happened to a lot of our institutions we put out a film with with eric weinstein talking about how since the 1980s what a lot of these institutions have done have effectively once you politicize an institution you take it away from its main from its main function now when i talked about the cost corruption decay of these scientific models these scientific models are depending because they're highly they're highly costly they're they're very unnatural they're a very different way of thinking and they're very powerful i can don't get me wrong i'm not doubting them but they decay quickly because they're built on these institutions and what rebel wisdom and eric weinstein and brett weinstein are talking about the whole idw is their concern that the underpinnings of these institutions are eroding and this is this sort of then becomes the nexus between the religious institutions that brought us through the centuries to here and tom holland's concern that well when the religious underpinnings this and again my last video when this one religious layer which is under the political layer which is which is under the the institutional layer that is that is spending all the money to keep these institutions going does it all collapse at once it's a scary question especially when she no that religious layer that's that's nothing you're going to start with politics that's not promising no we'll start with science but how much how expensive how enduring is that model really you get people jockeying for hierarchy within it for reasons other than that they're good at doing the thing that an institution is is designed for i think there's some sense see that this is actually an interesting parallel because i think that's that's the felt sense that i think a lot of people are picking up and that's why i think that's what i think the metaphorical truth of a lot of the conspiracy like the overarching conspiracy narratives are is that we are interesting use of that phrase right there we have some very very deeply corrupt fragile hollow systems and you look for example i look at the wire david simon's the wire which he called a meditation on the death of america where he looked at like what happens to the police force when you're basically just trying to meet the stats rather than to do your job the parallels between the police and the drug gangs you get trapped in these systems of incentive structures and essentially and then he looked at the media he looked at teaching he looked at all of these different systems and said they're all kind of being hollowed out at the same time and my sense is my sense is that this is what people are picking up on a real felt sense level something in other words contra this i'm gonna learn how to say this word this caricature caricature i gotta look at this word up i didn't plan on saying this word that the rationalist celebrity atheist would like to promote that we sort of sit back with our monarchical vision and then we make rational decisions about how we operate and every time they talk that way i think have you met a human being do you know how we are do you know have you have you read thinking fast and slow have you seen all the ways we fool ourselves and this is how we are is deeply off in society and it's not too it's not too big a leap to say okay well who is doing this and who is who is gaining from this i totally resonate with that that the conspiracy myth comes from a very authentic accurate perception that we got that word authentic oh boy what what words what words are we not using when we say that word our institutions have betrayed us that they're not serving their declared interests that they have a secret agenda that they are the okay and that's really interesting that our institutions have betrayed us they're not serving their declared interests well what's their declared interest well for the government it's supposed to be the welfare of the people but that's tricky welfare do all the people does any given policy thing affect everyone the same or are some people and i mean this is this is what we're dealing with and why is it that we imagine that the the the government is for the welfare of all the people well that idea because if you look at you know ancient if you look at ancient empires well kind of the whole country is for the welfare of the pharaoh and they say that's the way it's supposed to be i had a conversation with gore dr gordon menzies he's an oxford trained economist who's written this book on western fundamentalism it says well guess what these westerners they all believe in democracy free markets and sexual liberty those are our fundamentals presuppositions it's what they are and here we've been formed to imagine it's the job of government to what life liberty and the pursuit of happiness okay enlightenment that's cool where did the enlightenment come from keep drawing the things back puppets of something trade us so our agency detectors go off things aren't going well and we're looking for someone to blame that they're not serving their declared interests they have a secret agenda that they are the puppets of something personally i don't think that that that they are the puppets of a group of evil conspirators i think it's more accurate to say that they're the puppets of a paradigm of a mythology puppets of a principality a puppets of something that sort of like school spirit we it's controlling us it's a lot bigger than the spirit of whatever little high school you're going to but that actually does scale up to the district because there's commonalities there and to the city and the state and the nation and the world and the zeitgeist and you know these things scale up but what i love about what charles eisenstein does here is he's able to basically within secular terms for people say hey there's agencies above us that are operating that sort of like school spirit we participate in we don't really control people are trying their best to control it there's propaganda there's marketing there's money there's government there's there's police there's laws are trying like crazy to control it we don't control it what is it well myth yeah myth it's because you don't know enough religious language it's a principality that's probably a better word for it it's it's something akin to santa claus or uncle sam or all kinds of things or greeks would greeks and and polytheists would have all kinds of words for it because it's spirits of of a set of interests of a system of an economic system of an ideology of control you know this is what i wrote about in the other essay you know that that civilization defines progress as the increase in our ability to impose control upon the world bingo because one of the things i've been following the eric weinstein ross douthat peter teal and then when benjamin boys talked to brett weinstein brett kept talking about progress and as someone who does a little bit of thinking about these world views it's like tell me of this progress how will you know it when you see it and and brett's done some real thinking and talking about that that's been helpful to me but what did he just say because he said something really important about progress and the increase in the rest an ideology of control you know this is what i wrote about in the other essay you know that that civilization defines progress as the increase in our ability to impose control upon the world progress by the increase of our ability to impose control around the world so it was progress the again read age of read um alchemy of air sometime great book so it was progress when we figured out we who's we um when the germans figured out how to fix a night to fix nitrogen from the air so now suddenly you didn't have to go down to south america for all that guano you could get it right out of the air and oh by the way you're going to upset the nitrogen cycle all these algae brooms all that runoff through the mississippi river all that potent stuff we put back in the soil because we take it out of it all that nitrogen that came out of the air that can be used for the music for the munitions of two world wars in the 20th century progress is our ability to control now anybody thinking about this not too long will say hey wait a minute we thought well libertarians say control ought to be located at the level of the individual oh okay um others who are socialist what control ought to be control is best and safest towards what end best and safest located in the hands of well-meaning government officials well maybe we'll throw in the enlightenment there consent of the governed or playdoh the philosopher king or or this progress is not so easily discerned now we might be able to recognize that my my current cell phone that has a snapdraiding snapdragon um 8 55 in it is better than the cell phone that i had that had a snapdragon 8 20 in it because it runs a little faster and so on and so forth but as we scan these are tiny little things there i can find progress there but was it really progress to ditch the horse and wagon for the internal combustion engine well that's kind of depends on when you're standing and what you're paying attention to and was it really progress to move from glass containers to plastic plastic don't break when you drop them plastic or lighter you use fewer fossil fuels to transport them yada yada yada progress is something that's really hard to know especially when and i think he's right here we tend to measure progress as the degree to which we have control who's we what kind of control this is going some scary places no wonder our agency detectors are going off and to control the other to control matter to control society to control the other to control matter this is a and i hate using this word but i'm using it correctly i believe this is a spiritual question because what matters is see the reason i hate using that word is because most of you heard it wrong when i used it this is the thing behind the scenes that is controlling the other or the matter or everything else nine times out of ten when someone comes to me because they have a relationship problem what is it i can't control my husband i can't control my child i can't control my mother oh so in other words the best thing would be control well you can kill them because that's about the ultimate control we have over other human beings what we really want to do is colonize them and turn them into our robots and switch them from group b over to group a so they become simply matter and again go back to verveky aristotle matter what is that word matter comes comes from wood because you can make wood into a cup or a spoon or a ship or a chair or a chair or a table it bends to our wills of group b things so no wonder everybody's agency detectors are going off they should be going off and now maybe we'll ask some deeper harder questions about well what is metaphorical truth is there any other kind of truth that we actually colonize or can appropriate what is myth what is spirit what's really going on control the barbarians the terrorists control the ability that civilization defines progress as the increase in our ability to impose control upon the world and to control the other to control matter to control society to control the barbarians the terrorists the weeds the bugs the bacteria etc etc so if we are immersed in that worldview then we're going to it's going to look like something is coordinating everybody toward a goal of more and more control or if you have say like more mundane if you have a system that's set up a medical research system that is funded at bottom in large part by pharmaceutical corporations who make money by patenting drugs then you're going to have a lot of money available to study patentable things and you're going to have and that money will have infused the entire system so that if you're a graduate student looking for a good research project those will be the ones that are available and that'll be the kind of learning that will be applicable to something that advances your career so it's not that you know you're in the pay of nefarious powers and you're this venal corrupt fake scientist who's just in it for the money it's like that's the whole cast of the system like i don't want to say that conspiracies never happen i mean they suppress information like that happens look at vioxx so i'm i'm not like being pollyanna here and saying oh they would never ever do something that corrupt go back to my conversation with brett sockel well genesis 3 it's a conspiracy it's a conspiracy story why do why why are there so many conspiracy stories because it's built into the fabric of seeing the world as subject to spirit say well i'll go the other way and i'll just see the world as we're going to get to that way because that's the alternative and you're going to be less happy with that way they do things that corrupt i think that that but i think more often it's unconscious and systemic which means that you'll never solve the problem by removing the bad factors in other words and he says this nicely in his essays oh what oh would it be that some bad actor that somehow bill gates who after he made all those billions could think of nothing better to do than start the gates foundation and get try and address things like malaria and poverty that's a sure sign of a bad actor but he started this because bill gates wants to run the world and bill gates had enough money to run a good bit of the world if he wanted to but i don't think that that's driving it what happens is that we participate think about school spirit again we participate unwittingly let's say you're a kid in school and something bad happens and you're pissed off and you you break a drinking fountain okay and let's say the school doesn't have much budget and that drinking fountain stays broken for two or three weeks every time everybody walks down that hall they see that broken drinking fountain and suddenly that broken drinking fountain and the inability to address school spirit begins to lower the spirit of the school lots of stuff go into this we don't control it we certainly participate in it it certainly shapes us do we have the language where can we find the language to actually the language and the practices to actually engage in these issues yeah my friend peter i think he said something like becoming a we all have to become conspiracy theorists as some kind of initiation that it's part of a kind of world initiation like and we have to obviously we have to question consensus reality and i think those of us who've been in sort of what you we don't have a better word than spiritual it's exactly the right word it's exactly the right word why that word it's the only word communities to kind of to go with that but those of us who've been in those kind of communities questioning consensus reality is is such an important part of that an awakening to something deeper and awakening to some deeper sense of what humanity is and what our potentials are but then i guess the struggle the difficulty is not to collapse into another fixed narrative on the other side of that awakening which is what i've seen a lot of can happen very easily once we've had those experiences we can have a kind of shattering of an old worldview but what we often do is we reform an equally solid worldview around some new material that then just kind of it's part of the same problem in a way well now the thing is we have to do this that's the process and go back and look at my videos about transformation it's the process where you can't just take it all apart and leave it apart you have to live and so you now we're back into the hero's journey now we're back into jordan peterson where you take it apart and all these metaphors you go into the underworld and you try and figure out and you re-emerge transformed but then you realize that your new worldview also needs addressing because well it's always being needs to be calibrated by all the data you're getting so back down you go and you keep doing this rather than allowing ourselves to remain open to uncertainty and open to you can't remain always open you have a left and a right hemisphere and they're both playing their parts and in fact it's okay i'm more fancy vervekey words it's opponent processing it's back and forth back and forth chaos order it's it's this process by which we continue to learn and grow and recalibrate and renew and grow and discover it's an important process and we want communities that can facilitate this and we want a fair amount of openness but it can't be just open there needs to be structure because the world is too complex not only in the physical world around us but in the thought world and so you're always building on other systems that have done a lot of the things for you and of course science does that too does it all the time but again go back to the the bit about the the scarf in my last video that karen was wearing that if something wrong gets early on in the stitching the pattern is wrong you're gonna pull it all out you gotta re-put it together the journey totally and often that new worldview is actually the old worldview in coded form it's just a different form of the same thing now who's not believing in progress well maybe sometimes it is progress maybe sometimes it is in progress how are you going to know we have greater degrees of control now many people when they undergo this change in fact are looking for great greater degrees of control uh alcoholics people that something has happened in their life that their life is no longer sustainable in that new way and they have to go and find a new way of well so part of that again control itself isn't the enemy it's just having the right control not too much control and again triggering all the jordan peterson stuff there's problems all around here but we're looking for the right way forward and the real initiation or like maybe i'll say another stage of the initiation is you you you go from the default consensus reality to uh you know a conspiracy theory or a cult you know it could be anything that's that's the receiving room for people who have left the old story and then you're like actually that's not working either like that has some of the same limitations and so you go to another one another one and that process is the is is it's a series of stepping stones into the unknown who says your life is not a story and you're not following a hero's journey or have we just been simply programmed by that way well where did that programming come from i'll watch my videos about story and reality and my recent sermons about this into the place of being comfortable with uncertainty and looking at the parts of you that that that you've kept at bay by offering them certainty what comes up when you allow yourself to be in uncertainty and here's the thing you need to be solid enough to actually engage with uncertainty because when you get overwhelmed by uncertainty well then you're no longer you it needs to be both there needs to be a solid core and variable in order to face the change but what is that core where does it come from hence what's the secret sacred self that well that's sort of a what is that agnosticism i mean how can we find our way through these things when you allow yourself not to know that and that requires undoing some pretty deep programming in our school system for example you're rewarded for knowing you're rewarded for producing the correct answer not knowing is that's that's a new habit and we have an entire scientific ideology that says that that humanity is converging closer and closer to the literal objective truth that we are approaching a theory of everything of the universe and a technological system that that says once we order and affix a number to each object in the world and each person in the world we should convert everything into data then we will be able to whose we whose we do rationally and optimally manage because here's the thing because the world is so full of people we want to do this to other people he's back to the other who are back to the same process remember and now he's debunking it but he's showing the process this world so this this prejudice toward knowing and the punishments we've received for not knowing these these constitute a deep programming that really takes some courage and some community to undo to be okay with maybe nobody knows and it's okay not to know for a while i really like that charles because it it seems that that's one of the failure conditions right now of politics of journalism of all these different areas is this people who are claiming to know things like this air of certainty that everyone seems to be coming in with and it's just falling apart it's just being obviously challenged because especially under the influence or impact of so much novelty that we're seeing with the pandemic anyone who's in a public any kind of public role who is claiming certainty and they sort of claim certainty like a kind of defensive posture everyone is starting to see through that now and it feels like that particular mentality is is what we're seeing being tested to destruction right now i think that's a very good point the difficulty is you don't want anthony fauci coming on tv and saying i don't know what do you know and what don't you know so again this is a common thing that people like well it's all the certainty that's the problem it's the dogma that's the problem well no it's figuring out what you know and what you don't know and where those things lie and now i'm saying now science is really helpful helping you to know some things but that stuff is embedded in a whole bunch more not knowing now it's the affectation like i come from from sort of traditional media and i think that more than anything is what people pick up on and really distrust is this sense of the voice from nowhere this sense of instant expertise on a subject that probably the journalist has just started researching that morning all of those things like that air of defensive certainty just seems to be something that's being that that to me is like right at the core of what's being undermined and dissolving right now yeah especially when it comes from the elites from from you know people with in positions of social authority because i think with very very good reason over the last few decades people have been in growing distrust of the elites and of their arrogance you know if if our society has had continued to improve okay pay attention now we're talking progress again improve how would we measure this improvement but but we have a sense of it but you know again we're back in this weird space where we kind of know improvement we kind of but but it's and again our minds are sort of these i have this capacity to to look at multiple variables and to kind of weigh it we often get it wrong but we have a sense of it but there we are you know had continued to improve you know from the post-world war two era then maybe we would trust our elites if if uh you know the ecology of the planet were healing and getting better if social inequality were improving if um if again now notice this list now here's the thing i i often hear well the problem is dogma talk to gordon menzies he says everybody's dogmatic everybody's dogmatic everybody's dogmatic about some things you have to be there needs to be something in order for there to be uncertainty about something else you can't have just uncertainty you can't have just certainty you have to understand where we're at uh people's psychological health were improving if people's physical health were improving if our social ills were dwindling for the last 30 years we would probably trust our elites and their pronouncements of what is good for us our social ills but none of these things have been happening instead we've seen growing inequality growing insecurity growing psychological distress he's not talking to stephen pinker is he depression anxiety declining health autoimmunity this sounds like verveke's meaning crisis um addiction no no so so somebody comes and says listen to us we have your best interests at heart and we know what we're doing our lived experience does not confirm that in the way that it might have in 1965 we're still dealing with the middle of the 20th century now david's going to sound like he listened to my last video but he didn't have the chance because i posted that on monday i think it's i think it's essentially important to recognize where we are thinking in religious terms ah see he's understanding something about the religious mode of speech versus the political mode of speech because um charles has been talking about all of these big things and it's like well that's that's the religious mode of speech isn't it that's that's beneath the political and how frequently we're we're thinking in religious kind of mythological language because my my sense is with with the most again we come to this problem with with terminology but when i'm thinking about kind of all-encompassing conspiracy theories for example david ike talks about a murderous cult who are running everything you have the q anon and the cabal like those for me feel qualitatively whatever the word is the sort of all-encompassing religious narrative they're in on this side of it what i find really fascinating a little skeptical about the religious i'm not sure where he's going with this i should have seen it about those is that even though you could argue that there's very dark material in there there's kind of the idea of sort of um evil evil cult evil small groups of people they're actually rapture ideologies because they're saying if only we could expose this defined group of people then the better world is just the other side of that if we could only only kind of overthrow the cabal if we could only expose this evil cult and it could happen today it could happen tomorrow utopia is at hand he's about to say something here which i'm gonna have to comment on but and what he's about to say here is that boy this is a this is a this is a christianist pattern that we're seeing now of course now you're talking theology in my level of converse and i'd say well we could have a very interesting conversation about that particular pattern as to whether or not and now we're into the weeds in terms of competing schools of christian theology like the deep christian roots of a world view like that i think have to be really made explicit and and so you can say oh these are deeply christian we gotta do something else because everything but christianity thank you seen for and david was in my church and david and ollie recorded a worship service at livingstone so he is not anti-christian okay let me say that but the point here is that and i think it's similar to tom holland's point and maybe these guys should get tom holland on because i'd like you know david you know grew up in in a church like many people in the west and you know david has had the journey that he's had but you know the point here is that there's been actually what david's really pointing to is dispensationalism but my channel isn't fundamentally about picking fights with other christians about the poor ways they read the bible most of you wouldn't want to wouldn't care to sit down and listen to that all day for what it is um because i i'd like if only the world was that simple if only it was that easy to to achieve utopia right and if you sit down and you ask yourself to say okay what would be the world done right well watch the good place upload west world we don't we don't even have any confidence we can do that anyway watch the whole thing it's only 35 minutes and it's a both both charles eisenstein is worth listening to and both of those essays are outstanding and the interviews with david are outstanding and it's good stuff so agency detecting where we're our expectations change and readjust our suspicions of what we're really talking when we're talking about conspiracy what is a conspiracy now a little bit later in the article on the conspiracy myth charles tells this story the british scientist rupert sheldrake told me about a talk he gave to a group of scientists who were working on animal behavior to a prestigious british university he was talking about his research on dogs that know when their owners are coming home another telepathic phenomena in domestic animals the talk was received with a kind of polite silence but in the following breaks all six of the senior scientists who were present at the seminar came to him one by one and when they were sure no one else was listening told him they had all experiences all had had experiences of this kind with their own animals and that they were convinced that telepathy was a real phenomenon but that they could not talk about they could not talk to their colleagues about this because they they were all so because they could not talk to their colleagues about this because they were all so straight when sheldrake realized that all six had told him the same thing he said to them why don't you guys come out of the closet what closet are you in come out of the closet you'd all have so much more fun and be so much more honest and probably help in terms of progress now some of you thinking he's gone off the woo end i'm still a dutch calvinist okay but pay attention he said that when he gives talks to scientific institutions they are nearly always the scientists who approach him afterwards telling him they've had personal experiences that convince them of the reality of the psychic or the spiritual phenomena but they can't discuss it with their colleagues for fear of being weird for fear of losing status look at my last week sermon about stories i told a story about a young man and a visitation and a oracle and reed mcbeth i mean in this in this secular principality we lose status by saying what we know that's called corruption that's just sort of like so jenitzen it's tyranny and jordan peterson's crime was being honest and that's why sam harris got the heebie jeebies around jordan peterson because he wasn't following the script this was not a deliberate conspiracy to suppress psychic phenomena there wasn't a cabal of scientists reinforcing them but they understood that something some spirit is in the air that is manifesting itself in the silence of these scientists and rupert sheldrake who has decided he was willing to suffer all of the loss of status that has gone along with the choices that he's made these six scientists didn't convene beforehand and decide to suppress information they knew was real they kept their opinions to themselves because of the norms of their subculture the basic paradigms that delimited science and the very real threat to damage of their careers the persecution and calumny directed at sheldrake himself demonstrates what happens to a scientist who is outspoken in his descent from official scientific reality searching youtube the ted talk of rupert sheldrake that was never allowed it's there he can watch it it's a great talk do i agree with everything no i'm not a scientist i haven't read rupert sheldrake's book but i've come across him enough but what they're pointing to is exactly what we're talking about what happens to a scientist who is outspoken in his descent from official scientific reality what happened to brent weinstein and his descent from the totalitarianism at evergreen state that benjamin voice has documented this is how people work now someone of you may say well that's not supernatural and i'd say do a little research on that category too maybe look at brent weinstein talking to alistair mcgraft about that cali category alistair mcgraft who has advanced degrees in both theology and science supernatural what do you mean by that word well okay let's push that word aside let's keep using that word spiritual so we might still say that a conspiracy is a foot but its perpetrator is a culture a system a story i would say a spirit a principality a power though some of you know the bible say that a story i would say a spirit a principality a power though some of you know the bible say he's using pauline language yeah i am culture system story acting as group b can a story act like a person is a story a spirit can it colonize you oh yeah can it inhabit you can it possess you and again by the way this sunday is pentacost and you might wonder that's one of those weird christian things that we don't celebrate we do christmas we do easter new years kind of gets adopted by christians even though it's not really in the christian calendar but pentacost wasn't that the jewish festival of wasn't that the jewish festival of booths and then and then there was like tongues and flames and and interpret and and people understanding language thing and jesus peters stands up and preaches a sermon but it's a line of demarcation that suddenly an entire group of disciples got something that they didn't get not too many days before and they got it all at once and it's sort of like me and david fuller are barking up the same tree and david's a busy guy i don't think he's watching all my videos if any and i haven't always kept up on everything rebel wisdom puts out i'm just little old me and i spend so much talking to this computer i don't have unlimited time to listen but here we are what are these things we're talking about watch jordan peterson politics religion and the intellectual light web where michael and carren talk about basically what jordan peterson talks about in personality and permutations 2017 personality 12 phenomenology heidegger binswanger and boss if you got time for only one jordan peterson video watch that one it's really good it's really helpful eisenstein goes on a call to humility have you ever noticed that events seem to organize themselves to validate the story you told about the world bias oh yeah blue subarus oh yeah but more than that the selection bias and confirmation bias explains some of that and i think something weirder is at work as well when we enter into deep faith or deep paranoia it seems as if that state attracts confirmation events confirmatory events to it yeah it does reality organizes itself to match our stories why would that be watch peterson personality 12 you get allergic to supernaturally stuff you get allergic to supernaturally stuff he's got some from below arguments that can shed light on it in a sense this is a conspiracy just not one perpetrated by humankind that might be a third truth that the conspiracy myth harbors the presence of an organizing intelligence behind the events of our lives now this morning i did and i hope the recording went right because i thought the question and answer session was outstanding a number of you have been asking for question and answer sessions and i put a call out on the patreon and not too many no questions got answered i haven't checked it recently i don't know if anybody did i decided i was just going to do it with these discords and so i was on the awakening from the meaning crisis discord not the bridges of meaning discord where i sort of call my discord home but the so so don't feel like i'm cheating on you all you bridges of meaning peeps but the awakening from the meaning crisis thing and i did question and answer there and it was really an outstanding question and answer but john vervecky and i are sort of working out this problem from both ends i'm working on person because i'm a theist he's working on non-person because he's a non-theist but we're both sort of moving towards the middle and saying what kind of organizing intelligent behind the scenes might this be and it gets more interesting because what kinds of things not only maybe influence me to see the world in a different way that's what karen and michael were talking about with respect to change your values you'll change your world that's what jordan peterson was saying but whenever jordan peterson was asked not by sam harris backing him down on stage about the resurrection he'd say you know i don't know well why don't you know because i don't really know how high this stuff may go so yeah stay open stay open the world is a bit more plastic than we imagine now there's a lot of scientific image smuggling and again here's daniel bonovac's excellent little lecture on wilfred cellar's work on the manifest and the scientific image every smuggler operates within the manifest image even if they're trying to smuggle in the scientific image we live in the manifest image that's where our persons act that's where the choosing we do that's why every time i hear someone saying we are going to control the world well part of the meaning crisis is because we've deconstructed ourselves and we are part of the whole show and we are part of well if i'm just well now you're smack in the middle of a meaning crisis the manifest image is where ought functions the scientific image is where is functions but the amount of experiments that we can do science with is small and very cautious compared to the amount of decisions we have to do in our lives and the world is for that reason very spiritual humans employ the scientific image science says not science doesn't say anything science doesn't talk humans use science they wield it they employ it so it's always nested in the manifest image you cannot see science itself without seeing it thomas nagel it's where philosophy has bumped into consciousness that's why panpsychism another trying that as a way around it as humans employ the scientific image to figure out how to solve problems go back to verveki but that goal state that's part of the manifest image you're not going to get there from science science isn't going to tell you how to get through jordan peterson's cornfield science will give you options well there's a bear in that part of the cornfield or there's a statistical likelihood of meeting a snake there but again the world is big and so we use statistics and all kinds of things to whittle it down but then we develop if you try to nest the scientific image or as the manifest image in the scientific image you get to sam adams and that's why i call him patch and if there ever was a conversation that demonstrated why or what he does it was his conversation with brent weinstein it was manifest in his conversation with jordan peterson but why couldn't brett get anywhere with sam he just switches one eye to the other scientific image manifest image scientific image manifest image but he doesn't know he's doing it that's why on one hand he's out there preaching with all of his heart to give up religion but on the other hand saying you have no agency just enjoy the movie well you know what a lot of movies really stink and life is really hard for a lot of people and then you die not a lot of movie enjoyment well you can do tricks note you're doing it's the manifest image you just keep switching your eye patch back and forth you're going to have to try to learn how to see out of both eyes instead of developing this patch amnesia so which is nested in which if the manifest image is nested in the scientific image if the manifest image is nested in the scientific image you're stuck in a sam harris movie and you're going to have a meaning crisis if the scientific image is nested in the manifest image you'll be seeing persons all the way up so i got asked a question actually today and again i hope to i hope to be able to publish this question and answer from the awakening from the meaning crisis discord well paul is well i actually realized that i asked this question in previous video is personhood detection merely the perceptual limit of our pattern recognition could be could be but now let's read a little theology and a little historical theology i've been reading hans borsma's heavenly participation because school spirit is not something we control but we participate in it and it's moving the world in ways that we're not controlling and it seems all of our efforts to find control are always thwarted humans appropriate all truth metaphorically and manage it personally so i have to if i have to put my answer to brett and steven wolford into a tweet there it is humans appropriate all truth metaphorically and manage it personally this has actually a long history which is detailed and laid out in the theology and philosophy of the west hans borsma lays it out here indeed this is one side of the coin of analogy there's a kind of similarity between god and the world god number one the whole earth is full of his glory but the coin has another side as well the doctrine of analogy does not just argue for similarity it also insists insists on infinite difference between creator and creature now if you believe that you're the product of a material world then it's your creator and your creature you can't appropriate truth any other way than metaphorically and manage it personally that's your box in fact this similarity is the main point of the doctrine of analogy and this is what brett sockeld ran through with me although there's a certain similarity between the way god is good and the way creation is good nonetheless an infinite difference difference remains and never decreases not even slightly between the goodness of god and the goodness of creation therefore the fourth ladder in council 1215 insisted that between the creator and the creature so great a likeness cannot be noted cannot be noted without the necessity of noting a greater dissimilarity between them in other words we always fall short and again go ahead substitute be a pantheist of sorts and substitute the world plus information daniel dennett gives away the show and unbelievable and nobody calls him on it it the doctrine of analogy basically claimed that the connection between creation and creature is merely sacramental in other words when we see the tree move we're understanding spirit yes creation truly participates in its eternal chrono christological anchor but this participation is strictly a gift of grace and in no way erases the creator creature distinction all right a little bit of theology for you but if you want more theology and philosophy like that i recommend hans borsma's heavenly participation but again these are theologians dealing with stuff and a lot of people are allergic to that but what they're finding and this is what david fuller is bumping into they're they're digging and asking what's below politics it's religion it's religion that's why you go down to the religious language and well persons all the way up that's what jonathan peugeot says we cannot help but respond as if there is a group b and even sam harris has to agree to this we need to live as if there is a group b even if sam you're locked into your whole show materialism that c.s lewis dealt with in the 1940s we cannot help but respond as if there is a group b above us and this terrifies us and the best expression of this i got from eric weinstein who said it's better if there is no god because if there is a god you have to worry about what's on his mind that is the terror of unbelief and what motivates it and why jesse ventura says well christians grip on to religion because they're scared yeah but guess what guess who else grips on to irreligion because they're scared christians are scared that maybe the world is just chaos and they don't matter and so religion addresses their meaning crisis but atheists grab onto atheism because what if there is somebody on the other end of the line c.s lewis read his quotes about pantheism what if god is a lover a husband a hunter what if he does know us each by name what if he does have a plan for our life and that plan includes pandemic and cancer and disability and racism and discrimination and all sorts of things that are miserable about this world and what if our lives are short and ugly and brutish that's terrifying can we know that god has our best interest at heart well i'd have to move my patch over and put on my preacher face and so well there's rough drafts on this channel and my church channel on the other channel but that's the question of philosophy and religious history what is that spirit we are dealing with and spirit is the best word we have even if you don't believe in god something's moving the trees watch lost something's moving the trees and it's awfully big and we're awfully small and our agency detector is going off maybe it's there for a reason maybe we look at what's the spirit that is dominating the scientific establishment in the university that brett is complaining about or the government or ross douthat talks about the stagnation of government and why nothing can move the only way to relate to it is as if it's a person now again in my conversation with john vervecki he says that's not you're not proving ontologically that that's true and i will concede that but i also then in a sense present the ontological argument the ontological argument says and sort of c.s lewis's argument from desire it's an awfully sad world if that spirit moving the world isn't good and better than us and better than we can imagine you know i'd say well maybe that's wishful thinking maybe it is but i wish i had a little more money when the pandemic came around and i got a stimulus check from the donald how about that so you know what there we are there we are why am i not impressed with oh i just lost my powerpoint why am i not impressed with metaphorical truth i don't have a problem with the metaphorical side i have a problem with the other side because it's not what you think it is and the world is more complex and it's nested in the end in the in the manifest image now is personal is personhood detector merely a perceptual limit are of our pattern recognition perhaps but the other path is either determinism or this tyranny of control where we now are under control who's we you think that's going to put an end to conspiracy theories in other words the more power human beings have the more our conspiracy theories are going to be about real people because what we're really trying to do is colonize other people so yeah i'll choose my theism and i'll work the problem from this end but what about the religious stuff well words that fudge religious is an awfully fudgy word and i'm trying to work at the right and work it from the left and there'll be more videos about that religious people think their rituals matter do they how read what jordan peterson wrote about sacrifice i was so interested that that came up in carron and michael's listen to jordan peterson's easter video at the very end of his biblical series on his channel well the future in the past are so full of people purpose is always group b things are always sneaking purpose in religious and political higher i want to get higher resolution on that interrelationship the question of course and as always is how should we live what guide can we have to move forward how can we know which way is forward you know civilla's project on um a quality existence in terms of value and piercing um how should you live is a manifest image question and they will be watching out for scientific frame smuggling or scientific image smuggling missed that one i corrected them just like we'll be watching out for jesus smuggling we'll do the best we can in knowing what we're talking about yeah this was long thanks for watching
