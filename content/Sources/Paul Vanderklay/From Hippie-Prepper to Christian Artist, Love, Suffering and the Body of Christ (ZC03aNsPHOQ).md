 Thought you were recording I'm recording now So some of you know who I'm talking to because you've you've already subscribed to her channel Karen is an artist who lives in the Bay Area and we had a conversation Two three weeks ago. I think so. Okay, and I thought that went very well I think it was very well received on the channel and she has her own channel and And talking with Travis actually signed up and he had to cancel so you got to go on your channel first We had so much fun talking I Listened to some of it. I haven't listened to the whole thing and it sounded like a fun conversation Yeah, it was unbelievable how many connections we had just unbelievable so I'm looking forward to talking to him, but as I was just telling you I'm just I I Have to I'm getting so many requests for conversations both from people who watch my channel and now increasingly other people like other youtubers or scholars or And I really want to follow up on some of those conversations too So I have to figure out how to manage I have to figure out how to manage this and Not hurt my church in the process, you know I want this to be an overall blessing for my church not a not hurt it Summers a weird time because my kids are home and my wife isn't teaching school. And so it's just busier Ironically when they're all off doing their own thing I have a little bit more free time. So it's just Just just busy. So well, so you say you're having fun with your channel. I am I am having a great deal of fun and If anybody who's watching this decides to help me name my channel, I would be all in on that I have a few ideas But I'd like to I'd like to give it a name so that if people are searching on YouTube for something They'll just stumble on to my channel because if I just leave it at Karen Wong There are probably 50 Karen Wong's and there's nothing to differentiate me from anybody else So yeah, yeah Wong's a pretty common name here in California Vanderclay not so much so yeah helps me So what what what were you thinking about talking about today? Well, so last time I was talking to you afterwards I told you I kind of wished that we had touched on this idea of love and suffering and So I've been giving that a lot of thought and that has kind of given some structure to The threads that I've been following kind of trying to untangle some things in my own life and figure out How I Think somebody noticed the other day that I talked about how I talked from the basement I I structured the basement first before I come out with an idea and And so I kind of think every person has a basement That is what they're composed of how they got to be where they are And so I was trying to figure out why do I feel the way I feel about love and suffering and so I started Untangling some of the threads of my life and and just trying to put it together thinking. Okay, I'm gonna tell Paul my story Okay, I thought wow, I've had such a rich life. It's just unbelievable, you know, just unbelievable Good it in intertwines with the the history of Evangelical ism since 1980 it intertwines with the political landscape since 1980 It intertwines with Just you know the musical scene everything that that I became a Christian in 1980 And so for me, that's kind of when everything started So Well, go ahead and jump right in usually the first conversation we do the The story stuff in the second conversation we get into whatever we reversed it with you We had a first that that video I think was very people really liked it You really put things together well for people and that was very well received Well, I think people like to what they tell me is people like to have the bottom line first Okay, because they don't want to listen to the basement unless they have the bottom line So so let me give you the bottom line first Bottom line is that there's something about the individual that is very important in the way the universe is structured and I think just I'm going to say two things about that right now and that one is that God works with each individual in a very unique and individual way and Also that suffering is very individual thing I think we we talk a lot about all the suffering of this people group or the suffering of that that Family we tend to talk in group when we talk about other people's suffering But everybody who has ever suffered knows that your suffering is unique and no one else can begin to understand What you're going through they might say they do but the only one who can really understand what's happening inside of you is Jesus so So I those are two things that I've learned and I Remembered in 1988 when I was a missionary in Japan And I was a fairly new believer. I'd only been a believer for about seven years So I didn't know much here. I am trying to be a missionary And yeah hard place and I was reading the Bible and I stumbled on Philippians 3 10 For I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and I thought yes, that's what I want and then I read the second half of the verse and this fellowship of sharing in his sufferings and I didn't really know what that meant But it scared me because two years previous to that when I had first arrived in Japan I got a notice that my brother had died in a small plane crash in Alaska And because of our financial situation as missionaries, I wasn't able to go back for the funeral So that was a long period of suffering Just trying to suffer with my parents who were back in the United States and and Trying to sort out things that had been left unsaid with my brother and Arguments that we'd had about the existence of God and all of these things that you just you have no answers for any of it but The conclusion that I came to after six months of suffering through that was that the only thing that I could hold on to for sure Is that God is good? And that sort of became my lens So so here I am two years later after my brother's death and I run across this verse and I think well Yes, I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection, but I don't want to go through suffering like that again. I'm scared I'm scared But I didn't know what was coming I didn't know what was going to come after that which is probably a very good thing because I would have bailed out Yeah Yeah But I want to go back a little bit and explain how I got to be a missionary in Japan. Okay So in the late 70s, I got very interested in the turmoil that was going on in the United States the political Restlessness the The economy was a disaster in shambles. There was a lot of talk about in fact we were saving tuna fish and toilet paper in our closet because we were convinced that the economy was going to come apart at the Seams and we were going to be on our own so we bought a little farm out in the country that we could grow our own food on and And we were going to make our way through this tragedy that way and so I started reading all kinds of We were we were in a way we were hippies turned preppers Yeah, so then we Then I got interested in politics and economics thinking I could make a difference And but then one day I finally realized wait, this is way bigger than I am It didn't matter how many letters I wrote to the editor or you know, how many envelopes I stuffed for politicians This problem was way bigger than I am and and it was that realization that Led me one thing after another until I stumbled into a church um That's a whole nother long story But in that church I ran across a little book that was called secular humanism in the light of the holy scriptures by Homer Duncan of Lubbock, Texas Always think of him with great fondness Because one of the things I had been concerned about was a an organization That was promoting humanism in the public schools And in their literature, they were saying things like we want to control The minds of the children of america And i'm thinking okay. I've got a nine-year-old daughter. I don't want her mind being controlled by anybody But I don't know anything about humanism. I have no idea what it is Um, but here was this book promising to tell me And it was going to tell me something about humanism compared to the holy scriptures and I knew nothing whatever about the bible I had no no background This is the late 70s Yeah, this is 1980 now. This is 1980. Okay um So I pick up this book and I read it and it made so much sense to me And I knew I didn't want humanism so I thought I must want this other thing and that led me on a search for um, trying to understand what there was in christianity and within a few months I was at a An old-fashioned tent revival in iowa And I walked down the sawdust trail and kneeled at the altar and uh, I didn't really understand what I was doing But but I knew it was something I wanted and um I'm not sure how effective the transaction was at that moment But it got me on a path and got me involved in a little country church That taught the gospel um in an area where there were five small towns around Where that church was? And I don't think there were any other gospel teaching churches in those towns When you say it taught the gospel a lot of people what do you mean by that? Yeah, okay So that I I should quit using christian lingo, right? Yeah, it was it was a church where the it had it had been a friend's church Okay, and people are there's a lot of did not one of the things I hear on your channel Is a lot of people talking about all these different denominational threads and eastern orthodox versus evangelicalism versus catholicism and all that and part of what I want to say is that Inside every i've had an experience with almost every denomination there is and i've either been to their churches or i've had friends in those churches or I've in one way or another through all these pathways. I've been involved And there are believers who love the lord. Jesus christ and are totally dedicated to him inside every one of them so many of these denominational differences are peripheral to Through meaning I think we get involved in a lot of Debates and discussions and arguments that are fun They're interesting, but they're peripheral So this little church had been a friend's church and the friend's church idea was in the in the way back You sit and you wait for god to speak And by the time I got to this church And um by the time I got to this church the pastor who had been there before had moved on and they had gotten the pastor who was a A guy and his wife who had been missionaries to the navajo indians in in arizona And he was from kansas and so he was not a friend's pastor but he was a absolutely remarkable human being he and his wife both and Whenever we had a question about the bible He would jump in his car and drive the 10 miles to our farm And just lay it out for us and help make sure we got all our questions answered Um always focused on jesus christ as the as the way the truth and the life and um And so so many things happened all at that same time so I had just become a believer Outside of our small town there was a nightclub and the owner of that nightclub came to christ And decided to turn his nightclub into a christian dinner theater And so he started inviting full gospel businessmen's association guys in there to talk and and have these dinner meetings and And full gospel businessmen isn't just men there would be men and women but so that that was more of the charismatic side of things and so I I heard a lot of messages from those folks and and then um In the middle of that within just a few months after I became a believer I was asked if I would run for the state legislature in iowa And so I got involved in this campaign and i'm going door to door in all these small towns and just meeting all kinds of people of every stripe and um And building deep friendships with some of them And I got elected and I served for two years and became Very very controversial I I don't know if the newspaper articles are still available, but I was very controversial What did you do to become controversial may I ask? Well, there were several things um Part of it was that I joined up with the conservative element in the legislature and there were There were 12 guys that were conservatives and so they called those guys the dirty dozen And when I got elected, I was the only woman that was considered a conservative and so You know, then they called me the baker's dozen or something like that But um, there were a few issues that came up that were um Appalling is is probably the best word I can use for it Um, the one I became most controversial about was a sex ed Curriculum that had been developed by the iowa state university home ec department and it was to be used to um Teach sex ed they called it parenting education, but basically it was a sex ed curriculum for the high schools And I have no problem whatever with sex education, but but the direction of this was so appalling Um that in order to train the teachers some parents came to me and told me that they They were also teachers and had been in one of the teacher training classes And in the teacher training class they were they put the teachers in a darkened room and they would flash Profanities Well worse than profanities, you know the worst words you can think of They would flash them on the screen in in bright colors And then then they would tell the teachers if there's any of these words that you can't say out loud Um, you need to get accustomed to talking about them without Being embarrassed you need to be desensitized. So go in your closet at home and say them as loudly as you can So that you get over the fear And the reason they needed to be able to do that was that they would be one of the lessons in the curriculum was to um Have the young people this would be like for freshmen in high school pair up with boy girl boy girl boy girl And they're supposed to talk to each other about all the dirty words that they hear on the playground relating to sexual activity And then write the dirty word on a piece of paper and put it in a In a little jar and the teacher would pull them out one at a time and then she would say the word the Street word for it and then she would give them The botanical well biological word for it Um I had no intention of talking about this, but you made me talk about this So, you know every class curriculum Yeah, every position you can think of okay every sexual position you can think of there's a street word for it But there's also a formal word for it, you know, but they you know Kids don't learn this stuff By their own that means well, that's what i'm wondering. Okay But but beyond that I thought the bigger issue for me the bigger the for me the issue wasn't was all these are dirty Words and people shouldn't be using them and they shouldn't be talking. That wasn't the issue. The issue was why are we? Desensitizing people about something that it should be considered so beautiful And so purposeful and that has meaning why are we desensitizing people? so I Paired up with a couple of other legislators who felt the same way I did and we This is so funny. We copied off some pages of this curriculum and put it into brown manila envelopes Sealed the envelopes and labeled them for each legislator And then we we had them distributed to the legislators so that they could get them at their desks and They of course the pages the the young, you know, the intern pages were the ones that were delivering this material So the first thing that happens is this Other legislator gets his packet. He opens it up He gets enraged and he stands up and pull you know, you stand up and your mic is You pull your mic up out of your desk and so he stands up and pulls up his mic up to his mouth And he says this is absolutely disgusting that you would send material like this with the pages So I said, yeah, I said, uh, yeah, this is exactly why we want to inform everybody about it and he said Teachers know what they're doing and these people who have developed this curriculum know what they're doing and you have no right to interfere in this Because the educational system is doing the right thing for people you should stay out of it Well, that's the same person that was offended because the page brought the envelope Well, you know, you know what they say cognitive dissonance That's hilarious so The next thing that we found out about was that they were using a video called the quickie Which was a speeded up version of a couple meeting at a hotel room taking off all their clothes rolling around on the floor Having a sexual activity and then putting their clothes back on and getting out and leaving the motel And this was part of the desensitization program So We had a private meeting with the legislators in a private room and showed this film to them and we said we do not think that State money should be used on something like this to desensitize people because that's a problem And man, we just got nailed from every side So Everybody was angry with us and they decided to have a public meeting about this So we have this big public meeting in demoine and they invite people to testify from every different group and they the um, of course the nea came to testify the national education association And then also the pta came to testify The pta they were all over our case Keep your nose out of the schools. You don't know what you're talking about The people who've developed this curriculum had a good purpose for it and you know on and on anyway, my name got out in the news and they were writing articles about me and and they didn't like me to start with because I was already part of the dirty dozen and so You know, they take the most unflattering photographs they can find and And they dig up whatever they can about your past and you know Yeah, so anyway all that to say that that was a part of my learning as a new believer How to really trust god in the middle of a real pressure cooker so I really went through it for a couple of years and um My daughter at the time was 11. So I was having to drive to the state house like 100 miles from home Every monday and then come back on friday afternoons and my husband was being He was a teacher but so he'd take her to school with him in the morning and then bring her home at night So she was never alone without somebody but but certainly she was without me And when she was in fifth grade which would have been the second year I was there the The nea decided after this earlier debacle that they wanted to get rid of me so they Sent out a bunch of material to everybody saying that I was trying to close the local schools and So the teachers were having all their students write letters to me in protest about trying to close the local schools Which had nothing whatever to do with anything I was doing and my own daughter was one of the students that this teacher was Forcing to write a letter of accusation to me Just give it to mom when she comes home Oh, no, no, they brought the class to the state house and they delivered these letters to me personally Yeah, so it was quite an experience But through that I also met people from every denomination and And I discovered something very interesting about politics and that is So at the end of this two-year period when it was time to run again And I really made my own party very angry with me because I wouldn't Bend the knee to a particular bill that they wanted to pass that they thought would look good on the the re election brochures And I made the terminal error of Exposing what they were doing By getting up and talking about it in the house chambers But it happened to be at a time when the tv cameras were there for some other reasons Got on got on the evening news and the party looked at that and they said we are going to take her out So they ran somebody against me in the primary so that I couldn't Um, and the person who they ran against me in the primary had had that seat before so he had good name recognition They knew he couldn't win the general But um, but he had good name recognition. So they ran him against me in the primary He won the primary he went on to lose the general election and that was the end of my political career But what I took away from that was that um It doesn't really matter what party you belong to the party in power wants to stay in power and the party outer power wants to get into power and um They don't look at a bill in terms of what are the consequences going to be five years from now or ten years from now What snakes are buried in there? They look at it in terms of does this look good on our reelection brochures? Yeah and So I realized that political activity was not the solution You can't impose. I mean for example Everybody knows robbery is wrong. So we have laws against robbery, but that doesn't stop anybody from robbing your local 7-eleven, right? So I felt like the lord was saying to me I change one heart at a time It's the individual level and that was what eventually led us to Getting ready to go as missionaries to asia So in order to do that I had to get a graduate degree in linguistics and teaching english as a second language So that took me through another two years a very interesting time of working with doctoral students and um I think that's one of the things that led me to this whole Thing that I have about trying to find underlying principles because Learning esl taught me how to communicate with people of other languages but at a very At the simplest conceptual level possible to still get the information across So I had many students who were working on their doctorates and they're trying to write their doctoral dissertation, but But their english is very limited. So how could I help them? Take their ideas and put them into A kind of english that would be useful For their you know for their future career and their dissertation so forth So it's also english as a second language in japan as that was part of your missionary work Yes. Yeah, that that's how we met people. That was our whole way in to meet people But before I leave iowa state university I have to tell you about this one chinese guy that I met who was working on his doctorate in quantum physics So I don't know if you remember when evangelism explosion was big So I was going to an efree church at the time and got involved with the evangelism explosion training and I was out working with my partner And we contacted one of my students who had shown some interest in a previous conversation that I had had with him So I said hey could we come and have a cup of coffee with you and talk with you about this more and he said Sure, so So we're talking to him and and we started to share the um the story about jesus christ being the the um The way the truth and the life to put it simply yeah And that jesus christ was The logos and we're you know sharing with him the the basic kind of stuff that we did with the evangelism explosion and he said He said well, you know, i'm so glad you're talking to me about things like this because he said last night I laid awake all night long thinking about something and he said I don't have the answer to it But maybe maybe what you're telling me maybe there's some answer And I said, well, what were you thinking about? And he said well, you know black holes absorb light They absorb light endlessly And he said and still there's light in the universe said, you know, I I can't find the answer to that So I thought well, that's beyond you know, that's Above my pay grade. So I had nothing for him, but we left him with one of these little books of john A little booklet and uh, and I said on thursday, we'll come back and we'll bring you a whole bible because I didn't have a whole bible with me So we went back on thursday and uh, he comes to his dorm door and he said I found it I found it He found what he said I found the source of the light And then down in verse 14, I think it is And um light shines in the darkness and the darkness does not overcome it Yes, the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it has not overcome it And so I really saw it I saw it in the book of john And I said, well, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it And so I really started thinking about stuff, you know, and then later he told me another thought that he had And I i'm probably going to mess this up. But he said, you know if you take if you Live a life of 80 years, but without god he said it's it's equivalent to zero But if you live even one year with god, it's it's like infinite and I said, can you show me and he said sure and so it's um Let's see if you put If you put god on the bottom if you put infinity on the bottom, so it's 80 divided by infinity That's Nothing. It's meaningless, right? But if you put infinity on the top Infinity divided by one so even one day you're still infinity His little master so that's the way physicists think right when they come when they come to the lord so, um Yeah, so anyway, um So then we became missionaries we went to japan And after we were in japan three months I find out about my brother dying in this plane crash I struggled my way through that and then I had my episode with philippians 3 10 and um I was Afraid to think about the fellowship of his sufferings, you know thinking about jesus and in towards the end of 1988 my husband Confesses to me one night that he is in love with another man And he is gay and he's leaving Me So All of a sudden my world when when had you married him before after he became a christian? Uh way before we had been married 19 years He became a christian same time you had yes. Yes. Uh, yeah, so we We both came to the lord in 1980 and and Later when he told me I did have a chance to talk with him at much more length later on But he told me that Once he made that decision to follow christ. It was just crushed day by day by day just increasingly crushed by by the temptations and by you know, just everything that went along with um Yeah, well, so I don't want to really go down that trail too much but that's fine Yeah, it is there's a whole big long story there that you I know you're cutting down on your conversation So if we ever have another one in the future we could explore that more but but um So I had no money because I couldn't take the the The donated money anymore that was supporting us as missionaries and I had to figure out what was going to happen with life. I had lost the love of my life and and My When I came back to the united states I discovered that my mother had just come out of surgery for Cancer and that cancer was inoperable And that she had maybe six months to live and Something happened to my father when he got that news And so his heart began to be irregular and over the next six months while my mother was dying My father's organs started to give out one after another so During that time I got a job working for The university which so there was this kind of triangle there was a the university was in ames My mother was in carol, which was 100 miles to the west and my father was Or 50 miles to the 60 miles to the west and my father was in demoine, which was 50 miles to the south of ames and so I was running this triangle many times every week Just to try to make sure I was staying in contact with everybody and taking care of everything but still earning a living And um The thing that I learned through that well, okay, so during that time Um One thing I forgot to mention Well, there's so many things i've got to mention anyway i've been Involved in many different types of churches When we had been in the university before We had gotten involved in a church that very quickly became apparent to us was a cult and So after we got out of that church, we started having meetings at our house for people who were Suffering as a result of what the cult had done to them And um That is a whole story in itself, I think they're still operating but they're but they may have made some changes in their in their um Theories about how the world works Because when we finally discovered that they were a cult it was it was primarily because the um I know this is a diversion I'm probably diverting because I saw the look on your face when we hit the valley of suffering I diverted back to this previous history thing, which is kind of a thing that I Learned to do I think because some people Um kind of like in movies when they have the the comic relief, you know right in the middle of a movie so Probably shouldn't have done that but since I started on it i'm going to follow up anyway, okay So it was it was uh, it was called ames fellowship church at the time And this is 1980 Three Okay 1983 We're at the university working on our master's degrees And it was the greatest church you ever saw I mean they were having this great revival on campus They were having big meetings on campus and students were coming and they had all their own music that they had written to verses in the bible and The music was great and we were loving it and we were you know, the bible teaching was Very expository just excellent all the way around And then we realized that that something was missing and what was missing was the holy spirit It was the father the son the holy scriptures And then the elders took the place of the spirit because they told everybody what to do The elders would tell all these single people who they should date tell them where they should live And and they came up with this mantra every believer should every man should want to live up to the expectations of the qualifications for being an elder And every woman should want to live up to the qualifications of being an elder's wife So then that was their Their paradigm if you couldn't live up to that paradigm then you would get disfellowshipped So, um, there were a lot of hurting people coming out of that body And that Experience gave me a certain radar for being able to see when things are getting off kilter a little bit Towards the legalism side of things I think one of the reasons i'm talking about all these different churches and experiences that Bottom line Jesus is faithful So when you're one when you're one of his sheep, he keeps the pasture weeded for you Um I know it's possible to stumble into something like that and get trapped in it but I also know that there's some way that you can stay clear of that stuff and I I don't really um I realize now that what I just said a minute ago Is only true on one level and that is it was true for me That even though I didn't know anything about the internecine wars of all the different denominations And I didn't know all the rules and regulations of all the denominations and I didn't understand purity of doctrine or anything else Somehow jesus has kept me safe through this whole Long journey that i've had going through all these different denominations. Oh, I know It's because of the suffering I think suffering teaches us something at a deeply fundamental level that connects us to god that keeps us safe from um Falling into the You ever been to yellowstone park You know the paint pots that are on either side of the walkway it You don't want to fall into the paint pots You want to stay on the trail So I think suffering might be the connection that keeps us on that trail So, um Connected to that I want to go back just a little bit to when my mom Oh, I guess I haven't got there yet when my mom was in the hospital. Um at the very end of her life Um, she made it five months after that surgery not six months But I was in the hospital with her during the last day and it was a sunday And I could um She was had been in a lot of pain and she had actually gone into a coma like three days before Well a coma, I don't know She was not there anymore Because and she had one of these pain machines where you can Touch it and it gives you a drip that was keeping her, you know um so I wasn't able to talk to her but I got this sense at one point of like I was in the room and I could have I had this sense that I was somewhere in between Heaven and earth there was just this moment where I felt like there's some sacred quality about this moment and I looked up at the television and there was uh Church service playing and this young man had been giving a testimony and at the end of his testimony He he quoted from a book by john stott and they put the quote on the screen And the quote was was this one right here? I could never myself believe in god if it were not for the cross The only god I believe in is the one nichi ridiculed as god on the cross In this real world of pain, how could one worship a god who was immune to it? And The whole quote is really something I've never read the book but but that was the only part that they had on the screen Is that from the his book on the cross of christ? Yes, I think I think so. I haven't read the book. I just remember that quote and it was 1980 1980 December 10th of 1989 when I saw this yeah, the book that book came out then I read it with I was in an internship and uh, Myself and my supervisor we read it together. So it's a very good book Yeah, well it made a tremendous impact on me because um I mean I already deeply knew I already deeply knew that Jesus christ is real and that the story of the cross is real. I knew that at a deep level but but that was almost like a Like an embrace When I saw that verse on the screen It reminded me of an embrace that I a couple of embraces that had happened The year before when I had been in japan when my husband left me When I was really struggling there and just in so much pain Um One day the phone rang and transatlantic calls were very expensive in 1980 88 Um and The person who was calling me was a young woman that I had known from my home church who had very very limited financial resources and um Very limited education. So I don't even know how she figured out how to make a transatlantic call And she was a very simple person with very difficult life But she had heard what had happened And I get this phone call on a day when i'm just deeply suffering and it's her her name is kathy And she said karen I just want you to know That it says here in god's word that Um All things work together For the good of those who love god and are called according to his purpose That means karen that means even this thing Wow And I mean I was just undone, you know um That that god cared enough about me that he would send me that message on that day in that way um was just Just beyond me And um So I I had many experiences like that, you know where I would get these embrace embraces. There was another time when I was Struggling and I was I was worshiping I was I remember I was standing in the shower and I was worshiping Just out of the pain and all of a sudden I just felt this waterfall of joy and love and and Immense pleasure in god's presence just just wash over me and fill me and I mean I was just It was impossible to explain And almost impossible to hold on to hold I there wasn't enough of me to hold that feeling so um It's it's like c.s. Lewis always says, you know It's in the suffering that you really really come face to face with the love of god Yeah, I mean, I know you can know that god loves you But you can't really know that god loves you until you're in the valley with him All right, there's different kinds of knowing Yeah Yeah, yeah, that's very It's very true It's it's it's hard stuff it's hard stuff to talk about But it's but it's true it's true Well, and I think what i'm the bigger thing i'm trying to say here is that It's this thread of suffering every person every person suffers. I mean that's jordan peterson talks about that all the time, right? Yeah, that life is suffering. Well, he says life is suffering But I think that's I think there's an error there somewhere because that makes the identity of life to be suffering, right? Right, so something's wrong with that. There is suffering in life and every person goes through it and there is also somehow a purpose in suffering so that in a sense the present rewrites the past Because when you come through the valley you come through the trail of tears so to speak you come through the that was the wrong terminology He's excuse me When you come when you come through some sort of struggle some sort of set of sufferings that you've gone through and you get to the other end and you begin to see oh Oh my goodness I'm in this place of great beauty now and I don't know that I could have appreciated this beauty before But now I can see this beauty and I can see the purpose and all of a sudden it goes back and it Rewrites the whole story in the back So I can For a few years. I couldn't talk about this without sobbing But now I can look back on it and it is it's not only another lifetime, but It was another me and that me doesn't exist anymore and the me that exists now has more capacity for comfort and for beauty and for understanding and all of those things that Was built out of that experience that wouldn't be possible today and I have a 25 year old daughter who never would have been born if that hadn't happened and I have a husband that I never Would have met if that hadn't happened and so You get to the rest of the story And it rewrites the past And that is the piece that I think's missing if you say Life is suffering and you find meaning by picking up the heaviest load you can Well, no, I think you trust You trust that the person who's leading you is trustworthy And then you follow the leading and if the leading leads you into the path of suffering So be it it may Be really terrifying but you can know that the one who's with you is holding your hand and You don't go looking for it. But if you fall into it There is someone with you Suffering suffering and loss finds us all one way or another Always and and you're right suffering is always individual C. S. Lewis Um, have you read c.s. Lewis is the problem of pain? Yeah Um, and and then you also if you read the problem of pain, which is an early apologetic book, it's you know It's it's lewis the philosophical observer and then you read, you know a grief observed Where it's lewis the sufferer? Yes, I read that too. Yeah, I think tim keller's best book is um Is walking with god through suffering? I've read a number of keller's book, but I think that's his best book. He does It's so what what it's it's You have to be cautious talking about suffering because people suffer and suffering is a funny thing because Sometimes it makes people bitter and sometimes it makes people strong And We don't we don't You know for ourselves in a sense we have decisions we can make To To decide whether the sufferings will make us Because what suffering can can give us is the capacity to be both more tender And stronger and that's the opposite of bitter and hard and it's uh Because you meet people whose suffering has made them bitter and hard and I agree with you that a vital difference is often one's capacity to Have that suffering be transcended by I mean if you're You know when you say you're holding on to god through the suffering in a sense what you're doing is you're leveraging meaning To address suffering that's that's essentially what you're doing because and I know Christians can do this cheaply and christians can do this uh in a In a pat shallow way, but the the christians who are not Uh cheap pat or shallow Have almost always suffered and found that they Were found that They learned how to suffer and were brought through suffering by trust in god and You know, so it's you know peterson's talk about meaning and suffering It's vitally important to understand those two together because suffering without meaning Is what makes us bitter and hard and crushes us Suffering and love it's tough tough stuff But we are out of time and I don't want to make the next person suffer That was a very great segue Well, thank you karen and um, yeah, thanks for sharing some of your story it's it's a It's a big deal when people come on this channel and share their story It's no small thing to just tell your story and put it on youtube And any person can listen to it and any person can comment. I don't close the comment sections I haven't yet. Maybe I wouldn't someday for some reason but and and then of course people are going to have all kinds of opinions about you and your choices and your experience and some of those people will entitle themselves to comment on it and Unkind or generous ways and so it's no small thing to share ourselves and and I think we do so in the hope that what we What we say will be helpful and and Yes, that's a good thing But I've got a but the next guy is already in the room.
