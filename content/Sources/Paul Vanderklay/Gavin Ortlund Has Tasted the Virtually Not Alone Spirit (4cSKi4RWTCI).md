 So you start making videos and then you start getting response. What has surprised you? What is something that you have now learned and are pretty sure of that before you started on YouTube you could not have imagined? That's a good question. I'll be curious if you would answer this question as well. I'd just be curious to see your thoughts. I would say it has surprised me how much fun it is and how much you can build genuine relationships. I might have tended to be a little cynical about relationships that aren't embodied. And I totally agree with my friends who will talk about the importance of having embodied relationships where you're with someone face to face. That is so important. But it doesn't mean you can't at all be blessed by these online relationships. I've kind of been amazed at there are people right now that I consider kind of dear friends. We will be praying for each other. We'll be texting each other. And I'm like, and then suddenly hits me like I've never actually met this person in real life. And it's so weird. And it's like, how do you do that? But it happens. And I've been kind of surprised by that pleasantly. I would agree. I would agree with that. I would completely agree with that.
