 challenge. I'm the same way. I would never want someone to watch YouTube videos as a replacement for local church membership or local friendship or anything. But as a supplement, boy, there are needs that can be met and as vulnerable as it was for me both to start my YouTube channel and then to give it more focus. Both of those were actually, it actually took courage. I felt so vulnerable about it. I thought, how is this going to look? You're aware of, and then you're questioning yourself. And I'm saying, are my motives right about this? And I'm thinking like that. But the thing that I'm feeling along the way is exactly what you're describing in terms of the people coming. There's incredible need and there's incredible opportunity. And the main people who watch my YouTube channel are young men. And young men right now have a lot of questions and they need bothering and they need discipling. And that's what's got me into it is I'm drawn to this sense of need and opportunity.
