 It's so nice that zoom tells us. Such are in California and I think that's a recording consent required state so yeah it is it is. Well I guess I should give a little bit of an introduction. My name is Paul and today I'm with Michael and Nate and many of you will recognize Nate he's been pretty active in this little corner of the Internet even though I've actually never had Nate solo on my channel which is something we do have to fix at some point but he's got his own channel Grail Country and I was I've been introduced to Michael's work both through Nate and through Karen who I know from the Bay Area and so Nate says oh three of us should you know you Michael should really talk and I said well I thought I want you to be here Nate so I've started reading some of Michael's books and to try to get a sense of what's going on here I was very interested by the introduction I got to Michael from Karen's interview and so here we are so thank you both for joining me. Thank you. A pleasure to be here. I want to kind of put you in the driver's seat because you're the one that said oh you two should really talk so why do you think why do you think we should have this conversation today? Well I think um I think a couple of reasons um I think that your God number one God number two question has an underlying question of what is the relationship between God and the world which is what sociology specifically is addressing and you also both have a concern about what the future of the church looks like and I think that that that Michael's work and the sociological approach speaks to that as well so I thought there was some at least some some productive grounds for communication. Okay well maybe maybe we should and I'm sure Michael you're probably very tired of this um question. I know what's coming. You know exactly what's coming and it's the it's the bane of anyone who tries to maybe not bring a new idea into the world but at least present a new word to people who are not familiar with it and in I think especially in spaces of committed Christians any new word is immediately suspect until proven innocent so. Well that's what happened with sociology for 600 years now. Well there we go so why don't you I feel like you know in reading oh uh Michael recommended one of your books to me so I started reading it um and I think I have a much better handle on it now but what's your what's your what's your three minute take an explanation of what sociology is and why it's important. It's uh well I think it's something that's been present in Christianity also in Judaism from the very beginning but that's why I call it in my one book the submerged reality I think it's always been there but people don't notice it necessarily or it's it's certainly not explicitly taken up in um we can say you know uh the governing theological circles but the the basic idea is that Proverbs 8 is not a metaphor that when when God speaks or when the wisdom speaks and gives her beautiful beautiful speech about the creation of the world that that's really a divine person you know I don't know where that how exactly um when you know I think what happens is people go wait a minute are you adding a third a fourth person to the holy trinity which was an accusation of that Sergei Bulgakov underwent and it's been it's kind of kind of how it is but I well the way I think of this of Sophia in that instance in the relation to the trinity is kind of as a receptacle or or a grail you know a vessel that is able to hold it and and to make the divine palpable in the physical world and one word I often use in describing Sophia is metaxu which is the middle right it's a term I borrow in particular well you know what uh Bulgakov talks about it but even more I borrow it from William Desmond the Irish Catholic philosopher and and so so for instance in uh Proverbs 8 where Sophia describes herself or wisdom describes herself as the co-worker of God on the creation or or you might say handmade right which I think is then reiterated in Luke's gospel when uh Gabriel greets Mary and she says behold the handmaid of the Lord because what happens with that greeting is that Mary and who I hold and lots of people have held to be the kind of incarnation of of Sophia because how she she so in Proverbs Sophia makes creation palpable to human senses and in Luke Mary's yes makes the divinity palpable to to and in a very even more literal sense right taste and see right and the Eucharist I think is a perfect example of that as well um so so that's kind of the the undergirding which is why for me anyway and I think I'm I'm not I'm not uh unique in this but I'm probably unique in the way I foreground it and in our relationship to the creation a lot of sophiologists through history have been more or less uh theological or philosophical speculators you know and like uh Vladimir Slovia for instance and Bulgakov whom I mentioned and going back even further Jakob Burma the the Lutheran mystic you know they they were kind of uh working in a conceptual realm but for me you know I'm a biodynamic farmer so for me it has to do with our relationship to the created order you know and one way to think about the sovietic is you know uh the glory of the Lord that shines through creation upon occasion and usually only does that according to our disposition toward what it is we behold and so you don't see it in nature you see it in liturgy you see it in the arts you see it um you know all kinds of our ways in which we relate to beauty but it doesn't happen every single time right uh it's depending dependent I think on our uh like I said our disposition our openness to it but but you can't kind of force it to happen and we've all had those experiences where it bleeds through or it shines through the universe and we find ourselves in actually into a kind of different consciousness about the world and about our own being and and that's that's kind of what I think uh that's kind of my three minute conversation and interestingly uh familiar with Margaret Barker Margaret Barker is a Methodist theologian and preacher and biblical scholar and she's been writing these books about these kinds of things and I long time she's you know probably in her 70s and uh she detects this in the Old Testament literature and in particular her criticism or her observation is that with the reforms of King Josiah uh that the the veneration of wisdom that was in the temple was kind of kicked out of the temple and those people who wanted who were we can call them traditionalists who wanted to hold on to that that aspect of of their their Jewish faith they went in exile to North Africa which is where the so-called wisdom literature was mostly written and also where the holy family went went hiding right so so there's so she's working in that but but after that though with only a few hints I think in the patristic era it's not until uh the 16th and 17th centuries where this really becomes something people are actually thinking about and and the ground zero for that is Jacob Burma who who brought that into conversation so actually sophiology in this modern iteration started as Protestant mysticism and it went from Burma to the German pietists were really interested in this idea as well as the Philadelphia society in England which was Jane Led and John Portage and Thomas Bromley they were really inspired by the early translations of Burma's work and that spread actually and in Germany it influenced Novalis and Goethe and the romantics in in England you see it in not only in the philadelphians but you also see it in William Blake you see it in uh Henry Vaughan the metaphysical poet and Thomas Vaughan the metaphysical poet so there was a real uh recalibration I think of Christian mysticism in in a Protestant idiom after the arrival of Burma on the scene because I think even like Heidegger when Heidegger showed up in philosophy it can hit the reset button for all of philosophy and I think Burma did the same thing for Christian mysticism I'm just taking good notes here Wow now I am you know I would imagine someone imagined me potentially um your complete adversary given the fact that I'm a Calvinist minister um and I've seen what Nate writes about Calvinism on Twitter um I often get a pass by um by people that I talk to well you're not one of those bad Calvinists I give you a pass for sure but I but I say that to um explain a role that I play often which is in some ways a translator of um of things potentially helpful to people despite their fears and you know you probably in that little introduction triggered anti-catholic fears um but I do and I can see with that introduction a little bit Nate of why I have a better sense of why you you wanted us to talk today because of my god number one god number two a big you know one of the big issues behind the scenes of a lot of the drama going on now is is the question of persons is that um I often call it the uh scientific lab leak that you know here here's a really cool thing for figuring out stuff in the natural order let's drop two balls from a tower in Italy and let's let's let's run all these experiments but in order to do this we simply must start with the scientific lab leak and then we'll start with the scientific lab leak and then we'll and let's let's let's run all these experiments but in order to do this we simply must assume that there are no persons involved and so that sort of sets up what John Vervecki talks about in terms of his meaning crisis that now suddenly human beings are alone in the world god has been turned solely into a mechanistic nature and we are the only agents and then finally with the rise of sociology and psychology and a bunch of other brain science that has come about in the last 50 years you know not only we used to think we were the only persons left now we're not so sure about ourselves and so when now you talk about Sophia which is the word for wisdom Sophia and you talk and you very rightly appropriate something that you know even sola scriptura uh biblicist protestants have to concede yeah that's there in their bible too that why is why is wisdom talked about as a woman and i mean that of course once you start picking at that scab you're gonna you're gonna go you're into a whole bunch of stuff very quickly so i can i can see um i can see how this lays itself out and part of what i think's been happening as we have sometimes called this little corner of the internet with verveky and peugeot sort of you know burst into ignited into um ignited into an audience thanks to jordan peterson is um this questions of probably a a reintroduction to older traditions that were far more deeply symbolic um and that we now i think now with the recession of modernity that we are experiencing things are now available to us that weren't available to us as groups something like 20 years ago even though they were they were out there but sort of shunted to the side for a variety of other ecclesiastical and political um agendas i don't know if that's fair that sounds fair to me what do you see nate um yeah i think well i mean sophiology is like almost the exact opposite of what you just described because for sophiology creation is a person right like like so it's it's quite literally um the polar opposite um yeah go ahead lewis lewis got into that so you know part of i mean michael doesn't know me at all not near as much as nate knows me just by listening to enough of me um you know part of what i found myself doing um was reading a lot more reading c.s lewis's book miracles on a fairly regular basis to just contend with modernity and when you read a book repeatedly you read more and more of the book especially if it's a decent book if it's a good book because there's a lot more under the surface and i i would pick up uh lewis always talking about nature as our sister which is a really helpful framing in terms of nature as a person which again is completely opposite the scientific lab leak where oh this thing works really good in the lab let's let's let's get it out of the lab and apply it to every absolutely everything around us and well that then had its own consequences because um yeah raping your sister is is not necessarily something you ought to do that's the language right that's the language of modernity subjecting nature to to the test yes ravishing yes and and ravishing exploiting um and and so when you come to german romantics or you know i don't know i don't know a lot about um you know i don't know a lot about you know the walldorf methods but i i do have some familiarity via the sacramento walldorf school where my wife teaches which is a public school it's not a private school um but the biodynamic farming i mean all of this stuff i know to be sort of part of that package and then that also connects us with you know some of the stuff that peugeot's been talking about lately in terms of okay well we've got these these other traditions that have come down to us some of these mystical traditions some have tried to stay fairly self-consciously within ecclesiastical lines others have have wandered afar from them and that of course i think probably spooks um again more modernist people who listen to you and say oh this this this sounds like spooky stuff that we should stay away from but yeah it's i'm glad you said that because you know um my my doctoral dissertation it was uh but it was published as a literature in the encounter with god and post-reformation england so it's mostly examining protestant mystics of one or weirdos of one kind or another in england um so jane led when i mentioned this in there henry vaughn and his brother thomas vaughn are in there as well as uh john dunn who's not a weirdo or at least not he's more a conventional source and uh but john d who is kind of a weirdo right and and i'm and sir kenham digby and the interesting thing is is d digby who kind of jumped back and forth between the the catholic and protestant ships in england at the time which is not uncommon and thomas vaughn's twin brother henry were all alchemists of one kind or another right so they were but this was in the late 16th and early 17th century where really before the scientific revolution and and in the submerged reality have a chapter on robert flood who was a british physician and theologian but also still connected to that older tradition which which they all thought especially the vaughn's and robert flood they didn't accept the day karteen model the cartesian model they were rejected it and because it rejected the divine order the spiritual order right and i've always wondered what would it and thomas vaughn but especially robert flood he was in in conversation with all of the leading scientists of his day but he was not uh he was not buying it right he was not going along with it but i've always wondered what would have happened to humanity had that tiny school of thought which was really grounded in you know ancient greek and roman and christian ideas of the microcosm and the macrocosm totally you know and the world so what would have happened had those guys gotten all the research funding and all the attention and all the cultural collateral what would have happened and i think you see over time little bits and pieces come up i think uh david bohm if you're familiar with him the the physicist quantum physicist he was interested in these kinds of ideas and yeah barfield was a big fan of bohm and uh brian josephson was another i think he's a physicist he's another british scientist um and who is the other one i was thinking well there have been there have been plenty who who wanted to bring this back or who think you know we threw out the baby with the bath water and or i was thinking it's homeopathy right hanuman and that was in the 17th or 18th century 18th or 19th century um so those were all grounded and ridolph steiner himself right were grounded in those kinds of traditions and for steiner it started with german idealism you know trying to recapture and not and but not go backwards recapture the dimension that had been lost and i think really for me that's the you know that's the this in the future that will be the salvation of what we call science i think that's what john vervecki is already doing i mean i really do feel that way like and i think i think when we had that conversation with him i think you could sense that like it's it's it's well he actually is an is a neoplatonist so but like it reminds me of mill bank has uh john mill bank has like a sort of like an alternate modernity that he's traced through these various like sort of more neoplatonically influenced thinkers that have like still cropped up from time to time yeah like kind of from from nicolas custa and and moving forward through some of the german idealists etc well i i'd like to i'd like to back up a little bit because with a conversation like this i'm i'm very aware of a good bit of my audience that's going to hear a lot of these names dropped that they have never heard of check out and they might even just see nate heil and say you know nate heil he's like john vervecki he uses these words and they're english i recognize their english but i don't know what he's talking about so let's back up a little bit and talk about the cartesian model and perhaps what the what was the cartesian model and what would have what might the alternative have had looked like if in fact they had gotten the funding and then i think also in those questions historical questions are why did the cartesian model get the funding i think that's a that's an important question too but the first one just just flesh that out a little bit for for people who might say oh yeah the cartesian model i have no idea what that is but i don't want to ask a question because i'll look dumb uh the cartesian model it's very simply that the only things we should concern ourselves with in the sciences are that those things that we can measure in and uh quantify so qualities go out the window right um uh essences go out the window and so then you want to get left with them you know and which is what modern science is and that's this is what happened uh throughout the 17th century in particular but to this day um where as you mentioned earlier that you know will subject nature to torture to have her reveal her secrets to us because you can do that to something that's dead right right that's yeah that's and what's in it wordsworth right we murder to dissect right so you you kill what's alive and this is when i was a welder feature right for 16 years it's one of the wonderful things that i i loved about that job is that it allowed me to introduce kids to phenomenology but i didn't think of it in those terms but you know you you know it's a very different experience from running into a snake in the forest then seeing a video on it right and and you cannot even describe how different that experience is and i was teaching at a welfare school in the city so i often took the kids out camping and stuff and and it was great because they said they'd find some salamander or something go show Mr. Martin he knows what everything is you know because they were they were so happy to be engaging with nature in that way which which ties us back to the idea of glory that we were talking about before and like well Gokhov's actual definition of Sophia is wisdom glory right so you'd actually it's the glory you notice first that leads you to the wisdom part of it um which i think Michael you've often referred to that as reverence and i think that's that's a great way to think of it and and it's completely different attitude from the scientific revolution oh and that and this is what i'm saying is that just starting from that standpoint of reverence you're you're doing christian science or science in a christian way right um not looking to exploit it you know seeing and and what's interesting though is so Gerto was was really pushing against this uh the scientific revolution which he called the mechanical the dogmatic mechanical torture chamber right empirical dog dogmatic mechanical torture chamber and it was a great i don't know if you heard the story but when he uh he wanted to you know gentlemen in his era they were the ones doing science there were no scientists it was people with money who had time to indulge a hobby it's what Darwin was doing and Gerto was was no different and he was interested in the world he had the poet's eye right and he wanted to do some experiments with prisms because he heard about what had gone on with newton but prisms in those days were ridiculously expensive you can imagine remember when we were kids at paul how much a calculator costs now you get you get a free one when you open up a bank account that's right but they were like 500 bucks in the 70s um so prisms were the same kind of thing and so Gerto who did have money still he couldn't afford them himself so he knew a nobleman who had some prisms and he said he asked if he could borrow them and sent them over you know he but he had them in this box and he was just too busy doing other things never got around to using the prisms and then the the baron or whoever he was sent over his footman to pick up the box two weeks later and Gerto says oh darn forgot so just before he gave it to the guy he picked up one of the prisms and held it up to his eye and he was astonished at what he saw and he told told the the guy who came come back in a week by your master they're not coming back today because what he saw and if i if i had one right here i could see it one of these windows he saw around two sides of the window say say on the top and in the left side he would see bands of green and blue right where the the window meets the wood right and the other L we could call it he saw bands of orange and red and yellow and he and he said well this is doing something so he had to figure out what that was so and i'm sure the way we were taught we weren't we didn't have this experience probably as kids but we were told that color is what happens when you when you torture light to turn it into his constituent parts right it's it's like broken into its pieces but Gerto came up with a very different theory of color and what for him and this is a very poetic way to put it but it's actually true that light for him arises at the interplay of or color arises at the interplay of light and darkness and you can see this um if you see a sunset for instance and say the sun setting and the colors are very orange all right now what is the what is the the opposite color to orange i didn't i wasn't i wasn't a Waldorf kid my well it's purple or orange and if you look the thing is you so you look on the sunset so look on the western horizon and you're seeing this orange and red if you turn the opposite direction looking to the east you'll see it the opposite colors yeah that's right in purple yeah so the the sky is a prism yeah but and again you know it's kind of wonderful when you notice this and when i used to teach uh this is i think this came up in seventh grade in a welder school the kids would just go wow yeah why is that happening you know you kind of usher them into this experience of wonder and beauty that the world is beautiful yeah but it you've never taken the time or found out how to look at it yeah no you know this this makes me think i know nate lives up by the coast too but uh his coast is so cloudy and cold i don't know if they do that up there but down here where we get more sun in california well you live you live not too far from lake michigan so you know that too although it's pretty cloudy and cold up there by lake michigan too right now but um you know at you know when you when you're when you're getting towards sun when you're getting towards sunset if you're in santa cruz or you know any place that's i mean suddenly i mean the whole coast fills up and everybody parks their car people pause their day and here we're going to do what all of us would acknowledge happens absolutely every day and we're going to pay attention to exactly this and another another one of my favorite favorite illustrations with glory is um i don't live i live a few hours from yosemite national park it's one of my favorite places i love being in the valley i don't like going there midsummer because it becomes a zoo but if i do go midsummer i want to be right by bridal vale falls where these big tour buses that are bringing people from all over the world you know open up and disgorge you know chinese and japanese and german and people from all over the world i love being there when they first set foot in yosemite valley and they look up and you know awe and glory and and it's really interesting nate that you connected this with my god number one god number two thing because my first i mean people have always been oh you need better names for it and i resist the better names things because i don't want to i don't want to let them i want to keep them as loose boxes that i can throw things in and take things out of and um my first articulation of it was isaiah six um holy holy holy is the lord god almighty that's in a sense god number two transcendent the whole earth is full of his glory and you know i i like what you said earlier when you mentioned um where did you say i took notes um well well you know the and and it's true often that often we need to be attuned to see the glory disposition disposition but it's also true that there are moments and times when the glory simply overpowers us and has its way with us in a sense you know perhaps the sister's revenge on her rapists um that that she says you know do you do you really think i am merely do you really think that i am merely here available to you to to to frustratingly to your frustrating attempt to satisfy your baser desires and your greed and your gluttony and if you would only if you know if you would only meet me as a sister our communion would be so much more rich and you know i and that is that is you know god god speaking through another thing i love about what you also laid down here is um part of what part of what happens in modernity is so before i was doing this in california i was a foreign missionary and one of the things that very quickly and that if you read any missiology at all you recognize the problem of the excluded middle in terms of the cosmos that um westerners have a very high god and then you know all of this dead space here below with the exception of the persons that are us and nothing else in the middle and then the angels well we keep the angels on christmas cards with feathery wings but and then you know it's only the pentecostals that play with angels and demons but you have to keep that binary angels and demons and don't don't get don't flesh that out at all whereas you know as as michael hyzer people are always you know coming to my channel and say have you read michael hyzer have you read michael hyzer because he of course is an old testament scholar that's been you know decided hey what if um what if we don't just sort of gloss over all of these references in the hebrew scriptures to who were who when when the lord met the accuser at the beginning of the book of job what was going on with that i mean he asked uncomfortable questions about those kinds of things and suddenly then oh now is it frank paretti and this present darkness that we're in the grips of or how can we make sense of this and so i very much see your you know opening in line of okay okay christians who love their bible uh you say this is you know divine revelation what about this what are you gonna do with this so i think that's helpful yeah i mean jennison i think and it was good yeah it's good yeah i i i think for me what you were just talking about paul like that's that's that's the link to to barfield's idea of participation right where you can see where barfield is talking about participation he's kind of talking about the same thing that the sophiologists are attempting to talk to because it is talk about because it is that it is that that wisdom glory that is that is what we have access to through which we participate um which is why like in systematic sophiology you have like like sophia has a divine in a creaturely mode systematic sophiology that sounds like an axi moron well bogatkov is quite systematic actually yeah interesting so i've i've date i've heard you mention bolt i i'm not familiar with him at all bogatkov sergay bogatkov okay uh he's a russian orthodox uh uh early 20th century theologian um who lived from like the mid 19th century to like 1944 okay or late 19th century to 1944 um uh he wrote a uh like a major trilogy and then several minor works but um sophiology was a perpetual theme in his theological writing and he got into a lot of hot water for it got into a lot of hot water for it with who um with uh yeah yeah although uh he was he was reprimanded um by a lower authority and then kind of like exonerated by a higher authority but but sophiology itself like is still like looked at like kind of a a scance by the orthodox church well it seems like it's looked at it's probably looked at a scance by orthodox roman catholic and protestants even though it sounds from your description that it's got representation in all three um sectors absolutely good yeah yeah it does um yeah i there's a um there's a there's there's a hesitancy because of the withdrawal participation i'll just be like that's why that's because it's because the reason we're hesitant and the reason we're suspicious is because of the withdrawal participation and because i think that and we have uh and and our fear of idolatry that i think is that we've misunderstood in idolatry in a way that barfield points out in saving the appearances i think that our our idolatry is now in the realm of our abstract ideas in the conceptually absolutely and not and it's not it's our engagement in the world is not the source of our idolatry now and we need to make that a move to engage and participate in the world again in a different mode we're not going to be able to do it in the same way that we did under original participation but we need but we need to but we need to be able to do that in order to to get where we're going and that's really i mean an idea that i wouldn't say took but barfield you know was inspired by steiner because that's what steiner's thing is that mankind had to go through this this desert of materialism to bring back the spirit later and he was and that's why he called what he was doing spiritual science you know whether you want to agree with that or not that's one that's another thing but i that's what his project was is that he was kind of spearheading or trying to spearhead the way back and not the way backwards either yeah right because if there there is a i guess temptation like a traditionalist temptation right to go back to how it was well you can't go look you can't go home angel right so we can only go forward but we can uh we can go forward and um and reimagine how how this is and i think what i think was significant was the the the arrival of phenomenology um which allowed i mean even with we're talking about biblical studies right um but one of the problems and maybe strength somebody would say but with with uh with biblical um exegesis is that when we do it we do it with the canon right next to us that says what's allowed what's not allowed so we can't encounter the text there as it is because because we feel obligated or whatever it is too well we have to make this trinitarian it doesn't seem to trinitarian right here you know paul paul doesn't talk about the trinity too much right whoops and that was what john milton right john milton his they call him a congregation of one you know who i'm sure milton thought of himself as a christian but he didn't believe in the trinity at least not like most people believe in the trinity no sense sam proudly claims him as a unitarian oh really yeah have you met sam i would have been a terry he hasn't met sam he hasn't oh okay well i i think that's i think that's really helpful i didn't know that about steiner i don't know a lot about steiner i certainly see you know some of his you know what he was trying to do in terms of pedagogy but um what what you say i think is really helpful in this little corner of the internet because and often i often sort of feel in a strange way between peugeot and vervecky in that you know vervecky identifies as a non-fiest um his you know as a neo-platinist um he wouldn't identify as a christian per se um not even to the degree let's say jordan peterson does of course jonathan majeu you know presents himself clearly as a as an advocate for orthodox christianity and i i tend to agree with you that you can't go back and when i look at traditionalists that say well we just have to all the answers are in orthodoxy we just have to go back and and i i look at that i'm skeptical because i don't think i don't think you're the same as and you know i i illustrate this so i have a friend bern power who's living in tablici georgia and when he crosses the street and tries to go to an orthodox church you know they look at him like i'm not sure you're one of us um and i i think that the you could probably see the difference most palpably in immigrants to north america who are starting and going to orthodox churches and people who are coming into orthodox churches having been evangelicals let's say and there's going to be a lot of differences between them because all of that stuff matters and i i also even though we can say that there certainly have been many wrong turns the i i think part of the reason the protestant reform reformation happened is exactly is exactly why you said here you had you know here you had canon law luther you know is bucking you know he starts out as trying to be an obedient augustinian monk and well increasingly the the the fight grows until finally of course luther just got a personality that you push him he's going to push back and just back back back back back boom big explosion and now you've got a tremendous amount of wreckage but that explosion had been coming for a very long time for lots of different reasons yeah and i i also think there is no going back and at some point at some point we're going to have to start relating to i think we're going to have to start relating to our sister in a better way and i think there's abundant evidence out there that answer to exploitation is not more exploitation which is usually oh no this exploitation has given us trouble let's exploit more surely will solve the problem of exploitation it's like that's you know i find people like the answer to floods or is more water and it's like no the problem is the water so um i you know i really appreciate what you just said and i'll have to i want to because this is part of an argument that i keep trying to make with people that i i'm i'm tremendously happy that the orthodox church in america is now presenting in a way that a broader audience can see some of the riches of orthodoxy that perhaps haven't been present to us in the west given just how history unfolded yet i tend to think the way forward is usually a way forward and it's just for us to figure out okay what does that look like yeah and you know part of this um michael has been i know with um your conversations before that um if people are curious i i very much recommend your conversation both with john vervecki and with uh caro wong on the meaning code i mean you are you bought a you bought some property in western michigan which is a place that well it's not as affordable as it used to be but um and you have a whole slew of kids and you run them to basketball and yet you write these books and now these books are not the kinds of books that i'm gonna find in cosco when i go to cosco but it's on the walmart they're on the walmart website are they really i couldn't believe it yeah even my did oh did we lose him looks like he froze up a little bit there oh come back come back oh you hear my big question and this is well that's what he's living in western michigan and i'm sure the uh unlike those of us here on the coast who have access to things like fiber um yeah i mean and that's you know nate that's part of i'm sure he'll jump in in a minute yeah that's part of where i look at the rightness and the beauty and the glory of this at the same time we are just as jonathan peugeot is in his orthodox advocacy we are deeply embedded in the technological right that there's no there's no backing out of this in a way no that's right that's right i would i would agree with that too um and yet at the same time like there has to sometimes in order to find the right path forward you have to take a look back absolutely and um i think that in in in the case of sophiology you're talking about i i what i think is actually quite an ancient wisdom tradition um i know that michael mentioned margaret barker's work earlier which is i won't i won't talk about it too much since you're not familiar with it but essentially margaret barker's thesis links the early christian church to the temple mysticism of the first temple so it actually like it it it places the roots of a lot of christian belief like farther back within the within jewish thought than you would think and i would say that like some of the elements of kabbalah actually like reinforced that connection um particularly like kabbalistic thinking about the shachina which is which which which seems to parallel this sort of like this idea of sophia that keeps cropping up in these various places within christian thought uh within protestants orthodox and roman catholic circles you find you find it uh in all three traditions so um well and it's even it's even interesting to me i mean every now and then i suppose when they have enough money the freedom from religion found sacramento chapter will usually around easter they like put on putting up billboards around christian holidays and um and they they too will talk about um you know just because we're atheists doesn't mean we don't experience wonder and and you know and the you know what bishop barron was saying in the four horsemen conversation too um i just add in fact a protestant colleague of mine who is who is deeply reformed and and quite conservative much more than people suspect um you know talking about beauty first and you know i very much read that theme in um at least in the small bit of michael's work that i've been that i've been reading and and i think you know looking at looking at that in i i think for many at this point in the protestant and even around in roman catholic churches protestantized um spat over church going and religious identity um those who are wandering back into church seem to be doing so for the beauty and saying i'll figure out the theology as i go right well you know just i think that that the thing about the atheist experience of wonder i want to bring that back to i want to bring that back to the idea of participation again um because barfield is very clear that if participation actually receded entirely there would be no hope of moving toward final participation so that there so even even even deep within withdrawal within withdrawal participation there's an element of participation that has that that has to remain so what i would what i would want to interrogate the atheist is like what do you really mean when you say you have a sense of wonder like what is your primary experience like when that when that sense first hits you what does that feel like and i guarantee you it's going to be pretty disconnected from their atheistic rationalist explanations of the experience that primary experience itself yeah they they would of course say well these are these are simply you know these are simply firings of the chemistry and the synapses of my brain but you can only right but you can only do that as at a remove from the experience right right like when you're actually when you actually have when you actually have that experience when you're actually experiencing something that just overwhelms you with beauty right like that's not how you're thinking about it in fact you're barely thinking about it at all you're just participating in it so now let me let me play the devil's advocate here especially with respect to to mysticism because let's imagine we can develop a computer game or virtual reality that that completely overwhelms a person's a person by way of their appetite for beauty to the degree that they sit strapped in a chair with a vr headset on and never bother never bother getting up to eat or relieve themselves or pay attention to their spouse or or or or it seems to me that part of what we must do in this is is not basically not get too gnostic in the sense of the it is in fact participation in in all levels of creation and that is that is in many respects what we're looking for and it's not simply something with respect to our visual cortex or pleasure centers in our brain it's the pleasure centers in our stomach it's the pleasure centers of our fingers it's it's the mutuality of pleasure between persons that we're looking for so and and i think there's at least i have the anxiety of i mean it seems we can the three transcendentals always need to always they they all need each other and if modernity was say the overreach of a particular form of truth you know there's a there's dangers of i mean zealous good gets tyrannical as well right right right yeah so it's it's all of the transcendentals um in there well i think we would have to we would have to talk about what we mean by beauty because i would say in the example that you gave of of like that video game yeah i would say that that's if i just have like some stunning visuals in a video game the experience of that might be pleasurable but it is not nearly analogous to the experience i have like watching a sunset at the beach they're they're very different and and and one of one of the primary differences is that there's no you you have when you're experiencing that sunset at the beach you there's no desire to possess it right like you couldn't like because you know you can't right so you're just you're just it's just like you're you're just in the experience and it just overwhelms you whereas it's like in the video game it's it's something that's repeatable that you can control so you can just like have it over and over and over again and you can develop this desire to possess it right so there is like i think there's a difference there well i think that's good and you know michael who's been able to rejoin us now his books are available at walmart um maybe not at your local walmart but via the walmart website um but i think i think that's good nate in terms of and i think of it let's say so it's we're coming into the holidays and my son will be driving up from southern california and my daughter will be flying in from seattle and my children my my one son has driven in from um from santa cruz and we will all be in sacramento and hopefully at some point we'll all be around a table and or around a meal or around a board game and and now at this stage in my life you know when when when when all of this comes and they all bring their personalities in and and you know fortunately we homeschooled them and so they all love each other and they boy when they're all coming they all want to come that's the biggest draw we have and when they're all around a table together you know i i feel i see i participate in glory in a deep rich sense that right and it can get really hard to define these distinctions but it's like one of those things that we we really it's something we really we know with our intuition we know the difference yes we just do so so i'm glad i'm sorry michael that you live in impoverished western michigan um where where your white where your internet is likely not of the the gigabit cable fiber variety that are easy to get in sacramento so but but so so tell me tell me why you write books why do i write well i write well i for the same reason i write poetry as robert frost said i tell i write poetry to tell myself things i didn't know that i knew and and as i tell my students you know with with writing book i mean when i write anything it's because i want to know more about it you know something intrigues me and when i so when i wrote my dissertation for instance and i had always wanted to do something on thomas and henry vaughn and i mean i knew henry vaughn's poetry but i'd never and i read a little bit of thomas vaughn but so i i did all this research on them and i became more and more interested and i saw the influence of burma on both of their thinking and then i did a chapter on jane leaden to philadelphia's and i saw it there as well and i remember that stayed in myself somebody should write a book about this about the influence of burman the 17th century and that was my original attention with writing this the submerged reality but i decided i wanted to do more than the 17th century and broadened it to other things you know so it's i write it because i write because it's fun you know i mean you get into a kind of a contemplative space when i'm when i'm writing a book or poetry and it feels good so i would think it's all glory too i mean you you write because it feels good you write because it's fun and you and i mean you could write this stuff it wouldn't be half as much fun and it wouldn't feel half as good if you just wrote it and you know put a pile on your shelf somewhere that maybe your kids you know when you die would say oh what are we going to do with this you send it out into the world yeah and and i was i was really fortunate to find a publisher who you know actually when i sent my publisher not my dissertation was published by ashgate who were they were they were bought by somebody else but that that was an you know it was it was glad to get it published but it was a very corporate feel to it but then i had a book of poetry that i had put together and i sent it to angelico press and they said wow you're you you know what else do you write you write other things like this and so i told them i get this thing i was thinking about writing it like yeah do write that we'd love to publish something like that and so that became a pretty good friendship with them and and they're very supportive i mean you know i got another weird book for you john i got another weird book for you john available but what i found though is that um maybe not a lot of people but there are people out there who encounter what i have to say you know because i always figure my ideas are not that weird i think they're not weird they're not weird to me and i it always seems like it's makes you know kind of sense not only were they not weird they were deeply convergent with my own when i kind of like i don't know that's a good sign but a lot of people from all over the world have gotten old to be like wow i was waiting for a book like this i thought i was crazy to feel that these feelings are thoughts but i think it's not i i i don't think what i what i write is weird at all i think you know i assume that the way i feel about things is is congruent with the way lots of people i think you see it as absolute sanity i do i think everything else is crazy because it's suggesting a deep connection to everything yeah and to each other right exactly well i mean there's a lot of obvious congruity with why i make the insane videos i make which i i still think that what i'm doing on youtube is absolutely insane and i there are often days i have no idea why anybody else watches what i'm putting out because it's hardly published and or polished and it's you know at least a book has an editor and it's been refined and you know all my mistakes are out there to be seen but um you know and but again this this shows one of the you know nate and i were talking a little bit when when when we lost you i mean this shows one of the one of the strange i don't even know the word for it without this without this crazy technological interconnected world where walmart had to start a um a broad website to compete with its main rival who is no longer sears and kmart but amazon yeah um you know i you know i was i'm reading your book on kindle and so here's this here's this strange here's the strange i don't i don't even know the words to call it but this is what we're living in right now in this weird internet age where i have a channel and we can talk about obscure people from past centuries and obscure people that strange people that live today who are finding joy in things that are most common but have a take on them that hopefully will have others you know the you know my second question for you is you know what do you want your books to do out there in the world i want that i want them to uh to find a community you know what i mean and i want a community you know because for me you know you were just talking about when your kids come home for christmas right and i have the same experience um i have nine children who are in the same age group and i have nine children um uh two three of them four of them i don't i think four or five of them are out of the house i have to take inventory but when they come home you know and they come home for the holidays or um we we do we celebrate festivals on our farm like mayday and nickelmas which is and they come but also other people come and to me that kind of conviviality is central to a healthy way to live and when i send my books out there into the world i'm hoping i can find people out there who are looking for the same thing who're looking for an experience of what's real and you know we talk about using the internet and what have you and i think you know there's a lot of evil that is perpetrated through the internet right not you know between pornography and surveillance i mean what else do you need right but there's still a way for people like us to connect they couldn't connect otherwise yeah you know so there's a potential to redeem the internet yeah there's definitely a light side to it and certainly certainly your books found like resonance with like with with my crew over at grill country i mean michael and sherry and i all love like really love your your work and uh hopefully hopefully maybe more people will start catching on and i think i think you're i mean what why are we doing this what do we want i mean i've been thinking lately about this question you know i was watching the you know it's not kind of strange debate between jonathan peugeot and sticks and hammer 666 i mean this this youtuber and you know they're they're going uh having this debate and you know you send your books out to out into the world for glory because i mean even even if you know your audience isn't going to be you're not going to make as much money off your book as jordan peterson is going to make off his um you send it out there for glory that that someone might find this and and and then might gather more together and in fact you know doing what we're doing now it's been interesting to me how much appetite authors have to talk about their books and it's often done sort of on the pretext of oh the publisher wants me to do these things to sell books but i think the i think the real joy in this is to find out that our um our produce is productive well it's also it's fulfilling your vocation right and we call it okay but and i was at an education conference gosh 25 years ago and this guy said you know teaching is still one of the only professions important enough to be called a vocation right and i felt called to be a teacher you know and i certainly felt called to write these books you know i often didn't you know i wasn't planning on writing them but i felt called that i felt something's tapping me on my shoulder and saying you gotta write this book yeah you know so whatever happens after that the pleasure actually the pleasure for me is not getting it published it was writing it right and uh so i think i think those things are important well and and back to what they now we're talking about in terms of the atheists and i think this is where i think this is where the shallowness of atheists that's that's where they find the bottom too too soon too joylessly that even even richard dawkins when he writes his book is when i say he's looking for glory i'm not saying that in a shallow sense that everyone should look at him and praise him of course part of us always wants that too but we send this out into the world for resonance and for community and for that joy of csl talks about that with the first friend rather than the second friend oh you too you like this north stuff and um i mean this is a this is a broadly common foundation that is available in many ways at levels deeper than people's overt religious profession and those of us who have confessions that say things like these things down below are not incidental to your existence and in fact if you pay more attention to them these things can grow and you can you can enjoy more of this in your life rather than playing around in all the shallow pools of vainglory and wealth and um you know tricking tricking your sister out of her glory for your own shallow reasons right yeah thanks another exploitation right it's interesting to me that uh you know when you send send the it's basically every book i write it's like sending a message in a bottle see who's going to come back how's it going to come back and i'm always surprised and pleased and pleased when i hear from people you know who feel like they've been waiting for something like this but the original uh subtitle when the working title for the submersibility i can't remember what the original title was but the subtitle was uh something along the lines of ecumenism which for a lot of people is a dirty word right and but i think sophiology at least the way i understand the whole history of it is an extraordinarily ecumenical project you know it starts so in the modern age like i mentioned it starts with protestant mystics then it moves it kind of migrates from them to the russian orthodox underground and then from the russian orthodox it migrated to the catholics and particular to uh chardin and uh louis bouillet and thomas merton you know so it kind of but we see you know and that we're in this idea when i was thinking about the church what do we mean by this word the church right right and i don't have a very narrow definition of the church you know so well and vulgakov kind of identifies sophia with the church like via mary right so like mary is the manifestation of the crucially sophia and is also like you know the mother of the church so there's a connection between uh between sophia and and the church and look at the woman and then in terms of ecumenicism his emphasis on sober nos of like looking for the the common instead of the difference and like you know um living in a communitarian way like that was pointing toward that which is why he was involved in uh efforts to get to come into communion with with anglicans when he was in england yep so and it's that's all seems very important to me i mean you know i think this kind of ecumenical approach combined with i would say a distributist or a communitarian approach is very sophiological because it's an organic relationship to your neighbor right and even if you know might not necessarily and i don't get too hung up on dogma and things like that you know i mean you can be because uh those often separate us you know what i mean well there's a there's a the parts we have in common right there's definitely a resonance in sophiology with my politics was i think one of the reasons that attracted one of the things that attracted me to it you know because i was a christian anarchist long before i was into sophiology and like there's and there's like you know it's about approaching life we're we're in a way that emphasizes the personal and the relational and the communitarian and um and not and doesn't seek to uh to dominate or seize power or control that like that that that's it's it's very much a part of it yeah um so i think that's i think that's like it's what the church is supposed to be we're supposed to be a you wrote i actually you reposted an older piece you wrote from august recently uh about about the church is a parallel polis and i'm like that's exactly that's exactly it that's like what it's supposed to be and it operates on a completely different value structure are there amish in your neighborhoods not uh we have meninites and meninites yeah we have there's a big amish community near near here um where do you live pardon me where are you how far north are you in michigan you know i'm um 20 miles from jackson you know in jackson oh yeah yeah yeah so just south of jackson there's in homer michigan huge amish community and i and i i do business with them a lot i use them as butchers and uh i amish crew put my roof on my house um and so i'm really i'm familiar with these people i deal with them all the time speaking of christian anarchists right and uh i teach at a methodist college part time and one of the student evaluations the girl flipped out because another student was doing a paper on alternative ways of living and in class were talking about their papers and she said you know i said you mean like the amish and you know christian anarchists and stuff like that she said yes she said and i just said yeah i'm pretty much a christian anarchist and which is what triggered this girl was in the evaluation from he called himself a christian anarchist and she couldn't handle it and i remember just talking to the to the chair of the department said well that's what i am um yeah but you know i think i can't because i know the um the community that's around my channel in the comment section and i can anticipate you know a number of who and what is going to be said here um i i think part of the part of the striving we must figure out how to do is to um so often not not set these things against each other in unproductive ways um because you know even the most dogmatic the most anti-dogma people i find of course have their dog dogmatisms and um i i do see part of you know part of my own longing and the the the video children that i send out into the world is for a a reconciliation and a unification and i do see you know this conversation has been helpful to me in terms of you know seeing something of the potential for uh bringing bringing the children uh bringing bringing the children together around some of which is so deeply common to most of us um and and that i mean i think some of the some of what you are pointing to are are it's analogous to i love in galatians where paul is talking about the fruit of the spirit and he sends and he says against such things there is no law and when i read that i think about that and i think about the fact that love joy peace patience kindness goodness gentleness faithfulness self-control these are kinds of things that even the you know even no matter how totalitarian a society the um the monsters in charge are looking for these qualities from their um from their peons in order for their machine to work and it's almost at this level it's almost this level of existence that you're pointing to and saying if we pay a little bit more attention to this level maybe we might um we might achieve some betterment against which there is no law well yeah well also i would say this there's like when when you in the absence of an artificially imposed power structure what kinds of people do people look to to be leaders when you don't have one when you don't have a power structure that's just imposed people are automatically going to look to people who have those virtues well let me push back against this anarchism a little bit um you know i used to i used to there was a there was a young man who got you know went way off the deep end and libertarianism and he was telling me how you know neighbors there should all taxation is theft you know neighbors should voluntarily covenant together to build their roads and sewers and i thought um we're gonna have sewage in the middle of dirt roads if you think you imagine you're actually going to get your neighbors to come together in this way what you would actually what you would actually develop would be yet another government and um there there is almost always i mean my goodness if you have any children there is almost always an element of coercion in any community and just like almost anything else it's it's getting the it's the right way at coercion not not saying oh it's the absence of coercion is the is the answer to everything so now we're going to try and you know we're going to try try to create an absence uh vacuum of you know no coercion but of course you're going to have to use coercion in order to maintain that vacuum so i mean i i i know what you're pointing at but i do think we have to push through a little bit better and and go a little deeper well from i mean i think you're right but i think um so i i i consider the amish christian anarchists right and i've seen how their communities work and they i mean it's not perfect but but they have the right idea right they they have the smallest is beautiful idea and that's what's uh i mean like i okay say in the book you know or one of my books don't try to do anything at once you know do what you can ever ever hear that poem by uh chesla milosh on angels and it ends with i'm gonna i'm gonna mangle it i'm sure but the words uh day breaks another one and you hear a voice do what you can right you don't try to do everything and you so it's the little things it's the little things it's not you know we're going to completely unplug from the sewage system or it's well for instance we have a csa here on our farm right so supplying food for this network of people you know that's a more real experience of the world than going to the average i would also say it's a little postmodern to consider like uh gentle persuasion to be coercion in the same way that that that you know that someone pointing a gun at you is so this you know this matters um but uh and and my point is this is this is the thing i want to say the problem is is that when christians look to the state to implement the things that they want to implement they're always going to be disappointed 100 of the time and we have to stop pretending that the state has a monopoly on human cooperation if we want good things we can build them and we don't have to start big we can start small like i know like in trans uh in in your book transfiguration michael you have that great that great advice to just start where you are um and i think that's that's well i think what happens with living in the state to everything is we outsource our charity right yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's actually a interesting there's some interesting there's a guy george yancey who's done he's a sociologist he's done some study on mainline versus evangelical and one of the real differences between the evangelicals is they don't outsource their their charity to the degree that mainliners do which is a very interesting distinction but i i guess you know i i certainly am am someone who is in love with small things that are probably not terribly sustainable for very long time which is essentially my church um but you know i i the the part of what part of what haunts me um with these conversations is so often that of scale in that um lots of respect for all my life i've been my parents my grandparents i mean i'm a third generation minister and so my entire life has been devoted vocationally to the efforts of small things that will likely not last long and probably fail and that's why i don't care about your theology but but it's such a secondary concern yeah yeah i i my i guess my desire is to is to ask questions i you know part of me my heart is warmed that uh michael martin is living near jackson michigan with his bio dynamic farm trading with the amish writing books for joy and glory being sold on the walmart website i mean my my world is a little brighter for that mission but but part of me part of me longs for the um part of me longs my heart breaks for the suburbanites who are you know hooked into netflix um only eating from cosco um living their their quiet lives of futility which has been now sold as the american dream and so you know the questions of okay um can can more people live like michael martin um well i grew up in detroit and and but i but you know what i mean but that was something present in in my soul from childhood um you know and i think this this desire to find find the real to find something authentic and which drew us to where we are now but it took forever to get here it was really hard especially having nine kids along the way right yeah yeah i only had five and i had appreciation for the nine oh that's another level the nazgul we call them they call themselves with to the over oh yeah that's what happens uh but i but i mean schumacher right small is beautiful start where you are and you can and it's surprising how many people who live those suburban lives are attracted to our csa for instance and your csa is your community supported agriculture so we sell shares in our farm we only have a 10 acre farm where i think about an acre that we garden so but it's amazing how many people that can feed and how many and how many people are attracted to that and so those people come to the festivals as well right just like when i was a wild art teacher you would see all these urban and suburban parents coming to these festivals and you know they were drawn to that beauty at those at school because it it evoked something that we all kind of harbor but we but we feel that we can't have it so we settle for netflix right yeah but we can't have it and actually and that to me is what the church should be yeah yeah and what the church frankly often is because if you look at all the little many of the little churches just dotted all over the place that are going absolutely nowhere it's it's not it's not dissimilar to a lot of these other projects it's it just tends to be ironically a little bit more sustainable because they have deep traditions of mutuality and practices that actually keep the church going whereas i've seen i've seen other communities supported agri-agriculture efforts here in sacramento just you know they just they just fail because there isn't the there's isn't quite enough out there people get people get boxes of produce and they open it up and they're like what am i going to do with turnips you know or they haven't delivered they don't even interact with the people who sell it yeah it just gets dropped off right or picked up yeah so yeah i'm but you know i i was interviewed a couple days ago by this by this guy uh resistance recovery and he wanted we talked a lot about romanticism because i'm teaching a course on romanticism in spring and it's one of the things i i write about and the funny thing is is you know why like like pauli asked earlier why why did that that model of science fail and the questions why did the romantics fail well i don't care what do you mean by fail right um we're still talking about them right and i think those kinds of movements can act as a as a as an enzyme or a ferment that can that can live later right like a little bit of yeast right i think romanticism never really died you know the first the first movement of course they were terribly outnumbered we talk about them now but we're talking about 20 or 30 people you know from 300 years ago or 200 years ago um but we're talking about them and we're not you know and we might still be uh under the the thumb of the technocratic technocratic regime but we don't live for the technocratic regime we live you know like paul talking to those 60 people in in corinth right or you know people still holding holding i mean i'm hearing this post-christian age right yeah um our posthum almost post-human age yeah people talk like that about the kind of the cultural shifts of the of the 60s a lot too where people although they just all sold out and became you know like you know wall street executives or whatever but if but if you actually but you can't you can't find a city in america where you don't see the residual impact of those shifts like still like they're so so failed it really depends on what you meant by failed i mean it definitely it shifted the culture forever in in in in some good ways in some bad ways maybe um but it didn't i it's pretty hard to say it's a categorical failure well maybe we need to recalibrate our our expectations on samples sample sizes and value because you know it's it's very interesting that we do we do tend to value that which is scarce um you know i think about hebraeus 11 talking about the saints that the you know the world was not the world was not worthy of them and and i i often think that way about um the glory that i see in you know people who stumbled i mean it's part of the reason my channel has the shape it has and part of the reason that i i continue to post videos um of my conversations with randos and you know how i found nate and you know how many other people because one of the things that i saw in my father's ministry in paterson which um you know like many other good things is a short-lived thing um you know i i just i would see splendor i would see splendor in common people that because the world is running around too fast and won't pause to listen can't discover its splendor and that c.s lewis has this has this marvelous comment that you know god spreads his you know these grand riches very evenly all over the place and um the the things that he doesn't give us are the things that we're always sort of greedily trying to grasp which is a sense of permanence which in our world tends to yield plastic well i think this is important for us as christians too because it's like even though we know that the the effort to build the kingdom on earth is going to fail we still have to try yeah like it was it was camelot a failure you have to live out your vocation i mean yes yeah yeah yeah and worry what you know a priest i knew he used to say yeah yeah just live out your vocation let god worry about all the other stuff you know i mean did you not know i would be about my father's business right yeah yeah yeah and and it's and it's strange that our master is someone who to the best of our knowledge never wrote a single word and we know all of his words from his disciples and given in books that that regularly tell us that his disciples weren't understanding him yeah right people ask me what's the old testament it's the history of people who screw up all the time yeah remember that time we blew it in canaan you know wow oh that was good time well this is this has been helpful for me um and and you
