 Hi, this is Paul and this is Rough Draft for Sunday where I run through my Sunday sermon how it is at the moment. A few months ago I did a sermon on Jonah and the monomyth and I ran through a little bit of Will Schroeder's video on YouTube of how every every story is the same and some of these story patterns and and some observations by Joseph Campbell that fleshed out in his hero's journey and his monomyth that he had in a hero of a thousand faces and and Dan Harmon's story circle and I compared some of this with with Daniel and I contrasted Daniel and Luke Skywalker and and they did comparing and contrasting because stories and story Story patterns are all about theme and theme and variation and and they had all of these contrasts life and death conscious unconscious chaos and and order dry land and sea and and for a while now people have been noting some of these patterns in the Bible and and Trying to figure out what that means for us as we interpret it The story we think we want to live but never But would never pay to see usually go something like this Bobby and Betty were perfect and had perfect lives They lived happily ever after that's that's just not an interesting story. Although most of us would Say yeah, that's that's that's what I want At the same time most of us have at least your common amount Which is more than most of us want of tragedies and the common question I'll have from people is why is this happening to me now some of you around living stones might remember Dottie who When people would ask her this she'd say well, why not you? What makes what makes you think you're so exceptional that the that life's tragedy shouldn't happen to you? CS Lewis quite famously begins his book the great divorce with It's surprising initially because he doesn't say that it's hell but hell is a gray city where you get anything you want just by looking Just by thinking about it with no work required yet. Everyone is miserable and quarrel some because of themselves So so life is a life is a very strange thing And and we're not always quite sure about how to manage it or or how we should manage things Chris McCandless a number of years ago in 1992 headed off into the wild and this this is a Famous American thing to do national parks were created to preserve wildness and throw lived on lived on the the pond in order to suck life at its marrow and we have all of these Interesting ideas about well, I'll head off into the wilderness and romantic notions What often happens isn't too different for not what happened to Chris McCandless. He went off into the wilderness and he died and People are always having to be rescued from their Misadventures into the wilderness nature is red and tooth and claw and not necessarily terribly hospitable to us Yet at the same time there's the other side. We've we've as a culture gotten quite Conscious of safety and now Jonathan Haidt has released as co-written a new book With with Greg Luke, and he was on Joe Rogan It was quite interesting watching those two talk where Joe Rogan is is a tatted up fighter who? Who who does all kinds of drugs and talks openly about it? but won't but is reluctant to let his kids have sleepovers and and Jonathan Haidt who's a University professor says no you got to let the kids out of the house and have them go do on their own Because if if children aren't tested if they don't go out into the world if they don't face risks They don't develop and so on one hand we look at we look at the wilderness and say wow look at that Life is dangerous on out out there in the wild. Yeah, but life is dangerous here in the civilization, too now for the next number of weeks, we're gonna be taking a look at the gospel of Mark and There are four Gospels in the New Testament and the church has always maintained these to be four witnesses These are these are four voices that speak of Jesus now. It's most scholars believe that there's a fair amount of dependency in Matthew and Luke from Mark But but the size of these books is quite dramatically different Luke is the largest with over 19,000 words mark is the smallest with with just a little over 11,000 words It begins this way in the beginning of the good news the beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah The Son of God as it is written in Isaiah the prophet I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way a voice of one calling in the wilderness Prepare the way for the Lord make straight paths for him Now recognizing the relationship between these Gospels and their differences one of the things that that we commonly do today is when we look at these passages we compare and contrast and we can see that John the Baptist shows up in all four Gospels and And then we take a careful look at okay how many of them how many of them quote Isaiah and Well all of them and but but how are other some of the other words around around it? How do they how do they speak differently from each other because apparently Matthew and Luke had had reason to change and to change Mark we the relationship between John and the other Gospels is a is a highly debated matter So John the Baptist appeared and in Mark He seems to just kind of pop in out of nowhere and well not really out of nowhere He comes in from the wilderness and the wilderness in in the biblical story is a is a is a very important place It was the wilderness where God brings the children of Israel out of Egypt and he keeps them in the wilderness for 42 years and and in that time in the wilderness He he brings one generation to death and rises raises up a new generation who will go into the promised land the wilderness in in terms of the imagery of the Bible is is a place where where life is not possible and What's interesting in terms of the biblical story is that You have wilderness on one side and you have water on another side and the place where? land and water are in proper balance is the place that life can be if you have too much water or then you have seas and No life or a threat to life if you have not enough water at all you have wilderness And that's not it and that's a threat to life And so there's this this balance that the tilled ground where where water and and Land come together in the right way, and and then you can have life. So so the wilderness is a place where Where people where people try to live or where people don't live? but but So Israel in the wilderness had to live in radical dependence upon God And so when John the Baptist John the baptizer comes comes out of the wilderness onto the scene to baptize He's preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins and and that's a strange things too because Baptism was a ritual cleansing that non-jews would have to participate in in order to be welcomed into the community And so there's a lot of discussion about well, what is this baptism of repentance Well, it seemed that there's a lot going on in these days and people were very nervous and and so John Coming out of the wilderness seemed like an Old Testament prophet coming out of nowhere and and people wanted to be really sure That they were ready to face God because if God was coming and they weren't ready Well, they had the old stories they God People who stepped out of line could could find themselves dead and so John was baptizing for the forgiveness of sins and part of we know about of what we know about John the Baptist was that this Was a really really big movement and in fact The Gospel of Mark records that the whole Jewish country so the whole Judean Countryside and all the people of Jerusalem now, obviously there's some hyperbole here and in Spanish we used to say todo el mundo everybody Excuse me everybody in the world And that's what it felt like I'm sure that everyone was going out to hear John and John was John was telling them things and and they thought could this be an Old Testament prophet? What could we be in a time where God is going to move and act again? And and maybe God will redeem his people from the Romans and maybe God will will get the the the those who are collaborating with the Romans like the the Herodians and the and the and the Aristocrats off of our back. Maybe God is going to do wonders. Maybe there'll be miracles Maybe there'll be a great prophet and everything will be changed They were they were confessing their sins and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River this this process of confessing and This was this is something that people often do when they're desperate when when something happens Let's say their life is at their their life Something happens they have a car accident and they they have a guilty conscience and they need to they need to get it off Their chest they need to have a clean slate They need to have a fresh start so they start confessing their sins and baptism is a fresh start baptism kind of has a dual Understanding of both washing away sins, but also of going down into the watery sea and Coming up again a new person now you see all of these all of these mythological elements that that we began by talking about in terms of the upper world and the underworld and so in the when I was a missionary with the Haitians when when a Haitian would go down and be baptized they would often thrash around in the water and Why are you thrashing around in the water? Well, well the the spirits are trying to not let go of you And so the pastor would often take the take the person and put them down and they would dunk them a number of times Until finally the spirits would leave the person's body and they would be wholly devoted to God and it's it's quite ancient in fact that baptism was associated with Exorcism and so there was very much a sense in in the time and the place and the culture that People weren't right with God and their sinfulness was was probably a reason for their Subjugation and so John out there by the Jordan was beckoning them to to get a clean slate to make a new start To go down into the water and come up a new person John wore clothes made of hamels of camel's hair with a leather belt around his race waist and he ate locusts and wild honey Now now this is important because Elijah the prophet Elijah was the one who wore these clothes and if you remember our stories about Elijah Elijah was the one who confronted Ahab King Ahab who had married Jezebel and Jezebel had brought the bales into Samaria and so Ahab was the king who was the king of the King who was accommodating to the more powerful Empire and of course the people there could associate that with the Herod family accommodating themselves to the Roman Empire and Contaminating the people and contaminating the culture and and leading the people astray And so this was a new Elijah who would come and and just like the old Elijah stood up to King Ahab and the old Elijah oversaw the slaughter of the prophets of Baal at Carmel Maybe this new Elijah who is coming out of the desert coming out of the wilderness one who doesn't live off of civilization One who isn't dependent on the farming economy in order to live someone who is living hand-to-mouth directly from God maybe he's coming with fire and now he will stand up to Herod and and then the Romans will get their due and God will purify the land the land and God will purify the people and great things will happen There was likely a palpable sensation that God was about to move and Everybody wanted to be on the right side of this struggle and so they went down and they got a clean slate And they confessed their sins and they came into the water and they came out new people and they were anxious and ready for God to act Now and This was the message After me comes one more powerful than I the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie I baptize you with water But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit Well, this was this was ordeal and this just raised the expectation that that someone was coming after him that God would that God would now come back to his people and God would Set the house in order you think of Odysseus going back to his family and and all these stories in the ancient world of people returning what God was going to come and he would handle the Romans and he would make sure that Herod got his due and someone coming is going to clean up this mess and again Everyone is getting baptized because they want to be on the right side and John is so impressive with his camel hair and his belt and all of this and he says I'm not even worthy to be the most lowly servant of this person who is coming and they would probably imagine the kind of being that you'd see in the the first chapter of the Book of Revelation someone who's whose skin whose whose face shines like the Sun and his hair is fire and a Two-edged sword comes out of his mouth and when he speaks you hear the sound of rushing waters You can find these stories in the Old Testament read the book of Ezekiel read the book of Daniel Everyone is primed for God to act It's an everyday apocalypse Do you feel like life is crazy and the world is about to end or fall apart? Do you feel like there were times in the past when you didn't feel this way? Well, this this is pretty common throughout history We we often have a sense of these feelings desperate people do Exceptional things sometimes to their doom sometimes to their salvation It's a journey into the wild and and this is why we're so fascinated with With McCandless who went out into the wild something deep within us Wants to wants to do this wants to be tested wants to go out there where where it's just us and nature Or me and God and and and see what God can how I can be made new how how I can be Remade and restored and and what can happen? At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan Now this makes us pause right away because Via theology we would say well Jesus didn't have any sin to be baptized by so so Jesus baptism is It's a little bit more particular and a little stranger and this actually comes through and in the Gospel of Matthew When when there's a little bit of dialogue surrounding this but again mark is so short and so brief and so Apocalyptic and so live and so on the edge that boom. He just lays it out here and we're left to wonder Why why is Jesus being baptized Just as Jesus was coming out of the water now notice that detail now again This is a this is a short gospel But but the details are important as he's coming out of the water Not as he's going in because the coming out of the water is the new self It's the it's the one who's passed through the trial the one who's gone under the sea not unlike Jonah the one who who is Emerged supernaturally from the ordeal he comes out of the water He saw heaven being torn open only mark uses that word torn He saw heaven being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove and a voice came from heaven You are my son whom I love with you I am well pleased now this whole son businesses is strange to us But it wouldn't be strange to them because the sons of the kings were princes and they spoke with their father's authority And they came to the far-off land and they exercised the authority of the king While being the heir apparent and and everybody wanted to get in good with the Sun because if you could get in good with the Well when then when the Sun came into his kingdom you would be friends with the king And so right there you have all of this coming together and the spirit descending on him like a dove Well, what does that mean? well that goes back to the flood and Noah and and when Noah is in the ark and not wondering and Wondering when will these waters abide he sends out the dove and it comes back with nothing Then he sends out the dove later and it comes back with an olive branch And that's where we get this whole all these sayings about coming with an olive branch And and so the dove is a messenger of good news and the Spirit of God that that Jesus is going to baptize with Well here it is and their expectations are raised and heightened and who might this man be will his face start to shine like the Sun Will he have a two edged sword come out of his mouth? Will he stand up and kick out the Romans and and put Herod's the Herod's in their place? What will he do? He's got the he's got the authority of God in heaven above and he's he's come out of the water and he's ready to go At once and again, this is typical of Mark's gospel at once the spirit who was directing things sends him out where? Into the wilderness so you have the watery wilderness sound like Elmer fun the water we wilderness the watery wilderness and and Then the dry wilderness and she goes out into the wilderness. Well, why is he going now again? The other two Gospels have more details in this but but Mark doesn't have any time for this It's it's the moment is now it's it's time to make a decision How will you live he went into the wilderness 40 days why 40 days well 40 years Israel lived in the wilderness 40 days and 40 nights the the waters came down from heaven and drowned the earth and Noah's time This is all biblical resonance and he goes out into the wilderness. Why to be tested He's tested by Satan. He's going to be tempted. He's going to be tested. You can't have your leader be not tested And he was with the wild animals only Mark has this only Mark notes that he's out in this place outside of civilization just like the place John the Baptist comes and angels attended him You get the picture from mark that big things are coming on an apocalyptic level in a in a in a special way This Jesus is the champion and he's about to go toe-to-toe But with who Now the questions are being raised these are going to be the questions that the people have for him will he come out of the wilderness and stride into Jerusalem and and and clean the Romans out of the Antonia Fortress and and find good old Herod and Cast him from his throne and set up a throne and and start bit by bit to put Israel back on the map like it was in the time of King David But then John gets put in prison Well, well, well if this is God's show if this is God's movement if this if this prophet is coming with power out of the desert How could he go in prison? You mean Herod's gonna win and of course skeptics will say yeah There's only the power of the sword and and Jesus goes to Galilee, which is Galilee of the Gentiles Which is well where where it's not the epicenter of Jewish faith or power. It's it's the backwater where where it's just it's just regular regular people trying to make a living in the midst of the of the Multitudes and mobs of of and the diverse Roman Empire But he goes up there and he starts proclaiming the good news Well, what good news is this? Well mark set us up for it. This is the good news of of God's intervention This is the good news of God's red of God's revelation And Jesus says the time has come and the Greek word used there's two Greek words for time One is Kronos, which is kind of ongoing time and one is Kairos, which is the moment the moment has come He said the kingdom of God has come near repent and believe the good news And people hear him and they notice and they wonder What kind of good news will this be is? Is is Jesus gonna kick out the Romans are are we going to have a great economy or are we going to be able to make? Slaves of our surrounding neighbors like we did under King David is is Jesus going to Displace Caesar and are we going to rule the world just like the Romans world rule the world now is is God the our God? finally going to come in and and Show up all the false gods of the other nations and the pre and the and the gods of the other peoples Well our God finally raises is this good news is this the good news he is bringing? Now this is not a safe story And there is no safe space if you could coon up and wrap your wrap your kids in bubble wrap They will die of boredom and anxiety If you head into the wild you may die of starvation and self poisoning like those potato seeds that That Chris McCandless ate You won't have any choice about it You likely won't have any choice about it because you can't really control your lives Messengers emerge from the edges. How will you respond to them? How do you know who's the charlatan? How do you know who's true people people come with with fascinating stories and for a while they they they catch fire and everybody Pays attention to them and we think oh well. Well. This is it. This is what's coming But that's happened before Will you lock your door or to your house or your room and stay safe? Will you go out to the waters of chaos will you repent and believe? Will you will you try to get on the right side of this new coming kingdom or will you double down? With what you've already known This is what we do Now in this Excuse me in this story God tears open heaven But it doesn't look like we all thought it should the Holy Spirit descends not like fire not like Apocalypse but like a dove not like the space monsters in a Marvel Comics movie the voice of God validates the Sun, but the Sun is strange and We struggle to understand him He is often gentle with those we think God should be harsh with and he's often harsh with those We think God should be kind towards And so we watch him and we ponder and we wait Jesus demands we make a choice Not choosing is Choosing bubble wrap is he a liar? Is he a lunatic? Is he who he says he is? Can that be believed? What has he come to do and what has he come to do with you? Now as most of you know some of my favorite stories are from JRR Tolkien And they've been turned to movies and Peter Jackson didn't do so well with The Hobbit in my opinion but I Love the scene when Gandalf comes to to eat to Bilbo to young Bilbo and And Gandalf wants to take Bilbo on an adventure The Bilbo doesn't want to go on an adventure Bilbo has it his hobbit's hole Bilbo wants to stay and enjoy his meals and have nothing ever happening Enjoy his meals and have nothing ever happened to him But Gandalf won't let him so What is it? When bad things come into our life? What is it when the unexpected and the strange? Emerge and and we're not sure what to do Can we trust? now Bilbo strangely runs from it hot as hobbit's hole and Embarks on the adventure an adventure that could take his life Now the question is when word comes from the wild when when the man with the the man with the camel's hair and and Who eats honey honey and locust shows up and says you'd better straighten out right now Because the God of the world is coming What do you do? And what do you do when that one who's who sandals that the crazy man he says he can't even untie them He comes with comes with power comes with vindication and validation by God and He comes with an olive branch What do we do? How do we respond? How will we live? After we hear him You
