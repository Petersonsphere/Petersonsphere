Thank you again Gentlemen want to just basically we get I guess since Vash is taking the affirmative and kind of let him get the ball rolling In terms of why he would take his stance and then from there is just kind of right into the discussion So Vash the floor is yours Yeah, absolutely. Thank you very much So Jordan B Peterson is a figure that I've had conflicted feelings on for a while I don't I don't personally like him very much, but then but that's largely irrelevant You know that can be aesthetic preferences when it comes to his content though when it comes to the stuff he does on one hand I don't Actually have much of a problem with the prescriptive judgments he makes and concerns to Psychology and self-help now. Now I now I admit I'm not you know, I don't have a doctorate in psychology I don't really have the professional background to understand the extent of and the nature of the claims that he makes or their validity specifically, but the broader Takes that he has for example the need of order in one's life to take care of your of your surroundings To be prescient to be disciplined and responsible to take happiness as a measure from one's accomplishment To not allow yourself that such-and-such, you know chaos is a dragon. I Don't actually disagree with a lot of that And there are probably a lot of young men There are a lot of young men who stand to benefit from that advice and in that respect I have nothing but respect where my problems come in is that he is not actually known For his self-help he achieved prominence when he published that video series following the voting into law the the legislation c16 in Canada and he did that he he did this very This very performative. Oh political correctness free speech on campus I will not be arrested for my views kind of thing and you know, it's fun and glad and dandy But he's his political takes his historical takes basically everything he does that deviates from his from his background from his field are deeply troubling I mean, there's the obvious and inescapable Sort of misogyny behind many of his propositions chaos is feminine Women wearing lipstick in the workplace we don't know if men and women can work together there are a lot of views there that I take issue with but Last but not least and I guess I shouldn't you know, Gish gallop the main one that really gets me is his Neocultural mark I'm actually forgetting the particular way he strings together these words these Neo Marxist postmodernists or neo postmodern postmodern neo-marxist. There we go. It's Leaving aside the the problems in that terminology He he propagates this myth and this is a very troubling myth to me because it leads inexorably towards fascism and it is the myth that our institutions are crumbling under the weight of a conspiracy a far-left Culturally Marxist conspiracy theory that has infiltrated essentially every aspect of Western society that is now enforcing its its its authority by forcing us to use perhaps gender pronouns, you know that the recipient wishes to have used on them and this is essentially fascist propaganda, it's Mostly indistinguishable from cultural Bolshevism the conspiracy theory that was so loved by the neat the Nazis the Nazis And it makes me wonder how much of this is poisoning the discourse How many young men are getting a good sale on personal life advice mixed in with a lot of bad? That's what I worry about Okay, you bet all yours Paul. Oh well The question to me was interesting because I don't really know how many people he's hurt but I Got interested in Jordan Peterson Not so much because of the culture war issues. Those things caught my attention. I didn't know why a professor of psychology at University of Toronto would be kvetching over And over gender fluid pronouns what caught my attention was the fact that I Heard a lot of people listening to him and saying things like they're interested in the Bible and they're interested in going to church and As a pastor I listened to this and I listened to Jordan Peterson and I noted He's not much of an institution builder. And so then my concern was who was going to come after Jordan Peterson with the people that he is talking to and help them find something a little bit a little bit more sustainable to work on their lives with and so then what I did was I you know, I made a video about Jordan Peterson I Intended maybe to get some other interested conversation partners and what began to happen was I started getting a steady stream of emails and requests for speaking to people and as that happened I started making having conversations with people who had been watching Jordan Peterson Quite a bit and as I began talking to those people I began sharing some of those conversations online when with the consent of the people that I was discussing it with and Discovering that a good number of people found themselves finding relief from depression and probably probably depression from nihilism or something of them of something of that fact and Finding themselves feeling a lot better performing better having some motivation to work on their personal lives to work on their relationships and I've just spent the last two years mostly talking to people that have pretty much said my life is better because I Listened to Jordan Peterson and he I followed his you know some of his advice like do what is meaningful not as not what's expedient and Along the way my life is better and what I've done as a pastor is Try to gather these people together so that they could support each other and make good goals and keep moving forward And in that group have been mostly men but but a certain probably 20% of them have been women Many of the women that began to follow me and seek out conversation with me were mothers Probably who had seen sons and nephews who had been struggling in school and after listening to Jordan Peterson Actually began to get their lives on track So I'm uncertain as to how many people have been hurt by Jordan Peterson But I've got a pretty good sense of how many people have been helped by him I am okay is are we are we moving into open debate or is there a you bet gotcha gotcha. Hell, yeah Oh, oh, yeah, I'm so I'm so happy. I was afraid we were gonna have like another like Like bad faith shouting match. This is fantastic Okay, so I don't disagree with anything that you said I Strongly disagree not sorry disagree. That's a very light word for what I feel I despise the alienation that has gripped so many people in our society, you know the This this detachment for oneself one the detachment from an ability to sort of pursue meaningful work And there are a ton of there are so many um There are so many disciplines that try to pursue this question for example like the the anti-capitalist Wrote like method of describing this would be like alienations from one work and one's community brought about by the material like modernization of social student and the Commodification of life, you know, but there's a million ways that you can approach that I would love very much so to help Or to or to see people help with their depression. My concern though is Have you ever heard I don't know how much you like what like horrid corners of the internet you like poke your head into from time to time have you ever heard of a A place called the red the red pill I've heard of the red pill. Sure. Oh, yeah. Okay I'm glad its reputation proceeds. It's this community and I don't know how much exactly, you know But it's it's a community on on reddit though. It has like branches elsewhere and it's it's a very virulently heterogeneous, homogenistic self-help community that advocates men are like intrinsically superior to women and women should women women should be like the the the second in command of their own lives and men need to be strong and learn how to Manipulate women's emotions in order to maximize their gain out of life and women enjoy this process because women are designed to be like emotionally subservient and And the red pill isn't as relevant as it used to be but I remember back in the day when talking about whether or not This was a horrid place people people would say like This place is disgusting. It's filled with virulent misogyny These people talk about like why rape should be legal like these people are beyond the pale and then somebody else would say true Okay, fine fair. However, they have given me a lot of advice, you know go outside You got to exercise eat clean and they would list off these like self-help tidbits that like that resonated with them to which the the response you know is Don't you think there are there are other ways and from other communities that you could have learned those messages and That's my problem with JBP and you I think might Partially agree with that because you if I'm understanding what you said correctly You're of the opinion that there's not much longevity to the advice that he offers because it's centered almost around a cult of personality he holds I Don't know if the advice centers around a cult personality but I think we've I think now since his retreat from the stage because of the I think the illness of his wife and then his hospitalization. I think that sort of marks the end of At least the first Jordan Peterson wave We have we have yet to see if there'll be a second wave When he publishes his new book if he does another speaking tour many of the people who have watched his videos Reached a saturation point at some point and so they they got motivated to clean up their room But again as a pastor, I know that people can go to a church service They can see hear a sermon or see a presentation they can be moved and they can make all kinds of pledges to improve their lives But what does it take to actually improve your life that we are far more shaped by our habits Than our by our habits than we are by our intentions And so the community that has gathered around me I Highly doubt too many misogynists would want to listen to one to two hour Messages and conversations by a Christian minister because they're not going to get that sort of anti-woman slant And so that's that hasn't been the community that has gathered around me whether some people would pick up certain strains of what Jordan has to say and interpret it in a misogynist or in you know in a Certain light Peterson himself has on a various occasions rejected this this alt-right tag And I think I think reasonably so because at least I mean Canadian politics are a little bit to the left of American politics And if you listen to a lot of his older messages He was sort of a moderate Canadian in terms of I mean he believes in the Canadian health care system and all of this so In terms of tracking him in that way, but people are prone to listen to messages and interpret it in the ways That they find useful and then propagate it with their own slants and so that people would take this with his messages That's fine But I I don't know what if there will be a chapter 2 for Jordan Peterson on the public stage Like there was a chapter 1 and so my intention was well those people who have been energized and motivated by his message What can I do to build a community around them to make their lives better that's been my goal Okay, yeah, I think I mean I think that's an extremely reasonable goal what well obviously I think it's an admirable one what So so distancing Peterson from the the community He often fosters which I think anyone could charitably describe perhaps as a mixed bag you've experienced From his community a group of people who are earnest in their desire to seek self-improvement and not bog down with the with the Milo of reactionary politics what specific? What specific pieces of advice do you think he offers that really resonate with? With the people who need that help like I know that obviously like to clean clean your room I know I know that's like a classic one But in your experience what parts of what he says like really hit home with those people I I think so so for many of the people a lot of the The impact they received at least again This is part of a this is part of a sample bias because I'm a Christian minister And I started making commentaries on his biblical series So then my question was and really I got into him and started studying him because I wanted to know why There are you know thousands of churches including my own that have plenty of empty seats and this Canadian Psychologist could fill a Moderately sized concert hall in Toronto charging 40 bucks a seat selling out each time giving two plus hour Lectures on the Bible. I mean, what is that about? And to me it showed a hunger in our society for a level Well for a certain kind of biblical commentary of all things That people had an intense hunger for and those people who listened to it couldn't really tell me What they were getting out of it and so that drove me to ask those questions and to Try to figure out what on earth is going on and I think it has a lot to do with the the emptiness of a secular life and the resonance that Our connection to the past via Nearly, you know very the age-old stories offers to people who look around and say what what why am I alive? What does it matter? And You know, that was obviously something that in terms of my church background I'm equipped to do so I pursued it and I think that part has been more significant than You know his twelve rules for life yet, you know Some of the rules I think are are helpful But I don't think the Jordan Peterson impact has anything to do with the little cliched Rules and bits of advice that he gives because a lot of that stuff has been around forever And a lot of mothers were a little bit annoyed by the fact that their son started listening to this guy Saying stuff that they had been telling their son. Yeah. Yeah mom and dad saying for 20 years. Yeah, exactly Okay, wait, hold on. I got to challenge you on that Do you feel there's an inherent emptiness to secular life or do you think that secularity might course or like there might be a correlation? Between the two I think a lot of people felt a void So there's been another Canadian psychologist that I've done some work with named John Berveke And and he's he's labeled what he calls a meaning crisis now This isn't new you can you can pretty much pervasive throughout the 20th century People have been struggling with meaning and nihilism and and meaning actually is See for Jordan Peterson meaning is a sacrament. It connects us to the transcendent and the divine and I think a lot of people struggled with meaning especially men because I don't think men Men in our There's a whole lot here before the age of 22 many people in our society are given no responsibility and They're expected to just keep going through school until they get out of college and then maybe someone will give them a responsibility which is a very different thing from how human beings have lived for just about the rest of human history and I think what Jordan Peterson helped put on the map is that Their life does mean something and they should get going with it and some people took him up at his offer and discovered Yeah, that's that's really important. And but again, I saw that You're motivated to do something in a minute. You're gonna need Yeah, I don't I mean I don't disagree that this is typically a problem that men face especially because masculinity has seen so much Deconstruction over the past 50 years in a way that I don't believe femininity has And then there are a wide variety of social reasons for that. And I mean, I'm a gender abolitionist I support that process. I don't want there to be men or women or anything really but I do recognize that as they exist now men as the construct are struggling and I do want something done about that. The issue that I have here is that it's very easy to It's very easy to ascribe solutions that end up having really bad consequences down the road after all the the the Characteristic alienated young man, you know lonely not particularly good with women. These is all fairly rote tropes This is the this is the pool from which pretty much all political radicalization stems from whether that be far-left socialist Whether that be Isis suicide bomber This is like the this is like the the the the miss the still water mosquito breeding ground From which you can get a lot of really extreme political views And I think it's unfortunate that a lot of people are brought about to political radicalization through what is essentially loneliness and alienation but I'm also worried that some attempts to fix that might end up leading these people down roads that are Unsustainable or or or actively detrimental to society Which is why and I have to bring it back to this I in your experience You've met a lot of people who have benefited from JBP's teachings or at least the message resonated. That's great I wouldn't no problem with that The issue I have is that in the context of his broader popularity Which is aligned for the most part with right-leaning politics What was him getting his start with the trans pronoun thing and C 16 and such and such? It feels as though it's very difficult to distinguish people who genuinely could benefit from JBP and his advice and his outlook and People who are just along for the ride who might end up going down a really bad road a year or two or three Down that way and there are secular people I know too who have jumped in on JBP quite a few of them and It's probably not for his biblical talks. It's probably for the political ascriptions that he sort of pushes into his self-help rhetoric I Think Jordan Peterson was something of a Rorschach test a lot of people Gathered around him from a lot of different Agenda areas one of the things that I did early on so I started making videos and people are like well people in Sacramento Started talking to me. Well, we should do a meetup and I thought Okay, I've got a church building. I'm used to leading small groups. Let's do a meetup and so I You know put something on meetup.com and people started coming and I began to who's gonna show up to this thing most of the mostly men probably again eight out of ten were men and I was curious are these going to be the proverbial basement dwellers who are living in their mom's basement covered with Cheetos dust Playing video games and looking at porn all day most of the men that showed up were in fact doing very well in terms of you know They had a job they they're earning very good money. They're they're actually quite well put together many of them single A few people struggling in some of those ways that that we imagine Jordan's followers were one of the things that came out very quickly is that many of the men are dealing with a difficulty in terms of what I call the generational handshake and Which is men and women finding each other establishing a stable monogamous relationship having children and Being able to manage a marriage which is not an easy thing for anyone being able to marriage manage a marriage Well for the long term. I think part of what got people's interest is Ironically Jordan Peterson comes out and starts Advocating for some of these traditional positions and so that's why a lot of conservatives sort of gathered around him but What I so it was it was interesting because I suddenly have this group of men around me And my wife goes off to Tahoe with a group of friends and she comes back to me and says you know Do you know any guys who are like in their mid-30s and have good careers on our single? Because I just spent the whole weekend with a whole bunch of 30 something Who have been successful in their careers and they would love nothing better than to find a man to settle down with and so What we've seen I think is good news fellows Well except you know most of the men in my group are just a little bit too young and the difficulty is that I think you're right in that Society for the last 40 50 years has been trying to renegotiate What what it means to be a woman in our society and so there have been it there's been a tremendous amount of emphasis and focus on that aspect and there's been relatively little work done on the on the Men's side of the equation and so what we have right now is We have a lot of men and a lot of women who have a lot of dissatisfaction with whether men and women can find each other and Settle down and get married have children and continue the species and So I don't know and Jordan Peterson sort of came out and said you know what you should You know you should stop living with your girlfriend You should marry her and you should settle down and form a family I found a lot of women who are I I was I find a lot of women who are actually quite excited to hear that someone is telling men to stop using women for sex and to make a Commitment and to actually be a man which means follow through with your word Make a commitment stay in there when times are hard because that's what it means to be a man and People got that message from Jordan Peterson, and I thought that's a positive message So I Agree with what you've said there has been reconstruction done in what we understand femininity to mean and not so much done in regards To men I know and I say this because I live stream You know I talked to a decent number of people there are a lot of dudes who have absolutely no idea how they're meant to live Their lives on one hand. There's the archetypically masculine the hegemonic you know you just get your job and you settle down you marry, you know quickly and you have the children and And then on the other hand like many of the social institutions that made that a viable choice 40 50 years ago are starting to wear a bit a lot of the social and literal institutions What with the wages not rising to meet cost of living standards? and it leaves people in a bit of a bit of a bind when it comes to where to move forward from that point and I Don't I don't know if what Jordan B Peterson advocates this sort of Christian traditionalism is that way I don't know I don't know if it's sustainable in the long run it feels to me like everything that we had upon which that gender dynamic was built is on a train and it is hurtling towards a mountainside and What Jordan B Peterson is doing is? Making sure people don't jump off the train before it hits. I feel like the the systems he's trying to advocate for are Worn thin they're wearing and What we're going to see even in regards to the people who are just earnestly interested in self-help is that a little bit down The line they've moved forward without realizing the rugs kind of been shuffled a little bit to the side I imagine we're probably going to see people who in their pursuit of sort of a traditional gender dynamic Aren't really capable of keeping up with society's rapidly evolving expectations for how people are supposed to behave it's in essence a reactionary wave a response to alienation from society with what has worked for centuries, but may no longer and that's why I'm I'm hoping You say that JB peas self-help may not have the longevity it needs I'm hoping that if something comes next or something substitutes that it might be a little bit more Institutional it might be a more Interested in tackling what it is with society that is causing people's problems then the idea that a a dearth and personal discipline and traditional responsibility are Responsible for the loneliness and absence that so many men feel you know what I mean Yeah, I'm not sure what what you what you're referring to when you talk about the train hurtling towards the mountainside What what is that train or what's on that train? I feel like the traditional gendered expectations Jordan Peterson talks about it a lot himself You know, we don't know the rules for how men and women are supposed to work together in the workplace and as Segments of the society become more sort of progressive marriage is becoming less and less of a viable option for people It's a marriage rates are declining divorce rates increasing. I feel like This this almost it's not necessarily countercultural this this revival of cultural efforts to Impose traditional gender standards might inadvertently put people in a position where they are forced to break rather than bend Not meaningfully address what's going on with society and try to rectify that with your personal expectations But rather stoically continue the course to plant your feet firmly on the ground and act well and act Traditionally and act like a man in spite of whatever might change Between now and the future and that's a little worrying for me I don't know. I don't know how that's going to pan out in the long run. You know what I mean? Yeah from what I'm seeing it's that Women women are being so I did a meetup in San Francisco Just actually it's gorgeous city and I did a meetup in San Francisco in conjunction with a Jordan Peterson event the The people setting up the event offered me a room to do a meetup and you know I could get tickets sold and stuff a Fair number of women came to that meetup that don't usually come to my Sacramento meetups And most of those women were in their mid-30s and a lot of these women were angry Because a lot of these women said when I was in my 20s people told me my career would be fulfilling and I've pursued my career and I've been very successful and now I'm in my mid-30s and I look at my mother's life Who had children and a husband and a home and I think she made the better choice and I feel robbed Now I also talked to men that I remember talking to one man and he was in his he's in his 30s And he had been together there with his girlfriend lived with her for about three or four years and He told me he said she's been she's been putting more and more pressure on to make a commitment and get married and have a child and I kind of feel like the Relationship has plateaued and there's a there's an opportunity in another city and so I'm kind of thinking maybe of of You know, he didn't say it but basically a ditching and what he had done is Lived with his girlfriend for the last four years or so which for him You know, he moves to another cities in his mid-30s finds another girlfriend Maybe in her 20s or 30s and moves on with this life this and you know, hey no harm no foul I never promised you anything. But in the meantime, that's a strategy. That's right This woman has spent four years of her life investing in him and getting nothing out of it I now know more and more women now in their 30s looking at in vitro Fertilization in order to try to have a child without a man Now I have I have had five kids and so I I know with my wife and I've been together 31 years I know what it takes to raise a child and it is not easy and it is not getting easier and so People keep talking about well this traditional this traditional landscape. Maybe that won't work I have yet to see someone that has is proposing that something that would work especially for children Because what I've seen in talking to a good many people is that the nihilism and the depression? almost all of them have told me stories about their parents breaking up and Their parents their father's new girlfriend or their mother's new boyfriend and on and on I don't see a lot of hope in that in that line and I don't have a lot of confidence that we're just gonna make Something up that works better than what we've done before as difficult as what we've done before has been I I I worry that a lot of the a lot of the descriptions we make of past times are Tainted by rose-colored glasses a lot of people this is commonly cited For example a lot of people speak about how Women are now less happy than they were back before it was commonly accepted for a woman to work that women's Liberation in the workplace has or sorry liberation in the workplace has has come at a cost to their happiness And that makes a kind of intuitive sense after all I mean It's work is you know And it's probably not as intuitively fulfilling as as raising a family as people everyone loves raising families I mean being around kids. I think these are just dopamine machines I know I know I'm sorry. Do you have any children? No, I did on I'm I know I was and I was about to say Caveat not a parent. I don't know. I like kids. They're nice, you know, I can't devil to raise I do not doubt it. I do not doubt it, but I think fundamentally people like raising kids and in a broader spiritual sense and But at the same time, you know There are a lot of things we'd like to gloss over when we look at how the traditional dynamic happened sort of in the past Back it with the with the nuclear family, you know when it was more common We can choose an arbitrary time period 50 60s, but there was a there was a lot of abuse In fact spousal rape wasn't even recognized until fairly recently in some states and there was a lot of I think genuine unhappiness that was painted over by the By the expectation that everyone keep going and pretend everything's fine that stiff upper lip mentality That's not to say it's necessarily worse than what we have now, but the reason why things fell apart I don't think is because of like Feminism or radical progressive or cultural Marxism or anything like that I think it's rather because the economic circumstances that allowed people to support themselves and the nuclear family just kind of fell apart You can no longer live off one income in a family at least not not for 90% of Americans So now people are working gig jobs the the unemployment is incredibly low But under employment is radically high people don't really know if in six months they're gonna have the same job people don't really have a sense of attachment to their workplace and People are owning homes with less and less often more and more empty properties are getting bought up by by exorbitantly wealthy companies that are using them as like Investment opportunities and it seems like the American dream is dying and I think those gender roles were part of the American dream I and and this is where this is where I unveil my true power level Because I I believe that humans work best Operating communally. I think that one of the most Horrific things that that modern liberalism like capitalism the that you know anything post-enlightenment One of the most horrid things it's done to us is it's forced us off to cordoned us into these little Suburban boxes where you don't know the name of your neighbor across the street where you you work gig jobs You barely know the name of your employees before you're fettered out to work your next you You're alienated and I think that's what people are suffering from really and it happens in our relationships, too Nobody has the monetary Sent to commit there's no the bedrock is gone. It's just people now Lonely and and trying not to end up on the street, which is easy There are a lot of support programs out there. At least it's easy for some but to live comfortably that is incredibly hard now and I wonder if we couldn't accommodate this this new frenetic life which will surely soon see changes with a Different type of dynamic a different way of addressing that alienation socialism Throwing it in at the end Slide it underneath the paper slip under this Socialism You know, I agree with a lot of what you a lot of what you're saying It's interesting. However that in almost every case women initiate divorce Yet divorce is almost always catastrophic for the women and children and so whereas I certainly agree with you that the The past the past let's say the the past corporate model where in the 50s and 60s you had the company man who had a pension being managed by the corporation and good job security and Sufficient income so that his wife could you know, stay home with the kids I think a lot of people would give their eye teeth for that today and and that's simply gone And so there's there's no question in my mind I've lived and worked most of my life in black communities in America. My father Planted a church in the struggling black community of the First Ward of Patterson, New Jersey I live in a multi everything community in Sacramento, California and The the economic factors undermining many of these communities ability to sustain a marriage is significant on the other hand and I very much agree with you that Humans work best operating communally and as a pastor what I would say is that the question is how can people work? Communally because the struggles that people have work in community are sometimes financial but again in most cases Even if there's one of the members of the family is marginally or underemployed the other member of the family is better employed You've still got two income earners if they can get along, you know managing to keep one household together and generally speaking Financially people do better that way I've known people there was one young man who was coming to church for a while and his parents were divorced and still living together They hated each other's guts, but they couldn't afford to live separately and so On one hand there certainly is the economic aspect But on the other hand what it actually takes to for for two people to get along over 20 30 years goes way beyond some romantic notions of love and I completely agree with you that a big part of this has been the demise of institutions and institutional learning that not only Encourages people to work hard on their marriages and their relationships with the people with which they share a home but also provide support to help them get along in Many cases if a marriage is in crisis within six years they'll work it out if they can stick with it and work on it and Negotiate it out and and there are you know, just the way that the society is structured now And I think it's a good thing that society, you know A woman can get out of a marriage just as easily as a man can today And I think that's a good thing the difficulty that we have are when people come into marriage with sort of a selfish personal Aspect that says I'm gonna stay in this relationship for as long as it suits me You're never gonna be able to build a marriage on that and there's going to have to be another foundation Upon which the relationship needs needs to stand for the marriage to be sustainable and have really legs going into the future Okay, 100% agreed. I Think I think two points to that the first thing that I would ask So I okay so I I'm really split on this on one hand and I can be open about my position on this I Believe very much in like polyamory I want like polycules to be an ideal relationship I think that people are generally stronger in structures of more than two people Obviously as being young have met plenty of people who have less than successful, you know Triage's into that type of lifestyle but I but I think that under certain circumstances it can produce pretty stable bonds and I wouldn't Be opposed to seeing this explored kind of as a broader model. So my bias here is evident and Sometimes I do think in that way that you just described rather disparagingly this I'm in here for my own benefit Excluding a kid, by the way, of course, I don't have a child I wouldn't just like ditching a child, but I'm here for my benefit and I'm not having fun. I can dip That's my right. I have that right and on one hand there is some validity to that. I get one life, you know I I don't believe in after life personally even you would agree. We have one life here I've got you know my one chance. I don't I don't want more than one here. That's Reincarnation folks reincarnation you want to come around again? Listen okay, don't don't depress my chat It's listen look life is suffering it's good character building the god I How do you how do you strike a happy balance between getting people to commit and I mean that in the healthiest way imaginable Not like to your dying breath you're bound But how do you get people to invest in one another without getting people to paint over the red flags? Because abuse and relationships is like a really common thing In every segment of society every race every type of relationship homosexual heterosexual every age this happens like a lot and the ability to divorce easily is Good in a way because it lets people get out of that situation Unless they have kids or unless they don't have the money to but on the other hand a frivolity of thought when we When we approach relationships probably does lead to us feeling kind of empty at the end of the day How do you how do you find a working ground between? painting over abuse and horrid relationships people should get out of and Encouraging people to stick it out to be together A couple nights ago, I I watched the Netflix I watched the this the documentary surviving R. Kelly and That was a fascinating program in turn. That was a hot one. Yeah Oh wow And so, you know, you've got you've got women who are living in separate rooms in his studio Who you know are peeing into a bucket and have to check in with him to leave their room And he's having them and all kinds of different permutations taking videotapes of it a bunch of these women are underage and Towards the end of it There's one mother who is trying to get her daughter out of there after nine years And you know, there's no there's you know, they haven't been able to lock this man up Because none of the women seem to want to you know Go to court and say yeah, this is what he did. And so that I think is an illustration of just how tricky Psychologically dynamics of abuse can be and anyone who's who's dealt with battered women and some of those dynamics know just how just how difficult this can be when you really have a monster manipulator Someone like R. Kelly at least that that program certainly portrayed him to be so that is certainly that is certainly something I think deep I think the deep problem with our Contemporary approach is simply this we look at people as means to an end This person or even this relationship is a way to make me happy and and that's the commodification Of other human beings and I believe that human beings are not to be used but are to be loved Now you have the question now, then we say well, how can we get people to well, first of all, let me tell you as the pastor There's no getting people to do anything You know, I I make a living talking to people and telling what they're all willing to Support me saying to them and then turning around and not wanting to do it because it is not natural for us to love in the kind of ways we all want to be loved and What it takes and I think you're very much when you say humans work best operating in community Because what it takes is for the community to be Gathered and focused and an agreement around certain values and factors such as human beings are to be loved and not used And what that means when you go into a marriage is that you say I am not going into this marriage for my happiness I am going into this marriage for the sake of the other now There's definitely that can get twisted in an abusive relationship and that certainly does happen and there needs to be intervention when that does happen But what it takes is for one person to basically say I'm going to lay down my life for another person You know usually not to that extreme But you when you have a child you lay down your life for that child because there's no more Selfish individual in the world than a newborn because that newborn wakes up in the middle of the night and says I want to be fed I want to be changed. I want it right now you talk to that newborn all you want it ain't going to make a difference And so what we do and what marriage actually teaches us is to learn to love and what love means is to lay down our life And give our lives for others and How do you how do you create a community where where people live that way and are surrounded by that value? Well, that's what I do as a pastor. We as a society have looked at that and said, yeah, we don't think we want that. It's like, okay But then you get that then you get the consequence of people saying I want to find someone who's going to make me happy Well, that's sort of a nice way of saying i'm going to use this other person for my happiness and i'd say long term Whether it's two people or three people or four people it doesn't work There are a lot I can see in my chat scrolling by there are a lot of people who like that take To clarify, I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point Um To clarify, what do you mean by it's not natural to love someone in the way? In the way, uh, you want to be loved I think all of us would like to imagine we can be with someone who will love for us And care for us and let's say something would happen to us. We'd get in a car accident We'd get alzheimer's something like this that our spouse would stand by us until the day we die That's what we all want But for that and i've i've seen enough spouses who's you know who their wife or their husband had alzheimer's or a stroke And and they you know, they they cleaned up after them They fed them they cared for them and they did it sometimes for years even decades We all want that out of others But what it takes to do to give requires not just I want to be the kind of person that takes care of my spouse It actually does take a community that has the values that Reinforce that kind of sacrificial giving and one of the things that you said earlier I think comes into that when we say in our lives. I have just one life This is my shot to get happiness and meaning and everything I want out of it If you go into life that way At some point you're going to look at the equation and say i'm sitting here tied to this person that has alzheimer's I could dump them in a hospital and no one would this person wouldn't even know they don't even remember my name And then go out and get my happiness because after all I deserve it. That's what society is saying and this is the The results we're seeing in society is what you get from that kind of valuation And now I would argue as a christian minister that actually if in this world You make this world better if you actually can imagine To say, you know what I can I can sacrifice my time and my life for this spouse that i've had a complicated relationship with but i'm going to be faithful to him or her until they die because actually I believe I have You know, I have eternity to live which will be a lot better than this place right here So I can do that now again I appreciate the fact that most of us hear that and say I don't know about that But that's because we're looking at life through one set of lenses, but we sure want our neighbors and our spouses and our children To believe that and so if we want them to believe it Well, it takes a community that actually keeps raising up those values and puts them forward And I think that's part of the reason that we have all of these ideas That well, we deserve to be loved Well, do we have what it takes to actually love Pretty convincing I um, there's a deep philosophical split on this one, I think um not even a split necessarily a split perspective or or maybe um, a um, an incongruence between two values because I agree with everything that you just said in regards to the the the Validity and loving people beyond utilitarianism the to to to be able to appreciate one's company or to um, to to care for someone even if in some broad hard numbers sense you recognize that the um The the the your life, uh, you you know utility is not being maxed out by those actions It's it's important. However to stick by those things and everyone's fondest memories of compassion and trust I think Are from people who did that if they were sick or unwell and somebody else cared for them Even though it would have made all the sense in the world for them to leave for many people This would be parents for some people. It would be a close partner For some would even be their children and and and that's what everyone wants and you're right. Not everyone has a mindset which is um Amicable towards that mentality though, I suppose if you really went back on it if you really you know, parse the numbers or something you could argue that the sublime experience of deep reciprocal Unconditional compassion between two people would maximize utility, but that's it's it's a mindset thing. Um, hmm A question then in regards to jvp then to cycle to cycle it back. I think to the man himself This is one issue that I have with him that I think extends to his self-help more specifically than it does his politics he's said Someone hypocritically it turned out because he's now, you know, i'm being taken care of for his addiction problem Which I won't make fun of I don't think that's proven at all. But um, he did say that it is um One should ensure their room is clean before trying to change the world Essentially that you should make sure your own house is in order everything's set. You're fine. You're good before Affecting change but you and I agree on something a lot of the Reason why people are experienced this horrid alienation from their life their inability to form meaningful bonds Is because a lot of the institutional structures that made those livelihoods possible and affordable have begun to crumble and this is one Key distinction I have here. I think that in many cases one's Room is unclean because of the society in which we live and in order to clean that room that society must be changed I would see for example the economic superstructures that are failing so many people right now Changed not necessarily by people who have their act together but from the people who don't because of those systems Do you do you agree or disagree with that? I I agree the difficulty that we have with systems are that they are made of people and so What you know what what's sort of you know, it's always it's always hard to know well just think about you know, whatever group of people you're living with Now if you're living with other people, maybe it's in the context of an apartment building or maybe it's in a neighborhood or maybe it's within one How one household you could say? Well, you know What does it take for us to be a household that keeps our own house clean and and does this is and so if you've ever lived With roommates in college, you know, you have some roommates that are slobs and some roommates who are neat nicks And so you could say well, well, which is it? Is it us as a group or is it us as an individual and it's always both and my you know, one of the one of the When he said, you know keep you know You know keep your house in perfect order before you go out to fix the world Basically perfect was such a poor choice of words there because the truth is none of us are perfect But the the question of society first or the individual first that's always a very difficult one What I like to what I like to say is that without individuals nothing changes and without institutions nothing lasts and so part of what we're seeing is that There's certainly you know, the market in some ways likes to incentivize um Likes to incentivize the commodification of people And and that's a real problem and I agree completely and so employers who You know I and you know politically, you know, so I I mean You might have You know, you probably don't know anything about my politics, but it doesn't matter. I I I have a problem with with with industries that Don't give health care to their employees if we're going to have employers If we're going to run health care through employers and I would be in favor of you know A lot more than that. And so I there's no question in my mind that we can use some structural change But the question of individual versus societal that's a weakness I think with jordan peterson that I I think was manifest in his program That I saw as a pastor because again, I saw he's out there talking about the individual great, you know It's very true that I can't change anyone i'm living with I can only change myself I should be the change to use that little thing and act the way I will want others to Others to act I have to do that first, but you're exactly right And that's what i'm saying in terms of marriage There needs to be an institution and a community around us that reinforces those values And community certainly works better when we have some assurance that The others with which we are sharing this community have the same value It's being reinforced and we can all work on it together Yeah um if you uh i'm trying to i'm trying to think like what would so Politics aside and and of course well, there is no such thing. All of this is deeply political but I should say um, the um Political differences between myself and jbp aside i'm trying to think now what would be what would be the The optimal jbp if you could if you could construct them somehow somebody a person sent I don't know if you're from god. I don't know so somebody constructed to Help people out of the alienation which seems to accompany modern society when I think of that person I think of i'm of course biased by my politics. I think of somebody Who's who's very far left who wants to build a really strong economic base to allow everyone to live a dignified life, um Because we have the money for it at least here in america we could with with proper incentive structures have everyone live it at least a lower middle class living with um with um With no like substantive economic issues to to ensure everyone can enjoy a baseline standard of living Which is certainly above what welfare provides us today, which is which is pitiful in this day and age in this country And which encourages people to to form strong communal relations with others to be trusting and open to be disciplined Absolutely That's important but um but also to be open to the possibility that sometimes the the issues that are affecting their life are are not a an evidence of of personal failing but rather evidence that the the the house in which they live The society in which they live needs correcting to ensure a revolutionary mindsets in people a a a willingness always to challenge social institutions so that there will always be a um Um sort of the civil spirit necessary to maintain the common dignity of the average citizen. What would what would be What is an ideal jbp look to you? Like how do they deliver that? Oh, I think I think we we have the jbp that there is and I think he's done a lot of good and i'm satisfied with that I I'm reluctant to boil i'm reluctant to boil these issues down to economics I spent seven years of my life living in the dominican republic working mostly with haitians And I cannot recall a single instance of a suicide attempt amongst those haitians and these people for the most part were illegal immigrants in a far poorer country than the united states living in glass in brass huts and shacks made of garbage and basically working for tyrannical either government organizations or Coffee growers and scratching out a living, you know working gardens. I watched the david chapelle Thing on netflix last night and he makes the point at the beginning of it Anthony bourdain has about the best job that any of us could imagine Flying around the world eating the world's best food talking to the world's most interesting people That's his job and he kills himself And the haitians living in those huts in the dominican republic. I never once heard of a suicide and so the confidence that I have that a Predominantly economic program would yield the kind of well-being we imagine I don't think actually Pertains because as a pastor you get to see the lives of people and i've seen a lot of very unhappy people With a lot of money and a lot of people who enjoy life You know, I grew up mostly around african-american folks and you know Some of the best times i've had have been with just hanging out with junkies and poor folks And and you know, yeah life is hard, but they've got meaning and happiness And I think again one of the one of the main things that peterson communicated was that the quest for happiness is not as Simple as we imagine it to be and what's actually true is that meaning is a far more sustainable Is a far more sustainable entity and that which in fact Is most in distress every now and then i'll do a sermon that touches on suicide One of the things I noticed is that one of the places in the united states with the highest suicide rate was a high school in silicon valley the the children of the titans of industry That have more going for them in terms of economic security than any of us on this channel would ever hope for And so I think if we're looking for Well-being Predominantly from an economic rearrangement. I think will be dissatisfied Yeah, I I mean that's that's one of the grand paradoxes right right now the suicide rate in america is at its highest for middle-aged white men who are Demographically much better off than many of the other constituencies suicide rates are as you noted for the at least for the american black community Substantially lower than they are on average for the white community. It's the same for hispanics I'm inclined to believe this is because of their family structure. Also, there's a which is traditional Oh, no denying that but I wonder if the um If the conditions of traditional family structures and how they positively affect one's well-being could be supplemented in a less traditional Way that nonetheless keeps the spirit of the original organization. I remember this is this is something that's always stuck with me It's something that I read a very long time ago. Um I bothered till I did I did bother to look it up. It is true Even if the citations have left me now, but I remember there was a greek philosopher who existed some 2000 whatever ancient greek philosopher and he was interested in the study of happiness Which I guess we would now term as like a meaningfulness or well-being or contentedness because it wasn't just like ha ha happy um And what he discovered and he was laughed at he was ridiculed by his contemporaries because all the other philosophers were learning about form And meaning and the the essence of consciousness and he was off trying to find how to have a good time And what he discovered, you know from from his Teachings at least was that the best way for a human being to be happy would be for them to live along with eight to 12 friends in a villa Which was suitably sized such they all had private bedrooms but shared communal spaces such as living rooms dining rooms kitchens and such And he believed after all of his life that this was the optimal way for human beings to live And he died as one does and other people I think um eventually took towards following his writings after his passing Epicurus epicurus chat says that's him. Yep. Okay Epicurus I sound much smarter now and and and other people took that teaching and I am I am deeply moved by that idea because I kind of wanted the same thing my life too I grew up with very good parents, you know, and i'm very happy for for everything they gave me But it was nonetheless a boxy home or I knew not the names of my neighbors the idea of living in a shared space is Almost like a dorm. I think that's why so many people have fond memories of their dorm experiences and probably corresponding negative ones as well um The idea of living like that. It's it's very enticing to me and if you want to branch it out into sort of more of a Relationship dynamic there's the there's the potential for sort of segmented like your space with you and your partner then the broader space with other families and maybe you have Kids, but you know the others well enough that they could babysit for you Like on the way out you shared like two of you share a kitchen or two groups This is it's very compelling and what would be needed to see changes like that or Changes like how we structure homes so people live together or changes in the workplace to ensure that workers aren't like just Getting through the day with no ability to talk to one another due to really oppressive corporate rules All of these are economic changes the how we design our homes how we build our workplaces. How our schools are designed How do we teach resource officers to deal with those who are suffering from depression? How much emphasis do we place on people's well-being following a depressive episode? All of these are economic or social changes and that's what I really want to see not just making everyone wealthier But building these structures that are that are facilitated around human happiness rather than than capital acquisition And I feel like at least from what you said that at least in regards to the sentiment you may agree with a lot of that Well The question I would have is 2300 years ago epicurus tried this Why didn't it? Why didn't it win the day? And then my question for you would be when you go on vacation Do you stay in a hostel or a hotel? Well, I will admit that I stay in a hotel I have heard people say that they have positive experiences from hostels and there might be other reasons why that's the case hostels tend to be very um Disgusting for example, um But if for example, there was a way to make them disgusting. Oh, well of people, of course But if they're people you care about and know and live with Epicurus's ideas didn't take on because there's not much money to be had in making people happy Had and making people happy there's money to be had and making people scared But we got close I think with villages and feudal um in feudal times Well, I mean obviously people there were barren wretched and miserable and had shit on their face all the time At the very least they had meaning within a community who they cared about things were dirty there and not denying that And it was the peak well mostly it was the horses I imagine who made it dirty But they lived their lives and there was a meaningfulness to that and I think we can extrapolate That um that communal spirit Into how society functions today without returning to this post like this this modernist liberal Traditional idea of like uh, I mean liberal in like the enlightenment sense idea of like the nuclear family where people get locked off into these boxes I just it feels like a grim return to an attempt at replicating The joy of an earlier and perhaps less profitable, but nonetheless superior system Do you know the american corporation that has the um that has the the vision statement make people happy Um, I mean i've heard it before again. Um Is it Is it facebook? No, no, it's disney. There's okay. Uh, that's so I should have gotten that that that one's that's a clear And do they make much money? I mean a listen, I mean if you're if your point is that capitalism does a poor job of meeting human need then i'm i'm with you i'm with you all the way my point is that happiness is People I don't think people finally want happiness They will trade their life for meaning and ironically I think you know If we come all the way back to the question of jordan b peterson, that is what's actually at the heart of You know the first book that he wrote is is more important book, which is not very readable Is maps of meaning because people will people will go to war and be killed on the battlefield people will Put their bodies and lives at risk in childbirth people will sacrifice everything that they have for meaning But they will even in fact sacrifice their happiness for meaning And I think if we can get an understanding of that we might actually be able to figure out What kinds of institutions and social arrangements would actually give us more? Well-being than just I think epicurus in the end Didn't succeed in changing the world because he was wrong And I would I would argue that someone named jesus christ actually changed the world far more than epicurus And I would argue that he did so because he was right I don't think you can meaningfully extrapolate the validity of a position for how popular it is there have been plenty of intelligent and wise men Who have died penniless in the sewers and plenty of idiots who have been elected to high office I mean, you know jesus didn't make any money jesus christ's, uh, uh, uh elevated reputation nonewithstanding There is plenty of empirical evidence to suggest that communal living is a is a good way about to live one's life and I think that you You see facsimiles of this in in poorer communities as well Now I admit and I admit i'm speaking here not from experience but only from reading because I am rather privileged in my upbringing but in everything that I have read and scantily encountered in some of the poorest communities in this country, um the whatever Whatever glimpses of meaning and validity they picked from their lives Were in a shared bond with their neighbors with their community and a willingness to do whatever it took to maintain the well-being of that community But to an irrational degree people get the more isolated they live and that's exactly what we're seeing in north america agree Yeah, the family size is shrinking the more money we get and so that's why I argue if you put the emphasis on Economic well-being you're not actually going to address these questions of community What if you put the emphasis on on economic socialization? Redesigning social structures in a way that facilitate human contact everything our workplaces our schools um, uh The way in which we like get services from others now We just like click a button on amazon it arrives at our door our families all of it is getting more expedient and more distant If we could find ways to to to to streamline these systems in a way that facilitated human contact I think that you would see people form a much more genuine bond with their community And I think really good things can come from that. I think I think the most expedient way to do that would be to have them Have less money and they would be more people living together and you would is that a pesadist? I hear do you support do you believe that true happiness can only come from the flames of apocalyptic nuclear hellfire? Only after we nuke the country can we rebuild and become truly a truly one No, have you not heard of pesadism? No All right. Okay. Listen. Hey, listen, I don't get to those dark corners of the internet very often I'm just listen i'm just saying I mean if if if you want to go hard in the poverty happiness Correlative scale then a nuclear winter sounds like a really really quick way. No, I don't I don't disagree though Be like flippancy aside. Um I do I guess I guess on the whole I do think that right now the commodification of human life has made it difficult for us to Really appreciate one another and form bonds. It's really difficult. You're we're obviously of different um generations So things maybe are different for me or for you than they were for Oh, okay. Don't give me that face. I'm 25. Oh, yeah, we are you're my children's age. Yeah Yeah, yeah, don't give me that face. I'm sorry. I know my face not on camera I don't know if you forgot. I'm just remember a beard like oh god is 30 40 Um, whatever the case may be things are it's really hard to make friends now Like it's really genuinely difficult to make friends um And there have been studies born out of this a lot of it is part is because we don't leave our houses as much anymore And listen internet, okay. I'm not I may make my money here. I i'm not defending the internet in that respect I'm not going i'm not going to bat for that. But in terms of um, also of like our irl for like our in-person friends um, so often the economic like um, Meandering of life the fact that you have to move to get jobs or how much we have to work or how? fastidiously we have to dedicate our time to a profession it kind of prevents us from making friends outside our work field and Even within that work field usually most workplaces are nightmares They're horribly alienated you can't form friendships there and in fact you're not supposed to they don't want you to yeah It's and it's disgusting and it makes them more money, but it's disgusting And this is like our only chance it's eight hours a day five days a week for some people Some people work more or less. I don't know and that's their like main shot at socialization and they're expressly systemically prevented from doing so and And I and I and it's really sad and there are so many people I know that that are losing their friends um, or who don't have any friends and who find other ways of accommodating the desires that come about from friendship like like feeling validated um by others and that's like I consider that the the alienation from friendship. I would consider this like a um like like an apocalyptically bad social problem like A lot of people make fun of incels, you know the term is involuntary. Yeah, a lot of people make jokes about this I try not to make jokes about this. This is like this is like actually a real problem we're going to have to deal with and whether that the solution comes from a return to more traditional family structures or like some broad systemic reevaluation of how our our our our social structures affect our ability to make friends I will agree with you on this It is glad to have people talking about that and Jordan b peterson has definitely brought about that conversation the way that many others haven't Well, and so I would say well, what if you had a what if you had a place where people could come together weekly and You can reinforce the values and principles and do some singing. Oh, no have some food together and oh no Make friends and find potential spouses gosh. What it'd be amazing if someone thought of a place like that But yet churches are dying Including my own So no, we're in a mess and it's a mess of our own making Yeah Yeah, wait, can I wait can I ask what um, can I ask what um, what church or sector branch or whatever the proper terminology It is you follow if it's not polite to use i'm i'm a pastor in the christian reform church in north america Which comes out of the dutch calvinist tradition Which comes out of the dutch calvinist tradition from So would that be that would be catholic then right if it comes from calvinist Sorry, sorry calvinist. Okay. I admit i'm very ignorant about christianity The only thing I know is that the catholics build the prettiest churches. I don't know where they do That's my orthodox build some great churches, too Yeah, and listen the only thing that's okay. I will say this okay in in rods So credit where credit is due. Okay in almost every town i've ever been in the church is synagogues Mosques, whatever it doesn't matter religious institutions far and away the most beautiful buildings that I that um That I will ever see everything else is dull gray concrete office buildings and that is genuinely sad to me that one of the last excuses We had to bust out our architectural chops is is is falling to the wayside So from an artistic perspective at least at the very least deeply saddening to me I agree. I agree that may be a point. Uh, we've gone over our normal hour of yeah Sorry, that's I did not expect to have a good faith conversation. It's been so long. It's actually extraordinary Oh, this was enjoyable. I enjoyed this I could speak to you as well This was so enjoyable to listen to I was like I'm not joking. I was like, I know I should But I was like i'm just gonna keep letting it go because it's just been really interesting I honestly am fascinated and Uh as a side note too that the fact that you had both mentioned Middle-aged white men actually commit the most suicide That's i've never knew that I never would have guessed either So a lot of a lot of them just to clarify a lot of them are medically facilitated like these are people who have like um Like debilitating conditions that that in all likelihood will mean their death soon anyway So that does account for a small portion of the statistic, but a lot of it is also like systemic alienation for sure Wow, that is really yeah, I never knew so With that we will jump to the q a so thanks so much What i'm going to do is just quick send the questions that we have over to the speakers just so that If you guys want a chance to skim through them as I go through the troll Uh questions you can uh, take a peek at those i'm going to send those via email and want to say Thanks everybody for your questions Uh, it's going to be I think we're with this like roughly 10 minutes We're going to try to zoom through as many as possible and forgive me if we don't get to all of the questions i'm just trying to I want to respect the speaker's time and Uh, just kind of keep it short and pithy is uh, got just about the right amount. So Very excited for these First up. Thanks so much stephen stein who said can't we all just Love james and get along. Thank you stephen. That's uh, he's our friendly benevolent troll by the way I love james and I love getting along That's I think we've gotten along well tonight Yes, it has been so I I just emailed you guys the questions if you want to peek at them I've got i'm going to read through like maybe four more we get a lot of troll chats, but I still read them I don't I just love them. So thanks steven converse contender, uh, I get Says vosh. So what you're saying is jordan this is early in the debate So I think it was it was referencing the kathy newman discussion converse contender says vosh So what you're saying is jordan is good I get it. Uh, uh So yeah, so I I again I don't like jordan b peterson mostly for political reasons I do think that he enables far-right politics and I do think that the the discussions that he opens leave enough wiggle room in regards to their sort of philosophical prescriptions that is easy to take from them reactionary politics, however That's one discussion a far more interesting discussion to me is what do we do about the types of things that jordan peterson has set himself out? Trying to address like alienation loneliness and what have you and in those and I may not like jbp, but I Love the fact that we're able to have conversations about that now and and that and that is a take that I am unapologetically in favor of I really appreciate both of you guys, uh Next up really quick. I just enjoyed this conversation so much. Seriously you guys this is honestly just been I guess the like the old-fashioned talks of like values and kind of and some so anyway, I just this has been great Steven steven, thanks for your other super chat who said he said most Important point vosh made in this debate was that james is sculpted like a greek god. I don't think he said that but thanks stephen So I can say it if you like Sigefredo's ravi just says two thousand dollars. Thank you. I appreciate it. I'm not sure what that means. Thank you though It's just stupid. This is she goes by this is her own name Uh She's stupid horror energy. Thanks for your super chat. She says question for james. Why do you shave your legs? Not in fact true Uh, though more power to you if you like to snake was right. Thanks for your super chat Now we're getting into the more pointed question. So i'm i'm ready Uh, we have snake was right asking how is anti-communism equal to fascist propaganda So I assume that's directed at me because I made the claim um so, um so to be specific here and I and I don't want to be too like um Inflammatory or anything like that because it probably doesn't serve anyone's interest But when jordan b peterson talks about cultural marxism, this is literally and this is this is like an indisputable fact A retooling of cultural bolshevism, which was nazi propaganda in both instances the essential propagandistic uh a sort of argument was that there was a left wing plot in Cultural bolshevism's case by jewish people and by cultural marxism's case. It depends. What do you mean purple hair at sjw's? I don't know, um to subvert academia and disseminate marxist values of of like tolerance inequality to destroy the white man um Through that academia to change people's minds to influence and propagandize against students I'm very wary when people use the term cultural marxist. It's rooted usually in anti-semitism But sometimes I don't get that vibe from jbp It just comes off to me as somebody who is maybe inadvertently spreading propaganda that abets and enables fascists You bet. Thank you very much. Ariel fernandez. Thanks for your super chat They said question to both do you think all or most of the state legislatures in the u.s Should be uncameral legislator legislatures instead of bicameral legislatures I think they meant unicameral unicameral. Yeah, I would probably make a little more. Yes uncameral no cameras And probably be better without cameras frankly from what i've seen from the cameras I I don't know. I have a son who works in uh, who works in politics and I think he'd have ideas about this But I don't really know enough about it to to wage to to give an opinion Um I um, I don't like the senate. Um, I don't I don't particularly like the um, I don't particularly like The idea that like oh god electoral college memes Okay, I don't state houses right that's what the question was state houses was oh was it state not federal uh, they said Oh, you're right state legislatures. Oh, oh, okay. All right. Oh wow Um, I I admit I haven't thought too too hard in the bicameral of state legislators Um, I don't actually know how the second house is chambered. I don't know if there's a different like but like uh, um Process for which they're voted for or I don't know if they're representative of a different type of demographic than those who are in the first House, um, so i'm gonna flip a coin real quick and i'm gonna i'm gonna very firmly decide I Hate bicameral legislators, they're disgusting and they're also fascist propaganda Okay I want unicameral legislators now because we are like six years away from fucking the fourth right taking over if we don't fix this Shit, okay. That's my take. Wow Thank you very much ariel Um answer ariel fernandez has another question. Thanks so much for your Okay, they were just defining them. Uh, thank you for that stupid whore energy. Thank you for asking Your super chat question, which is why did peterson? Ignore part of eric harris's journal that were rife with misogyny racism and ableism I haven't heard of this. I don't know what you guys know what that's referring to. Well, he's talking to eric harris One of the columbine shooters And he made a point about his journal and some other aspects Why did he ignore those points probably because every speaker when you're putting together a talk You pick the points that you want to make from the material in front of you and sometimes you skip over some of the others. So I though i'm not personally familiar with this omission. So I so my take would is is only from the information I've been provided right here. I will say I do think there's a benefit in tying a link between um The the alienation loneliness what have you that no doubt afflicted those two with whatever reactionary politics that tend to cohabit There is a pretty if you go into far right circles online A lot of those folks tend to look like they could benefit from some community living if you know what I mean So I think that that link is something worth looking at. I don't know why he personally would have removed it I lately i've been you know, who timothy snider is um, he's an author. Wait, that sounds familiar. Hold on He wrote he wrote a book about um Anyway, he did a lot of he's a historian that's done a lot of work on the early 20th century Especially in eastern europe. He wrote one uh bloodlands, which was the history of the space between Nazi germany and the soviet union i'm currently reading his book black earth, which is uh, which does a deep dive on On nazism and fascism. It's really fascinating and I think people who I I think it's helpful to read a book like that when you think about some of the connections between Fascism and I mean it i've learned a lot about the basis. I you know, so hitler hated the jews Yeah, I never knew why he hated the jews, but his thinking behind that is really quite interesting And it sort of mixes up a lot of the facile Associations we tend to make today with the current political landscape. So it's a it's a book I recommend Yeah, i'm looking i'm looking through the bio in wiki right now It looks um, it actually looks a really good read if only I wasn't illiterate. Thank you It's an audio form, too. Oh, I know you understand english Oh beautiful So we have another one which is Stupid horror energy things for your super chat. She asked is there any actual scientific evidence for peterson's claim that boys quote, uh quote boys interest tilt towards things girls interests tilt toward people I've heard that case made by psychologists. I'm not a psychologist Uh, I think anecdotally having had five children I you know, all of these are tendencies and But I can see my boys tended to focus on things and my girls tended to focus on relationships That's what I saw with my kids now how he ever sussed that out or say what's nature nurture I don't know, but I know that that's You know at least from the psychology that i've heard it is an assertion But again, all of these assertions are generalizations such as men are taller than women Generally, you can find some women taller than some men but That's the way it is I haven't i haven't seen any specific like like Like scientific well i've seen studies on the subject It's really difficult in sociology and psychology to tease out like any intrinsic characteristics or what has or has not been affected by societal upbringing I would I can I could be I could be sold on the idea that there might be very small differences in the intrinsic wiring on average not In aggregate not like for every individual between um, but between like the the stereotypical sexes But I would imagine that if that was the case it would probably be a statistically insignificant deviation That's probably teased out and exacerbated by social cues, but that would be that would just be my guess without knowing more about the literature Gotcha. Thank you very much next up Ariel fernandez, thank you for your super chat. They ask mr. Vander clay. Are you a distributist? If you answer I don't know or know to being a distributist Then please answer my next question do you have knowledge of what distributism is I There is there is a youtuber called the distributist that I know a little bit He has his own channel and then there's one of my one of the people who i've had a number of conversations Mary mary cohen who now just started her own youtube channel says that the distributist is not a Distributist so I really don't know what they're fighting about and I think it has something to do with gk Chesterton and some social theory and roman catholicism, but since i'm not roman catholic. It hasn't been an area of study of mine I listen all I have to say is that I love the distributist. Okay, that's all I've got That's are you talking about this like the idea or i've talked with him before it was a shit show That's super interesting and it's it's funny because i'm not exaggerating The very next person who sent a super chat. I don't know if it's because he heard his his ears were Itching, but the distributist sent a super chat. This is next on the list and he said bravo paul bravo So no joke and he's been on here before so good to see you distributist. Hope you're well and paul. You got a fan Uh So a distributist to be figured out what racism means So apparently you two have a history. I don't know but uh You guys let's see stupid horror energy. Thanks for your question She says why does jordan peterson sound like a post-modernist when he discusses women? How can I let's see just uh, she says our At like the at symbol within in an email P3 accounts, is this something i'm supposed to know is this some sort of cool slaying? uh When he discusses women oh rape accounts. Oh, she she spelt it. Oh so that youtube wouldn't pick it up Ah, oh, I said it out loud what I meant to say. Okay, you got it so Well, so why does peterson sound like a post-modernist when he discusses women's? our Excuse me. No problem. There's a lot of there's a lot of Post-modernism within jordan peterson Gotcha There there is I mean it's hard to it's hard to not and some people will make the same claim listening to me That i'm way more post-modern than they thought I would be but I think it's and peterson himself acknowledges that That's post-modernism identified You know a lot of true things such as that there are motivations In narratives that that are playing in the to use one of charles taylor's words in the imaginary And so there's a fair amount of post-modernity and in what in the way jordan peterson approaches some things. I think it's true Yeah, I think I think that a lot of people um, Unnecessarily ascribe negativity to like post-modernity as like a concept without recognizing that they probably engage in post-modern thought in some Aspects of their life we did it earlier in this discussion while we were talking about social alienation from a respective economic and traditionalist social perspective All it really means is that um, you believe there are different Different different narratives different lens of analyses through which life can be examined and that there's no such thing as a universal Principle truth there's objective reality, but that doesn't necessarily mean there's objective truth and a lot of yeah I know I mean I agree a lot of good stuff can come from that. It's just another lens of analysis Gotcha. Thank you very much brian stevens. Thanks for your super chat He said question are the numbers he's referring to the uh suicide rates between haiti and the u.s I think this is uh in reference to what you had mentioned paul. He says are the numbers namely 11.7 In haiti and 13 In the u.s that far off or different he says because these are the suicide rates between haiti and the u.s I my my sample is was strictly anecdotal and if you rewind you'll hear me say it that way That where i've been a pastor in the united states and I regularly hear about suicide attempts among people who in terms of standard of living Compared to the rest of the world live remarkably secure and well off as compared to people who lived with absolute You know crushing poverty given those two samples and if one imagines that Well-being and happiness is simply a function of economic well-being We would imagine that we'd see haitians offing themselves all the time, but I didn't and in fact, like I said I see I hear many more stories of even just this sunday. I heard a prayer request for a child of 11 Who was suicidal and when I think about what it means that an 11 year old child would be contemplating taking their own life I have real questions about what kind of world we have placed this child into I don't I don't disagree with the principle. I'm not familiar with the socioeconomic situation here in haiti, but I just extrapolating from um From u.s demographic data concerning suicide rates. It's undeniable that the relationship between um suicidality and um, uh living conditions is Complicated um to put it at the very least Haiti also has some really specific stuff going on right now. I mean, they're literally in a revolution presently. So The so I imagine that the material conditions over there might might lend to some Conflating factors when it comes to analyzing how exactly they treat themselves in the social sense Gotcha. Thank you very much gentlemen iril fredan. As we don't have too many more They asked vash. Do you think Juan velasco former peruvian general who led a successful military coup in 1968 was a socialist or a socialist sympathizer uh Here if you can hold on for just 10 seconds. I'm copying that name from the email and i'm entering it into google And someone else is going to answer the question for me What? Is i'm not that much of a history buff. Hold on What was a left-wing peruvian general turned dictator who served his 58th president during the dictatorship from 68 to 75 under the title President of the revolutionary government of the armed force. I mean he sounds like a leftist I don't know if I would agree with I don't know if i'm a big fan of dictatorships though um Characterized by authoritarianism agrarian reform. Yeah, I mean i'm gonna I don't know if he's a crypto. He sounds like uh, He sounds like he was trying to build revolutionary socialism. I don't know if I I don't know if I agree with his methods You betcha and Mothra j disco. Thanks for your super chat. They said jesus was the true antifa commander Must have true true Totally baffled. I think I cut off. Let me just double check that I didn't cut off this super chat I'm gonna read the next one and we're gonna come back to this one because I feel like there's maybe a missing word He led the black bloc with uh with the bandit with the chief over his mouth and everything throwing uh Throwing molotovs in the uh in the temple where all the merchants were Next up we'll come back to that one. I promise. Oh sue. Oh sue. Thanks for your super chat They said ask pvk his thoughts on tyrannical family courts I don't know anything about tyrannical family courts or are those a thing? I mean What does he mean by tyrannical family courts? I think they are referring to This is my only my guess this came up the other day when you were on here vash. Uh, If i'm interpreting it, right? I think they maybe mean courts that show I think isn't it something jbp has talked about about how there's discriminatory practices and family courts that lead to more women getting the Boys or whatever? Yes. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking too So yeah, I think that's what they're referring to when they say tyrannical family courts is these I I don't I think I I think judges should look at the circumstance and do what's right. It's really and I I think it is true that that There has been a bias in society that believed that children were better off with their mother than their father And I would like to see a more even-handed treatment of that I I don't I think I in any given situation you know, I every now and then something comes in front of me and it's a custody battle they're almost always terribly difficult and terribly sad And this again, I mean, I think the the mark of an adult is that the adult puts the welfare of the child ahead of their own And that's what we want to see Yeah, I I mean I won't lie when I say I mean again i'm not a parent so obviously my understanding of how difficult it is Stems pretty much from my like reflective understanding of how my parents raised me But yeah, no, um, sometimes the way those family court situations play out is absolutely disgusting With kids being used as bargaining tools. I will say this by the way Hey listen, the family court is not the only court system that's systemically biased against a certain demographic of people If you have an issue with how the family court typically Prioritizes giving children over to women because women are expected to be like the child bearers and the housekeepers and what have you There's that social expectation. They'll do a better job than the men same reason why sometimes when men bring their kids to Playgrounds they'll get accused of being pedophiles for being with the kid or as if a mom does that never happens exact same reason Even though there's no statistically significant difference between the amount of victimization of children by men and women Um Then you should probably also have a problem with the fact the court system has approximately equal levels of discriminatory fervor when it comes to african americans I'm just saying if if you have an issue with how systems treat individuals Then you have to look past the individual judges and look at how the system as a whole Regards those groups and I think family courts do kind of screw over men And I and I oppose that by advocating men can be just as good housekeepers as women, you know Or not housekeepers. Sorry Yeah, yeah, yeah Childly You see men and women are equally good at juggling your honor So I think that your uh, your contention here your is unfounded. No, uh child bears Gotcha. Thank you. And I just went back to double check this The I definitely that's all the super chat said was jesus was the true antifa commander Than the letter o in the number seven Is that like oh that oh that's that's somebody saluting it's meant to be an emoticon for somebody saluting Oh Like at the head is the oh and the seven is the the hand in the forearm. Oh That is cool Thank you for teaching me how to be cool vash. Uh, no problem my pleasure interpreting cool. I should say i'm not that far yet Okay, stupid horror energy. Thanks to your super chat. She says Question for vash. Did you support the bundys attempt to take over mal? Is it pronounced malhauer? Mal malheur. I think it's the The national park are we talking about the bundy ranch? Is it the Yeah, the bundy in 2014 the bundy ranch standoff That might be it. Yeah, I think that's what they're talking about. Um, some some forms of um, Some forms of rebellion against the government are good and some are bad Um, like for instance, i'm not categorically against murder murder and self-defense is good. For example I believe you should be able to defend yourself in this instance. The bundys were literally grazing off of land They didn't own and then when the government said hey don't do that They took up arms and threatened like the fbi the like so no, this is not a legitimate This is like the difference between like a proletarian revolution and just like firebombing starbucks full of baristas The different the set it from a distance if you blur your eyes a little bit things may seem similar But if you come up close, there's a there's a world of difference No, I don't support that at all. I wish and by the way, if those bundy folk were black They would have been gunned down that site would have been Carpet bombed from the air but because they're white one of them gets shot and the rest of them get off. It's pretty wild Gotcha. Thank you very much next up Up Got that one our father in the green. Thanks for your super chat They said question to vosh. I heard this far left agenda in academia would be discussed further with a fellow academic named crocoduck Is that like a oh, yeah, I thought I was going to discuss scientific Scientific subjectivism with crocoduck. I do want to discuss it with him. Yeah Um, yeah, I mean there's no denying that academia tends to lean left but a lot of left-leaning ideas just bear out better in data It's smug to say but I mean like sometimes what are you going to do? Right? There's a lot of anti-intellectualism in modern conservative intelligentsia. It's been a problem for a while, but it's gotten worse and worse lately um, but I but at the end of the day my goal along with the goal of everyone else should be to make sure that everyone Gets the best education possible the best ability to understand the world around them come to conclusions that ultimately benefit them and others to live Happy fulfilled well-being lives Propagandizing students isn't how you do that but giving them good solid structural understandings the world around them I think that's a good take and I think right now that leftism kind of has the cornerstone on that market You got it. Thank you very much marcus. Thanks for your super chat. They said do lobsters live communally Very nice. No, they don't Well, yes, they haven't you seen they'll pull down the ones that are trying to escape from the fish tank They don't want to they they don't want to see their brother leave. I have a niece who's getting her phd of lobsters And i'll tell you they're pretty brutal I want to live as the lobsters do okay shiny and Capable of breathing underwater. I think these are goals all humans should aspire to Touche Our father in the green. Thanks for your question. Uh, thanks for your super chat They said follow up. What does vosh think of how elements of intersectional activism? Is seeking to subvert the fields of science and academia and even general progressive politics being hijacked in general? Uh, it's a conspiracy theory. I've seen this a lot in right-wing circles. I've been to university. I speak with professors I've spoken to professors at no point On no level so I see have I seen a subversion of science by radical like progressive agenda or anything Usually what they mean when they say that is people saying that gender doesn't equal sex or that um, It depends there are three things that people will say is radical progressive politics influencing science and it's either Gender and sex are not the same thing um sex is a spectrum not a binary or See that that um, there is not like there is a tenuous connection at best between um between race and iq Those are like the three takes and then people get up in arms and they'll be like, oh, Jesus god christ almighty the progressives are destroying even science. I've never seen this happen not once um, but if somebody has specific examples or they believe that like intersectional politics are Influencing our ability to rationally understand the world then I would be willing to discuss with them But so far every time i've seen it it's been malarkey You got it. Thank you very much. We've got just just three more questions if you guys I know we've already gone over your time Though so if you got like a dinner plan or anything, I want to let you guys go if you do you have a paul You look like you have a dinner plan. Okay, so sorry about that paul. Thanks so much for being here. Um, I will uh These questions i'll try to direct via email fast. You can make them fast really fast Uh the lup jackal. Thanks for your question. They said what theological books do you recommend assume this is for paul? Hmm now I gotta give a fast answer it a lot depends on what kind of things that they're interested in Uh, that's that doesn't that doesn't terribly help them. I like progressive christian socialist. I know them. They're quite nice I I I recommend i'll recommend c.s. Lewis terrific author. Um, a lot of good stuff Gotcha really quick. We got one comment. I think they were clarifying their previous one ariel fernandez Thanks for your super chat. They said to my knowledge almost all the seats in the upper chamber of state legislatures is based on population It will be in It will be like instead of state get the two seats in the senate. There will be senatorial districts That's i'd have to do some That seems like a subject I need to do a bit of research on before california They're just terms differently, but they're both based on districts and um, I don't know much about state politics to be honest. I should probably read up on it That seems like a like a hole I should feel there's 50 states and so it means a lot of reading because they're yes Listen, i'll skip i'll skip the irrelevant ones. Okay You got it. And then the last one is a yes or no question for avash. Do you think omar torihos was a leftist? I don't know that you know what we're gonna say we're gonna say yes Okay, I hope I hope that doesn't come back to bite me. Gotcha. Thank you very much Thanks everybody for being here. It's honestly been a blast both of the speakers have their links in the description So like right down there like you can click on them if you enjoyed listening to these guys I can tell you i've honestly I put in the chat I told somebody because I've got so many good feedback comments in the chat This has been one of the most enjoyable conversations i've honestly ever gotten to listen to at modern day debate So thank you guys so much with that It's been a pleasure It's been a pleasure The pleasure is all mine with that. We'll uh, say thanks to our speakers again and uh, let everybody go Thanks for being everybody. Keep sending out the reasonable from the unreasonable. Take care
