 Hi, this is Paul. Jordan Peterson has been in Dublin and I had a little conversation with someone who watches my videos in Dublin about some of what went on a lot of the is Question between Peterson and Sam Harris, but before Peterson did that he did this interview And there were some interesting things in this interview And I want to play a little bit at the end because it gets into some of the Jordan Peterson watch type Conversation what's what's going on with him? Where's this going? So let's just gonna I'm just gonna play it at the end play it till the end and then Comment on some of the points that he makes you've spoken about kind of recently about just disappear from public From public life to a certain degree and at some point if that's something you see happening more and more of just backing away from the line Well, the thing is is that well, it isn't even that I want to go live my life It's that at some point there's the problems that we talked about earlier There's an overexposure problem and there's a repetition problem. Like I have a fairly wide range of things to talk about but it's not inexhaustible and once I've talked about all those things Talking about them a bunch more is going to become pretty Counterproductive so what I need to do is go away and read and think and come up with a bunch of new ideas now I'm going to handle that to some degree because the next lecture series that I'm going to do is Will be on Exodus. I did biblical series last year on Genesis and that was quite popular And I think quite necessary certainly necessary for me because it was a good intellectual and ethical endeavor I want to go through the Exodus stories next and that'll be new but I need I need to balance communication with Thinking and and the generation of new ideas and I'm going to finish up this tour sequence probably Mostly by February. I'm gonna come back to Europe probably next April for a bit and then I think like I have like Thousand books at home that are sitting there waiting to be read. Is that how you want do you want? You know, do you do you rely mostly the way I unwind is by spending time with my family I wouldn't but no there's very little of that and there hasn't been much of that in my whole life and there's certainly be none Of it in the last two years. I mean I I I haven't had any time off for of any duration for well for For two years and not very much of it before then but I'm not complaining about that. Like I function better flat out I mean I need to pull back a bit because I have some reading to do and some thinking and all of that But I'm not complaining. I mean, I've got nothing to complain about it's very well How should you conceptualize your life peace and Tranquility, I don't think so. I think if you're lucky your life is an adventure and hopefully it's one you undertook voluntarily and an adventure isn't leisure and tranquility its alertness and readiness and That's Fine. I think that's the best you get is that you're contending You're contending with life successfully. And so that's the situation that I'm in and that's fine but it will be good and proper at some point to Pull back enough so that I can read and think and write more So but I will do that. I believe so if you do pull back at some point that that's exactly what you're gonna be doing Oh, definitely. Yeah, I mean I'm writing right now. I I wrote a lot. I'm gonna post some of it today about this ongoing discussion with Sam Harris So but I'm looking I like isn't that I like writing exactly because it's too hard to be something that you like exactly But it's something that I find necessary and Intensely engaging. I have a writer friend His name is Greg Hurwitz. He featured some of my rules in one of his books an orphan X book and He's been writing non-stop for 25 years. He's written a bestseller Every year for 25 years. He said he's involved in many projects He said the only time he really feels like he's accomplished something is when he's writing and I kind of Feel that way too like if I if I've written during the day then I really feel like I've done something that justified the day and Lecturing is like that and clinical work is like that, but writing is definitely like that so I'm looking forward to doing a bunch more of that and so Don't be like a genuine Now there are a number of other interesting things in this in this talk that they do I thought earlier in the talk he had a lot of political stuff on Donald Trump and the delve did some of their own editing to Put some of those individual videos out there and I see a lot of them are over a hundred thousand views So people have he'd in on that some of that kind it was just an interesting interview with a lot of with a lot of Chatting about some other things that we don't often hear Peterson talk about I thought he had his convert his his treatment of hierarchies was One of the clearest I think I've heard him do or perhaps I'm just getting clearer and clearer on what his teaching is and so when he talks it's more and more obvious to me One of the points that I made a couple videos ago was that repetition and study Now as I'm going back and listening to some of his biblical series on Genesis again I hear him with different ears, and I understand him better, but there are a number of things in this video I regularly get in In comments and in emails and Facebook messages the the oversaturation Comment I get that in the meetup. I've been getting that in the meetup for months actually And Peterson talks about this the overexposure problem. He's boy your your YouTube feed is full of him He's he's clearly not doing as many interviews Especially print interviews as he was before he's gotten burned recently on that quite a bit And a little bit later in the week. I'm gonna post the conversation that he did with a friend of mine from You know from Fresno, and I'll post that a little later in the week My friend actually has posted it already on his web page There's the repetition problem that he's as Peterson's Audience gets broader and broader he has to keep repeating himself and saying the same thing over and over again I think about let's say bands from the 70s and 80s that are Let's say bands from the 70s and 80s that had a number of hits and they go on tour for the next 30 years And they keep playing the same song over and over and over again because that's what people want to hear Whereas the more hardcore fans, you know get sick of hearing this song. I want to hear new songs So he wants time to read and to think and create he's talking about the biblical series starting that again in November The question I have about what he's going to do with that series is whether he's going to take it on the road Or if he's going to keep using the Bader theater in Toronto He hasn't talked publicly about his relationship with the University of Toronto if he's on leave What will that relationship be going forward and this gets into the question of Where is Peterson going how to think about Peterson how to frame him earlier on? I Compared him not as being the same but compared him. Let's just let's say Billy Graham Billy Graham Left an institution in his wake and when Billy Graham was doing his work He very much wanted to start a movement and so he engaged local churches and a big part of what the Billy Graham Evangelistic organization did was network with local churches to really turn something into a movement Peterson seems much more a John the Baptist type and i've mentioned that before John the Baptist was a was a big Was a big movement in the first century and the influence of John the Baptist There were followers into the second and third century of John the Baptist that's still connected with his ministry But let's say comparing John the Baptist with Jesus John the Baptist declined and of course Jesus Has continued to grow throughout the world now So it's going to be very interesting again a lot of often some interesting conversation with individuals on where is this going? Where's this going? Peterson doesn't seem to be interested in forming institutions He doesn't even necessarily seem all that interested in fomenting a movement He seems more interested in doing exactly what he's doing, which is going to places And giving talks and when you look at his his book Seer his book his book events He's those really aren't book events They're they're much more he's getting on stage and he is connecting with his audience And he is giving them the thoughts of the day and doing a question and answer and then the vip picture taken Which I think for him is a very Life-giving exercise where he's meeting people and I think he gets rejuvenated and he's if you look at his schedule He's covering an enormous number of cities. It's almost every night another city and he he genuinely seems to Find this not wearing or taxing but invigorating especially as compared to interviews with the new york times or some of these other major publications that are Basically going to take whatever they get from him and devise a little hit piece I I think the the level of The the media The mainstream media attention span is very short. So peterson just kind of hit that span. I also Try to ask normal people and when I say normal people people who are not Paying a lot of attention to jordan peterson what they know about him And in many ways the the hit jobs that have been done on him. I think have had their effect people who? Have never watched any of his videos have never read his book, but just can identify the name Have basically a very low resolution association jordan peterson Right winger misogynist boom boom boom those kinds of things and so I think the the hit jobs have done their effect on him While many of the jordan peters those who have invested in the videos and appreciated his work Many many many of them have stopped they're keeping an eye on him But they've stopped watching videos and they've stopped investing they've they feel like they've heard him already Many are waiting for the biblical series to come out again. Some are watching the sam harris these conversations but my sense is that that's Increasingly spent too and I you know brett weinstein had his conversation on the pang burn stuff My sense is that you know pang burn if they wanted to put this stuff out when the when When the iron was hot You know wait a few days, but then put it out and this long Period of delay. I think I think by the time pang burn puts them out Only the hardest core jordan peterson people are going to go back and watch them because that moment will have already passed And and I also I also don't know that the That the sam harris jordan peterson kind of technical philosophical Is really the sweet spot in terms of the interest in jordan peterson now I might be wrong on that because of the skewed sample that comes to me because i'm a pastor I'll tend to get much more of the biblical series the theological the the religious interest conversation than necessarily the the tit for tat debate with sam harris and and both sam harris and jordan peterson have kind of tried to defuse the the zero the zero-sum game that many want to pose that as And so it's it's just interesting watching that so peterson says the biblical series in exodus And it would be very interesting if he just has the the betr theater in toronto or if he looks for larger venues and decides to take the biblical series on the road and say do one in toronto in a much bigger venue and then in other words take what he's doing in the book tour and Do that in his biblical series I don't see and this is the weakness of him not building an organization or an institution because I've been in conversation with people spending a lot of attention looking at okay He's probably got upcoming book deals that he's working on if you sell a book this large Publishers are going to be all over you You know crying and demanding your next book and they want it now and they want to get it out there and they want it I mean, that's the way the market works. So In peterson when he's been doing this book series my impression is that he's using Just standard promoters omg vip. He's using them Which if you don't have an infrastructure if you haven't built an organization around you You are dependent upon off-the-shelf promoters and This kind of thing now Again, so now when he rolls out the biblical series, what will that look like if he builds an organization around him in an institution? Well, okay If I were advising him I would recommend building an organization and an institution In fact coming at this from a church point of view, which is in a sense Billy graham came at it from a little different point of view, but knowing what I do about Movements and people and and all this kind of thing I would probably approach some of this in a different way Now it could be that peterson is just doing what he wants. It could be that this is the best way to to financially take advantage of this but again my read on peterson is not that This is all about the money not that the money isn't lovely for him. He's Setting up his retirement nicely i'm assuming he's no longer dependent upon University of toronto but for him, it's the mission but getting the sense of What he sees his mission in I almost get the sense that for peterson Okay, a little he talks in this video kind of about the hero's journey He casts himself as the hero and as someone recently said to me, you know He almost sometimes in some interviews. He almost sounds like he wants to be martyred And so then again, I think back on the john the baptist where you know He's waiting for harrod to come and take his head and I don't think harrod is going to come and take jordan peterson's head We're not living in the first century judian culture war And so the question will be will peterson kind of rise and in the in the public sphere have his moment in january 2018 David brooks entitled his new york times piece on peterson the jordan peterson moment Are we past that moment? Now that doesn't mean he's not going to have a tail end of devoted fans But it could be that in a sense his impact has peaked now one of the things that you learn as a pastor is that If you have a if you have a narrative arc And you're not satisfied with what you've accomplished in that narrative arc the way to change it is to do something different You have to do something different and so that would be for peterson Well, what did donald trump do donald trump decided to run for office and I think in some ways I gotta be careful with this one because again donald trump is he who must not be named You know the way donald trump ran for president was almost jordan peterson-esque In terms of i'm gonna try this now and see what happens and lo and behold he's elected president So i'll try north korea now and i'll try putin now and this gets into the whole trump Is he the evil genius? Is he the idiot? Is he mindless? Whatever you think of donald trump? Peterson I get the sense is taking this one step at a time And he does not necessarily Peterson does not necessarily have a master vision And he's a clinical psychologist, which he'll tell you again and again and he's learning as he goes on this tour but Just listening to this interview you're hearing a college professor who's also a clinical psychologist Billy graham who worked in the church and was a pastor evangelist Approached his mission very differently and this is where again There's lots of layers to who we are and in a sense This is the peterson we'll get now will he change will he find a new gear will he do something else? You know, he's got his he's got a self-authoring program the discover yourself. I forget what it is the big five test Program, you know, he talked about a university but But again, if you if say compare jordan peterson to jonathan jonathan height Jonathan height has pursued his mission very differently now jonathan's books I don't think jonathan wrote books that were as Pitched to a popular audience. This was what peterson learned with his quora Adventure so again peterson's a different person and so when When you start comparing peterson to let's say billy graham or start comparing peterson to jonathan height or start comparing peterson to donald trump or maybe one of the fords in ontario politics You know you begin you can begin to see the differences in terms of what decisions is he making? Where is he going with this? And again when he gets back into the biblical series for him peterson talked about that and I thought the terms he used Were a good intellectual and ethical endeavor That isn't the those aren't the kind of terms a pastor would use those aren't the kind of terms Of an evangelist would use and now he mentioned that the biblical series were popular This is all very very interesting and and so now he's I think he's sensing he's He's reaching the end of an arc but Then when he says when the arc is ending February 2019 That's a long ways away in this culture. And so part of me wonders with so many jordan peterson people who people whose Interest he caught in mid 26 or in mid 2017 early 2018 To what degree is this long arc spent now? He's continuing to sell out places it's also the case that maybe myself well, i'm i'm an obsessive person because i'm still with him and I I'm not showing any interest of letting up But for many of the people i'm talking to I mean some people say well I watch your videos more than I watch his and If there's something happens in jordan peterson land, you'll tell me so That gives me an indication of where they're at Seen it done it integrated it at least to the degree that they feel satisfied by the integration and are moving on And looking for the next thing and of course, this is where you have the difference between platforms and performers Jordan peterson sam harris Douglas murray whoever the next whoever the next big thing is google wins no matter what because that's what it means to be a platform And they have obviously some sort of a symbiotic relationship But this is the nature of that game. And so I have the question february 2019 while the biblical series starts november 2018 And i'm very excited to find out what the reception to the biblical series will be and i'm very anxious to see How he sets this up, you know, he's gonna is he gonna have dave rubin come on stage and warm up for the biblical series That doesn't seem right I don't know I I i'm gonna watch very interesting how he frames this because depending on how he frames it it says a lot about what he's trying to do Will the biblical series just be as he declared for the genesis series? Just kind of a and in this case now profitable and popular way to think out loud He did that for genesis Will that be received in the same way for exodus? Remember you you don't step in the same river twice You don't even step in it in the same river once and the speed of popular culture today means whoosh So the jordan peterson that starts the biblical series in november will if he starts in november because Yeah, I I don't have again and this is an a knock against him He doesn't seem to be a planner. He is not working out a master strategy in order to If he's going to be the savior of western civilization One would hope he would be a little more strategic now. He's been Fortunate calvinist would say providential in terms of his success so far and all of his fights have been Have he has done well in them, but we really haven't seen a fight since then and the decision to kind of Hitch the sam harris pang burn thing with the long delay and and not really managing that, you know, I wonder Whether brett weinstein has obviously spoken out on it peterson is blogging about it but hitching his wagon to pang burn and and the pang burn Decisions that have been made have those really served peterson and harris and brett weinstein Seems to say no they he doesn't think they've served the conversation Will by november 2018 the intellectual dark web already be passé. How about february 2019? Will in in april of 2019 if jordan peterson Let me let me make a reference to phil vischer Some of you a few of you will know who phil vischer is most of you won't phil vischer Was the creator of veggie tales and if i'll just pull up the website Okay, this is phil vischer phil vischer was the creator of veggie tales And for I guess for a lot of the audience, you know what veggie tales was veggie Tales was huge and phil vischer was explaining the bible to america and phil vischer Basically became sunday school material through veggie tales and phil vischer lost larry and bob in bankruptcy court Because he he tried to go big and it was a disaster and if you're curious about it You can read phil vischer's book me myself and bob fascinating book I'm sure you can google phil vischer's story and find him on the internet but phil vischer when he was on the rise he could do no wrong and he You know phil's still out there and he's doing different things He's got a little podcast that he does and he did some dvds What's in the bible and he's playing with puppets and he's trying to but you know right now? He's he's just trying to make ends meet whereas In I don't have the timing in my head, but early on in the 90s During the transition from vhs to dvd which he totally Messed up I mean he and he didn't have the kind of legal advice that that would help him that would help him keep larry and bob and You know, it's a it's an amazing story, but it's an incredible story just in terms of just in terms of a little lesson about You can rise high and fast or and There's no telling what's going to happen to you now, I don't think peterson's going to lose anything in bankruptcy court because Peterson is just peterson, but let's imagine he says well Let's take the the biblical series on the road and he starts and he You know this this is in a sense that the the reason why he was safe He's been safe in terms of rolling himself the way he has and i'm no expert in this mind you and there's some of you people out there who know a lot more about this and go ahead and wait in in the comments, but We have no idea where this is going Okay, so here's a here's a scenario. Let's say peterson says i'm going to take my biblical series on the road And I would think that's a that's an amazing thing. So then he starts renting five thousand ten thousand fifteen thousand seat venues And he has to have obviously booked these months in advance And then he does this and he's on the hook for These the rental of these places and he in his first one, let's say he goes to Let's he wouldn't come to sacramento Let's say he goes to the bay area or la rents a 15th rents the staple center because he thinks he can sell it out And only 5 000 people show Boom, you're gonna lose a ton of money and but and you've already I mean this is where As scale goes it gets tricky so Maybe I don't know anything about this because i've never done anything about this But I do know something about church planting and I do know something about christian ministry and I do know something about That when you get up to a certain size there's scale and risk and Who knows what's going to happen to him? So He's got a thousand books waiting to be read which I believe because i've Told him some of those and just the number of books that have been sent to me I can't imagine the books that have been sent to him You know, do you unwind that way the interviewer says spending time with my family? It hasn't been much of that my whole life. I heard that and I thought You're a clinical psychologist. You gotta take care of yourself, dude And um, I function better flat out. Yeah, I see that Um, nothing to complain about I know he's enjoying it. He's got the ride of his life And then this interesting section on conceptualize your life peace and tranquility. No Better as a voluntary adventure and of course, this is total totally peterson-esque Not leisure and tranquility rather alertness and adventure contending with life. This is peterson is peterson has Postmodern neo-marxism and he's grappling with it and he's he's carrying his heavy cross uphill And even if he's not quite sure what's at the top of the hill But he's he's underway And some interesting comments about writing This is going to be interesting because And again, i've likened this to new preachers sometimes I train people to preach and I give them a shot and they They've got one sermon in them and after their sermon they're kind of spent and say, okay let's start working on the next one, but their first sermon was kind of their life story and Well, this is where This is where at some point peterson is a incredibly He's a brilliant man. He's an integral thinker. He's bringing a lot of things together Um going through maps of meaning now and It's a lot of the peterson stuff and I read 12 rules for life and a lot of the peterson stuff And so you have to question How much other stuff and this is where I as a preacher? You know if you if you rely on this bible and if you actually study it the bible can continue to give you new information And the bible has done this throughout human history again and again and again and again and again And if you look at almost all church revival movements many of them go back to the bible find new things in it and and then a new movement grows, so I think his strategy of using the bible in this way is a brilliant one It's worked for preachers throughout and then you have the question of what is he really is he a preacher? Is he an evangelist? Is he a psychologist? Does he does he fashion himself a prophet and that word has come up often the scott alexander Piece on him and I think in many ways john the baptist he That's kind of what is going on but now We'll have to see so Feels like he accomplishes something when he's writing lecturing and clinical work too, but especially writing that was very telling so Oh half hour. That's not too bad for me because I ramble and yes, I rambled I was hoping it'd be more like 15 minutes, but I can't do that. So Again, just a few just a few takes on this interview and I know some of you are really bored by the soap operas the soap opera Aspect of the jordan peterson story I'm not bored by it. I i'm watching and it's the truman show and you're just wondering How's this gonna end? We'll see don't think there's a herod around that's going to take off his head
