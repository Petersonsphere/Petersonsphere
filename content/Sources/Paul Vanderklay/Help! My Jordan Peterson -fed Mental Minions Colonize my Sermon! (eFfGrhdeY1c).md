 Hi this is Paul. It's Friday so it's rough draft for Sunday time where I walk through the current draft of my sermon. For some of you who've been watching my Jordan Peterson videos you'll notice things come in and that's pretty normal for me. What I think about during the week almost always winds its way into the sermon and so for some of you that might be a beneficial thing. Part of over the last six months been doing all these Jordan Peterson videos. My congregation hears a little bit about it gets a little interested so it's a way of me bringing my worlds together in a way. So this past week was last weekend was of course the Sam Harris Jordan Peterson conversation and I listened to a bunch of things from the both of them to try and get ready and one of the common complaints or criticisms that I hear sometimes from the skeptic whatever label you want to put on that group of people is certain things aren't in the Bible. There's there isn't a no slavery rule or there isn't a no nukes rule or or something like this and surely God would put those things in the Bible. Now there's not really a don't be corrupt well I'll ask you is there a don't be corrupt rule in the Bible? If you do a little Bible search see right away when I do this it's like I got to rearrange my slides so that's why I do a rough draft. So you can search corrupt and look at all the words instances of corrupt at least in in the various English translations I have easily at my disposal. You can even search for the word bribe but bribery isn't corruption. Corruption is a far broader word and it's actually a fairly important word if you if you look for it in the Bible. So if there if there is a don't be corrupt rule it's kind of similar to Google's don't be evil rule. Does it matter if the Bible does have a don't be corrupt rule will people change their behaviors? If the Bible doesn't have a don't be corrupt rule does it mean now look at that edit there too. Go back to the beginning of the slide if the Bible does have a don't be corrupt rule will it change people's behaviors? A lot of times when I listen to often people who are not in the church but even people who are in the church sometimes will say pastor you should get up on the pulpit and tell people to stop doing that and I think is that going to make them stop? We have all kinds of rules in the Bible about not doing this and not doing that. Don't commit adultery is a pretty clear one and people do it all the time. Don'ts where we're going with this is the limitations of rules. So if the Bible does have a don't be corrupt rule will people change their behaviors? A little bit to a degree to some degree. My point is that this business about rules and behavior is a very complicated business. What we often usually do if there's something we want to do that breaks a rule what we usually weighed in with is a justification where we will say well normally this is the rule but I am justified in breaking the rule for these reasons. So for example I am justified in committing adultery because my spouse doesn't understand me or we've fallen out of love or they've done it first or they've done this thing that has hurt me therefore this is getting back committing adultery is justice. But this gets into the question about religion and is religion hooey? Now there are a lot of assumptions about both how the Bible works and its content that bring people to one conclusion or another. Some people who argue against the Bible are very knowledgeable about the Bible others aren't. Some people who argue against argue that we shouldn't listen to the Bible might know a lot about the Bible but might not know a lot about how the Bible actually functions in specific religious communities and you also have the fact that the Bible functions differently in different specific religious communities even within the same culture and that the Bible functions differently within different religious communities across different cultures. It's all a very complicated situation and it is not the case that there's a rule in the Bible therefore Christians obey the rule. That's clearly not the case Christians break their own rules all the time. Christians even break the rules that they develop that aren't in the Bible so this business about rule making doesn't really hold. The conclusions they come to aren't always massively deterministic about their lives. I regularly hear people say well it's it's always my rule to never speak against anyone else and then they go right ahead and speak against other people. I'm doing this class in the epistles of John and the epistles of John are famous for having these most amazing passages about love one another and God is love is in in in first John and love love love love love and then a verse later it turns around but don't even talk to these other people in fact they're of the devil and despise them and don't give them the time of day and don't associate with them and Raymond Brown in his commentary that's a little far for me to reach Raymond Brown in his commentary brings this up and says on one hand no place in the Bible is more filled with love love love love and then he goes on to say filled with love love love love and then he turns around and says and don't even associate with these other people because they are and it's kind of like wait a minute you're you're in the same book and so skeptics rightly point this out and say the Bible shouldn't be followed it's inconsistent. How could how could the word of God be so inconsistent? Well if Sam Harris who was an atheist and one of the things that we recognize about this is that it's not the case that Sam Harris is an evil awful person because he's an atheist if Sam Harris I don't know a lot about Sam Harris but if Sam Harris were my neighbor he seems like a perfectly honest trustworthy man I would give him my house keys and ask him to take in the mail while I was on vacation and and maybe let he and his wife babysit my children and was I just sexist for bringing his wife into babysit I'd let Sam Harris if my kids were still little I'd let Sam Harris babysit my children. I've had many atheist friends in my life and I let them babysit my children and I lent them my car and they had keys to my house and I would I would trust them with as confidants and they're atheists does that mean they're not trustworthy? No. Now to an degree Jordan Peterson says ha you're not atheists and they of course are offended and round and round and round we go about that but we would imagine that if if all of this stuff about the Bible and rules and atheism and and then having a different moral structure which which I might be skeptical about that this would somehow deeply impact behavior and it just doesn't seem to hold true so then people kind of flip around and say ah all of this stuff none of this stuff is important whether you're a Christian or an atheist you're all the same it's it's the culture you were born into but then again if you start looking closely at that you see no our beliefs our commitments our communities our religions in fact do often over long periods of time often over multiple generations actually impact what we do and how we relate to one another. Now CNN is not my lectionary and so I always get a little annoyed when people say you know you should pitch a sermon on this on this thing pastor is this corruption? One of the things that we deal with is the question okay what is corruption and you'll find that people very quickly differ on corruption. Last week's big news was was family separation at the border this week it's Anthony Kennedy and and his retirement. Anthony Kennedy is a CK McClatchy alum my kids some of my kids went to CK McClatchy and I was as a parent I helped with the band so but and so they're very proud of that. Anthony Kennedy comes from Sacramento so there have been a lot of articles about Anthony Kennedy and the B but now when Obama was president the Republican controlled Senate didn't bring his Supreme Court nominee up for a vote and well was that right or wrong was that corrupt was that well it was a legal gray area. Now they might rush through Trump's nominee before the midterms and today I saw all of these articles about well Anthony Kennedy's son is a big wheel at Deutsche Bank and Deutsche Bank has loaned Donald Trump a lot of money so is there a conspiracy theory about this is there corruption and so even if you had a rule that said don't be corrupt does that necessarily cast a lot of light onto all of this because just as I said earlier it's not that people don't know what rules are and it's not that if there's a rule people will follow it and it's not just simply that if there's a rule people will break it. People are a lot more complicated a lot more nuanced when it comes to rules and and so what people usually do is say yeah there's this rule but I'm going to break it and my breaking it is justified in that to a certain degree we we maintain our own egos. So what exactly is corruption? Well that's not terribly hard to define you know we do we do what it is what is in our personal self-interest rather than what is good or right for others or right in history or right for your group or right for the world. Sometimes we further our own agendas over fair process and so when you look at the Anthony Kennedy thing that's kind of what people are debating. Well what's fair? Well fair is so often in the eye of the beholder especially if you don't imagine there is a god who will finally hold us to account over what is fair but then we might argue that well we couldn't know what was fair because we didn't have all the information and we couldn't see it from their perspective and so on and so forth. Corruption the opposite of corruption is in a sense your well-being at my expense and those of you who've been listening to my sermons for a very long time know this is a favorite catch phrase for me there's this polarity my well-being at your expense and your well-being at my expense and so really when it comes down to corruption it's it's the question can you say no to yourself for the sake of others for the sake of right and wrong for the sake of good and evil. Now last week we looked at the the purge of jay-hugh and we've been looking going taking a long time looking at first second Samuel first and second kings and we've seen kind of the rise and the fall of the messianic kingdom of Israel in the Old Testament and and when we look at Solomon we kind of have a lesson in corruption. Now the Solomon story is is sort of archetypal in that Solomon becomes the wisest man in the world but then the wisest man in the world gets corrupted. Now part of this is the how the Hebrews understood wisdom. Wisdom was understood in terms of excellence it was understood in terms of skill it was understood in terms of capacity and competence more necessary it's a very that's a very big discussion that we don't have time to get into but here's a question is this story more helpful to us in convicting us informing us letting us know about our lives and corruption than necessarily a list of rules that's a complicated question because if Solomon had a rule no marrying foreign women maybe that would have kept corruption at at bay if if Solomon had other rules maybe that would have correct kept corruption at bay David was going to build the temple God said no Solomon built the temple if Rehoboam had had a rule about laws and taxes maybe he could have saved his kingdom or maybe if he had a rule always listen to your elders but that's a hard thing because sometimes the elders are wrong so so right there you see there's a tension between the value of rules and the value of stories now as a pastor I often find that people have assumptions about the Bible and and the broadest assumption that I hear regularly is that the Bible is a book of rules and laws and if you keep God's rules and laws God will bless you and reward you here and in heaven and if you break the rules God will punish you here in heaven now there are passages that say similar things and there are passages that say things that are in tension with those things but again I find that many many people both Christians and non-Christians kind of assume the Bible is that way but now if you pick up a Bible and I suppose I could do it I have lots of Bibles in my office even though I seldom open them not because I don't open Bibles but because I almost always use the Bible in my computer if you would look at the Bible you would say okay what portion of the Bible Charles Stanley life principles Bible people give me Bibles sometimes too if you would open the Bible and say well what part of the Bible has rules in it well let's maybe start in the middle of Exodus and there's a lot of rules in Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy there's not only rules but there's a lot of rules and so we might say that the part of the Bible that emphasizes that has rules is kind of in here almost the whole rest of the Bible is not primarily rules most of the rest of the Bible are narratives stories wisdom prophetic complaints poetry letters correspondence now there are various little rules tucked in amongst those things but only a tiny tiny portion of the Bible itself actually are lists of rules and and that's really helpful and important to think about now quite famously Christianity and Judaism are have a little bit of tension over this because Judaism works a little bit differently than Christianity when it comes to rules but so so even illustrations of good and bad aren't necessarily reductive with this and again a very common approach to the Bible in Sunday school oh del wants to do updates oh lovely little computer glitch right there so one way people read the Bible is the Bible is a list of rules that you have to keep another way people read the Bible is the Bible are a bunch of stories with people with black hats and white hats and the Bible illustrates the good guys from the bad guys the heroes from the the villains from the the villains the problem with that approach to reading the Bible is it also isn't it also doesn't follow the Bible if you actually read about Abraham and Jacob and Isaac and Joseph and David and Samuel it's very hard in fact to find perfect people in the Bible some of your greatest heroes are truly scoundrels you know David on his dying bed is like you know don't tell Solomon keep the covenant to the Lord and oh yeah kill all my enemies that that I haven't bothered to kill even all my scores and so right after David dies there's a small little bloodbath where where Solomon cleans up the messes after David and of course David and Bathsheba and he kills Bathsheba's husband to cover up the affair and on and on and on and on that's the story of the Bible and that's how the Bible works now the only exception to that is of course Jesus but that gets into a whole another theological category the Bible is not a simplistic book of rules or heroes that we are supposed to emulate even if often Sunday school literature will do this you'll hear a lot of this in churches I don't think that's actually what's in the Bible and I think I've got a pretty good case if you actually read the Bible and what this leads us to are a whole bunch of paradoxes life is complex and life is simple good and evil are clear sometimes it's hard to know the right thing to do in a given circumstance we all know this but which way we see it is often contextual and that's why people will say well I know there's this no adultery rule but you know as long as my wife doesn't know it'll be okay I really need this my marriage will be better if I have a mistress just sit down with real people and talk to them and our capacity for justifying something that is against a rule is phenomenal this introduction may be too long for this sermon that was 15 minutes I always have a problem with introductions that go on too long that's kind of why it's kind of nice to do a little video because YouTube doesn't have a clock on it and I have to whittle it down before Sunday so what we have here in second Kings 11 is in fact a story of corruption and in J. Hughes in J. Hughes purge last week we talked about the fact that Israel Israel basically folds because it is corrupt and all the king's servants have no loyalty to him because they're only loyal to themselves because the king is only loyal to himself and the queen is only loyal to herself and when you have a hierarchy or a structure or an institution that everyone is only in it for themselves this is almost the definition of corrupt because someone who is not corrupt puts the needs of the institution or the group or the nation or the god or whatever authority figure ahead of their own that is basically the definition of not being corrupt well Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah who J. Hugh has just killed saw that her son was dead she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family in other words okay my son is dead I'm seizing the throne and I'm going to kill anyone who could be a who could be a threat to me now right away here we have to ask the question which country has a no killing rule when we talk to people and talk about well you know right and wrong and morality that seems pretty universal well if there's a near universal moral code it's usually don't kill well does that's has that stopped us from killing no and right away Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah when she learns that her son the king is dead thinks I'm in charge now now what's interesting is if you've been following the story you know that Athaliah is a daughter of Jezebel and so what in a sense we've seen is that corruption has been spreading from the northern kingdom to the southern kingdom now if I would pull up that that list of that concordance list of uses of corrupt in the bible one of the things that you would see is that in biblical language corruption tends to spread it spreads between people because and this isn't hard to figure out because when we were in us that we're in a group and we figure out that the people in the group are valuing themselves and taking advantage of the group and using the group for their own welfare and placing themselves ahead of the welfare of the group well that's called corruption and pretty soon everybody starts to do it and this is this is a very delicate thing in terms of institutions once the people in the institution are corrupt or get a sense that the institution is corrupt the institution falls because the institution is built on trust and if everybody in the institution is just using things to get their own way everything falls apart and what we saw in jayhue's purge was that someone would come up to jayhue and say you know are you loyal to the king and jayhue would say be loyal to me and they almost always would fall in line why the king was corrupt well to what degree was the king corrupt well this is where corruption goes all the way up and if there's no up there above the king if in fact this is where we get into bail worship if in fact all bail is is a petty tyrant who is looking for allegiance and offerings and will kick down dependent on what everyone is kicking up well that then impacts who the king is and so it makes a great deal of difference what's at the top of your hierarchy and and that when it comes to these stories and kings is deeply embedded in the system i can already tell that my my situation here will be quite long and yeah the video is going to be longer than the sermon i'm going to have to do a lot of editing in this thing but now something happens but jehoi she um jehoi shiba the daughter of king jehoram and the sister of a haziah took joash the son of a haziah and stole him away from among the royal princes now you might say well would a baby be missing but now let's pay attention when we saw what happened in the northern kingdom one of the things that these kings do is proliferate the number of wives and the number of sons so that they can guarantee themselves a legitimate heir now king henry the eighth didn't have the possibility of polygamy so he kept offing his wives so apparently there was a new baby born that athaliah might not have heard about and the mother and the daughter conspire to save their child so she put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from athaliah so he was not killed and he remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the lord temple of the lord for six years while athaliah ruled the land now in the seventh year of jehoi in the seventh year jehoi descent for the commanders of the units of a hundred the kharites and the guards that had been brought to him at the temple of the lord he made a covenant with them and put their put them under oath at the temple of the lord now pay attention to what's happening here here pay attention to what's happening here even though i'm not paying attention i'm looking at the messages coming into my watch maybe i'm corrupt what's going on here well what what kings often happened had was an elite bodyguard this elite bodyguard was often were often from a particular tribe and in david's case they were often not even israelites they were they were loyal specifically to him more than the tribe now this becomes very important for david when he fights the civil war against his son absolim because what we saw again and again is that this close-knit group of mighty men that were loyal to david who came around david in his exile years when he was fleeing from saul boy i could run the sermon so many different ways this text is so rich and it's a text that nobody ever pays any attention to because it ties all these different places so again i can talk about this on the video my challenges are gonna have to pair this down for the sermon maybe i'll start with the story i don't know in other words this sermon is very much in flux so what happens so let's go back to david so what happens with david is if you recall david is not corrupt david faces down against goliath when all of israel is on the verge of corruption because saul is corrupt because saul is disconnected from the lord who is in fact the top of the hierarchy where there is no corruption because again corruption always spreads and it bleeds and so saul is corrupt and saul is hiding in his tent instead of facing goliath and david goes up and he basically says me and god i believe in the lord and if god doesn't save me ha but i'm not going to let this phallistin do this boom there's the opposite of corruption and then saul elevates him david is uncorruptible saul fingers i'll give you my daughter i'll bring you into my corruption david is not corruptible david's corruption will come later and so saul then wants to kill him well what would what does jhu do well jhu is his life isn't even in danger and he kills those above him what is athaliah doing well she's kicking down again the way the world works is kick down kiss up well athaliah kicks down tries to kill all her relatives yeah this is a great thing tries to kill all her relatives to preserve her power well nobody's loyal to him well where does the insurrection come from it comes from the temple so the priest class conspires with the bodyguard now we didn't get any we didn't get any commentary here on the reign of athaliah but judging from the lack of loyalty to her she was probably enormously corrupt and everybody knew she was a bad queen and people hated her or maybe it was the patriarchy that wanted to see her downfall because she was a woman i don't know there's no speculation of it and there's no talk about it in the text but basically a coup gets formed and it's but it's between jahuita the priest and the bodyguards and so wow this is a real problem for athaliah and they basically and jahuita basically says okay summon yourself around the king he's seven years old we're going to have him take power but you've got a seven-year-old taking power putting power putting the king in power by the high priest well who's really going to be in control well the high priest is this going to be a good thing or a bad thing well depends on the high priest well we'll see the high priest and then the question is is the high priest preparing the boy to be a good king so the gargoyles which with weapon in hand stationed themselves around the king near the altar in the temple from the south side to the north side of the temple jahuita brought out the king's son and put a crown on him he pre remember if you know anything about napoleon who crowns napoleon after the french revolution napoleon well this is much more typical you know the pope crowns charlemagne the priest crowns king joash they anoint him the priest anoints joash not a prophet interestingly enough where are the prophets have they all been killed and the people clapped their hands and shouted long live the king so you have the royal bodyguards you have the priestly class and now you have the citizens of jerusalem nobody liked athaliah the daughter of the tyrian bail you know that's that's where she came from she came from tire when athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people she went to the people at the she went to the people at the temple of the lord she looked and there was the king standing by the pillar as the custom was the officers and the trumpeters were beside the king and all the people of the land were rejoicing in the blowing the trumpets athaliah tore her robes and cried out treason treason ah this is in a sense the height of corruption when you try to use the rules in a corrupt way and that's when you know it's all hollowed out because i appeal to the rules and everybody laughs i appeal to the tradition and everybody laughs because they know you killed your family you're illegitimate well what does that mean where does legitimacy rise boy the sermon is changing as i talk how does this world hold together what is corruption corruption bleeds down and then it kills up because if you kick down well they will kick up jehoi to the priest ordered the commanders of the units of a hundred who were in charge of the troops bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her for the priest had said she must not be put to death in the temple of the lord why ah well this is when you say no to expedience this is when you say no to yourself this is when there's a rule that you obey well there was a rule no bloodshed in the temple although that got broken and you can find the text where it got broken but what's behind the rule well behind the rule is a story and behind the stories are behaviors and and so now you can see how all of this is in fact constructed jehoi then made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people that they would be the lord's people they renewing the covenant now are there rules there yes but it's not just rules it's action it's story it's community it's it's agreements of behavior it's trust and understanding and it's watching each other in very subtle ways that you get signals is this corrupt how do i know once the jig is up once corruption is shot through well then suddenly chaos emerges and bloodshed emerges and this is part of the reason why it's the priest it's there's a structure here i made a comment now i'm way off the reservation in terms of this rough draft this is no rough draft at all anymore i'm i'm freewheeling baby which means that i got a lot more work to do on this sermon but i'm on video and so might as well keep it up one of the things i noted at our meetup last night when we're wandering all over the place talking about jordan peterson and everything else under the sun i mentioned that well you'll often see typical at the end of the roman empire why was it the church that in a sense replaces the empire because when all of the corrupt political institutions fall it's usually the best organized and the the most cohesive groups and the groups with the least amount of corruption that can in fact reconstitute the people and then the other institutions the political institutions the economic institutions then grow within the religious institutions and then eventually outgrow them and in fact one way to understand the thousand years that are the middle ages from roughly 500 the decay and corruption of the roman empire to 1500 in a sense the supremacy of political economic other institutions that in a sense after 1500 start to overshadow the church and what we've seen in the church is a continual loss of prestige as these other institutions rise we see well this is what happens with corruption now what happens often with institutions will outgrow the actual confidence and fidelity and trust that create them and once an institution outgrows its trust the corruption value goes value goes higher and higher and higher and then eventually collapses and then you get the kind of chaos and bloodshed that that we see happening here in the story my sermon is going to be totally different from this i got a lot to do on this sermon so all the people of the land went to smash the temple of baal oops we haven't been told this someone had built a temple of baal in jerusalem i wonder who it was probably athaliya why well jezebel built the temple of baal in samaria and probably athaliya built the temple of baal in jerusalem and so now the people smash it now is this a is can you how many how many different tribal aspects can you look at this they probably looked at athaliya as a foreign queen so you've got nationalism going here you've got religious nationalism going here so anyway first they kill athaliya then they go to the temple of baal and they tear it down they smash the altars and the idols to pieces and they killed matan the priest of baal in front of the altars ah now pay attention they didn't kill in the temple in jerusalem in the temple of the lord but they did kill in the temple of baal why well this is they are expressing sacredness okay they are expressing allegiance to the lord now if you remember the destruction of the temple of baal in samaria after they destroyed it and burned it how was it used in town as a toilet now if you go zoom all the way to the new testament to jesus time there's um there's gehenna the valley near jerusalem that had been used for pagan sacrifice human sacrifice during some of the eras of the bad kings and this one then was used as a garbage dump in other words the people are acting out their ideas of clean and unclean sacred common and profane and so what we see happening here in jerusalem is in fact religious reform it's nationalism perhaps but jehoi who has just engineered this whole thing the priest posted guards at the temple of the lord so you have the army and the priests and together they're bringing down the queen and they're going to put back the boy in the line of david back onto the throne he took with him the commanders of hundreds the charites the guards and all the people of the land and together they brought the king down from the temple of the lord pay attention to the symbolism and this and he went into the palace entering by way of the gate of the guards and the king then took his place on the royal throne all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was calm because athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace joesiah or joash was seven years old when he began to reign which says something about who's probably pulling the strings now joash actually wound up to be a pretty good king after 23 years they're dealing with some corruption at the temple because after 23 years the priests weren't repairing the temple and they were getting money and chapter 12 goes through the money aspect now the king wanted it repaired so he negotiated with them to raise the money and repair it now does this express corruption is this good or not good now what they did eventually was they made a big enough collection of money and they had lay people repair the temple and then the comment is that the lay people were so happy to do it that no one had to check the accounts because everyone was totally honest with it now again what is this chapter about these chapters are about corruption and what it's saying is that there's a reform that happened there was corruption that came into the monarchy and there was potentially some corruption in the temple and joash who was the product of some of this corruption actually took some of that character and started to express it and so just as corruption begets corruption sometimes reform begets reform and as the book of ezekiel displays quite clearly what is true in the temple gets played out in the streets what is true in the religion gets played out in the action now is this just about rules that's not just about rules it's about stories it's conveyed by stories because stories convey behaviors and in terms of our face-to-face communications we're watching ourselves very quick very clearly our watchers are watching each other and it's we're watching for corruption all the time because it's if if everyone is in it for themselves we're not gonna we're not going to be in it for god or for the kingdom or for the king or for the covenant or for all of these things that demand sacrifice oh gosh all my brain is working through all this george peterson stuff right now all these things that demand sacrifice if nobody else is okay well what's this about this is about the community i'm gonna have to completely rewrite this sermon so good or not good haziel remember him he got anointed two weeks ago he's anointed by weeping elisha invades and threatens to destroy jerusalem joash raids the temple treasury to pay for haziel to offer him tribute now this is mentioned is this good or bad does this express trust or not trust is this expedient or is this an expression of character or corruption we're not sure the text doesn't say it just lays it out there and in a sense invites us to discuss it and this is often the way the bible works again there's the simplistic version of the bible that says the bible is a list of rules and you're supposed to keep the rules yeah the bible is a list of stories and you can find good guys and bad guys yeah the bible is actually a far more complicated book that has far more nuance it was clearly written by scribes who were geniuses if you understand the intricate ways this book functions and works and was developed but many of these passages oh yeah the agenda the the author has an agenda and he's moving his agenda forward but many of these passages are open-ended and what they're really inviting us to do is to start to live into the passages and to begin to debate how corrupt was joash how good of a king was joash now as in kings all of the kings have these summaries and they did what's right in the eyes of the lord they did what's wrong in the eyes of the lord it's a very extremely low resolutionary resolution binary judgment and so that stands but the text is written in a way that we're invited to have our own judgments in the eyes of the lord all the years jehoi da was priest oh was he only god in the years that the priest who raised him had influence over him was he in charge was the priest in charge was he a puppet but he didn't destroy the high places now this is a this is a litany that gets repeated again and again and again in the book of kings and this is always seen as a negative thing because these high places are a big source of religious corruption because everybody's keeping their own little religious thing and what the the agenda of the book is to centralize its to firm up the hierarchy in order hopefully to resist corruption but part of the difficulty is that in fact when you firm up a hierarchy if you get corruption in the hierarchy you start to invite and you because what hierarchies and institutions do is they magnify power and they magnify control and so once you get corruption in the institution or in the hierarchy then you lose the whole hierarchy because in effect the hierarchy only works on trust and reality that people trust and believe in so what's the agenda behind that now jehoi da the priest didn't do it either in other words now didn't he do it because he didn't have the confidence of the people he didn't have the political chips he he didn't you know if you really want to destroy the high places of the high places of the high he didn't you know if you really want to destroy the high places maybe you need a military purge and you're good to put the nation under martial law and then maybe you yourself will be the threat of an uprising so they were probably working this kind of balance so they didn't do that either but then again what does that mean are they corrupt are they are they not sufficiently fearful of the lord at the top of the hierarchy that they'll they'll allow other things beneath them this entire passage is about corruption and again what we see is a rule don't be corrupt doesn't begin to deal with any of this doesn't begin to deal with reality now is a rule don't be corrupt a bad rule no it's about as good a rule as you can think of but it's not a terribly useful rule it doesn't really illuminate or inform again because what people usually do with rules is they concoct a justification usually built on stories usually built on actions usually built on their own read of a situation to say ah but this is an exception to the rule so i am permitted to kill or to steal or to commit adultery now killing stealing and committing adultery are about the three they're about the three commandments we've got left in terms of our in terms of our civic culture those are the three commandments that almost everyone will say you should not kill you should not steal you should not commit adultery false witness that one's under debate right now you shall not covet gave that up all a long time ago now this doesn't sound good at all as for the other events of the rent of the as for the other events of the reign of joash and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of juda his officials conspired against him corruption took him down his officials conspired against him and assassinated him at beth milo on the road down to silla the officials who murdered him were jozabad son of shimeith and jehoshabad son of shomer he died and was buried with his ancestors in the city of david amaziah his son succeeded him as king remember what the story is about story is about corruption this is a story about a kingdom that reaches its height under david and solomon and a kingdom that slowly after multiple generations hundreds of years gets corrupted and that's how corruption it seeps it penetrates it works slowly don't be corrupt don't be evil that rules not a bulwark against anything i am going to change the sermon completely would a no corruption rule help i think almost anybody would say don't be corrupt it's not like nobody agrees on this rule i think you will find even the most determined atheist agreeing with a don't a no corrupt rule is the text not clear about right and wrong i'd say the text is quite clear about right and wrong but the text isn't exhaustive in its clarity about right and wrong especially in the ways that we implicitly read it because when we read these texts we project ourselves into the characters usually selectively often in order to pull out of it the story we want or the message we want about ourselves so there's always a lot of bias or the message we want about our enemies so some of you are reading listening to this passage and thinking about obama some of you are listening to this passage and thinking about trump and i'm sure you can apply this passage to obama and trump and probably the way you apply this passage says more about you than about the passage i do it myself i'm not going to do it now the stories illuminate but applications remain our own can we separate them into good guys and bad guys and here's the thing jesus tells us to do things jesus remains very popular with people today and i have this all the time if you even if you listen to russell brand for example russell brand the bible that russell brand likes to use is mostly just the gospels and the stories of jesus he doesn't want to listen to paul he doesn't want to listen to the old testament i just want jesus well why well that's based on a snapshot of who he thinks jesus is based on a reading of the gospels but if i would sit down with him and we'd have a little bit of time i think i would probably say let's take a look at some of this jesus in the gospels i think you might find some things that you might not appreciate because point number one jesus talks more about hell than anybody else in the bible point number two jesus quotes the old testament more than anyone else in the bible now you might like to imagine or frame jesus as kind of a hippie-ish figure who's singing john lennon's songs you really will not get that jesus from any of the gospels um what you are seeing is some of jesus character his the love that he expresses for outliers the criticism he has for corruption and you take those elements and you say oh there's jesus well here's the thing about jesus if jesus was really that kind of person they wouldn't have bothered to kill him what the his as much of a historical record as i think just about anyone can glean from any select gospel passages at all was that jesus really annoyed almost everyone and even disturbed his disciples who loved him dearly to the degree that in the midst of a fairly hot culture war parties that could agree on almost nothing could all agree they would like their world without jesus that doesn't really that doesn't really tell us that jesus was the kind of figure that if he came into your life you would be significantly disturbed by him that it would always it would always be rainbows and unicorns and and lovely walks hand in hand through the garden which is how quite frankly a lot of emotionalistic nostalgic christians like to play this on both the right and the left so there's a little mini sermon in the sermon for you because i'm taking great liberties with rough draft for sunday people say jesus is a moral model but we're skeptical about the supernatural aspects of the story all right there's your cultural filter but how do you relate to the story how do you read yourself in it now again someone might read this and say aha the corruption of donald trump you can talk a lot about that some of you say oh obama started the corruption okay place the corruption where you want it all of us will agree there's corruption probably will disagree on who's corrupt and who isn't who's got who are the good guys who are the bad guys how do they help people obey the rules or be less corrupt now again i would argue that if you read this story the story is way more informative than it don't be corrupt rule because if you read the story things certain things become obvious to just about anyone sure there are multiple interpretations of the story sure you can pull the story out of the text and try to interpret it in your own way but i would argue i have a two o'clock appointment but i would argue the story does a fair amount of bringing it in itself and good narrative well written narrative well written literature does that it makes its point on one end it's open-ended enough so that we can enter into it but it's also focused enough so that it is compelling and moving and persuasive that's what stories do stories persuade life is complicated if you write if you tried to write rules for life and i thought there were 12 rules for life rolls for life doing this in front of a whole bunch of jordan peterson fans you see how corrupt is vanderkley in terms of his working jordan peterson to try and claw his way up the jordan peterson hierarchy well you can be the judge but rules for life not my favorite approach can rules help sure but they're illustrative more in fact than they're binding especially in a context like we're dealing with if you try to write rules for life you can make an endless list with endless wranglings and people can only keep in mind one thing at a time what people have a real capacity for a story and also poetry but we've sort of lost that in our culture hierarchies i have ideas develop and in christianity following the old testament love the lord your god with all your hearts all mine and strike love your neighbor as yourself but then jesus acts in a way that isn't easy to distill into rules he's clearly not corrupt and how do we know he's not corrupt because of his death it is a story at the edges you can't get a bigger story and for jordan peterson people you've heard him say archetypal story you can't get a bigger story than one perfect man dying for the sins of the whole world this only works however to make you less corrupt if you believe it okay the story might be inspirational the story might be aspirational but most people would say yeah it's pretty extreme because then essentially what jesus says if you give your life you get another better one not subject to corruption or decay which is the resurrection so you believe this man was incorruptible because remember it starts at the top how will you respond do you see your own corruption that's always the hard part because you really need other people to tell you because we have too many biases protecting our egos from our sin which is why in christian tradition part of the job of the holy spirit is not to give us good feelings when we listen to good feelings when we listen to christian music to give us miraculous powers when we want to heal our friends part of the power of the holy spirit is to convict us of sin why because it's in the conviction of sin that we begin the process of sanctification of our improvement of our growth into christ of becoming more like christ you have to be terribly secure to be honestly critical of yourself well how do you get terribly secure well what if the god of the universe loves you and has saved you and has done all of these things for you to the degree that this is where my calvinism comes through you are so firmly in his hand that romans eight nothing can separate you from his love if you have that kind of security now maybe i can get to work on the kinds of deceptions and biases and corruptions that are in my own heart do you see him dying to give you your corruption because that's it because unless it's persuasive unless you feel it deep in your bones unless you believe it at a very deep level you're not going to live it because we're way too corrupt do you believe he gives us his spirit to become like him and then this sunday we end with communion so this started out as rough draft for sunday maybe this is a new draft for sunday and there's a whole bunch of jordan peterson thoughts in here so that's just kind of the way it works sometime looks like i have a lot more work to do before sunday so thanks for watching
