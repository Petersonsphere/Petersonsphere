 I oh oh no oh no it's being recorded uh that was uh every time I'd have staff meetings at like one of the universities that was always like oh bring it down but I used to come up to Sacramento probably a couple times a year flying in there to go to Stockton and some friends out there so frequent frequent in your old town yeah it's a cool little area it is a cool little area old town sack yeah I haven't done the underground there's an underground tour in old town sack now where um because the street the old street level is quite a bit lower and so now actually the street level of old town sack is a little bit higher now so there's a whole underground area there so I love that kind of stuff I uh there's like if you ever go to tombstone Arizona there's actually a hidden like underground tour that you can take down there through all the groups like fun you have to find the right person to ask but uh yeah there's an underground tour there well we should we should begin so you had a little bio of yourself but why don't you why don't you tell me why don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit about yourself yeah um I'm kind of like stream of consciousness sometimes I apologize in advance um a little bit you have to apologize for that on this channel yeah well fair enough well a little bit of background on me um my parents were kind of like part of the like Jesus hippie movement I guess like in the 70s my mom was deeply involved in missions she spent time in Iran before the Shah fell she spent time in Pakistan all that kind of stuff my dad was a DTS that is a Dallas Theological Seminary graduate so he was like that whole scene he was a pastor when I was born and uh yeah there my dad was a church planter he got burned doing that up in Washington um and I was born up there but we moved down to Arizona pretty soon after that I grew up in a household where we didn't have television the only things I watched were like Bible cartoons um your viewers might not be familiar with Superbook or the Hammer Bible Adventures my first Bible was a comic book Bible so I was deeply I was deeply immersed in like kind of what would you call like the the the even Bible bookstore evangelical kit yeah yeah yeah the the social imaginary of a evangelical Bible bookstore wow wow it's very very western United States too yeah oh yeah totally uh I didn't know that at the time but later on of course you know what's that book on evangelicalism that came out a few years ago I can't remember her name it was a big book though um apostles of reason no no just called evangelicalism oh okay remember it was a pop it was a popular book even al moller interviewed this author I can't but I remember I was reading through that book I'm like she's like talking about the history of western fundamentalism I'm like oh man that's like that's me my parents are talking about my mom my mom the uh it's kind of weird my mom was also very involved like with civil rights and my parents my dad was you know a baptist preacher my mom did not want to be part of the southern baptist convention though because she grew up in the south and knew about that whole relationship so yeah part of the conservative baptist association is what my dad was with so we went out to Payson Arizona which is a small kind of at the time it was like you know they didn't they didn't have nothing they had like they just had a grocery store just opened up when I was out there and so my dad was minister you know trying to raise a family I think he was getting like ten thousand dollars a year or something like that you know I raised a family out in the small town rural community um and at some point you know they had a guest speaker come in and they were like speaking you know I don't know they were doing all the crazy stuff my dad was like everybody loved it my dad's like oh I can't do this and so he went on a walk that night and decided he was going to apply for law school and so he did the opposite most people they're lawyers and they feel bad and become pastors he was a pastor felt bad and became a lawyer and so we moved down he went to law school down in uh Tucson so we moved in and uh lived down there for a long time um spent a I was you know lived in a pretty like diverse cultural context yeah I was uh I my mom tried to get me to enroll in a they had magnet schools is what they call them down there it was like kind of these places where they let you kind of like explore sciences and arts a little bit more in more folks manner they wouldn't let me go there because I uh I offset my school's demographic there I was like you know they I was like the white guy there the token white guy at my school they wouldn't let me leave but um so went down to Tucson lived there for quite some time um my dad was a lawyer there we moved up to the Phoenix area I can remember being in about four third fourth grade and thinking to myself as I was looking at all the church kids my parents were making me hang out with thinking to myself that this church stuff is kind of malarkey right I can remember like I was really into UFOs aliens when I was a kid I was a really strange kid I watched a lot of x-files as a child I believed in ghosts and like I thought big foot I thought the truth was out there the truth is out there and so my first book report was on a book about UFO abductions um I ever wrote and so um I can remember thinking that church is kind of malarkey I can remember sitting down with like this home school Christian kid at my house we're talking about aliens and he goes well aliens don't exist because they're not in the Bible and I said what are you an idiot cars aren't in the Bible either do you believe in them and that was my defense and so um but so that kind of from about third grade to through middle school in middle school I became like a skater punk rocker I was convinced church had nothing to offer me and then at some point they hired some like um what would you call it like a youth pastor I guess he had like blue hair he was punk rocker skater he liked all the things I liked and liked all the music I liked and that was like that's how they get you in evangelicalism they're like they get the cool guy the cool guy he's like guys Jesus is awesome and so he kind of suckered me in and started playing in the worship band there I was what you would call what I call a tooth and nail Christian tooth and nail was a record label Christian punk record label I don't know if it's still operating it probably is uh but I was a tooth and nail Christian so I was like well these cool skater guys who are punk rockers are Christians so there must be something there so I was a very but I was a very as you can imagine liberal kind of like evangelical I was like I was the guy who was like you know supporting you know supporting gay rights issues before people were really talking about that yeah yeah I was very much attuned to how white our our congregation was yeah and I was also like really hostile towards like nationalism this was like early bush years so I was you know I was really hostile towards you know the kind of like rock war yeah I was yeah I was really like really hostile towards that kind of stuff and I can remember being in high school and sitting around in class with all of like my evangelical youth group friends and they're saying they're saying we just got to support our president and I would get into these big heated debates with them in the middle of history class my history teacher would allow it because she was a Kennedy Democrat right so she was like but uh yeah so that was that was kind of my background um through high school that was kind of my story um I discovered you know I was really into music really uh into performance all these kinds of things I started helping when I graduated high school I helped out with our youth group it's kind of like you know assisting the youth pastor um at some point though I had just like one too many church camps they would have I actually went to Hume Lake a lot you might be familiar yeah yeah yeah I went there a lot as a counselor and I just remember once sitting around a room everybody was joking about what they called the coming down the mountain experience and it was when students they'd have a big high spiritual high up there and then they would come down the mountain to real life and they would just fall their faith would kind of fall apart and I'm sitting there I'm like you know this happens and you're sitting around joking about it I was like that's it I'm done I'm done with this I don't know why that was the straw but like I mean in the meantime in college I discovered things like I read the Bhagavad Gita the Daode Ching I discovered something called the gospel of Thomas I was like WTF church why didn't you tell me about this uh I read Waiting for Gutto and I can remember reading Waiting for Gutto I don't you probably read the play I don't know I should assume but that that that moment where they're talking about the differences in the crucifixion scenes and how only one mentions that the there was this thief who had a change of heart at the cross I was like I was like flabbergasted I was like how did I not notice this it's like I stopped in the middle of the play I threw that down I read all four of the gospels the crucifixion scenes I'm like oh my god and I go into church the next truth is out there and you've been yeah I go to church the next Sunday I'm trying to tell people about this and they're just like totally disinterested I was like oh okay and so you know I was like I started getting hard into the documentary hypothesis I started reading all the apocryphal canonical stuff I read um a book called Jesus by oh god what was the guy's name I can't remember now off the top of my head but it was historical study of Jesus where I discovered q source and all this kind of stuff and this was like I was going to community college at the time they weren't talking about any of that crap at community college I was just like I was just I did a hard dive into it I was really into literature I read Harold Bloom's the American Religion which like I discovered Gnosticism and blew my mind about the Southern Baptist Convention about how like Gnostic they are and like so I started reading all this stuff Elaine Pagels and all this kind of thing and that was around 1819 and so from 1819 I was kind of like I went to my youth pastor and told him I'm like I can't do this anymore I'm done and walked away again I got really into film during that time really started studying Joseph Campbell Carl Jung the archetypes and all these kinds of things I got really deeply interested in that especially his surveys of religion because I also thought like I began to think that religion was a helpful way of like understanding human narrative because I thought religions I began to think that religions were true in the way that like Shakespeare was true it spoke about like something like you know there was like a mythical psychological core underlying at all and I was like this is why these stories kind of resonate with humans and so I want to know how to access this so I can write successful screenplays right I'm the perfect like commodity like you know whatever but you know Carl Marx would you know cringe or say he told you so but so got really involved in that I finally I moved to Los Angeles at some point I wrote some scripts nothing anybody would ever hear of the other thing that you should know about me is I've always been really suspicious of social media and all of these things I have a flip phone still I haven't gone on Facebook since 2012 probably and so that's like you know I'm very suspicious I don't have IMDB I try to if there is anything about me on IMDB it's because other people put it there not because I've put it there kind of type of thing I but I did do I did some short film work I helped you know others you know other people writing their stuff I acted in a few like music videos but it was kind of like is there acting in music videos I remember for them from the 80s what acting there was in music videos in the 80s was really bad oh my gosh I was so like they my I can remember like one time I was a silhouette another time I it was like I had a zebra head on and I was smoking a cigar but Paul I mean it's so sad like it's so sad my heart breaks for like the city of dreams the city of angels right it's like man there are people there were some people I worked with who had been doing it for like 40 years and they were still doing stuff like this was non-union work that they were doing and they still thought they were going to make their break and you're sitting there and it's just like it's a city of these broken dreams man it's like that's just a cliche right but it's like it's true at a certain level you just like oh man and nobody nobody talked about the job that they actually had which is what they paid how they paid their rent they all talked about like what they were aspiring to be right it was like taboo to ask what you actually did but like yeah so there there were people who thought they were really great actors and who were involved in these things and yeah so there was acting but yeah you know it's that level so I was out there for a little bit I got really burned out on that city got really jaded I was I wasn't even living in the city city I wasn't in north hollywood or anything like that I was out in Whittier California because I was like god if I have to live in LA I'm at least going to live in a town that feels like a small town so I got burned out jaded out there a little bit during the time I was still doing my music I ended up coming back out to the Phoenix area I was working on music out there with a recording partner doing some performances and then like a series of bizarre events happened in my life where I don't know I look at it now it's like this is gonna make you sound like a 2d free religious guy I guess but it's like the movements of the holy spirit working in my life it was like I was chasing all these dreams and fantasies I'm not even kidding I don't know if you heard about that guy who wrote a poem that for a buried treasure somewhere did you hear about this rich guy like years ago who he wrote a poem that was supposed he was like he had all these like like all this gold that he was burying somewhere and he wrote a poem that was supposed to give you the clues to where it was it was somewhere basically in the rocky mountains I heard something about this forrest fen I think was his name yeah I'm not kidding you me me and my brother had like we had like put together this elaborate plan to go dig for buried gold one summer it was so ridiculous so I was looking for buried gold playing music around town right I was looking for buried gold you know trying to write my screen plays and make it in hollywood and then I was looking for actual buried treasure but so a series of circumstances happened I had some grandparents pass away and there's nothing like that shakes you like having grandparents pass away within 24 hours of one another and then having to go and like sit through the relics you know the relics of their life right something happened in that process and I started really like kind of rethinking like what I had been doing with my life now I didn't do anything like you know profound necessarily I decided I was going to finish going to college and for some reason I decided to make this really genius decision of going in studying religion in college so during my film time I had still been connected to religion I had worked a lot studying specifically Navajo religious practice and Navajo witchcraft specifically which is like that would be a whole you know series of hours right there so I don't know if I want to get into that but I spent a lot of time interviewing people reading you know reading transcripts and reports I think I mean it's a very secretive environment obviously but I got really invested in that I thought it was going to be just a writing project and then it was like you you've been in interest like areas that aren't like first world affluent like you know European culture you go into some places and it's just like supernatural stuff is not like and this started like clicking with me it's like it's not fake right and it's like you might not believe in it but it really impacts people's lives and people people like believed that they were witches oh yeah oh yeah what does it mean if a person believes it and they do everything as though they are this thing and I started thinking about you know early on they are witches I'm like what does that mean it's like I can sit back in my like you know suburban context and be like oh there's this thing as witches they're just superstitious but it's like man people that freaking die like it's like people die and do terrible things like in the name of this stuff so anyway I started like you discover that and that started that really like that has always stuck with me I tell people there was like a five-year period of time where I was like I dove into that and it's like I'm haunted by that to this day I mean this is my early 20s and I'm haunted by that to this day it sticks with me as a I'm a freer you know I'm I am a pastor at this point but like it still sticks with me so anyways I decided I was going to study religion I think in the back of my head I was like well you know maybe I can use the stuff that I learned but for some reason I decided to choose Christian tradition as my area of focus and study again like it just was provoked in me I decided I was going to do that so I ended up going in I'm like in my late 20s mid to late 20s and so like I'm totally like way older than everybody in my classes right but it just so happened that there was this you know there was this professor who had just graduated from Princeton theological seminary it was his first year and he wasn't much older than me but we really kind of hit it off and connected and I started to survey the first thousand years of Christian history my immediate reaction to the first thousand years of Christian history was like yeah these guys were a bunch of assholes man like you know you read about Athanasius and the things that he was doing to Arius you're just like man you're feeling bad for Arius I can't believe this crap I'm like yeah no wonder I got out of this thing but then it's like I can remember reading uh origins contra contra selsus or celsus however you want to say it and realizing that like I thought that Christians were just like kind of like ignorant bumpkins who just didn't understand how the world worked basically and they had just like selectively like imposed their convictions through power basically this narrative in my mind because I had also read a lot of like critical theorists and things like that up to this point um anything that would allow me to deconstruct Christian faith um and but uh I got to this point where I was like I read origin and I read first principles and I'm like wow this guy's actually pretty sophisticated like he's got answers to things that I thought like he addresses these questions or you know comments that I had because selsus in some ways is like an ancient Nietzsche right it's like you know he was like he had some pretty like damning criticisms of Christianity where it's like he's not criticizing the truthfulness necessarily of it he's saying even if it's true it's like this is bunk like this is this guy Jesus is not worth worshiping that's basically his argument right he's like I'll concede that Jesus exists he's like he's not worth worshiping it's kind of like that's why Nietzsche's Antichrist is still like I mean you don't I don't have an answer to that book it's like you think that Jesus was this kind of like lazy heathenness or you think that there was something good about him laying down his life it's like you know um anyway but so I got into that I was like wow there's actually some stuff that's actually really sophisticated here um that I haven't been able to wrap my mind around um hang on one second I gotta get this not because I think someone just got out of the hospital oh okay yeah we'll have that um I don't know I I forget where I was but I was oh Celsius yeah yeah yeah I started uh I started um reading then into you know sort of reading a bunch of other stuff too it's like uh part of what this this guy from pts suggested that I read he's like he had me read uh Augustine's Confessions which or Augustine however you want to say it um I never read that before and I was like whoa again like I started reading more uh more Augustine and I was like oh this guy was really smart too what in the world and this comment about Genesis and I'm like like I thought I had debunked Genesis as you know you know just kind of like fable or whatever sorry I've got my train coming by here um you might get loud in a second that's all right I I I was like wow he's got some really like thoughtful responses to that kind of thing um I also found origins comments about uh the spiritual reading of scripture to be really compelling to me it was like something I had never heard before it was God's literal work and it's like literal meant kind of like kind of historical except when it came to song of songs and we didn't really talk about that but uh I anyway um and so read that read Gregory Mesa um read all the Cappadocians um and then also read the Epistle to the Romans just my my teacher said just sit down and read it in one sitting yeah yeah yeah and I was like I had already been kind of into Soaring Cupid Guard uh years before I was like wow there's some really interesting ways of looking at you know the Binding of Isaac and all that when I didn't care about any of it and I read Romans I'm like wow this is like this is the guy who inspired Soaring Cupid Guard's writing style yeah in the it's like he's actually really intelligent like Paul is it's like he's not just like you know this is the Bible it's like wow this is a pretty interesting way about going about an argument and so read that then I wanted to read Galatians and all of his letters right and he also had a really interesting approach to the Old Testament which I had never heard before which I thought I had never heard before where it's like you know all the stuff is signs of what's happening and uh you know like Abraham, Sarah these are signs of Christ and all these kinds of things and you read Hebrews and to me it's like yeah most important book in the whole New Testament to read if you're trying to get kind of like a handle on Christian hermeneutics right it's like where's the lens by which we read scripture it's like oh you get a sense for that in Hebrews and I just had never had never even thought of it before I had always been like under the impression that you know Jesus was just this like teddy bear that we all held in love and the Old Testament it's like sorry that's just how it is and we got to go to war and so um and I was always really not compelled by either of those images of God or of Jesus because Jesus to me was always like the hardest thing to access in the Bible in a lot of ways he felt like David Bowie's character and the man who fell to earth he was like a space alien and like um and so I never understood this you know Jesus says like you know oh hey he makes me feel so good um right but so I started having this the lid kind of thrown off of like my way of understanding the Bible and so all of a sudden now I was like reading it again with like a fresh set of eyes it's like I'm reading like the the gospel of John and I'm like is Jesus being sarcastic right here that's what it like kind of feels like um and that exchange between him and Pilate about uh what is truth is really like I don't know just very it felt like a modern author had written this thing it was like so resonant for me um so really started diving into that and this was at a this was at a state university public university is the Arizona State University I had this experience and then I the next thing that happened I started studying deeply like the historical you know historical critical approach and the criticisms that are leveled against Christianity and what they're based on and I'd always just been around this assumption that like these are really like airtight arguments that these people are providing and then you realize it's just not and I knew enough about Navajo uh and uh religious tradition to know that probably most religious traditions are grounded in oral history first before they're actually written down so a lot of criticisms I'm reading about have to do with like when we're finding manuscripts you know the errors in manuscripts it's like you know Bart Ehrman and his arguments are like the least compelling thing for me on the planet at this juncture because I'm like you know everything that we have in the Bible is probably like inspired by something oral that is so freaking old that we don't even we can't even like get our minds around actually um and so it's like the documentary hypothesis they have these you know fairly coaching arguments for why Moses didn't write it but it's like unless you think that this was all grounded in something that's or oral that's much older than the written documents that we have right so what does it mean to write something you know it's like then you get into the question of how authorship is actually shaped and formed and I read an introduction to commentary on infusions where this guy just like shoots down all these criticisms about uh uh Paul is not the author of that text and I was like all the arguments made a lot of sense to me I was like oh yeah that's a really good point it's like what if he had like you know different scribes and all this kind of stuff it's like it throws in the question it throws the questions into question pretty summarily anyway so that started happening to me at ASU and then during that time I had professors suggest to me hey you should go to graduate school that had not been on my radar at all I was like I don't want to do that I don't want to do that and then I read and so I wasn't how many I wasn't even sure how I would go about doing that and then I started reading more theology um started reading uh you know some older guys like John Calvin's Institutes and I was like wow that's pretty impressive um and then I also read some modern guys I don't know if you're familiar with Ephraim Radner um he's out of White Cliff College he wrote a book on the called the end of the church which is just a really fascinating uh historical read of like new neumatology right the movements of the Holy Spirit and what what the implications are given what we've seen in our fractured church in the modern world is you know his thesis well his conclusion he basically comes to is that if we are the body of the body of Christ as the Bible indicates it's like maybe we are recreating Christ's march up to Calvary and we'd be broken and bruised on our way up to that um the scary thing he says is that that means maybe the greatest testimony that the church can give to the world is by actually dying um and so that's why he has this thesis about the end of the church um anyway so I read that and that kind of blew my mind a little bit and uh so I was like well I'd love to study theology more and so I was like well if I'm gonna do this I'm gonna like apply to all the best programs in the country the best yeah what are the best yeah exactly I did though you know I was just like you know ignoramus really but I started doing these you know well you do google searches what are the best school study theology at and so it was like the list the consistent ones were always harvard yale duke and uh Princeton theological seminary um and so I was like well I'll apply to all of those and if I don't get into any of them which I probably won't then I don't have to worry about any of this stuff and I can also tell my teachers my professors that I tried um and so I applied to all of them blah blah blah and then I got into all of them and I was like yeah getting into yale divinity is different from getting into yale law yeah yeah real different real difference and well once you get there you discover there's a real difference I was like anyway but I got in I got into all of them uh yale yale divinity offered me a full riot and so I was like well I gotta do that that'd be stupid not to I turned down money yeah exactly and so I go there uh I worked for there uh and they give me a job working at the uh buying a key rare books manuscripts library so it was kind of cool yeah it was great I got to hold a luther bible that was like from yeah the 16th century it was really cool um uh but uh worked out there I had my thesis reader was Miroslav Volf oh wow I was out there uh developed a really good relationship with Catherine Tanner um uh some really great folks got exposed to but out there so going out there though I thought I was liberal going out there I and I even put my I think I put religion not decided or something like that on my entry form and I go out there thinking I was liberal and they were just replacing the the gender signs on the restrooms because the previous graduating class had ripped them all down as being like bigoted at the time and I was like in the in the administration was too scared to because everybody in the administration was really uncomfortable I think with like not sharing bathrooms with everybody but they and so they I come out there and that's kind of what I step into um I'm out there in 2000 I'm during I'm out there during the Halloween costume thing um and actually I lived in a house with seven other people and I had people who were actually I had a guy who was a family friend with the Christaucuses in the house but I also had a person in the house who was involved with uh the the uh BLM organization who was actually making demands of the administration um uh regarding like you know their perceived mistreatment in this moment right so I was out there for that uh was down in the yard when all the yelling and screaming was happening uh that was made so much news and I was like I was like man what is going on like I I was like I I was just baffled and then I started taking like you know I started taking some of the seminars and a lot of them were really good some of the old school people that you have working there are just like really really intelligent there's a guy named John Hare there who's just like yeah really thoughtful uh theologian um and obviously Miroslav and Kathy are both like really thoughtful too but uh serving you know Schleimacher and all these kinds of things but then uh we got into like James Cone and to Mary Daly and to like you know all these kinds of like like into uh Lynn Ton statue is also up there so we got into hard into like queer theology and you know there was a lot of stuff like that going around James Cone came up and spoke at uh at the divinity school before he passed away um it was the first sermon I ever heard where somebody actually quoted the gospel of Thomas in their sermon but uh during that time I started like getting the sense that like oh maybe I'm not liberal because I'm not like any of this at all yeah yeah I'm in my late 20s so I'm a little older than some folks but at YDS there's actually like a lot of second career people there I can imagine but uh everybody around campus was very pretty radical and then then the stuff with Trump started happening I don't watch the news like that's I know I haven't watched the news like I will get snapshots of it like once a week but I remember I read somewhere that like you know the Solzhenitsyn quote about you have a right to be informed but you also have a right not to be informed and it's like oh yeah that seems really smart actually and I also like I've always had a punk rock suspicion of media um and it's total and so uh but then like stuff with Trump started happening and all my housemates wanted to watch the Republican debates which I thought was really super weird and then I'm watching it and I'm just like I'm like oh my gosh I'm hearing all the guys stuff he's saying I couldn't believe it and then they're all like laughing at this goon and I'm like thinking about people because I had in the past I've been like I've been working blue collar work I had like I had been a janitor while I was working in screenwriting I had been like I had worked in parks departments I had I had lived in like blue collar America where you know the drug problem was just starting in the late 80s and like only escalated and I'm sitting there and I'm like listen to this guy and I just like I just felt I'm like this guy's gonna win I remember saying it at some point like to him I'm like this guy's gonna win you guys like are laughing at him but he's gonna win and I remember somebody looked at me I'm like Eric I think sometimes you just like to watch the world burn and I was like no man I'm just like this guy I had to think there's a good chance they did a survey of students while I was there you know they said like 99 percent of students said that Hillary was gonna win the other one percent said that they were voting for Jill Stein and Gary Johnson and then the election night happened like they had the debates by the way they had like Super Bowl parties at like the grad the like the bars around town like there were people watching the debates drinking and laughing and Trump all the time I can remember going down to the basement of this one of these bars and seeing one of my classmates sitting there by himself watching the tv with the sound off and just reading the captions and he's like you know if you're away from all the laughter he says they both don't sound that different like it's like it's just all that up there makes him sound comedic and implausible but it's like if you just are sitting here it's kind of plausible and it was like that was an interesting moment during this time too obviously the stuff with Jordan Peterson came up and I remember in I think it was 2016 the fall of 2016 I also like that was going on so I started getting more invested in what was going on in the Jordan Peterson world when that video like to me what was interesting was like oh he's got there's this professor who's being outspoken about transgender stuff and I'm like oh that's kind of interesting because I was also part of my program I was studying liturgy and like youtube culture and stuff like that and so I started getting kind of like that's how I kind of discovered him and I was like wow that's pretty cool that he's being bold enough to say something like that I even emailed him at some point and said hey I just wanted to let you know that you've really you know you really inspired me and uh yeah you just have you've at least one friend out there at Yale and you know he thanked me and said you should read Carl Young and I was like okay thank you and then it was like you know the election happened and they canceled classes people were crying in the streets like literally crying there was a teacher who got up and he read Lamentations in tears he read Lamentations to class after Trump got elected and uh and it was just like it was such a Babylonians have destroyed the temple yeah that's kind of how it felt right it's like you you couldn't even like I couldn't even wrap my mind around what I was seeing like I hadn't been like a Trump supporter or anything like that but I'm sitting here and I'm like not that hey everybody if anybody ever watches this besides you not that there's anything wrong with that but it's like I'm sitting there and I'm like what is happening what like these are like adults and I felt like I felt like I feel maybe bad saying that but it's like that was my reaction I was like somebody told me that you know about the experience they had had that day about all the tears they experienced and I was like that's just like so sad that like and like pathetic that like that's where people are emotionally right talk about fragile yeah yeah I like I just was like so flabbergasted and so you know that was 2016 and things kind of like you know escalated from there a little bit it was like I don't know it people in that people like tension kind of arose and I began to realize more and more that I'm actually pretty like you know I'm really suspicious of politics but theologically as a Christian I am a Christian and by the way I'm also really pretty conservative about my Christianity because like the other thing that I started realizing while I was out there and you probably have some familiarity with this is like the the perspective that says that like basically start trying to over accommodate the religion the religion to culture I mean religions function like language and so if you try to accommodate the religious language too much to this other cultural language it's like pretty soon the religious language kind of gets like subsumed in that and it stops like having any meaningful content to it it's like right words are just metaphors that we're using to get at the abstraction right and if the word doesn't isn't useful for getting at that abstraction anymore it's like it ceases to be the thing anymore right right anyway so I I realized at some point that you had to have a strong commitment to the language of your religious system otherwise you might as well just discard the whole entire thing and I hadn't seen any credible arguments to me for discarding that thing because the the alternative to focusing in on and committing to your religious language system was like complete fragmentation and unknowing yeah like this is what I was experiencing especially after the election I was just kind of like this is like this is what you get this is the foundation this is your foundation it's like you are experiencing collective cognitive dissonance right now because your your religious system has failed you yes I remember I heard a I heard a Lutheran minister say his experience of it was it was as if somebody found Jesus's bones it was that like Hillary losing was like as if somebody had found Jesus's bones and I was like oh that's really an interesting way of thinking about this and then I read Eric Vogelin I think he he he made this connection between Gnostices and some of the political movements they saw manifesting in the late 70s and that kind of drew some connections to me as well as like really we're talking about counter religions right now and so I'm gonna I I'm gonna pick the religion that I'm gonna commit to I'm really gonna press into that and so all that happened I graduate I don't want to go through the PhD stuff because I'm just like I'm kind of over academia at this point and I get a job at Arizona State University teaching and also over at there's a university out here called Grand Canyon University I get a job there teaching and so I come out come back out to the Phoenix area to do that I know during this whole time Paul I haven't had a church that I called home I knew that I had to get into a church though like the first thing I needed to do is get into a church because if you don't build a church into your rhythm it's really easy I mean we're discovering this now in the wake of COVID it's really easy to cancel church out of your rhythm yep and so I immediately started looking for churches eventually I stumbled into this local church right down the street from me that's meeting at a performing art studio in our old town area out in Peoria turns out that the pastors there have very similar background to me and in terms of like being involved with music and kind of like you know deconstructing right luckily they reconstructed in the way that I you know I reconstructed as well they were really something that I really became committed to while I was out at Yale was the importance of church calendar and liturgy I think it's really unfortunate that we've lost some of that they were really committed to that as well and really hit it off it was really kind of like just fortuitous and so I started going to this church there you know there me and my being the pastor would have a series of lively discussions before I actually became a minister and I discovered during this time that they were Mennonite brethren, Anabaptist tradition obviously I didn't come from that we would get into theological debates and my dad was a lawyer so I became very comfortable as a child being getting into debates and discussions I just remember that leaving one of our discussions and the pastor stops in the parking lot turns around and says hey I just want to make sure that you're not going to leave the church over this and I remember like this probably was not the appropriate answer but I laughed out loud when he said that and I was like no no no and I was just so like I found that to be so like I don't know there's something so great about that I just loved that even though we had this disagreement he still wanted me to be part of the church and so that was when I decided like I'm I'm committed here and you know as I was teaching I was getting more involved in you know in volunteering and serving at the church at some point the pastor approaches me and asks me says hey I'm sensing the pastor's heart in you is that something that you would consider and we kind of entered into that process I went through you know all the you know the the process of the denomination the Mennonite brethren and got licensed with them and I'm only I'm still bivocational I'm still teaching over at the universities but I'm also now this Mennonite brethren pastor which has been kind of like a weird journey in and of itself I mean we're not like we don't we don't have like big beards and red horses and buggies or anything like that we're like a really hipster church we came into like we came into this old town area we revitalized a lumber yard and we have a coffee shop attached to our church right we get like we don't call ourselves a we don't our building's not a church it's a venue space right and a church meets there oh you're such a church planter yeah yeah so totally right and and I moved down the alley from the church so I can see the church building from my house and really because I really believed in like the importance of local and being kind of connected to a local body and people in a community because something that just really always exhausted me about kind of the evangelical project it seemed like people were commuting 45 minutes to go to church and it's like man how much of life are you not doing with people in your community right and that's why it's like to me it's like that's what creates the consumer right it's like the church consumer is it's just another thing that you do yeah right like going to walmart or whatever or actually after covid we discovered that walmart's actually more essential than the church so or the strip clubs in california yeah yeah yeah and so I was so as I've been pastor pastor of our community groups specifically but I was out here you know obviously during covid and I can I can remember being like um this was like a hard year and a half to be a pastor I was in Arizona I wasn't even in California and I can say and I I just remember um I am not uh I'm not anti you know I think covid is real I'm not one of these people but I remember sitting with my elders and really resisting closing our doors um because I just said you know it takes about three weeks to establish a new rhythm in one's life and then it'll take something like covid to disrupt that new rhythm and that's I that's why I'm like hey we can be really cautious but it's like I just don't think we should stop meeting we ended up deciding as a team to transition um into that and into doing online luckily we were a church with a lot of artists and creative personalities there we had a people who had live stream equipment and so we our church is only about like 100 150 people but we were able to put together what I thought was actually pretty like well in within a week we were able to put together our live stream kind of like um system and operated really well um we were able to maintain communities surprisingly I threw out covid we really interest emphasized small groups having that fun um but it was like oh god it was just like so painful um I don't think like dark you know it's like I didn't realize what dark night was until you know you're just like sitting in your house by yourself like because you know you can't go and it's like I remember being Easter and just like we're recording our live stream and there's just like nobody else there and I just remember looking out the window and just being like this is Easter morning and it's just like it just feels like any other morning right now yeah um it was like so tough um in a lot of ways um we made it through um I think overall our church really responded well to the moment but uh it did leave a lot of I saw lingering question marks in the wake of that yeah because it's just like I don't think that this goes away I think a door of possibility has been opened in the way that school shooting became a thing after columbum nobody thought that was possible then it happens and it becomes possible yeah I think that you know we we live in this kind of like theater of medical and media and it's like right now it's like we're all just kind of playing our parts in it and I really do think that um I think that this is going to be a perennial kind of issue that the church has to deal with shutting its doors um that's my perception but then you know being out there I still I've found in my heart a desire to be a church planter still or a replanter one of the two um because I find something really I think there's going to be a lot of communities dying around the country and I find yeah a lot of churches are going to die yeah and I feel there's like there's a call to just like try to save and salvage um too um so anyway I've been just talking so much that's been great I love your story it's a great story yes it's so cool thank you man um but yeah I so that's I I discovered you um early on in the process I think my brother he's a he's a medical student at Baylor he he pointed me in your direction pretty early on um when you posted that first video he's like oh you might be interested in what this pastor guy has to say and so I'm not involved in social media so I'm not like I wasn't like leaving comments for you or you know all this kind of stuff but it's like I've been following you since probably you know that first video holy cow really kind of got off the ground by the way that you engage with with people and in fact uh I've I've had students come up to me who started coming back to their faith through Jordan Peterson but then started realizing that there was like Jordan Peterson's not orthodox and he's actually kind of like heretical in a lot of ways is how they would describe it to me he's like and they're like they're like we noticed that a lot of the language you use is kind of similar to what he says when you talk about archetypes a lot and Carl Jung it's like what what are your thoughts about Jordan Peterson so we would talk and then I would always point them in your direction I'd be like you should watch you should watch this pastor Paul VanderKlay and so uh so yeah I've been I've been uh aware and paying paying attention to you I mean beyond being a really good pastor I mean I'm not trying to toot your horn or anything like that it's just like the level of reading and like thoughtfulness like you give to things it's just like remarkable to me um you you strike me I you in my head I've told my brother I have told him this I'm like man just based on what I see from you on YouTube I'm like you're the kind of pastor the pastor should aspire to be uh it's like you know being in the kind of context that you've described being in um I just um I I'm just so compelled by that um dedicating your life to that kind of service and then finding a new area that needed ministering to and just um seeking that out so just yeah really compelled by that man oh thank you thank you uh it it kind of grew um I don't know it's you know my church is small and dying and so I I want to be faithful to these people um I don't think the church is gonna somehow balloon because of you know my online ministry um because churches are very local they they're very local and very individual they're like fingerprints they're they they they're very organic and they're organic they're authentic and people take a look at this particular organic and authentic and like I don't want to be a part of that that's it's too organic and authentic because what people are they they hear organic and authentic what they really want is mirroring oh I want the church to I want the church to be a flattering mirror to yeah they want all well they want all the good and none of the bad they don't want any of the garbage that's not like for me it's like we're in an inner city kind of area where our church is at and I was like all in so I bought a house out here and I was like I thought everybody in the church is gonna start doing that and then you're like nobody's gonna do that no no no no there's real reasons they're not going to do it yeah yeah God bless them and that's why you know there's people are in at different levels and they partner at different levels and churches are sort of you know a consensus develops that this is what people are able to give and able to do and and and so it kind of kind of is that way so now I've been I've been tremendously blessed I had no idea what was going to happen after I made those first couple of videos about Jordan Peterson but the whole the whole journey has been fruitful and deeply gratifying and and just a lot of fun just a lot of fun so yeah you look like you look like you're having fun man oh I am I have a great time I just love your spirit and energy on the can I use that language spirit and energy he certainly may that's totally fine I'm just kidding I I've also been like so I emailed you several months ago because you had Andy Littleton on I've actually entered into a good dialogue with Andy oh good for me but since that time you started entering into this conversation about powers and principalities that I've just like that to me is like from a Christian leader's perspective it's like that's the thing that every pastor should be talking about Paul like this has been like spiritual warfare like nuts like this last year and a half before that it's just become more evident right I remember at the beginning of COVID all of a sudden I was getting called the houses to do like exorcism not not exorcisms to pray over a house because people were sensing that there was bad spirits in the house and all these kinds of things and I've also studied enough about Greco-Roman kind of perceptions of the demons and spirits to know like there's not it's not like there's like a guy who's standing there and he's like I'm a devil and I'm going to get you it's like the things that we call emotions are very similar to what people are talking about when they're talking about possession and spirits yeah anyway but I would love to hear like what has been kind of like what what has led you to like locate that as like this kind of like dominant theme like something worth like really emphasizing and focusing on is there I mean that's kind of a big question in some ways but I'm just like I'm so compelled by your language of using that of recognizing you said at one point you said that these these videos and these books are colonizing your mind and I was like yeah that's like all we are doing now we're in a culture of colonizing we're cannibalizing one another on a spiritual level we're participating in this warfare and we don't even realize it so I'm really I don't know if there's something for you to answer well you know so James K Smith you probably heard of him he's he's the one that he's at Calvin University now I mean he's written a series of books on on secular liturgy and you know it struck me so so part of what I part of what I part of what grabbed my attention about Jordan Peterson was and I think this sort of also comes through Jung is the the disconnect in our language around spirit it's it's quite frankly in modernity amazing that hang on a second I'll be right back all right so so this you know this word spiritual remains in our language and people use it all the time and and even highly secular you know people who are you know hard-bitten new atheist type continue to use it and it's like you ever stop and ask yourself what you mean by that word and and I got into this because I you know I do do Bible studies at church and people in in churches like this you'll you'll tend to collect people who are committed Christians but they you know they haven't necessarily thought terribly they've got you know good Christian practice but they haven't necessarily thought terribly deeply about the Bible terrible they've got you know good Christian practice but they haven't necessarily thought terribly deeply about all of the western evangelical kitch language kitch that they've just picked up along the way and part of the way that you gain status in a church like this is you learn to master that kitschy language and so you have all this code talk that goes around and at some point you know and I don't want to be a jerk about it but at some point as a pastor it's like well maybe we should maybe I should maybe we should start to play around with some of this kitschy code talk and see if we can get under it a little bit because there's just a fair amount of social bullshittery that is going on with all this kitschy code talk so and so then someone would say something like salvation and I would say well what do you mean by that and then of course it'd be like oh crap why does he do this to me I'm in front of my good church friends and he's asking me to yeah he's asking me a question I can't answer about a word we're all using it's like all right but I'll be gentle and no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna leave you on the hook here but we're just gonna poke around there a little bit and say what do you mean by that word salvation what do you mean by kingdom of god and then what do you mean by spiritual and of course people have no idea and so I was wrestling with that stuff and you know reading a lot of c.s lewis and then of course jordan peterson came along and the the way that he that the breadth of people that he sort of got a hold of and and some of the some of the particular groups of those people people who had sort of deconstructed both deconstructed into you know hard-bitten modernistic rationality like like new atheists or into sort of mushy new age spiritualism and and these are the people that he sort of at least some of those people he sort of got their attention and then they start similar to your story they want to do things like read origin or church fathers and and I thought now this and the breadth of this movement I thought this is this is this is to me I immediately saw this is one of the more significant things significant movements that I've seen in terms of my adult North American ministry I'll say it that way you know I had seen the seeker movement I kind of came back to North America as that was sort of receding I'd done my junkets to Willow Creek to saddle back I'd taken a good look at that look at that it never it was never going to be applicable at a church like this we're just never going to be able to pull off the music and the sound and the image and the excellence it's just never going to fly in this place it's way too ragtag way too much authenticity and I'd watch the emergent movement sort of split into young restless and reformed and I thought well that's kind of interesting because I'd been you know I'd grown up in a reformed tradition but this was obviously sort of similar to some of the hardcore Dutch reformed but much more Presbyterian and then of course the Rob Bell and that whole thing on Oprah and that yeah so watching those two things coming out of the emergent movement and it's like okay what's what's what's gonna come next down the road and and then I church plant so we had been planting churches pretty aggressively when I got here in the late 90s early aughts and that my church my partner who's the pastor of another CRC church who had one of the few successful CRC church planters using say a seeker methodology I mean he actually grew up in Kalamazoo and he used to cut the grass for Bill Hybl's mom in Kalamazoo that was his job in high school you know cutting Bill Hybl's mom's grass so he was you know he and he was a he's a he's a good pastor and very well be careful that almost sounds like something else yeah yeah yeah very refined and so and so he had actually been fairly successful especially in CRC terms I mean he'd grown a church into three four hundred people in suburban Sacramento and yeah and so we both got into church planting and and then right away like the the second church the first church plant out of the box these guys wanted to do a cell model that was interesting the third church was more of a seeker church again and then and then the fourth church plant wanted more of a Tim Keller PCA type thing and then by the fifth church plant it was all liturgy and you know weekly eucharist and using that word and liturgical seasons and and then these other church plants all started going that way too and I thought well this is interesting now of course living stands living stones can't ride any of those bandwagons I mean this church it just can't do a bandwagon it just it just way too authentic not you know just you can't turn this church it just is what it is so you know I'm watching all of this stuff happen then of course Jordan Peterson comes through and I see all of these people interested in orthodoxy and Peugeot comes on the scene and it's like there's stuff about this and stuff behind this and I had um you know I had studied I had visited Redeemer in New York City and you know had a quiet little seminar with Tim Keller with a couple of our with some of our sacramental church planters we'd had an inn sort of so we had a sort of private audience and a chance to take a poke around Redeemer press fairly closely and um you know that was in some ways closest to where I was from because Keller comes out of Westminster East and in the in the 80s there was this whole urban missions thing that was happening a lot of that out of Westminster East so you know the Keller stuff was was pretty close to me but you know we were never going to be anything like a kind of reformed reformed conservative cathedral church which is sort of what Tim Keller was doing and um and then of course Jordan Peterson comes along and I thought this is it's enough in alignment with the you know the ancient worship theme that had really developing out of the emergent thing and and it was he was asking he was provoking a lot of deeper questions that were really getting at secularity and then of course I made a video and people started watching it and contacting me and that was completely unexpected you know I I'd been working in this church 20 years and you know I'm known in my denomination but beyond it you know I don't have a mega church I'm not on the cover of Christianity today so then so then well what do we mean by this word spiritual and of course Jung I didn't know anything about Jung but totally different take on things that'll get up a speed on some of that stuff and then you know back to philosophy and and you begin to realize that this um phenomenologically is not a it's not a it's not that's not a bad approach to this which is of course very much the way Peugeot went it's post Heidegger and um you know then of course someone pointed me to John Vervecky developed a relationship with him so you begin to so when in churches especially a a tradition like the CRC which wasn't Pentecostal but could be Pentecostal friendly charismatic friendly I went in Grand Rapids and in college I was in sort of a charismatic Christian Reformed urban church which sort of tied a lot of those strands together for me and just knowing that this word spiritual we're going to have to have a far deeper understanding of it and by virtue of my Dutch Calvinist tradition you neither can exclude sort of the supernatural that you would bump in and of course you know Black urban America where I grew up and then Haitians and the Dominican Republic and then charismatic Reformed you know so I wasn't I wasn't I wasn't a skeptic about what modernists would call the supernatural but it's also got to tie into a secular culture and so you know in terms of my videos I just sort of follow where the conversation leads and and and so I I really had to you know I've been really thinking about what do we mean by this word and and how does that connect so so this week I'm preaching on Paul he's leaving Antioch after he and Barnabas are there for a year and then he's going to Cyprus and basically you've got a showdown between this Jewish magician Bar-Jesus versus Paul and Paul you know basically curses him and says you're gonna be blind for a while and the guy turns blind and this is all in front of the pro council who is watching this and he's like all right well I think that Paul and he got credibility he's got my attention and and there's sort of an easy dismissal by secularist modernists of this stuff as this is this is this is legend this is all BS but you know like you if you're around Navajo for a while it's like this isn't BS you know there's there's a reality to this but if you've been around enough Pentecostals you know they got some BS going on there too sometimes and the prophets roll into town and the show comes in and it's like there's a good bit of skepticism about that too so so you really want to somehow bring all of this together into an integrated picture where spiritual doesn't simply deny sort of a modernist frame because people are going to have to integrate this into their worldview as they leave secularism so you're not gonna you're not gonna desire you're not gonna deny what modernists feel like spooky powers but you're also going to have to integrate this into oh what Trump did because that was you know however you feel about his politics well he he sort of gave the nation an advanced course in an exorcism of sorts you know he he that'd be one frame to think about what happened with Trump and I loved what you said it's as if someone discovered Jesus bones and so I and so I wanted and so I wanted I want to figure this out and my channel for me is a lot of figuring things out and and if you're going to silo yourself in which we sort of see probably I don't want to speak ill of these people I don't know them but in a place like let's say Yale divinity maybe I'm just working off a an impression but I see that often because you have to sort of silo yourself off because the world is too big and so then the whole key is well let's have a productive filter that some things get filtered out and and it's a we can we can work in a manageable level to for the church to to to deeply work on this question of okay so the Holy Spirit is moving through your church and and you can approach that language in a fairly modernistic way you can approach it in a Pentecostal way you can approach it in sort of a primitive way and try and get at what the Romans were dealing with and but but one way or another we're going to need to use that word in a competent way and I've I've found in this little corner of the internet you know with you know say Peugeot and his Orthodox tribe and Vervecchi and his non-theist tribe and the Roman Catholics and this whole crazy group that we've sort of gathered together here I think we're having a productive conversation about this and that's rare so let's have it and and again I see this very much as a spiritual movement because not only do I believe it's the work of the Holy Spirit working through this but it's also all of these spiritual streams just kind of coming together and you know one of the things I picked up from Tim Keller which he picked up from one of his seminary prophets at Gordon Conwell was you know revival happens and and it's the work of God you know we don't you can sort of you sort of want to try to make an altar on top of caramel and say okay Lord you know we're ready for you to show up but only you can show up you know and in revival all of the streams come together and there's you know there's new hymnody that erupts there's there's fervent prayer you know there's pious devotion there's you know work with the poor and poverty and justice it's it's all of the things and um and and the history of Christianity has been in many ways a series of revivals with often dying of things I mean Chesterton notes that you know the seven the seven deaths of Christianity it keeps dying and rising again and and certainly modern Christianity is dying yes and that's epitomized and you know the mainline church um now obviously these deaths are never full and complete they're always you know somewhat dead or mostly dead but it never seems to go all the way down yeah there's still a little bit of movement in the body that's right but I and and so I saw with the Jordan Peterson thing I thought there could be a revival from this and I think there already has been to a degree but revivals come and they reshape the world yes and I don't want to be sitting on the sidelines when the revival happens I want to be there yeah that's oh man and that's like that's the real sense right it's like this last year and a half has made me I don't know I felt very impatient like this last year and a half for the reason of like I feel like things have been like ramping up and now we're getting to this place where it's like things are changing indelibly like you can't like we can't go back from whatever it is we've just entered into and I'm gonna be stuck at home it's like you know as a pastor it's like there are people dying in the hospital I'm stuck at home it's like there are there's all these things happening right now and you can't you feel like you can't just be like separated from it you have to be engaged yeah with it because you do you sense this flow happening right now um I I I you know you're talking about John Verbenke I want to thank you for introducing me to him as well in terms of like just his content so good um but like he talks about shamans as entering into this like flow state and I'm like thinking like what what happens like culturally seems like what you're describing is like a kind of like cultural flow state almost like these revivals and things like that it's it's when we're all like just releasing ourselves to this something right and that can be really good or it can be really bad depending on how you're testing that spirit because it's like it's a battle right now yeah it's not evident to me that like good spirit is like rising up over like bad spirit yeah and we've all seen you know people listen to Jordan Pearson you you you know about like instances where bad spirit is taken over and possessed a society it can happen right how do you how do you find good spirit and we're like an Anabaptist tradition out here so we're really emphasizing like third way stuff yeah I mean people who are liberal churches out here say that we're conservative and too reformed they think that we're reformed I think what they mean is they just remind them of like you know Tim Keller or something yeah um and then on the other side the conservatives churches think that we're liberal and in a lot of ways like I actually think that's a good thing but we have increasingly like out in the Phoenix area we're having churches like getting really divided over lots of issues right now there was actually a church that got on and said like pastor gave sermon local church and he goes anybody who says that they're third way that's a euphemism for like you know lukewarm it's like you're you're it's basically you're either with us or you're against us is what this pastor is saying and he's talking specifically about social justice issues yeah yeah yeah I hear that a lot and you know you're talking about the young wrestlers and reform we got Mark Driscoll and his church out here and they actually I've got people go to that church they've grown by 300 percent since COVID it's like there's this like there's this weird tension even within the body of the church not even like just culture broadly obviously it's there but um there's a book called broken church broken nation it's a little volume um I don't know if you ever read that but this guy it's a short historical study of the breakdown of major national denominations in the United States in the decades prefiguring the civil war and how actually these denominational divisions kind of exactly paralleled like what happened within the country itself and it's kind of interesting thinking about that perspective what's happening now it's like okay what what is being born right now right because I do think that the church the spiritualism of a country is reflective of where the country is going to materially be at yeah yeah um so yeah lots of stuff happening there I think like your language like Mormonism my group around Mormonism so knowing Mormon history reading I don't know if you've read D. Michael Quinn he wrote a book called uh early Mormonism in the magic worldview um that's I mean if you if you're a fan of history like he is like a king historian what's his name D. Michael Quinn D. Michael Quinn um early Mormonism in the magic worldview he's like talking about like pointing out how these revivalists that Mormonism was grounded in the things that they're seeing they're seeing through spiritual eyes that there's this kind of strange like in the wake of and leading up to these kinds of like revivals people stop seeing just what we're seeing materially right right they're seeing things of spirit um and I think that like that's really been helpful for me to consider and think through too um he looks at like things like sales records for like books on magic in the United States and how there were actually more people buying these books on astrology and magic than there were people buying Bibles in the United States leading up to and it's like it's like what what does that mean and I'm like you then you start thinking about like astrology is becoming popular in the United States again but also for the last two decades we've all been looking into these scryer stones right these like crystal balls essentially uh looking in and I think of Gandalf he had a comment where he said you know about the sea lost seer stones you look in you don't know what looks back out into you on each of these terms you know you stare into the abyss the abyss looks back out into you it's like what are we're looking in right now we're engaging this technology as we see it yeah functionally it behaves a lot like magic devices did you know we've seen this doing so what spirits are coming out through to you and these crystal balls that we're looking into right now you like CS Lewis abolition of man he does that really quick uh connection between alchemy and science and alchemy and magic and like magicians and scientists aren't that far apart it's like they're both trying to harness the power of the earth right to man's benefit it's like and actually historically they have that connection yeah and so that stuff's been really that that draws that to my mind as you're talking about kind of this like bubbling fermenting something that's happening I've also been uh Philip Reef has become very popular again oh yeah yeah and especially in your reform world Carl Truman considered one guy he used to be cool in reform circles and now he's cool in all evangelical circles because you know a little book about identity but he's been drawing people back in Philip Reath which I think is really useful because Philip Reath's trilogy on sacred order social order is really helpful for also understanding I think the deeper battle that's happening that's underlying this moment um the tensions that are arising there are these kind of it's a it's a tension between a old one way of perceiving sacredness and this kind of anti-sacredness which is in a sense its own kind of new system um and so he's got some really interesting insights that he writes about especially in the crisis of the op the crisis of the officer class and uh and my life among the death works um those are books that I've been revisiting because he tries he is going off of deuteronomy and the interdicts that are laid down by god there and contrasting that to our own moment essentially interesting and so oh you're just just you're just giving me more books dude yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry I get complaints and now here you've done it to me that's what the bastards do it's really bad and we get we get alone we get siloed out here nobody else is reading these things except us I know talk to somebody well I gotta land the plane here because I gotta do some things but um you know what you know is this is this video good to share you want to preview it first what do you think I uh I'm comfortable with you sharing it okay okay okay good good I'd love to I the conversation before this I had a lovely talk with a a woman who's a um she's she's young she just got married she's she's going to the university of compen studying theology in the netherlands and um it's just it's I don't know I love these randos conversations because it just gives me a chance to gives me a chance to step out of my filter and let um other things come to me and so this was just a delight this was the delight so I really appreciate it I appreciate it you giving me this time paul and and send me send me anything like if you got church stuff or something that you'd like me to include in this video

a closeted like Jordan Peterson community there they feel afraid about talking about it until they find out that I'm a fan of Jordan Peter they'll probably appreciate that that I'm being public and outspoken about you know these kinds of things but um yeah I I'd be happy to send that to you and uh and if you get back to Tucson have Andy introduce you to my friend Rod yeah absolutely I actually
