 I mentioned to some people I was going to do a video for Living Stones for New Year's Eve. And some of the people from the channel said, do people go to church on New Year's Eve? Do Roman Catholics go to church on New Year's Eve? I said, I don't know, but Christian Reformed Church people go to church on New Year's Eve, at least some of them. And those who grew up, those of us who grew up in the Christian Reformed Church probably have a lot of memories of growing up, of going to church on New Year's Eve. In Northside Chapel in Patterson, New Jersey, we always had our New Year's Eve watch night service as it was called. And it would start at 11 p.m. And as a kid, I was always quite excited to be able to stay up that late. Now we were just right outside New York City and most people associate New Year's Eve with Times Square and New York City and watching the ball drop and Dick Clark's rocking New Year's Eve. When I was young, it was Guy Lombardo at the Waldorf Astoria and old Lang Syne and all of those things. In some ways, the church calendar begins with Advent. And so that was more around the time of Thanksgiving. But New Year's Eve is continued to be marked in the church order of the Christian Reformed Church as a New Year's Eve and a New Year's Day service. The messiness of the Christian Reformed Church, not always sure exactly the logic for this. There's always sort of a combination of different traditions that come into it. And I'm sure a big part of it was the Dutch. Now, of course, growing up even in Patterson, just that close to New York City, we never went into New York City to watch the ball drop because we were in church when the ball dropped. And that was the way we brought in the New Year. And we would pray and we would have some memories of the old year and we would pray for God's blessing and God's favor in the New Year. And that's how we celebrated New Year's Eve. Now, one of the things that for many people at Living Stones or in other places in the Christian Reformed Church, they would connect with New Year's Eve was singing this hymn, Hours and Days and Years and Ages. If you want to know how deep of a community the Christian Reformed Church is, I found this YouTube copy of the song done by the URC hymnody and they continued to use the Old Blue Christian Reformed Church from 1959 and 1976. That was the Psalter hymnal that I grew up with mostly. And I looked to my shelf because I knew I had the small one growing up. My parents gave me one for my fifth birthday and sent this picture to my family and my wife who didn't grow up in the Christian Reformed Church, sort of laughed. She says, your parents gave you a Psalter hymnal for your fifth birthday? And I said, yeah. And most kids today don't even know what a Psalter hymnal is. The reason it's called a Psalter hymnal was because when the Christian Reformed Church split from the Reformed Church of America in the 19th century, hymn singing was a big deal and the CRC only sang songs from the Psalter. And over time we got a little wobblier, I suppose, and we started adding hymns in there. And sure enough, here's this hymn in the Psalter hymnal. Oh, hang on, I've got to get some glasses to read this. My young little eyes could read it no problem, but my aging eyes can use some glasses. These are the words. Now I actually checked the words in the 76 versus the 80, the edition that was later in the 80s, because, well, the words had changed a little bit as has happened between the two hymnals. And when the second hymnal came out, people complained about that. And it's very interesting looking at the changes that the later hymnal made. And you can sort of feel the culture of the 80s creep into this, what I'll talk about in a minute, this hymn that was actually from the 18th century. And we'll talk a little bit about the history behind it. I'll read the words of the hymn. Hours and days and years and ages Swift as moving shadows flee As we scan life's fleeting pages Not enduring do we see On the paths our feet are wending Footprints all will be effaced Present time to past is tending Though its page is not erased But from sin thy mercy drew us Would not leave our souls alone Gracious Lord thou didst renew us All our guilt thou didst atone Yea the plans of thy salvation For our journey all the way Is a blessed preparation Leads to life of endless day And though time will all things conquer It shall not our lot decide Thou alone, eternal Father, Wilt our eye our Lord abide And when dangers round us gather They cannot our souls molest In thy Son thou art our Father In thy love our hearts ere rest Speed along then, years and ages With all gladness and your pain E'en when deepest sorrow rages Faithful will our God remain Though all earthly friends forsake us Guide by his, guided by his loving hand To his heart will A, betake us Looking for, looking towards our Fatherland This was translated by L.P. Brink in 1929 I'd often get the comments, sometimes get the comments from people at Living Stones that the New Year's service was sort of somber and it is and traditionally in the Christian Reformed Church you'd have the New Year's service and you'd have the New Day, so the New Year's Day service and the New Year's Day service would be a little bit more upbeat and New Year's Eve we sort of say farewell to the old year and we take stock and if we gather together we'd share prayers together and we'd share memories and we'd probably share the names of some of the individuals that had passed away this year we'd pause to take a moment and take stock now there's a little page hymnody.org and it has a lot of backstories and things to the hymns and the continual process of the Psalter hymnal that is in the CRC and this psalm well this this song comes sort of from psalm 90 and from psalm 103 and it was a Dutch poet and I'm going to butcher his name because I don't speak Dutch and Job and some others listening to this will maybe close your ears or or put the phonetics in the comment section so we can all know how to say this Rijnsvis Feit from Zwolle the Netherlands 1753 and he died in 1718 in 1824 wrote this text in six stanzas it was published in the Dutch Evangelique in 1806 an English translation by Leonard P. Brink who was East Saugatuck Michigan birthed born in East Saugatuck Michigan another little Dutch CRC Berg and set in 1876 and died in Pomeroy Iowa in 1936 was published in the new Christian hymnal compiled by Henry J. Kuyper in 1929 oh the modernism was seeping in already in the 20s they published a hymnal going back to the Dutch original Henrietta 10 Harmsall thoroughly revised the Brink translation in 1984 for the the 1980s version of the Psalter hymnal the text contrasts the changing character and frailty of human life with the everlasting love of our changeless God though life's dangers overwhelm us we are confident in God's guidance and protection the text helps us to give voice to our own trust in divine providence to bring comfort to those in distress and to express our hope for everlasting peace the author received a law degree from the University of Leiden in 1770 and was mayor of Zwolle an ardent Dutch patriot and a man of letters who lamented the Napoleonic occupation of the Netherlands faith that's probably not how to say it in Dutch but like my I don't have a Dutch throat as our elderly Dutch neighbors used to say wrote 19 volumes of prose and poetry much of it highly romantic as well as theological and philosophical essays he also wrote a number of hymns 35 of which were included in the Dutch hymnal from 1806 which he helped to compile Leonard P. Brink a graduate of Calvin Seminary Grand Rapids Michigan 1900 spent much of his life as a missionary among the Navajo people he translated Bible books and hymns into the Navajo language and wrote a catechism for the Navajo people he also translated Dutch poetry and hymns into English liturgical use old years eve and it's a I mean I'll put the I'll put the link to the hymn below and you can hear it with an organ and a congregation singing it's it's as the words intend to deliver it's it's a song that that takes stock of the death of a year now now for this I wanted to know a little bit more Dutch history which I know woefully little of and so off to Wikipedia I went and this this song was penned during the Batavian Revolution I didn't even know what that was I had to do a little bit more reading the Batavian Revolution was a time of political and social and cultural turmoil at the end of the 18th century that marked the end of the Dutch Republic and saw the proclamation of the Batavian Republic the period of Dutch history that followed the revolution is referred to as the Batavian French era 1795 to 1813 so very much in the time that this author penned this and I would imagine you can hear as as the note said you can hear some of his anxiety about the present political situation for him even though this time spanned only 20 years of which there were of which three were under France occupation under Napoleon Bonaparte by the end of the 18th century the Netherlands found themselves in a deep economic crisis caused by the devastating Fourth Anglo-Dutch War which was ended by the Peace of Paris that war didn't end well for the Netherlands its its golden age had been declining its grasp was its grasp of colonies around the world was slowly being taken over by the British the British continued to displace the Dutch and to basically eat up their markets and eat up their colonial assets during this time the banks of the Dutch Republic held much of the world's capital the government-sponsored banks owned up to 40% of Great Britain's national debt the people of the Netherlands grew increasingly discontent with the authoritarian regime of Stadtholder William V of the House of Orange this concentration of wealth led to the formation of the Dutch Patriots by a minor Dutch noble named Joan van der Copeland Tot Den Poel who were seeking to reduce the amount of power held by the Stadtholder and you can read Wikipedia for what those titles meant and some of the particular history of the Dutch thus a division emerged between the orangists who supported the Stadtholder and the Patriots who inspired the ideals of the Enlightenment desired a more democratic government in a more equal society the Patriots built support from most of the middle class and founded militias of armed civilians between 18 1783 and 1787 managed to keep over several cities and regions in an effort to force new elections which would oust the old government officials and so basically what you see in this period is something of a civil war where you have militias and you have the official government and you have tensions between them in 1875 Stadtholder William V fled his palace to the west of the country I can't read any of these Dutch names See what a lousy CRC minister I am they removed the Dutch requirement before I went to seminary anyway basically this was a time of political turmoil it was a time of loss and basically the Netherlands was always caught between we had the North Sea which was at least reliable but you had the British the French and the Germans all around you and the way the Dutch tried to maintain themselves in the midst of those greater powers was neutrality but this was a period where the French were of course ascendant and Napoleon would well Napoleon was about to take over Europe including the Netherlands and at the end of this at the end of this revolt the Batavian Revolution ended with a proclamation of the Batavian Republic in eight in 1795 William was first elected in 1795 William was forced to flee to England where he issued the queue letters proclaimed that all touch got Dutch colonies were to fall under British rule as they had declared war on the Batavian Republic there were several coups 1798 1801 1805 now remember that hymn was produced in 1806 and so it's probably during this period that this hymn was written and this mayor of a town was in the midst of all of this turmoil and thinking about the passage of time for 20 years they couldn't find much political stability it seems the best years of the nations were behind them and the best they could too was deal with powers greater than themselves and and just sort of endure the Batavian Republic saw its end in 1806 when the Kingdom of Holland that sounds promising but was founded with Napoleon's brother Louis Napoleon as King of Holland so now you have the brother of a Corsican as the king over your country in 1810 the area was annexed into the first French Empire in 1813 the Netherlands regained their independence with William's son William Frederick as sovereign prince and so you can see well this was the years and these were the political doings of the Netherlands when this hymn was written now Time magazine this year declared 2020 the worst year ever and yet we've had a pandemic and nobody expected a pandemic except for the previous Bush administration and Bill Gates and how many people like in who study pandemics that said you know it's gonna come it's gonna come eventually we had SARS 1 and and and and we have swine flu and all of those things and sure enough here it came and there have been hundreds of thousands of death and there has been suffering of various kinds and so bad year seems to be a pretty fair evaluation of 2020 but of course bad year is dependent on individual circumstances for all of us there have been many bad years in the world especially given particular geographies and particular situations some people might be having a very good year this year because of particular situations close to them than a very bad year and others that we would have thought to be good years because of their life circumstances but generally speaking this world and its history is full of wars genocides famines fires political violence and on and on all of those are the big public things people have cancer they have marital breakups they have lost jobs they have various tragedies and traumas of every of every different kind and well these are pretty much common throughout humanity with a little bit of digging i noticed that time magazine had declared the 20 aughts from 2000 to 2009 the decade from hell now looking back on 2020 we might ask ourselves was it really that bad was 2010 to 2019 really any better and if this is the kickoff of the new decade well what do we have in store but then again even if you just go back over the 20th century over the memories that many of you had well apparently the great depression was started by the birth of a particular member of our congregations at least her brothers blamed her so the great depression of the 1930s the first world war of the 1910s the second world war of the 1940s which launched the cold war and if we decide we're going to play with the numbers a bit from 1965 to 1975 you've got the vietnam war and richard nixon's departure from office the decade from hell really the 1910s the 19 or the 20 aughts we live in an age of in a land of antibiotics and electricity and plumbing and sanitation and even in the midst of this pandemic most of us can imagine it could be a lot worse than it currently is life and planet earth is a very varied thing this week myself and some of the members of the family took a little day trip down to yosemite national park one of my favorite places and those of you who see my youtube channel notice that i have pictures of yosemite and other western national parks all throughout because i love going to these places and taking pictures of them they are glorious when you walk into yosemite valley and you see el capitán and you see half dome and you see the waterfalls it takes your breath away and whether or not you believe that this world was created by a creator god the place is glorious and there are many glorious places around the world and there are many glorious moments around the world the other picture is a picture taken by my father on one of their i think they made two visits to the dominican republic when i was there and he saw this dog and i'll tell you one creature to not be as a dog in the dominican republic because well kicked me like a dog well if you see how the dogs live in the poor areas of that country to be a dog is to be at the bottom of the heap you're a scrounger you're a scrapper you don't get fed that well and here was this pitiful dog sort of hovering around the sides hoping someone would drop something to sort of keep that dog in the land of the living this is life on planet earth this is the way it is there are good years and bad years and that poem which became the song which went into that hymnal speaks of what life is like hours and days and years they pass time consumes all the book of hebra has a sense of time in it by faith abraham when he came to go to a place where he would later receive as an inheritance obeyed and went even though he did not know where he was going by faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a far away stranger in a foreign land he lived in tents as did isaac and jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise for he was looking forward to a city with foundations whose architect and builder was god and by faith even sarah who was past childbearing age was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise and so from this one man and he was as as dead came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore and the book of hebra's goes on to list many more heroes of faith all these people were still living by faith when they died they did not receive the things they the things promised they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth people who say such things so show that they are looking for a country of their own if they had been thinking of the country they had left they would have had opportunity to return instead they were longing for a better country a heavenly one therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he has prepared a city for them and you can read about that city at the end of the book of revelation we are journeying through time for me in patterson new jersey in the dominican republic in sacramento california and many times in patterson new jersey my father would pull out the slides for these services perhaps that was what inspired me to use power point in the first place and pull out slides of of kids at day camp or or folks at church having fun together marking occasions this picture on the right is curtis and nancy at the 50th anniversary of living stones church in 2013 hours and days and years and ages swift has moving shadows flee as we scan life's fleeting pages not enduring do we see on the paths our feet are wending footprints all will be effaced present time to pass is tending though its page is not erased that's life on this planet but as the book of hebrew says we build hope here the picture on the left patterson of course was changing patterson was an industrial town and waves of immigrants would come from around the world the dutch the italians the irish people of the north of the country the the italians the irish people from all over the world would come to work in its mills and the pause of the second world war meant european immigration would be shut off so many came and the great migration from the the the old south folks up from up from carolina's and georgia up into patterson the new york metropolitan area to gain factory jobs to hopefully get a better life and the dutch who had been there for a few generations had moved on to churches and halden and north halden and weikhoff and midland park but as they left they thought there should be something here for the new arrivals and so they wanted to start a gospel mission and well land was purchased and they didn't have a building yet so they put up a tent and there is a macoba as she was known mrs woodenberg standing there she was often a babysitter for me growing up and i don't even know the others and my father who could probably name them because his memory was that good he has passed as well everyone in that picture is long gone the picture on the right is bate uno in in around barona in the dominican republic and i showed up for a service and of course when i showed up it was a special day because there were varieties of churches that i had to visit and people from the community would come out but the best church they had was some sticks and some palm fronds that you'd put over the top and you'd grab you'd gather some benches from the homes and you'd put it together and well when i'd come we'd have communion and maybe a baptism or something like that and there we would preach and there we would sing and there we would mark the passing of time but whether it's a tent in paterson new jersey or it's some fronds and a bataille or whether it's churches and whatever era and part of their life arc we build in hope we build in hope for a country that isn't our own now the truth of this world is that none of us get out of this alive and perhaps the pandemic has reinforced the fact that well 1.8 million global deaths from the pandemic but that of course is just a fraction of what the world takes every year hours and days and years and ages flash by and take us with them the book of hebra's isn't done though what more shall i say i do not have time to tell about gideon barrack samson and jephthah about david and samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice and gained what was promised who shut the mouth of lions quenched the the fury of flames and escaped the edge of the sword whose weakness was turned to strength and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies women received back their dead raised to life again there were others who were tortured refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection some faced jeers and floggings and even chains and imprisonment they were put to death by stoning they were sawed in two they were killed by the sword they went about in sheepskins and goatskins destitute persecuted and mistreated the world was not worthy of them they wandered in deserts and mountains living in caves and in holes in the ground these were all commended for their faith yet none of them received what had been promised since god had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses because these people may not be here but they are not gone they are not gone let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us fixing our eyes on jesus the pioneer and perfecter of faith for the joy set before him he endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god consider him who endured such opposition from sinners so that you will not grow weary and lose heart we are closing the book on 2020 today is its last day we will come into 2021 what will it bring what will it bring for the nation what will it bring for the world what will it bring for your family what will it bring for your community what will it bring for what will it bring for the people around you hours and days and years and ages swiftly flowing where do we put our trust our hope is in the lord whether in good times and bad whether as the author he feared Napoleon, militias, political instability, pandemic, plague, heart attack, virus, death our hope is in the lord we lean forward to a better world a renewed world a world of resurrection and on the way we make this one better that is the way that is how we do it god bless you at the end of this year and may you have a blessed 2021 i'll close in a prayer lord you know all things you know our getting up and our lying down you have watched as this world turns as days and hours and years and ages swiftly flow by our lives are but a breath but lord we ask that you would give us your holy spirit that you would move us that we would be part of the great story that we would be part of this great journey we trust lord that you will be with us whatever the new year brings whether it brings prosperity and renewed freedom hopefully with some resolution of this virus or whether it brings more unexpected things which are difficult and sorrowful be with us as you promise may we like abraham and the heroes of faith be with us look forward to a city that is not built by our hands help us to endure help us to be faithful help us to bear witness hear our prayer in the name of jesus amen
