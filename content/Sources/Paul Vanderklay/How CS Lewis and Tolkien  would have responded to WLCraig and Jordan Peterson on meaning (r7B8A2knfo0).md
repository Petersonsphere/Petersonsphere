 A couple of weeks ago there was a much anticipated conversation with William Lane Craig and Jordan Peterson hosted by Wycliffe College and I made a few comments about that when it was up and I wanted to make a few more now. I should preface this by saying William Lane Craig's style of apologetics and his mission is something that I know that a lot of people find interesting. I don't find it persuasive and I hope in this meaning in this video to talk about why I don't think it's persuasive, especially if I were an agnostic or an atheist, and to say why I think actually Peterson does quite well and in a sense even though he doesn't necessarily identify formally with the Christian community, that's perhaps the best way to say it, why I think he's having the effect he's having and then what we can learn from CS Lewis. So let's first listen to a little bit of William Lane Craig. First, if God does not exist there is no ultimate purpose of life. If death stands with open arms at the end of life's trail then what is the goal of life? Is it all for nothing? Is there no reason for life? And what of the universe? Is it utterly pointless? If its destiny is a cold grave in the recesses of outer space the answer must be yes. Now I understand William Lane Craig's argument in this and his so he's saying we can't have meaning in life without God because via God we get eternity. Now what that means that for William Lane Craig implicit in his definition of meaning is eternal meaning and okay that's his definition. I think it suffers from, well I think a lot of naturalists and atheists would listen to that and say I don't buy it. The reason they don't buy it is because in a sense they're in the what I call the iron box of naturalism or the iron box of secularism. We can't have any knowledge of God and so therefore all we have left with is an experience of meaning and a or a feeling of meaning and therefore Christians imagine that we're connected up with eternity that gives them a feeling of meaning. I don't have that imagination I'm in the box but I yet have an experience of meaning or a feeling of meaning therefore you really don't have anything more than I do because what you connect it with is epistemologically out of bounds and therefore I have the meaning I have is just like the meaning you have you just have an extra fantasy attached but that extra fantasy is epistemologically meaningless and I think that's a powerful argument. Now I think it's a I think they could sell it better if they would bring in let's say maybe Viktor Frankl who developed an entire school of psychology around meaning and his experience in the the German death camps he noted just how powerful meaning is and he in a sense followed Nietzsche in noting he who has a why can he who has a why to live for can bear almost any how and and that in a sense sums up Viktor Frankl's Viktor Frankl's argument if you've never read Viktor Frankl's work Man's Search for Meaning it's a it's a powerful book and and I think Viktor Frankl makes a powerful argument about the existence and the power of meaning even a meaning that is disconnected from William Lane Craig's eternal meaning. Now Jordan Peterson his entire Maps of Meaning course I think is an argument for a richer fuller meaning and if I were to summarize his course in one sentence it would look like this you are biologically equipped to experience meaning as an organism within a world where that experience corresponds to productive action. I'll read that again you are biologically equipped to experience meaning as an organism within a world where that experience corresponds to productive action and this is why when Peterson talks about being and he talks about being right in this space which is between chaos and order then things happen and it's not just an experience of things happen because we are knit into our entire environment because we are knit into being therefore when we are at this moment meaning is not just an emotion we experience it is not just as I think some naturalists reduce it to it is not just an experience that I project onto the material world it is something built into the material world and we have arrived together with it via human civilization and even via evolution it goes all the way back to the lobsters so I think in this way Peterson gives a much richer more robust sense of meaning but but at the same time the reason why he and William Lane Craig kind of talked past each other is because they do have their two they're very different definitions for meaning and I think Peterson would be on the side of the materialists by saying we can't necessarily connect that up eternally that for Peterson would be more than he can say because he is a Darwinian in terms of his epistemological frame and so he can't get beyond what what survival dictates and again if you listen to Transliminal 2015 that this is his epistemological world and so every time you hear Peterson answer questions about religion which people keep putting to him he'll say things like this gets me to the edge of my ability to comprehend or you know this will bring him to the edge but his he's very much boxed in by his his epistemological framework as a Darwinian which is part of his criticism for Dawkins and Harrison saying they're not Darwinian they're Newtonian and and so this is the limit that that Peterson goes to and so to kind of sketch out Peterson's map of meaning you do derive meaning from work you do derive meaning from country you live in a rich environment which is which is full of meaning and it's not just your mind projecting or experiencing meaning on this being itself is infused with meaning and you have this but he remains within his agnostic as if universe and so he is still not talking about what William Lane Craig is talking about and and you know we know this because actually I'm gonna I think I'm just gonna skip through some of these things well that kind of leads to to Peterson's argument about nihilism and and so people who are depressed maybe I won't skip it you know 20 years ago people who are depressed would say well I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and and in some ways that that gave too much to the materialists and one of the things that impacted me about Jung's autobiography was there's a section when Jung begins to work in a in a mental hospital and the other doctors are telling him that people with mental illness nobody don't bother talking to them or doing psychology with them because they basically have something wrong with their brain they have a chemical imbalance and since we don't have the drugs to fix their brain there's no point in talking to them Jung didn't buy that and Jung was right because he saw that people's mental disorder even if they in fact their brain their physical brain wasn't functioning properly that's not disconnected from the rest of their lives from their relationships from how they were brought up from the mythology that is in their world view from all of this so so in that way Jung was was a far bigger thinker and a far bigger perceiver of what a human being was and Jung saw that a human being is not just enclosed within our skin but we are in fact deeply connected relationally with others and deeply tied into worldviews and this was you know this was the realization that launched Peterson on his on his maps of meaning project and and so you know so we are not just a chemical imbalance and Jonathan Haidt notwithstanding when he talks about the fact that in terms of happiness 50 to 80 percent of our our happiness is about how we're Jonathan Haidt calls it Haidt calls it the cortical lottery but as he says here particular episodes of Joy or Depression however must be understood by looking at how life events interact with a person's emotional disposition in other words nature and nurture but we are we are not disconnected so if a person is depressed they might have a medical issue they might be suffering a loss they might be Jordan Peterson's bottom lobster or they might be dealing with nihilism and at my old year sermon I talked about suicide rates in a Palo Alto high school that was in the news a few years ago and doctors are trying to figure out why were these young people suicidal well it was what was it was it nihilism how can nihilism prompt suicide well it certainly can because it's not just a chemical imbalance in our brains as human beings meaning connects us to the outside world and therefore meaning is a category which is actually active in being and changes history which again gets into Peterson's anthropology that that people that the individual is meaningful in history and what you do and in fact even what you think matters for the future of the world and I think this is the correctness of what Peterson is getting at here is what gives his is mission power in terms of impacting people and that's in fact what the 12 rules is about and he is trying to to bring people out of nihilism into a place into a much more meaningful world where their actions have consequences and and where it all in fact fits together and and so I think that's that's why Peterson's even when it within his agnostic as if universe it is rich with meaning and it is it is steeped in meaning and as it is evolved meaning that has come to us from the past now I want to talk a little bit more about meaning because I think one of the best ways into it is the Greek word tell us Greek the Greek word tell us has both the meaning of end and also purpose it might be conclusion or even goal is perhaps a good English word that gets at this idea of tell us and and so what I think Peterson is getting at is that our experience of meaning happens when we begin to achieve ends so Peterson's future authoring program helps those who take it figure out their meaning by having a goal and reaching it and and in fact this is a way to experience meaning and as Peterson said this isn't just a a mental thing that we're projecting on the world this is built into us from millions of years of evolution and so it's it's not just inside of me it's within my relationships it's within the world as I perceive it it's within what Peterson calls being now we can get into an example this might be the tell-offs of cake that that cake has tell us or cake has meaning now the meaning of a cake you can see a cake in a in a bakery window and say that's a beautiful cake well well you're beginning to get at some of its meaning through beauty but but probably if you want to fully exhaust the tell-offs of cake you have to eat it because it's not just beauty it's not just nutrition it's also what I would say glory if you ask me to summarize them the meaning of life in one word I will tell you glory that is the meaning of life and and so the tell-offs of cake the meaning of cake is is that we eat it now and I think this is where a strict materialist might say we project meaning onto the cake and and Peterson would say no there's meaning in our relationship with the cake and there's meaning in the cake and there's meaning in this rich world where I know what cake is and I know what cake means because cake can even have other layers of meaning when I see a cake I might in fact be connecting with birthday cakes in my past or when you see a wedding cake this then connects with with other things in other words for for Peterson's work and I think this is part this is a big part of his contribution that that all of this is connected and it has to be taken seriously and if you Bishop Baron has a has a good video I don't agree with everything in that video but the his his video on modernity and morality I think really gets at some of this stuff because Bishop Baron comes at this and asks questions basically looks at basically looks through Aristotle and says what Nietzsche pointed out was how modernity stripped away meaning and and the formal well you know let's say the formal the formal cause that Aristotle talks about got ripped away and and without that formal cause we are in fact adrift in this much more meaningless universe which then contributes to our nihilism so that's a that's a particularly good video to watch now now where I want to go as a Christian is in a sense following CS Lewis that says that in fact there's something in cakeness there's something in country there's something in work that's not only built up from the bottom via evolution and human history and culture but brought in from the top in terms of meaning that God has in fact created into the world one of my favorite passages in the Bible is when the prophet Isaiah goes to the temple and and what do you know God shows up and God is there with the seraphim and they're crying holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty that is that is God high and lifted up unimaginable unapproachable unknowable holy holy holy but the whole earth is full of his glory in other words as the apostle Paul will later will later say in Romans one we can we can in a sense know him and see him through his works leaving leaving all of us you know we ought to know who he is so so what happens here is that meaning as Peterson finds it is relationally between us meaning has grown up with us but also meaning is above us and comes in through the things that we know now I think no one gets at this better than CS Lewis CS Lewis begins mere Christianity with his argument from desire and and what Lewis basically says is that we are let me back up a little bit what Peterson says essentially is we can't I can't go beyond Darwin he's a pragmatist can't go beyond Darwin therefore all I can know is via survival and so he will frame his epistemological world on this and this is why he has to is this is why he has to hedge his metaphysical comments the way he hedges them all the time because he can't know anything beyond Darwin now now my assertion is that this is an epistemological stinginess and that the stinginess is fashionable that in fact this is this is why Jung found his found his his colleagues in school embarrassed at the talk of ghosts this is this is why CS Lewis begins miracles with the talk of ghosts this is why anything that is outside the iron box of secularism or the iron box of naturalism is is something that we must not speak of in polite company something we dare not talk about because if we if we do talk in this way we lose status and this is and this is a big part of the loss of status of Christianity because if you open that door you're opening that door to all kinds of different silliness all kinds of different superstition now now this is where when you see Brett Weinstein and Jordan Peterson talking on Joe Rogan this is where they rub up against each other Peterson is a little bolder in saying I'm willing to play with this professionally I'm not willing to go beyond it this is my boundary line but I'm gonna have that be a dotted line I'm not gonna have that be an iron box and and others listening to him who are as a community holding on to that iron box are saying nope nope can't go there better not go there better not cross that line well how do we cross the line well let's let's listen to a little bit of of this because this interview because I thought at the end of this interview we start crossing this line and and I found this very interesting because in a sense the host here who's a Dutch host starts posing what is in a sense a cosmological argument so let's let's listen to a little bit of this stuff that drives this game that we're playing well that whatever doesn't that might be okay well but that that's a very archetypal idea there is like one of the deepest mythological ideas is that well there's nature and there's culture and there's consciousness those are the three things and consciousness all three of those play a causal role or it's yet it's nature culture and and and and and consciousness that's the individual in some sense and it seems to me that that's that's as true as anything that can be said but and there's more to it that's how you act in the world like you act towards other people as if they're active mediators between order and chaos and if you don't they do not want to play with you and I think oh that's interesting so so here we are in a situation where no one will play with you unless you treat them like they're the divine mediator of order and chaos and people say well what do you mean by that it's like I act like you have free will I act like your choices are important I act like you're a responsible person or should be held responsible no and and here Peterson is he's knocking on the door and and what Peterson essentially says in many of his things is you you have to get to the Imago Dei now Peterson is using different words he calls it a divine spark sometimes but you if you lose the Imago Dei you lose Western civilization and and people demand to be treated like there's something you know like they are little logos makers that they in Tolkien's words they are little sub creators that that that there's something to them that is now we're using divine and actually this this guy's gonna get into some almost neo-platinism in terms of in terms of where he goes with this I act like you can learn from your mistakes all of those things and if I don't do that then really you don't want to have anything to do with me so now you might say well that's not proof it's like well it depends how you define proof he's just creeping to that door it's a kind of proof so that's definitely something you can observe in people right exactly you can observe that you can observe that they act as if that's true it doesn't mean it's true yeah but it it this is his as if universe you can act as if it's true it doesn't mean it's true he can't say it's true because he's got that line that line of his is Darwinianism that says I can't epistemologically go beyond that point but I can reach out as if as if is in some ways the fig leaf the fig leaf that lets him sneak beyond it into church where in the fig leaf certainly raises the suspicion that it might be true yeah back raises the suspicion that it might be true in a little bit I'm gonna play some of Alan Jacobs book on CS Lewis because this is what Tolkien pushes Lewis past to that little bit about divinity and something that I heard you say before there seems to be something going on right now with mankind you can't quite put your finger on it and I was always when I listened to that I always think like well it's sort of obvious what's going on if you look at mankind's history like we're gaining complexity that's what we do I mean if you look at the Neanderthals and where we are right now what we're doing is we're gaining complexity and that's because we are learning more about the world and the more we learn about the world the more we start to realize how incredibly elegant our cosmos and our universe is we had astronomer here and he tells us about the fact that for example if the configuration of our universe the the rate at which helium converts to some other element was only slightly less yeah then this entire existence would not exist you and I would not be having this conversation right now and if I think about stuff like that it's not either it's a big set of occurrences and it's just luck mm-hmm or if you look at everything how everything fits together hmm my rational mind only goes like this is almost too convenient hmm this is the fine-tuning argument it's in a sense that the contemporary cosmological argument that the way the universe is that there's so many there's so many fine-tuning features that make this world just like it is and this is why the the multiverse was invented to try to undercut this argument even if there isn't any evidence for multiverses but this is the basically giving Peterson the cosmological argument now watch how Peterson responds to it that it all works like this and if you look at the board that we're playing at that seems to be aiming at more complexity mm-hmm so that's that's sort of the way I feel about that how do you look at that I like the idea of it it's like more sophistication in some sense there is a drive towards that or there is a movement towards that people that the real like what would you say that sort of militant evolutionary biologists say well there's no aim in in Darwinian evolution and I understand what they mean and I understand why they say it and it's a powerful point for reasons we won't go into but by the same token life was a lot simpler than it three and a half billion years ago than it is now there is this drive towards no and not at every level there's still lots of single-celled organisms right so but there's certainly part of the game has emerged and and and transformed itself at ever-increasing levels of neurological complexity for example especially if you zoom in at the part that we just described as divine the consciousness so I don't know if dolphins can be considered the part that's divine if you if you look this is this is a this is this is neo-platinism the part that's divine truly conscious I think they can they don't seem to have that tendency but as humans definitely do and I think I don't know how self-conscious they are there's somewhat self-conscious yeah I think it's a nice ourselves in mirrors exactly yeah but it's a pretty low level of self-consciousness to recognize yourself in the mirror I mean human beings have a delineated self model of themselves that they're constantly updating we're self-conscious in about ten different dimensions and and some animals have the rudiments of that and unfortunately we lost the cosmological argument line but it's gonna go someplace interesting so Elephants do yeah chimpanzees seem to dolphins seem to but compared to our elaborated self-consciousness and our clear knowledge of death there's a there's a big gap elephants play with death you know they're they play with but they definitely mourn and other animals mourn I've seen dogs more than cats mourn and but but animal but elephants will go to where there are bones and and check them out it's like they're right on the cusp of of of knowledge I would say but they're not linguistic so I don't think they can manage it yeah but it seems to me that once consciousness rises above a certain level and it it's a bit able to do the stuff that you just described then it starts gaining complexity it there's just a dispersed in us that can't be quelled somehow we want to gain more knowledge yeah if you there's a thirst now bit keep this in mind for when we get to see us little talk to an astronomer they're giddy about how much we do not know yet yeah I think I think that's a that's a good example of the biological instantiation of the hero myth you know we're designed to boldly go where no one has gone before I love that yeah yeah well that but that's why Star Trek is such a such a big deal why these why these heroic adventures the it's mythology for engineers right it's religion for engineers essentially it's engineers it's religion and we are there is a great adventure in going where you don't know and mastering the territory yeah and if you look at the Star Trek universe in particular that these guys what I always liked about it especially the old star take is that they were all like these almost archetypical heroes they always did the right thing they were always going like they had their directives and of course they were humans and they made mistakes but there was this moral that seemed to be so much higher than what we had in this time at Irvine it was something to strive for like Captain Picard could be a role model for leadership and a lot of senses well it's exactly what he is and he is a role model for leadership that's why people are watching him because you know any any leader a fictional leader like that is a fictional leader is a quasi messiah mm-hmm right it's a fragment of the messianic archetype and so it might be the fragment that particularly appeals to you so if you're a techie you know you want your messiah to be captaining a starship yes and that's where you get your fragmentary messianic vision and it's important it's vital and you see that with Star Wars you know all these people they say well I'm atheist to the core or you're a Star Wars fan oh yes I'm a great Star Wars fan it's like well you know those two statements don't go together so and it's obvious I mean I know I mean with Star Wars I mean for example the the screenplay was specifically influenced by Joseph Campbell's work who is of course a devotee of Jung and studied archetypal patterns of behavior it's not it's not a it's not a hypothesis of hypothesis to say that a geeky atheistic engineers get their religion through Star Wars it's just a statement of fact so and then we should pay attention to that because those things I'm not making fun of that and not in the least I think these stories are so vital that it's good that you get them in whatever manner you can get them but let's and then I'll go back to my fandom argument that I mean what is church you we have this drive to live into mythology we have this we are we are built for it now now again Peterson's will say yeah we're constructed we're built in it from the you know from for millions of years ago is from the lobsters on up and I would say yeah and we're built it's built into us from even before that and which is why mythology goes goes always goes all the way back to creation and goes to the the gods or in Christian terms obviously the God who made us and and in fact this is this is what happens this is what happens with CS Lewis and this is this is the way CS Lewis himself became a Christian and it's important to understand the role that J.R.R. Tolkien played in this Tolkien why Tolkien Tolkien was the one who converted CS Lewis well besides the Holy Spirit of course I'm a Calvinist but was the one who led CS Lewis to Christ and how did he lead CS Lewis to Christ he led CS Lewis to Christ along this path and said you already believe in mythology why don't you live it why don't you believe into it because in a sense what the church is is the true myth and it's you know you of course he didn't have Star Wars and CS Lewis's time you dress up and you you dress up like a Star Wars character and you go to the movie with all your friends and in that two plus hours you try to live into the movie or you do it with Harry Potter you do with Star Trek or you do it with Lord of the Rings why don't you just stop you know vacationing over in these worlds why don't you live in them and you say yeah but you know I'm not gonna live in the Star Trek universe really because that's fiction and that's where Tolkien has them and says what if it isn't fiction because because here's the thing about what we believe we don't believe this is where we get back to William Lane Craig and why I don't find his method of apologetics terribly convincing I'm sure some do I don't think he would have the visibility if he if he wasn't effective at all but I don't think we believe because there's an argument I think we believe because there's a desire because we long for our worlds to fit in and fit together at the end of CS Lewis's there's a CS Lewis did an essay called the is theology poetry and at the end of that that that essay he makes this he makes this famous quote where he basically says I don't I don't believe in Christian I believe in Christianity because I believe in the Sun now the point is you don't look at the Sun but he says I believe in it because I can see everything else because of it and he says that you know there's science and Christianity and if you have a scientific worldview you can't fit Christianity in it and in fact you can't even fit science in it and I'm gonna get into more into CS Lewis's miracles now CS Lewis says but with Christianity I can fit science into my worldview and science makes sense but also myth makes sense and all these other things make sense it's a world big enough he makes the point that if I dream there's no room in my dreaming world for my waking world but there is room in my waking world for my dreaming world therefore I know that the dreaming world is nested in the waking world so let's let's take a look at CS Lewis through Alan Jacobs book the Narnian now this is an edited audiobook and this is an unabridged version of the book but let's let's let's jump in here was a clear difference of opinion Lewis firmly insisted that myths were lies even if they were beautiful breathed through silver but Tolkien defended them passionately as vehicles for moral and spiritual truth eventually he wrote a long poem for and this is why in a sense this is why in a sense Peterson is like Lewis because you know Brett Weinstein will say wow there's there's evolved truth in them and Peterson will say no there's there's there's deeper truth in them that you ignore at your peril Lewis said they're lies and Tolkien says they're not lies they're truth or CSL called mythopeia that is mythmaking he gave the poem the subtitle Philomythus to Mizomythus myth lover to myth hater and he began it with the very question of what the natural world is you look at trees and label them just so for trees are trees and growing is to grow you walk the earth and tread with solemn pace one of the many minor globes of space a star is a star some matter in a ball compelled to courses mathematical amid the regimented cold inane where destined atoms are each moment slain what is immediately striking about this beginning is the characterization of Lewis as a despiser of myths who looks upon the world with a cold materialist eye we know that not to have been the case at this stage in his life we know the violent blows his earlier strict atheism had already taken but we also know that Lewis was a man who loved the give-and-take of argument and it is not hard to guess that in debating these matters with Tolkien he put up more resistance than he really felt it was a way of putting the supernatural beliefs to which he was drawn to a real test later in the poem Tolkien invokes the story from Genesis of Adams naming of the animals and extends it to a naming of all creation yet trees are not trees until so named and seen and never were so named till those had been whose speeches involuted breath unfurled faint echo and dim picture of the world but neither record nor a photograph being divination judgment and a laugh response of those that felt a stir within by deep munition movements that were kin to life and death of trees of beasts of stars free captives undermining shadowy bars digging the foreknown from experience and panning the vein of spirit out of sense the argument here is that when imagined unfallen beings Tolkien does not speak directly of Adam that was not his way first named the things of this world they did so by means of an instinctive insight into their natures and the natures of things are primarily defined always by their having been created made by the commanding Word of God therefore he sees no stars who okay right there meaning Tolkien does not speak directly of Adam which was not his way first naming the things of this world they did so by means of an instinctive insight in a divination a deep munition of their natures what are what are we getting at here where's my PowerPoint there we go their natures their their meaning their telos is in there and so when Adam names things in the world you when you when you name something you connect it with a telos and so when when he names we're naming meaning we're naming what a thing is and what a thing is for stars who does not see them first of living silver made that sudden burst to flame like flowers beneath an ancient song Tolkien is arguing here that anyone who like Eustace sees a star as a huge ball of flaming gas is not really seeing to perceive the creation truly we must move beyond knowing what stars are made of and because we are fallen and finite creatures this we can do only by image metaphor and myth in other words if we want to know the meaning of things and not just okay and a materialist thing the meaning I project onto it or even in a Petersonian thing the meaning that is kind of built in through the history of the world but a meaning which is made by its maker you need to access that through image metaphor and myth to be sure we lack the direct immediate power of divination that Adam had nevertheless the heart of man is not compound of lies but draws some wisdom from the only wise and still recalls him though now long estranged man is not wholly lost nor wholly changed disgraced he may be yet is not dethroned and keeps the rags of lordship once he owned his world dominion by creative act to this argument Lewis posed a question are these not mere wish fulfillment fantasies we know he posed that question because the poem addresses it directly yes wish fulfillment dreams we spend to cheat our timid hearts and ugly fact defeat but Tolkien goes on to ask a countering question whence came the wish and whence the power to dream that is if the materialist philosophy is true why do we even have such dreams and desires what planted in us this longing this sense of joy itself here Tolkien was reaching to the heart of his friend Lewis had focused all his attention either on what joy was or how to get it but Tolkien was forcing him to consider the matter in a wholly different light it was not joy itself but its presence in a biological organism comprising largely water nitrogen and carbon that constituted the greatest puzzle that we dream and wish at all is a powerful element of the case for belief that myths communicate some truth that cannot be communicated in any other way Lewis would use this argument repeatedly for the rest of his life as he would write years later do what they will then we remain conscious of a desire which no natural happiness will satisfy but is there any reason to suppose that reality offers any satisfaction to it nor does the being hungry prove that we have bread but I think it may be urged that this misses the point a man's physical hunger does not prove that that man will get any bread he may die of starvation on a raft in the Atlantic but surely a man's hunger does prove that he comes of a race which repairs its body by eating and inhabits a world where eatable substances exist so you've got your epistemological limitations can you prove that your desires are not for another world no but is that evidence does that suggest something to us does that with all the other evidence suggests that perhaps there is another world now again William Lincoln is arguing well it's got to be an eternal world and and I would say happily so it is an eternal world but it's not just up here Peterson is right that it's down here I would say it's up here it's down here and it's up here all the way down and into here that's that's what I would argue and again now just the argument isn't going to convince anyone until you desire it until you long for it and then if you long for it you you might want to live in it and again you would be foolish to say well I want to I'm gonna live as Star Wars man and I'm gonna dress up like Obi-Wan and I'm gonna walk around with a lightsaber and well you could do that but most people would call you a fool well the argument is well Christians are in some sense that same kind of fool but Christians would argue that we actually belong to a true myth because Jesus was a historical person and again when we get into see us Lewis's miracles we're gonna have the argument that basically Lewis says Jesus for him was the missing chapter in the middle of the story that turned the light on for the rest of the picture. So too the craving for myths suggests the presence of a non physiological need that they satisfy or more accurately try to satisfy. Because they reach something deep within us we return to them repeatedly but because they do not and cannot meet the need they invoke our experience with them is characterized by longing. But surely not all desires are meant to be fulfilled. Indeed says Philomythus they are not and he suggests Sumizomythus that he knows perhaps we all know what is to be rejected as wishful thinking and what is to be embraced as the courage to believe what we cannot see. Blessed are the men of Noah's race that build their little arcs though frail and poorly filled and steer through winds contrary towards a wraith a rumor of a harbor guessed by Faith. Blessed are the legend makers with their rhyme of things not found within recorded time. It is with these people that Philomythus casts his lot and he encourages Mizomythus to do the same. In the end Tolkien does not offer certainty of reward for the voyagers and myth makers but rather faith and hope. In paradise perchance the eye may stray from gazing upon everlasting day to see the day illumined and renew from mirrored truth the likeness of the true and he encourages Lewis to take the same chance he is taking to count on the perchance and Lewis did. For the rest of his life he was a champion of the knowledge-giving power of myth fantasy fairy. And that's as far as we'll go and so I think this lays it out. So William Lane Craig he's saying well it's implicit in meaning is eternal and I would say in line with the ontological argument the best meaning is eternal. Why would you hope for anything less? And you say well I see meaning down here and yes it's more than I project meaning onto the cake there is meaning built into cakeness and that meaning is built in from the ground up all the way up to now and so Peterson's meaning is fuller than the than the mere materialist who projects and I would say yes but why stop short? Why stop short? Well I have to be I have to stay within my box because if I step out of my box why what will happen if you step out of your box? Well I don't know. Okay well that's I can I can respect that but there's a whole lot of people don't know much but live you must and and so I would I would give I would use in a sense the ontological argument and say well let's say the materialists are true well then you know if the materials are true believe what you want you know there's no there's no I can find no actual ought and and I'm not gonna necessarily just take John Locke at his word and so I would say why not believe in meaning that is eternal? Why not believe in meaning that is built into cake and built into love and built into this world and why not believe that meaning can transcend this world and spill out into other worlds and that when we name things that that that we can actually live into a true myth and and so for me that's that's why I remain a Christian and why meaning we can know meaning in life and you might say well I'm gonna play John Locke's game and I'm gonna have you prove it to me and I'll say well people believe all sorts of things and you know what nobody they don't ask for a license they don't apply to the state for their being or for their meaning people believe all kinds of stuff well this is this is what I'll believe and you might say well justify it to me well I can't prove it to you I can tell you why I believe and you yourself is going to be the judge as to whether my belief system is compelling or perhaps more important if my belief system is attractive and if in fact as Lewis as Lewis talks about in at the end of at the end of is theology poetry and if I can find a copy of that online I'll put the link to it in here finally what's the waking world and what's the dreaming world there is room in the waking world for the dreaming world there is not room in the dreaming world for the waking world and so I would argue within the world of myth let's get into the picture within the world of myth there is room for science and now when we get into miracles and a little bit into Alvin Plantinga Plantinga is gonna make as a philosopher is gonna make the argument there's some real issues if you limit yourself to the science world in terms of truth-knowing that will a sense be the heart of Lewis's argument too and so Lewis says opt for the bigger world because your smaller worlds can fit into them and that's you know I wish CS Lewis was was with William Lane Craig and and Jordan Peterson in their talk about meaning because I think that's what Lewis would have said
