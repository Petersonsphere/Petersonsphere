 Hi, this is Paul and I'm continuing my series on CS Lewis miracles and we're up to chapter three and in my previous videos I talked about the subtraction story and So then I always look for examples of who is telling the subtraction story in a very Very popular way and I think Sam Harris does it quite succinctly and quite well in this video Religions are failed Sciences and so let's jump into the video and he will I think pretty clearly Articulate what this subtraction story is if the program will open here we go I've you religions as essentially failed sciences. I mean the religion was the discourse That we had when all causes in the universe were opaque We didn't know we didn't know the basis of anything. We didn't know why we were here. We we didn't know how Diseases spread or what disease was we didn't know how people Why people died early and why others flourished? We don't know what's causing the thunderstorms or causing crops to fail And we very naturally as a cognitive and behavioral imperative we form Descriptions of the world and we try to figure out what's going on We tell ourselves stories about our origins and about where we're going and about causes in the world and those stories given given our Pervasive ignorance and our disposition to see Agency in the world to see you know to feel ourselves in relationship to the world these stories entail being in relation to Invisible friends, you know and enemies and we so we have you know this parent figure in the sky Who's gonna take care of things if you live rightly and and we have other demonic presences that we should be really worried about and Gradually what what you see happening is that religion as as Rationality and dozens of specific sciences were birthed in the human conversation You see religion on a hundred fronts losing the argument with science I mean we see that you know on the front of Human health and disease Religion you know used to be that you could get a diagnosis of demonic possession I mean that was a you know a reasonable thing to believe you had if you were Having seizures say you know but now we have a science of neurology and we know about epilepsy and so when your kid has seizures You know you don't go to the church to get get him diagnosed and treated by exorcism and so that's a good thing I'm saying that religion is losing the argument on Every other front it's losing the argument ethically is he it's gonna it will lose the argument spiritually I mean we will understand spiritual experience so well at some point at the level of the brain and at the level of The way in which using attention in certain ways can change human experience we'll understand it in a way that makes a mockery of this kind of denominational religion talk about Jesus and grace or about Buddha and magic powers and that will break down in the same way that has broken down on medicine on in medicine And that's that's a process. I think we just have to be honest about and let unfold Okay, I think that's a really excellent Articulation of again what I call the subtraction story now. This is jumping into CS Lewis describes it in his Book the weight of glory in his essay is theology poetry For all these reasons then I think though we knew even before Freud that the heart is deceitful that those who accept theology are not Necessarily being guided by taste rather than reason The picture so often painted of Christians huddling together on an ever narrow strip of beach while the incoming tide of science mounts higher and higher corresponds to nothing in my own experience again, this is CS Lewis talking because Sam Harris's position here is not a new position This was the prevailing position especially towards the end of the 19th century towards the end of the 19th century What Sam Harris just articulated was very much believed and it was embraced and asserted and this was why the First World War took everyone at by such a surprise and Put Western Europe in such a funk now World War one Also, if you look at Phillips Jenkins book on the Great and Holy War World War one was also a very religious war but the aspect here is that for For this particular segment of society everyone believed at the end of the 19th century What Sam Harris just said and everyone believed that what would happen was that religion would continue to recede recede recede recede and As CS Lewis always seems to be able to put things better than anyone else painted Christians huddling together on an ever narrower strip of beach while the incoming tide of science mounts higher and higher Corresponds to nothing in my own experience CS Lewis says him being a veteran of the First World War That grand myth in order he's talking about the subtraction stories talking about what Sam Harris just articulated in that video That grand myth which I ask you to admire a few minutes ago and it should be admired. It is a powerful Powerful potent myth now I'm distinguishing between the myth of science and the practice of science and the reality of science and we're gonna get deeper into that As we go through here that grand myth with that which I asked you to admire a few minutes minutes ago is not for me a hostile Novelty breaking in on my traditional beliefs on the contrary that cosmology is what I started from CS Lewis as a boy in fact Rejected Christianity and was tutored by an ardent Post-Christian atheist who was extremely rational and CS Lewis steeped himself in being Anti-religious and against God and being hyper rational and it's in that context that he studied philosophy Deeply distrustful and final and um deepening distrust and final abandonment of it long preceded my conversion to Christianity In other words before he could become a Christian He had to give up on this myth of the subtraction story of it's sometimes called different things Scientism in CS Lewis's book on miracles. We call it naturalism. We'll also call it materialism Long before I believe theology to be true I had already decided that the popular scientific picture at any rate was false One absolutely central inconsistency ruins it it is the one we touched on a fortnight ago the whole picture possesses a dependence on inferences from observed facts unless unless Inference is valid the whole picture disappears and in my previous two videos where I talked about the rationality rules and And talked about Jordan Peterson and his need for at least God and scare quotes This was what I highlighted is this dependence upon inference and if you cannot if you cannot validate or somehow demonstrate inference if Inference is suspect or if the foundation for inference is suspect your entire edifice of this particular picture collapses And so you have this subtraction story ancient people's made-up stories to explain the world now We should take a pause here take a step back and say that Sam Harris just told us a story that explained the world That's why we call it a subtraction story And and the subtraction story is just as much as any of our other stories a made-up story To explain the world and if you get into Jonathan Heights the elephant and the rider You'll understand that well the elephant believes what it believes and the rider kind of makes up stories as it goes along Is this the picture of our brain? Is this the picture of? Rationality is this realism that we're talking about Human beings make science meaningful through story We can't appropriate the meaning of science in any other way and notice that again if you listen to Sam Harris or or Dennett or Richard Dawkins or a number of other atheists, and we're gonna name a bunch of them as we go through this video You always have to coach it in a story or why well I'm a preacher and I tell a lot of stories as a preacher why because that is in a sense the native language of Phenomenological beings you cannot communicate to human beings in a memorable way without telling it in a story and this of course gets into some and some of Jordan Peterson's points about Mythology and story the ancients were not stupid. They knew in fact what they were doing now it comes to No, Harris says well they had stories to explain the world yes Well, we use stories to explain the world But one of the things that I want to push back on a little bit is this idea that well There's big scary things out there, so they made stories they personified everything Oh, they certainly did and if you look at Egyptian mythology you have gods all over the place But but let's take a let's take a look at for example the ancient Near East cosmology I would argue that this cosmology as in fact Jordan Peterson runs through this once At least in one of his lectures if I recall this was not an unreasonable irrational Cosmology for someone to posit if there's for example living somewhere in the Levant and Mesopotamia in Egypt in Judea Why is there water above well there has to be water above because we know that water from falls from the sky So it makes perfect sense that there's perhaps a dome above and that dome has gates And so therefore when the god or something opens that gates waters come down and the the earth is watered and we live Well, how do we why do we think there's waters below? Well, if you dig far enough usually you hit water and also why do we think that there are waters to the east? Well, if you're living somewhere in this area And you travel you travel west west west west west you go through these gates Seems like pillars of the earth and what do you get out here you get the Great Sea Now that seems to be the end of the earth now if you travel in just about any other direction What you do is you travel far enough and even if you go, you know through Babylon and then across what today is Afghanistan and take the Silk Route all the way to China you get to the end of China and again you hit water It is not an unreasonable thing to imagine that if you're standing there and you're a human being there's waters above there's waters below It's not unreasonable to imagine that what the cosmos is is in fact this enormous watery domain and here we live in a little bubble within it and that bubble is as Genesis 1 refers to a firmament and This is how the world works now in a sense We're back and we're gonna talk about the elephant and the and the blind men quite a bit We're back in a sense looking at the elephant and why are those? Why are those strange men feeling up this poor elephant and they're all saying well the elephant is this and the elephant is that But again, my point is to tell this story We position ourselves in what I call a monarchical vision that that there is one Vision for how this story is seen and notice in fact with this representation this representation the the camera or the artist or the sketcher Stands with respect to a number of things to create this representation all of that is in the picture But most of this we don't actually see or consider when we tell the story When we say seven blind men were touching something and they all had different descriptions you would say Well, what are they touching and you would say well? I don't know what they're touching but you've say seven blind men are touching an elephant boom You have the monarchical vision of an elephant and suddenly the story makes sense and this story is in fact It's more commonly used to talk about religious pluralism But but it is in a sense also a story about science because we all sciences as we're describing right now is based on observation and in a sense the scientific story that we come to the world with usually in order to implement via Technology is a monarchical story that we have framed the story and it's from a certain perspective But just like with the elephant and the blind man when we look through this picture We imagine we see everything when actually as Jordan Peterson has made The point Jordan Peterson and many others have made actually this picture is an extremely careful selection of a situation Just like this particular is an extremely careful selection of a situation and now we have these particular Individuals in certain dress we have them looking old They're all male and in fact, and there's there's something with a dome way and back In fact, there's a there are many many many things that we can draw from this picture beyond the main focus Which is the elephant and the blind men and this is why in fact we say a picture is worth a thousand words so the story works Because the monarchical vision we have all we all have of the situation But that is implicit to the story not explicit This is a point made quite persuasively By a man who was an Anglican missionary to India in his retirement Returned to England and wrote some of the most important books that I think we've seen in the last Hundred years in terms of Christian missiology. His name was Leslie Newbigin. His books are very much worth reading now When Charles Taylor a Canadian philosopher Writes this one of his a number of very large books that he writes the man can't seem to write briefly He says, you know, why did things change so drastically from 1500 to 2000 now? Sam Harris might say well we discovered science and science has been pushing back religion and therefore life is Better now in in my vlog last Thursday. I noted Andrew Sullivan's piece last week where he had Pinker and and Deanan a Roman Catholic I believe and say well life is getting so much better Well life is getting so much better in some ways But what if everyone is healthy and has as much amusements as possible? And has lots of money and in fact is absolutely everything but they're nihilistic It's very interesting when you look at kind of the origin story of Siddhartha Gautama the Buddha Notice notice that story sometime and how those pieces work together Anyway, Charles Taylor writes a very long story because he says, you know The subtraction story is a very very low resolution picture and just like the elephant and the blind man It's a very selective picture of this process In fact the picture is far longer and and and really far more interesting than this high this very low resolution Snapshot that Sam Harris is arguing for with his subtraction story whether or not you believe his telling What you should gather from the subtraction story is that? Is that the subtraction story is a myth and I would assert in both senses of the word The subtraction story is a myth that I find commonly believed amongst many of my atheist friends if you know They know me. I'm a pastor. I'm a nice guy and they're my friend and There's this funny little piece of his life that we can't figure out why on earth. Do you still believe in God? You know, we you you're you're so reasonable on other other on many other scores again. Listen to Richard Dawkins on unbelievable I've played that in previous in previous videos, you know Richard Dawkins is talking to this evangelical pastor and a a Jewish scholar and and Richard Dawkins says Well, I'm not arguing against you. You're all reasonable people I'm arguing against those people who live in places like Nebraska and Kansas who don't want Evolution in their textbooks and they want to teach creation science and so on and so forth And so Sam Harris's story is in fact a myth It's a framing story for the world and in fact, it's been a very potent myth and and many many people have found it convincing and they found it convincing because cellphones work because If I stop eating so many little Reese's peanut butter cups I don't gain so much weight and the doctor is is happier with me Now what's interesting about the subtraction story is that the subtraction story has a number of sub-stories that seem to validate the subtraction story and one of the most famous sub stories that validates the subtraction story is Galileo and the story goes like this Galileo used science to tell the truth about the world while the church used the Bible to spread its myths and The church was very mean and they were mean to Galileo now It's worthwhile doing a little bit of research into this story as it is with the Dayton monkey trial Many of the times when you track down the sub stories of subtraction story You'll find as is in almost always the case when you track down any compressed story that The higher resolution pictures are far more complicated And one of the the key things that is almost always missed in the Galileo story is that yes Galileo was using Observation and was pushing back against What was church doctrine, but what's really interesting note was that the church was using Aristotle? Not the Bible the the picture of the world that Galileo was critiquing was Aristotle's picture of the world not the Let's say a strict reading of Genesis one's picture of the world and so you might ask well What was the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages doing with? Aristotle's picture of the world and if you ask a question like that and you do a little bit of research into that question You will be rewarded By going out and going into the chaos of the library and doing a bit of research now I've been using Philip Carey's philosophy and religion in the West which is an audible book part of the great courses series and with these books you get a Set of notes a PDF you get that via you can find it in an audible and you can find it other places Philip Carey says this modern philosophy is born in a crisis of authority Especially religious authority in the wake of the wars of religion after the Protestant Reformation the authoritative text which had governed which had defined The nature of the medieval world no longer seemed to give unambiguous answers to fundamental questions about God the world and the self Now if you go back over some of my previous videos I walk through the Protestant Reformation and empiricism rationalism Nietzsche and I discussed that in some of my earlier commentaries on Jordan Peterson's biblical lectures Modern philosophy therefore begins by seeking the sources of belief and certainty in the self this epistemology Turn to the subject is Illustrated by Descartes method of systemic doubt and his famous starting point of certainty I think therefore I am it is also a feature of Locke's Evidentialist ethic of belief according to which individuals are obliged to hold no belief Not even religious beliefs unless they have adequate evidence to support it now What's interesting about this and in a sense of confirmation about what Peterson talks about in terms of the way stories persist things that endure throughout time these two elements Actually a number of elements from the Descartes the turn to the self the use of doubt To try to find certainty in other words We we scrape away all the doubtful stuff to get to the foundation of certainty in other words doubt in that sense Is kind of like a shovel and then Locke's Evidentialism that you know if I say well, you know, I think um I think my dog is telling me winning lottery numbers someone would say prove it I don't think number one your dog can tell you any numbers and number two I doubt they'll be winning lottery numbers. So this is an example of Locke's evidentialism now Both of these elements these this well all three of these elements this turn to the self This this using doubt as we imagine to dig away or uncover to find foundational certainty Even the language of that is a little archetypal and interesting and then and then Locke's evidentialism these have become So self-evident so axiomatic Within our culture. We don't even think about these elements anymore. We just simply assume them And and if we stop and pause we might ask well if we're assuming these things yet I have never even studied Descartes and Locke What else might we be assuming and that's a very good question so Philip uh, Kerry goes on modern thought in the crisis of authority the meaning of authority in western religion the word authority Originally refers to the authority of a teacher rather than a king And isn't it interesting how we in a sense have displaced that It referred to Educational not political authority in the middle ages It came to refer to authoritative texts of the western tradition if you remember way back to some of my videos you remember Dealing with john walton about how john walton talked about before there were texts in the ancient near east There were authorities and it's in that sense that the first five books of the bible when we talk about them being the books of moses They in a sense have the authority of moses now were they written by moses now the vast majority of contemporary scholars will say no And even ancient scholars had their doubts at the end of deuteronomy when moses records his own death you think wow That's one heck of a prophet So the middle ages came to refer to authoritative texts of the western tradition the authorities Whose writing one um whose writings one consulted to learn something in other words if you were doing physics at the end of the middle ages You were studying aristotle That's where you learned physics now. That's very different today than if you go to a physics classroom where Let's say even in grade school when you're starting to learn rudimentary physics you you take a look at something and you say How fall does that how fast does that fall? Why does it travel in an arc? um We learn physics out here in the world You'd say well, of course well and you'd say of course because every time you say of course It's because well, this is part of this implicit world that you're living in Hence the crisis of authority also phys Aristotle was the key to physics and the church fathers on the bible So when Galileo has this fight with the church, he's fighting aristotle And he's fighting aristotle by using Things out there in the world and as I've said before you have this crisis of authority with text Now we're going to know physics not by consulting the authoritative text of aristotle but by Engaging the world engaging real things You know when I hit my head on i'm using ourselves to death It leaves a mark. These are real things the gravity, you know, this is how I can make a I can make a little breeze. This is how We learn physics today Now sources of the of the crisis of authority religious in the wake of the protestant reformation Christian europe could not agree on the meaning of religious authorities. And again, if you look at the protestant reformation What one of the things that the church was saying to martin luther was we are the authority We give the text authority and martin luther is saying wait a minute You have it out you have it backwards the authority gives you text and then you know you go back to jesus talking to the Talking to the religious leaders of his day and he says to his disciples they sit in moses seat Well, what did he mean by that? Well, they sit with they they have the authority. So jesus says do as they say But don't do as they do because they're hypocrites and we're gonna talk about hypocrisy a little bit later in this video So there's a crisis of religious authority. There's a crisis of scientific authority modern newtonian physics is based on experience and Observation rather than on reading authorities. This is what Galileo was doing. This is what newton was doing Now our stories are often low resolution approximations Galilee did not pit galilee did pitch observation versus Aristotle do some reading on newton and his religious beliefs alchemy Newton is a very interesting figure and and today we just simply associate him with say newtonian mechanics But what he was doing and what many of his the others were doing was practicing natural philosophy And i'm currently reading a a history book about that period and and the vast majority of these natural Philosophers in england and other places these fathers who give us physics and chemistry Were pouring over the bible regularly to try to figure out the second coming of christ And the bubonic plague was wiping out a fifth of the population of london. All of this is happening at the same time These are extraordinarily religious people. In fact, these people are so religious they make the they make you know, they make Probably just about anybody in america except perhaps the amish Look secular The relationship between observation and story, however Is long and complex Now let's get into c.s lewis's chapter 3 he first revisits the conclusion of chapter 2 If naturalism is true every finite thing or events must be in principle explicable in terms of the total system This is what sam harris was talking about I said Explicable in principle because of course we are not going to demand that naturalist at any given moment should be found should Should have found the detailed explanation of every phenomenon And okay, so this is this is what we're saying. Okay, we're This is why we're saying that this in fact is a system. This is a myth naturalists cannot demonstrate nor would we ask them to demonstrate their um the truth of their position by Demonstrating every single event that is caused by another event Absolutely, they could not possibly begin to do that. Although their position says That that is in fact the case and this first c.s lewis's the title of his book says why there can be no miracles because This is your doctrine. This is your belief system Everything within the world has a cause within the world and it's caused by the whole show the whole system and so There can be no such things as the virgin birth as jesus raising the dead as the resurrection of jesus Or as any of the other miracles that you'll find recorded in antiquity or in any other religions For by naturalism, we mean the doctrine that only nature the whole interlocking system Exists, that's all that exists anything beyond that We can't know about in fact, well, we're getting to the question of whether we can talk about it Because then we're going to get into peterson stuff And if that were true everything every event would if we knew enough be explicable without remainder As a necessary product of the system the whole system being what it is It ought to be a contradiction in terms if you're not reading this book at this moment and conversely the only cause you are The only cause why you are reading it ought to be that the whole system the whole show At such and such a place an hour is bound to make that course and this is why in fact, there's No free will Everything is determined from the moment of the singularity of the big bang Physics and everything has been moving out to necessitate Exactly where we are and all of the ideas that you've had about free will of of preferring um of preferring Reese's peanut butter cups, too I haven't even touched these these these these things and yeah, this is a lot better to eat than this It's all been determined from the big bang. There's no such thing as free will In fact free will is an illusion now you might say yeah, but nobody believes this really 2013 on my blog I started this article caused me to start a page on my blog called delightful article of the month Because when I read this article, I thought i've got to remember this article So about five years ago in the weekly standard this article came out and it was entitled the heretic Contemporary philosophers have a name for the way you and I see the world a world filled with other people with sounds and colors Sights and sensations things that are good things that are bad um And that are very good indeed Ourselves who are able more or less to make our own way through life by our own lights philosophers call this common This common view the manifest image Daniel dennett pointed out at the conference. This was talking about a conference that happened in the berkshires in late 2012. I believe Um pointed out at the conference that modern science at least since the revelation Revelations of darwin have been piling up proofs that the manifest image is not really accurate in any scientific sense Rather science this vast interlocking Combine of genetics neuroscience evolutionary biology particle physics tells us that the components of the manifest image are illusory Color for example that azalea outside the window may look red to you But in reality it has no color at all The red comes from certain properties of the azalea that absorbs some kinds of light and reflect other kinds of light Which are then received by the eye and transformed by our brain into a subjective experience of red And sounds too complex vibrations in the air are Soundless in reality. So if a tree falls in the woods, can anyone hear it? Well, actually a tree makes no sound these are that's a soundless reality, but we have ears to hear so But our ears are able to turn vibrations Into a car alarm or a cat's meow or a tree falling in the woods or worse the voice of mariah carrie Poor mariah carrie These capacities of the human organism are evolutionary adaptations Everything about human beings by definition is an evolutionary Adaptation our sense that the colors and sounds exist out there and not merely in our brain Is a convenient illusion that long ago increased the survival chances of our species And so when we watch rationality rules and he talks about making a sound We we have to buy into Well, what are we exactly are we buying into again? Who's making this statement that all of these things are illusory that there's this manifest image that I think I see Powered by darwin modern science proceeds in denett's phase as a universal Corrosive and this is similar to what sam harris was talking about destroying illusions all the way up and all the way down Dismantling our feelings of freedom and separate selfhood our morals and beliefs a mother's love and a patient's prayer in reality We are all just molecules in motion The most famous most succinct and most pitiless summary of the manifest image fraudulence Was written nearly 20 years ago by the geneticist francis crick You your joys your sorrows your memories your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will Are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules You are who are who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons. This is in fact we are discussing Cs lewis's the whole show now bear in mind cs lewis first wrote this in the 40s updated in the 50s But this has been around actually for a very long time and it keeps getting confirmed by science And so we might ask what exactly is science pushing back? What is more and more crowded on the edge of the beach? Is it religion? Well, let's figure that out This view is the naturalism that the workshoppers and the burkshires were trying to move forward Naturalism is also called materialism the view that only matter exists or reductionism the view that all life from tables to daydreams Is the ultimate is ultimately reproducible to pure physics or determinism the view that every phenomenon including our own actions is determined by A pre-existing cause and these causes go all the way back Which itself is determined by another cause and so back onto the big bang the naturalistic project has been greatly aided by neo-darwinism the application of darwin's theory of natural selection to human behavior Including the areas of life once assumed to be non-material emotions and thoughts habits and perceptions At the workshop the philosophers and scientists each added his own gloss to neo-darwinian reductive naturalism or materialistic neo-darwinian reductionism or naturalistic materialism or reductive determinism They are unanimous in their in their solid certainty that materialism as we call it here to limit the number of isms Is the all-purpose explanation for life as we know it? And this is exactly in fact what c.s Lewis notes again in the 40s and 50s it is clear that everything we know beyond our own immediate sensations is inferred from those sensations So in other words we have this manifest image and in fact what science has been demonstrating since c.s Lewis's time is in fact The whole show seems more and more real We know a lot more about how the brain works and about how we behave and and you know We're now thinking well There's these tiny little microbes in my gut that are really hungry for sugar So, you know when I get weak and and let them talk to me I eat Reese's peanut butter cups because I love them So so Lewis continues I do not mean that we begin as children by regarding our senses as evidence and therefore arguing Consciously to the existence of space matter and other people Lewis and is in this sense talking about naive realism I mean that if after we are old enough to understand the question our confidence in the existence of anything else realism out there Say the solar system or the spanis armada is challenged our argument in defense of it We'll have to take the form of inferences from our immediate sensations. I believe I am sitting in my office I believe this is amusing ourselves to death. I'm getting these as inferences from our immediate sensations Could I have been dreaming? I've had a lot of experience dreaming. I'm pretty doggone. Sure I'm not dreaming at all, but I'm sitting in my office and I'm making this video Is child put to the there are inferences from our immediate sensations Put in its most general form the inference would run since I am presented with colors shapes Pleasures and pains which I cannot perfectly predict or control and since the more I investigate them the more regular these behaviors appear Therefore there must exist something other than myself. I'm not a solipsist and it must be a and it must be systematic This is a realism. There is a real world out there. There is something that exists independent of my desires Independent even of my perceptions when I go to sleep at night when I put my cell phone on the charger I wake up in the morning. It is still on my charger and it is not on my charger anymore. I talk to my wife and my kids Inside the very general inference all sorts of special trains of inference lead us to more detailed conclusions We infer evolution from fossils We infer the existence of our own brains from what we find outside in the skull of others creatures like ourselves in the dissecting room All possible knowledge then depending on the validity of reasoning if the feeling of certainty Which we express by words like must be and therefore and since Is a real perception of how things outside our minds really must be well and good But if the certainty is merely a feeling in our in our own minds And not a genuine insight into the reality behind them. Well, you know Reese's peanut butter cups are so good They must meet good for me if it feels so right It can't be wrong. Is that right debbie boone taught us? And just about everybody else who sings those songs If if this certainty is merely a feeling in our minds and not a genuine insight into reality behind them if it merely Represents the way our minds happen to work then we have no knowledge Unless human reasoning is that unless human reasoning is valid no science can be true So I go to my doctor and my doctor says no, they're bad for you I say I don't believe you But then I look around and I do a sample of everyone who eats these five times a day And everyone who doesn't and eats vegetables and drinks v8 and I discover all the people eating These are keeling over in their 60s. These other people are living to their 90s except for the smokers Hey, I know a little something else It follows that no account of the universe can be true unless that account leaves it possible for our thinking to have real Insight a theory which explains everything in the whole universe But which is what but which made it impossible to believe that our own thinking is valid would be utterly out of court For that theory would itself have been reached by thinking and thinking is not valid That theory would of course be itself demolished It would have destroyed its own credentials It would be argument that prove that no argument is sound a proof that there's no such thing as proofs Which is nonsense. In other words what we're saying here is that this entire Project of science is built on all of this observation and all of this inference and all of this experimentation and if inference Isn't valid well What do we have left? This isn't a new idea to c.s. Lewis Thus a strict materialism refutes itself for the reason long given long ago by professor Haldane if my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms Now i'm going to make this argument a number of times and the reason is because the first time you hear it It doesn't make any sense It's like in luther's words a cow staring at a new gate you keep looking at it and looking at it But if you keep looking at it enough you begin to realize Well, you begin to realize because we believe so much Of what we see and what we infer we are in fact consumed by this And we're going to go back to the berkshire We're going to go back to the berkshires in a few minutes But naturalism even if it's not purely materialistic seems to me to involve the same difficulty Though in somewhat less obvious form it discredits our processes of reasoning or at least reduces their credit To such a humble level that it can no longer support naturalism Itself Let's look at three ideas of knowledge. I feel hungry My dog gives me winning lottery numbers. I make hydrogen and oxygen gases from water Now you would say the first well, that's well, what is I feel hungry? Yeah, that's true Or but but but that's not thinking that's not inference. Is it? Well think about it My dog gives me winning lottery numbers. Well, that just sounds crazy What if I won the lottery and in fact, I believe that my dog gave me that lottery number Well, it wouldn't be crazy either we're going to get to pragmatism I make hydrogen and oxygen gases from water and you would say wow now we're talking knowledge now. We've got something there All right Is naturalism likely? Everything we've learned from science since the 1940s when c.s. Lewis wrote wrote makes naturalism less likely Because our naive intra our naive trust in our senses is more complicated and science itself is telling us This this naive experience this manifest image that we possess is increasingly less likely That's what? denet Dawkins all of these materialist philosophers the people that say rationality rules is is speaking from This is in fact the temple of naturalism And everything we've learned in science makes that case less likely See the problem with science Problems we have problems with science because Of naturalism we have the inference problem if inferences are suspect Science is suspect. We have the truthful observation problem all thought events and they are events and And in fact what neo darwinianism is saying is that my thoughts are events just like the evolution of Finches they're all events. They're just chemical events and they're a little harder to watch and harder to study, but they're events. Nevertheless All thought events including perceptions are products of natural causes the whole show Can they yield truth professor hal dane the early part of the 20th century says that's circular reason You can't use that You have the sociology problem most naturalists must naturalists always be philosophical hypocrites and elitists Back to the story one notable division did arise among the participants However, some of the biologists thought the materialist view of the world should be taught and explained to the wider public in its true Hock high octane cricky in form Then common non-intelligent people might see that Purely random universe without purpose or free will or spiritual life of any kind isn't as bad as some superstitious religious people Have led them to believe in other words, ah religion's bunk But yeah, go ahead and keep imagining you have free will because None of us have it anyway All right Daniel denet took a different view While it is true that materialists yield to tell us that a human being is nothing more than a moist robot A phrase denet took from a dilbert comic we run a risk when we let this cat or robot out of the bag If we repeatedly tell folks that their sense of free will or belief in objective morality is essentially an illusion Such knowledge has the potential to undermine civilization itself then it believes Civil order requires the general acceptance of personal responsibility Which is closely linked to the notion of free will so all those people from this camp who are yelling at peterson Well, then maybe they shouldn't yell at him Maybe you should go out into the masses and say be the hero you have free will your choices make a difference You're not just a moist robot. There's meaning in the universe. There's God maybe We'll get to peterson a little bit later Civil order requires the general acceptance of personal responsibility, which is closely linked to the notion of free will better Said denet if the public were told that for general purposes the self and the free will and objective morality do indeed Exist that colors and sounds exist too. Not just in the way they think they exist in a special way Which is to say ultimately Not at all when everyone's special says dash of the incredibles no one's special On this point the discussion grew testy at times I was reminded of the debate among british censors of the publication of lady chatterdees lover a half century ago Fine for you or me one prosecutor said it said to have remarked But is this the sort of thing you would leave lying about for the wife and servants to read? There was little there was little else to disturb the materialist in that there was little else to disturb the materialist in the birkshire contentment Surveys have shown that the vast majority of philosophers and scientists call themselves naturalists and materialists Nearly all popular science books not only those written by the workshoppers Conclude that materialism offers the true picture of reality the workshoppers seemed vexed Workshoppers seemed vexed. However, knowing that not everyone in their intellectual class had yet tumbled to the truth of neo-darwinianism A video from the workshop showed denett complaining that a few but only a few contemporary philosophers Have stubbornly refused to incorporate the naturalistic conclusions of science into their philosophizing Get in line boys and girls. We're all thinking the same You don't want to be left out Continuing to play around with outmoded ideas like morality and sometimes even the soul You can sympathize this a little bit later You can sympathize with lighter and wiseberg for fledging on materialism as philosophy of everything As a philosophy of everything it is an undeniable drag as a way of life. It gets even worse Fortunately materialism is never translated into life as it is lived As colleagues or friends husbands and mothers wives and fathers sons and daughters Materialists never put their money where their mouth is. Are they elitists like the censors of lady chatters chattertum? Of the of the dishy book or Are they hypocrites? Nobody thinks his daughter is just molecules in motion and no but and and nothing but nobody thinks the holocaust was evil But only in a relative provisional sense a materialist who lived his life according to these professed convictions Understanding himself to have no moral agency at all seeing his friends and enemies and family as genetically determined robots Wouldn't just be a materialist. He'd be a psychopath Say say what you want about lighter and wiseberg and the workshoppers at the berkshires From what I can tell none of them is a psychopath not even close Which leads to the one who must not be named and you might have wondered early on Why was this article called the heretic because this article talks about thomas nagle? Now i'm trying to recall but I do not recall jordan peterson ever mentioning the name of thomas nagle And if you listen to sam harris or daniel denett, you will probably not hear them Say the name of thomas nagle even though thomas nagle is one of the most brilliant foremost He's not a christian. Okay, so i'm playing a game here. We talk about alvin planega if we want to we're going to talk about thomas nagle He doesn't buy the whole thing. He says I will not bow in the temple of naturalism Because it doesn't hold up. You can't be both a scientist and a naturalist Hmm remember peterson saying that in transliminal 2015. I remember him saying that This is from mind and cosmos thomas nagle's book oops, I got it backwards. All right My skepticism is not based on religious belief or on any belief in any definite alternative In other words thomas nagle says I don't have this worked out yet It is just a belief that the Available scientific evidence in spite of the consensus of scientific opinion does not in this matter Rationally require us to subordinate the in the incredulity of common sense. In other words, we don't have enough We don't have enough We can't submit we can't get rid of common sense on this our theory has a problem This is especially true with regard to the origin of life. In other words, this isn't just a pragmatic problem This problem affects our assumptions about how life began The world is an astonishing place and the idea that we have in our possession The basic tools needed to understand it is no more credible now than it was in Aristotle's day That it has produced you and me and the rest of us is the most astonishing thing about it If contemporary research into molecular biology leaves us open leaves open the possibility of legitimate doubts about a fully mechanistic account Of the origin and evolution of life dependent only on the laws of chemistry and physics This can this can combine with the failure of Psychophysical reductionism to suggest that principles of a different kind are also at work in the history of nature principles of the growth of order are in their logical form teleological rather than mechanistic Oh my this is gonna now you can see why Nagel is the heretic why he was not invited to the little getaway at the berkshires Even though he is one of the most important philosophers of our time teaches at nyu He's not some kook out somewhere But you'll never hear about him because he who must not be named don't say thomas nagel don't read his book You will be a heretic Now whose system is dying the death of a thousand cuts because actually after world war one when or before world war one when When sam harris's view is supposed to sweep religion from the world I see no reason why We should imagine the world is getting less religious now Maybe you live in a little secular bubble and that seems to be the way it goes But if you get up high enough and you look at more people of the world the world looks very religious very religious indeed Back to c.s. Lewis, but this it seems to me is what naturalism is bound to do It offers what professes a full account of our mental behavior But this account on inspection leaves no room for the act of knowing We don't really know anything. We're just playing out what started at the big bang There's knowing is an illusion. It's the manifest image free will love. It's all an illusion So says the philosophers the naturalistic philosophers in the berkshires And if it's all an illusion, there's no insight There's no acts of knowing or insight on which the whole value of thinking as it means as mean as a means to truth depends It is indeed in all hands It is indeed on all hands that reason and even sentience and life itself are late comers to nature now. Lewis is saying If the manifest image of true the manifest image is dependent on our brains and on this evolution and on all of this in other words It doesn't precede us. It's a product of us It is all it is agreed on all hands that reason even sentience even life itself are late comers to nature If there is nothing but nature therefore reason must have come into existence by a historical process And of course for the naturalist this process was not designed to produce a mental behavior that can find truth There is no designer and indeed until there were thinkers there was no truth or falsehood The type of mental behavior we now call rational thinking or inference must therefore have evolved Have been evolved by natural selection by the gradual weeding out of types less fit to survive Now this makes rationality rules Extremely ironic for his channel. What realism are you talking about? This is where jordan peterson steps in because jordan peterson steps in in a sense saying something Well, yeah, where is peterson and where is lewis? They have to talk together a little bit because peterson like thomas nagel has doubts And and peterson is saying I think he sees but he doesn't quite put it on the table this materialistic frame world In and of itself as the naturalists say can't yield truth and peterson is not willing to give up on truth And this is where we have the drawing that I used back in some of these other videos you have The naturalists you have the materialists and the newtonians as peterson calls him in here and he says hey story governs stuff We have hierarchies going on we see tools. This is being This is knowing the materials come back and say aha Without a brain, you can't know anything. Well, of course the materialists are going to say that and and now lewis comes and says hey But wait a minute This this entire drawing me making this video. This is just the outworking of the big bang We have no understanding that this in fact is telling us anything truthful and so in a sense, this is where the pragmatists come in and say ah And so if you listen to scott adams, that's we get the moist robot thing from scott adams will say Oh, we we know truth when we can predict Prediction prediction seems to be the key. So the things we can predict then we know truth the problem you're going to have is Uh, how good are you at predicting really? Um somebody that scott adams might say well, I predicted trump would win. Well good for you. Let's keep going Um, you got a lot more predicting to do if you're going to tell us how much you really know Now let's get back to our knowledge. I feel hungry Now we find this to be uninteresting until the doctor tells us to lose weight and might say something well There might be a little sugar There might be little sugar microbes in your gut that really want you to eat this pieces this Reese's peanut butter cup And um, and which thinking do you want to do the little microbes in your gut or the one in your head? And so you say well which thinking is going on because I feel me to want the peanut butter cup Are these the microbes talking to me? We say well I can resist them Whose eye and where does that eye come from? You know The the watchers the the the the youngie and cloud of witnesses inside my noggin My dog gives me winning lottery numbers. I don't have enough time today to go into random I did that in some in the video that anyway, um Here's the thing prediction Let's say I win three lotteries in a row and when I get on tv with my big check they say How did you win three times? My dog tells me Oh, who's crazy now? This is just it with random It doesn't matter if my dog tells me doesn't matter if I sit down and I analyze The lottery numbers from the last 50 years It doesn't matter if I sit there and study that little ping-pong ball machine and say wow The the ones just the the tiny little weight of the 16 on that ball makes it a little lower than the Than the ones with threes and so maybe I can find a pattern and It's random. Well, what is random? Well, we're getting into getting to lewis's story He says well What is nature like? Is it random? I make hydrogen and oxygen gases from water. We call this science because we can demonstrate it Okay, but how much can we demonstrate this way now? I'm not a skeptic And in fact, you know, I am a realist But the question is going to be upon what can we base realism and I don't think it can be based on naturalism This is where pragmatism comes in because pragmatism comes in and says hey We can work this out. Maybe we can't know the whole thing Maybe you know who is it me or is it the Reese's peanut butter the bacteria in my gut wanting me to eat that Reese's peanut Buttercup, which one is is going on it? Well close enough We we don't need to know Truth with a capital t we can know truth enough Now as I talked with Roland, I mean this isn't advanced philosophy at all really and and this isn't new philosophy C.S. Lewis writing in the 40s You know made this point based on philosophers before him. And in fact, as I said Everything we've learned in science makes naturalism and materialism more untenable more unlikely as an explanation for the whole show And and and so then we look at we listen to Jordan Peterson and as as Roland put in his put in his slides You know, what are we talking about? Well Peterson on truth? It's true enough so that if you act it out or hold it that increases your chance of survival and that and reproduction and over long periods of time, it's true and Truth serves life. I really appreciate Roland putting all this stuff down for us Truth is expressed in action and action is made true by its consequences and you get into you get into Peterson's definition of truth which rationality rules really objected to Peterson says hey We can't know truth out there if we say If we prop up our materialism with pragmatism by saying as Scott Adams does you know We I think it's true because we can predict because I can predict getting hydrogen and oxygen doing doing that You know putting electricity through water. Therefore I have truth and you say okay, you got that little truth right there But can you really prove my dog isn't talking to me if I pick three lottery numbers? Because that's pretty unusual You say well that's kind of stuff doesn't happen go back and see who picks lottery numbers and and how how often they win This is funny. Let me get into probability and all of this stuff So then that's why Peterson comes and says well, we can't you know, Peterson's at least honest enough to say The naturalist materialist stuff that really doesn't work So I'm gonna confine myself over here and my pragmatism to true enough and and then he's going to say So what it means that in part that the environment is finally incomprehensible Is he a skeptic? I don't think he's a skeptic because you can't predict it Okay So what that means is that a limited creature that has established itself by darwinian means can't have access to the truth They can only have access to sufficient truth And sufficient truth is the truth that allows you to survive and reproduce and from a darwinian perspective There isn't any truth past that and so the conversation I was having this week was was Jordan Peterson a christian I think let's leave the christian stuff over to the side. Jordan Peterson is Jordan Peterson let's talk about what he really believes and every time he talks about metaphysics and And and materiality meeting up and every time he says, I don't know It's because of his pragmatic epistemology. That's what holds him back. He's reluctant to say beyond that because Darwinian and this is why he says well is the hydrogen bomb true? Well, if the hydrogen bomb leads to our destruction by Jordan Peterson's definition of truth It is not true Just like tiger bombs Okay. Now rationality rule says no, no, no, no, no, no, no it exists out there and Peterson says, ah Prove it You've got your manifest image. You've got your inference. You've got all of these mental processes Your system doesn't work. Well, where does that leave us? Now you might think wow Jordan Peterson. He just really nailed that. This is new. Well actually Pragmatism has been around since before C.S. Lewis a still humbler position remains and so you'll see that Jordan Peterson is more humble than rationality rules You may if you like give up give up all claims of truth Or go down to sufficient truth. You may say simply our way of thinking is useful Our way of thinking is useful without adding even under your breath and therefore true see now Jordan Peterson goes It's extra step and says it's my way of true. It's true in a darwinian sense Not a newtonian sense It enables us to set a bone and build a bridge and make a sputnik And that is good enough The old hyper the old high pretensions of reason must be given up You got to give it up You know reason done It is behavioral It is a behavior evolved entirely as an aid to practice That is why when we use it simply for practice we get along pretty well It's true enough But when we fly off into speculation and try to get general views of reality We end in the endless useless and probably merely verbal disputes of the philosophers and some might say well Isn't that where we are right now? We will be humbler in the future. Goodbye to it all no more theology. No more ontology No more metaphysics But then equally no more no more national naturalism For of course naturalism is a prime specimen of the towering speculation Discovered from practice and going far beyond experience which is now being condemned nature is not an object that can be presented Either to the senses or the imagination it can be reached only by the most remote inferences Or not reached merely approached It is the hoped for assumed unification of a single Interlocked system of all the things inferred from our scientific experiments more than that the naturalist Not content to assert this goes on to sweeping negative assertions. There is nothing except this An assertion surely as remote from practice experience and any conceivable Verification has ever been made since man began to use reason Speculatively yet on the present view the very first step into such was into such a use was an abuse a perversion of the faculty merely practical and the source of all chimeras Naturalists On these terms the theist position must be a chimera Nearly as outrageous as the naturalist nearly not quite it abstains from crowning It abstains from the crowning audacity of a huge negative But the theist need not and does not grant these things He is not committed to the view that reason is a Is a comparatively recent development molded by a process of selection Which can select only the biologically useful for him reason the reason of god Is older than nature? And from the orderliness of nature which alone enables us to follow her Is derived in other words reason comes before nature Math comes before physics boy. There'll be a fun conversation To him the human mind is the act of knowing Is illuminated by divine reason It is set free In measure require in the measure required from the huge nexus of non-rational Causation free from this to be determined by the true note by the truth known And the preliminary processes with within nature which led up to this liberation if there were any were designed to do so So To call the act knowing the act Not of remembering that something was so in the past but of seeing this is what I call the monarchical Vision but of seeing that it must always be so And in any possible world to call this act Supernatural is some violence to our ordinary linguistic usage But of course we do not mean by this that it is spooky or sensational or even in any religious sense Spiritual we mean only that it won't fit in That's such an act to be what it claims to be and if it is not all our thinking is discredited Cannot be merely the exhibition of a particular place and time of that total and largely largely mindless system of events Called nature it must break sufficiently free from that universal chain in order to be determined By what it knows now in other words The picture of the elephant and the blind man. This is the monarchical vision stands outside of time Stands outside of possible worlds. This is this vision of Nature that we do when we reason that is we do when we do science Weinstein's argument What makes the scientific truth hierarchically superior is that it explains all the subordinate truths in a way that is logically consistent The only problem is That's a good statement But it's wrong about science You can only see science if you can see nature and you can't see nature from within it You can't see science in nature unless you have reason and inference And where are you getting these froms? Are they the product of nature then you're within it? In other words if you're within nature You can't see nature and you can't have science. It's nested. It's hierarchy And what you have to do is come above it. Naturalism can't afford this Your brain science can't be afforded C.S. Lewis Is theology poetry if minds are wholly dependent on brains and brains on biochemistry and biochemistry In the long run on the meaningless flux of atoms I cannot understand how the thought of those minds should have any more significance than the sound of the wind in the trees Or the sound of the tree falling where no one is to hear it And this is to me the final test. This is how I distinguish dreaming from waking when I am awake I can in some degree account for my study the study of my dream The dragon that pursued me last night can fit into my waking world I know that there are such things as dreams. I know that I am that that I had eaten an indigestible dinner I know that the man that a man of my reading might be expected to dream of dragons But while in the nightmare, I could not have fitted in my waking experience The waking world is judged more real because it can thus contain the dreaming world The dreaming world is judged less real because it cannot contain the waking one for the same reason I am certain not I am certain For the same reason I am certain um Oh, there we go that it that in passing from the scientific point of view to the theological I have passed from dreaming to waking and this is why peterson keeps talking about Theological when it gets to this point in the conversation because we're using theological language now Christian theology can fit in science art morality and the sub-christian religions The scientific point of view cannot fit in any of these things Not even science itself. I believe in christianity as I believe in the sun Sun I believe that the sun has risen not only because I see it but because I see Everything but because by it I see everything else back to miracles It is of some importance here to make sure That if vaguely spatial imaginary imaginary intrudes and in many minds, it certainly will it should not be of the wrong kind We had better not envision our acts of reason as something above or behind or beyond nature Rather this side of nature in other words When we do our monarchical vision of science It's still our vision It's on this side of nature it's it's not really above it because we keep getting it wrong It is by inference that we build up the idea of nature at all reason is given before nature and on reason our Our concept of nature depends our acts of inference are prior to our picture of nature Almost as the telephone is prior to the friend's voice that we hear by it When we try to fit these acts into the picture of nature we fail The item which we put into that picture and label reason Always turns out to be something different from the reason we ourselves are enjoying and exercising while we put it in The description we have to give of thought as an evolutionary phenomenon always makes a tacit exception In favor of thinking which we ourselves perform at that moment in other words This is the this is the exception that you know all y'all believe in religion or not religion because how you're raised me I see clearly and i've decided for myself. Oh you've decided we'll talk to the folks in the berkshires I can decide everyone else is a moist robot For the one can for the one can only like any particular feat Exhibit at a particular moments in particular consciousness the general and for the and for the most part Non-rational working of the whole interlock system the other our present act claims and must claim to be the act of insight A knowledge sufficiently free from our non-rational causation to be determined positively only by the truth It knows this is how we might actually know truth But in the imagined thinking which we put into the picture depends because our whole idea of truth of nature depends On the thinking we are actually doing not vice versa This is the prime reality on which the attribution of reality is any to anything else rests If it won't fit into nature, we can't help it We will certainly not on that account give it up If we do we should be giving up nature too In other words, this is the reason all those guys left the berkshires and loved their wives and cared about their children And and did their best to stay awake as they drove or or went on airplanes So that's chapter three Let me know what you think i'm out of time
