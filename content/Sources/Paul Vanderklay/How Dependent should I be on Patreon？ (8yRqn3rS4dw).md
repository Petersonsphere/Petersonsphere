 Hi, this is Paul while I was getting back from my vacation I noticed that this patreon business Kind of blew up and part of what I've been doing with YouTube is just kind of following along What other people have done and learning from them Jordan some people ask why don't monetize my channel Well, I kind of listened to what Jordan Peterson didn't followed him. I don't monetize my channel and My channel's little and so I don't I don't have a problem with that but I but I did get into patreon and I was reluctant when I did so and So I've been that's been growing for me which for which I'm very grateful, but it's also been giving me new ideas So I watched the David the David Fuller Benjamin Boyce conversation about patreon and I noticed that rebel wisdom added Subscribed star as another option for supporting them beyond patreon and I've been doing a lot of thinking ahead How can I facilitate conversations for people and I was kind of making some mental plans? I haven't implemented anything with respect to patreon but now I'm less hesitant to do so I was gonna set up tiers and have more things available and Facilitate more education and conversation But now I don't know if I necessarily want to use patreon as my platform for that My real goal is you know, how can I facilitate conversation for people? How can I encourage Christian spiritual formation for those struggling to find a church home? One of the things I've I appreciate how difficult finding a church home is for people and I'm not trying to I'm not trying to offer something as a substitute for a local congregation but I'm trying to at least support those who aren't ready to take their that step into a local church or are struggling to find a Local church and and how can I do so in a way that is a win-win both for my career and for Livingstone CRC going forward and so I've been thinking increasingly about patreon and and the possibilities that there could be and along comes this This blow up where I had some some supporters Deleted their subscriptions on patreon and I don't know whether they did so because they just were just done supporting me Which is fine Or if they don't want to also support patreon by supporting me which I think is a very reasonable conclusion to come to and So then the problems with patreon developed if you want to stick with their mission You know if you want patreon just you want I want you want patreon to stick with their mission rather than becoming an editor Of content. I don't want visa or MasterCard deciding what I buy and I don't want patreon deciding You know who's who's obviously they need community standards. Obviously they have terms of service but to De-platform people You know, I'm I don't want any drama from a service like patreon If their fee is reasonable in terms of maintaining the institution I understand that they get a little a little cut of everything that you support me through patreon but if you support me through patreon you're in a sense supporting patreon and and once patreon develops and Identity that's beyond its mission now suddenly they're a player in it and I can appreciate the The trouble that people are having with it. So this has made me think that I need to do some rethinking I need a more independent platform for my goals and it makes me nervous to be locked into one vendor and So questions for you that you can leave in the comments What are other vendors besides patreon that you like? Really look much into subscriber star if they're the best option or if there are other good options out there Some people have already written me about some ideas that they have Are there other ways to facilitate community that I haven't thought of so go ahead and leave a comment and let me know your thoughts
