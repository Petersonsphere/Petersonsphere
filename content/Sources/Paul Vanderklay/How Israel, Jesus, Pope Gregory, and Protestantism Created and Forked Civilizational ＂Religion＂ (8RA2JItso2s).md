 Hi, this is Paul. I want to follow up on my video about common personal religion. I actually renamed it this morning I don't like renaming videos or re-thumbnailing them once I publish them but because of the pace at which I put out videos and the Just the pace of my life sometimes after a night's sleep after a little bit of thinking about it. I think Okay, well maybe maybe maybe this is a maybe this is a better title for it than the other thing so the video I released today today is the 23rd of January is about common religion because okay, we want to talk about Islam we want to talk about religion we want to talk about all these things and And Getting a handle on what on earth we mean by this word and the history of the word as we use it is pretty important and this also gets into the topic of Civilizational religion, which is what I started with Jonathan Peugeot Jordan retweeted my conversation with Jonathan That never produces what people think they produce a two million a two million follower Twitter account might produce Maybe a thousand new hits on a video something like that depending on the video So it's it's never it's never what you think Since the since the world impact of secularity religion in quotation marks has become a thing of individuals now this is Even even in that sentence a whole range of That's that's completely a modern Western even in some senses a Protestant Realization and definition and The rest of this video impacts that This is another tell of the powerful formative influence of Christianity on Secularity in many ways secular humanism is a sort of Christianity light and even Protestantism light Now with this is part of the reason that I'm delving into Islam The Ark Conference post-modernity the urban monoculture the recession of modernity We all brought this question to this this this is the question that's at the surface of so many things right now So many well at the surface of this is the question that is roiling politics religion war I in many ways this struggle is churning beneath our culture and our world It is in some ways beneath the part of what's beneath the Ukraine Russian war It's definitely beneath many of the struggles in the Middle East. It's definitely beneath the de-churching and the What's happening culturally in North America and in Europe with respect to religion and there's a history to this and I want to give sort of the broadest quickest walkthrough of this history Orthodox and Catholics have a history with these issues and part of the Re-emergence or part of the emergence of orthodoxy in America is about this Part of the Christian nationalism conversation is about this The Protestant Reformation sort of punts with the piece of Augsburg. Okay, let the let the leader of the state decide the religion in some ways that's a very ancient way of resolving the challenge of religious pluralism the invasion of European democracies by immigrants from the Middle East to our Muslim is renewing and and in many ways in flaming the conversation because all of this talk that I've been doing in previous videos as to whether or not Muslims can live in the Advanced Christendom, let's say post Christendom Has everything to do with this and even the very interesting little question of the modern state of Israel Every time I talk to Hezzi and many of us are Israeli friends This is what dominates my imagination We the the assumption that was supposed to be the end of history Did not prove to be the end of history and so that's why all of this is Super salient. So let's go back in time Let's go all the way back to Hammurabi his style the code polyistic patrons of the Kings That's what the gods were these gods within the Medi-divine realm They were the patrons of the Kings and so when empires or kingdoms fought They were the empires and kingdoms on earth were proxies of the gods And so when Israel lost everyone assumed that her God was second-rate now Obviously the Hebrew prophets sort of undermine this and we'll talk a little bit about revolutionary monotheism versus evolutionary monotheism but the status quo in the ancient polytheistic world and now we could be returning to something like that is Kings were portals of the gods and and Kings had a had a had a divine patron or a series of divine patrons and and Therefore the empires which were sort of personifications of Kings and emperors also had divine patrons and so the god so Romulus and Remus Were well They were under the god of war Rome is deep into this. Okay, even though there's quite a bit of flexibility and Transaction going on you just look at the Greek city-states. They're you know, Athens Athena There they have divine patrons now There are other gods that are in play but there's a patron god for the city and and this of course is part of what? provokes the reaction to Christianity when well the Jews they were they were they were a Minority and they were sometimes tolerated and because of their Deal with Julius Caesar the the Jews could sort of get out of having to pay homage to the divine Caesar but the Christians had no such pass and that's part of what sets up so much of the and so much of the animosity between Christians in the Roman Empire until Constantine Kingdoms and empires were vehicles by which the gods expressed their dominion over the earth individuals families clans tribes vassal states could relate to gods within these structures hierarchies developed but again, you know, Athena is the patron of Athens Accumulation and absorption of gods and evolutionary monotheism. This is sort of the direction that Jordan Peterson goes I think that's a reality to a degree, but I don't think that's the best way to understand the Bible Ezekiel Kaufman Christine Hayes those videos that I've spoken about for years you have revolutionary monotheism and and basically Israel sees her God as Her God is an alternative to this meta divine realm I played in that little clip Tom Holland noticing that you know the the there's this tension with Roman and Greek gods that they're Well, they're under the fates. Well, then what are the fates are the fates gods? Is it a meta divine realm? They didn't have that term Of course, these ego Kaufman comes up with that term, but you have all of this tension going on So of course for the Hebrews you have one God over creation now the degree to which this developed I mean, that's all that's a huge conversation with respect to the Bible and biblical history henotheism monolatry monolatry, etc, etc You can see this in the book of Daniel for example The book of Dan you have these monsters the empires they're raging across the earth and then in Daniel 7 the ancient of days sets up Thrones stills the beasts and then a son of man comes with the clouds of heaven to And to receive an eternal empire that that that that the son of man rules now obviously Christians see Jesus when he takes on the son of man term as part of that narrative others see other messianic Others see other messianic figures in terms of that We're going to talk about Messiah ship in this those of you who follow my rough draft for Sunday Well, I have a pretty clear idea about what I think about that now Let's talk about civilizational Judaism and Torah. So here's Charlton Heston 1950s a previous a previous iteration of Hollywood which very much had Civilizational Christianity which in the middle of the 20th century tried to bring in the Catholics and the Jews This is some of what happens in the middle of 20th century as the United States goes from being a predominantly Protestant nation attempting to be a Judeo-Christian nation, of course along the way you come into a certain degree of multiculturalism So if you read the Torah the Pentateuch the first five books of the Bible, it's clearly a civilizational blueprint for Within the narrative the children of the the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and you know there's all the symbolism and the archetypal stuff and it's it's this whole civilizational blueprint that's set up with specific laws to govern The people of Israel it's set up as a covenant so you can you can sort of see the relationship with something like Hammurabi and biblical scholars have been noting these both similarities and differences between The the system of the Hebrews and the Israelites as compared to some of the surrounding nations So the Mosaic Code is given to govern what today we would look at as a kingdom the Lord is the is the patron of the king of Israel and The king of Israel is the vassal. He's he's in a covenant relationship He is told to love up because the the under party loves up to the dominant party And so you have the suzerain vassal covenants and covenantal theology has gotten into this stuff for for years The Lord as the king of the world Israel's king is governing below and and there's always sort of an implicit Imagination that there's there will be a messianic king someone who will govern the world beneath the king of the world and so that universalism is set up within the Old Testament vision of You know how the world should be that the Lord will be in heaven his king will be on earth and under that king the whole earth will be his dominion and it will be ruled in that very ancient way of the The of the God the king and then the whole world under that empire now this this doesn't come to be David rules a a Significant little kingdom right there in the middle of the world while both Egypt and the Mesopotamian powers are Weak, but the Hebrew prophets are then gonna have to wrestle with these things So of course when the temple is destroyed There needs to be a new story a new theology that takes that into consideration of course the Lord shows up to Ezekiel outside of Babylon and and so you have a reworking of the story so that the The destruction of the temple is part of this far larger picture But again as you see in the book of Daniel the picture is in that sense maintained that the the gods the gods Son of man will rule over the entire earth and of course Jesus sort of steps into this But we'll get to Christianity in a minute Laws come from God laws are updated and interpreted by teachers of the law by rabbis You see a lot of the tussling between Jesus and some of these parties While they're under Roman domination and of course under Roman domination The idea is well We've got to break free because our rightful place is at the top of the hierarchy Our rightful place is at the pinnacle of the world and from there We will rule over all of the world now of course there are many many many different variations subtle Variations of this and as religious traditions develop and deal with the real politic of the world there will be all sorts of coping and strategies and Justifications and exceptions and different formulas for this, but this is the base narrative and and this is sort of Civilizational religion and so this is civilizational Judaism and Torah and you can see how it's similar to the the religion around Israel, but yet it's different and So there you have awaiting the fulfillment and the Messiah so you can go back on how many of my very interesting and enlightening Conversations with Jacob for example who you know where they're waiting for a Messiah and so when they look at Jesus well Jesus is not the kind of Messiah they are looking for because Jesus gets crucified now Again I am just sort of wading slowly into this The case of Islam, but in many ways Islam continues this Ancient Narrative that that that Israel sort of Continues and sort of modifies because instead of being a meta divine realm and all of these different Patron gods you have one God over the earth and so there should be one King over the earth or one emperor over the earth and well that actually sort of plays out in Islam with respect to the Caliphate now again I have a view of the of the of the pluralism under Christianity with respect to these topics I have a little bit of inclination with respect to Judaism and these topics But in Islam, I'm I'm sure that it is just as complex the conversations are just as complex with respect to this But from what I can see and what tends to emerge again and again is well the Caliphate Well, what is the Caliphate the Caliphate is an institution or power public office under the instrument of an Islamic steward with the title of Caliph a Person considered a political religious successor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a leader of the entire Muslim world Historically the caliphates were polities based on Islam which developed into multi-ethnic transnational empires So you can see this older version of Empire Manifesting and forming during the medieval periods three major caliphate succeeded each other the Rashidun Caliphate 660 632 to 661 the Umayyad Caliphate 661 to 750 the Abbasid Caliphate 750 to 1258 and the fourth major Caliphate the Ottoman Caliphate the rulers of the Ottoman Empire claimed the caliphate authority from 1517 until the Caliphate was abolished as part of the 1924 secularization of Turkey that in many ways sort of shows the the collapse and the Conquest of Islam and this this obviously has not been lost. But now once you have This gets into okay God number one and God number two When Islam is defeated in the First World War and the caliphate is Abolished How do you read that well, it's the will of God, okay, well you have these issues again and again through history Read the book of Jeremiah God will never allow he's the God of all the earth He will never allow his temple to be destroyed and humiliated by the likes of the Babylonians. It happens How do you have to deal with this? Well, you cope well you you have a new story That says well God is not bound to the temple in this way and you can see the religion of Israel Change and modify and you have synagogues and it gets spiritualized in a sense. It gets immaterial in a sense The same struggle over the crucifixion of Jesus is the same. This is the same issue Well, Jesus is supposed to be this eternal this eternal son of man who is there to rule and he gets crucified Therefore he absolutely cannot be that because he lost but he rose from the dead He ascended to heaven you see in the Christian story all of this is contained so that Jesus continues to rule over the world right now but now you sort of have a Conflict between kingdoms so you have the kingdom below and you have the kingdom above on earth as it is in heaven You have all of these tensions Well Islam has the same thing when Islam conquers much of Christendom at least in the east Islam says well, you know if you make the argument I've had Christians tell me to lighten up on the Tom Holland thing because well if you say Jesus conquered Rome and Rome gets switched to Continue. Oh, well, you're just sort of leading into the Islamic argument that well Islam is the successor to Christianity and Just as Jews don't think Christians have it white right with respect to Jesus Muslims think Christians don't have it right with respect to Jesus and so Well, clearly Islam won but then Islam lost in the first world war and You have the destruction of the Caliphate. So that one video that I played with Tom Holland talking about Reformation and Islam that was all during Isis because Isis said we're going to resurrect a Caliphate and and so what you see in The the world of Islam is all of this tension Will a ruler emerge now many Islamic countries are ruled by strong men and of course Saddam Hussein wanted to sort of Present himself as a neo-nebukit Nezir, of course until he wasn't so In a certain degree with with the with all of these religions what finally happens down below is revelation of what is true above Okay, that's Understanding that dynamic is super important. That's very much God number one and God number two So you have these Caliphates Throughout the history of Islam a few other Muslim states also almost all hereditary monarchies such as the Maluk Sultanate and Cairo the Ayyubid Caliphate have claimed to be Caliphates not all Muslim slates states have had Caliphates the Sunni branch of Islam stipulates that as a head of a state a Caliph should be elected by Muslims or their representatives Shiites however believe a Caliphate should be an imam chosen by God from the Al-Abyt the house of the prophets in the early 21st century Following the failure of the Islamic Spring and related protests Some have argued for a return to the concept of a Caliphate to better unify Muslims So now what you can see there in sort of the Sunni and the Shi'a branches are this is this is what I say There's a menu of options when something happens and the interpretations Tend to follow along certain lines. And so when I watched that video from eight years ago of Debate whether Islam needs a reformation and I agree with many of you who put in the comments I think it's terrible language. I don't think it's great language. I think Karl who's who's been both hot and cold on this channel Karl says needs an enlightenment. I think that's a more honest thing of what many in secular Europe and the secular West say Islam needs they need to go through the Enlightenment and But you have to understand that there's this other conversation where Christians are saying, you know the Enlightenment is the fruit of Christianity and Of course some now with with with orthodoxy and say no the Enlightenment is a heresy of Christianity It must be undone all of these tensions over the Enlightenment all these tensions over modernity but To say that he's Islam needs an Enlightenment is in that sense sort of like saying Islam needs a reformation basically Islam needs to be further Christianized because Christianity is seeping into Islam through the internet and Just like with the modernist fundamentalist fight in Christianity the fundamentalist becomes sort of the the bizarro it's it's Girardian mimetic rivalry where modernists and fundamentalists are sort of Mirror opposites of each other now all of this fight over Islam again when you look at when you listen to the People are selecting things on the menu and it's a fairly limited menu you find that well look at this The more they try to fight against modernity in this sense the more modern they become this is an old story This is very much what happened to the Roman Catholic Church in the Protestant Reformation The more they tried to fight against the Protestant Reformation the more Protestant they became This goes all the way through to Vatican II in a sense one way to understand Vatican II is the more they try to Respond to the modern world the more they become like the modern world and that's the that's the reactionaries dilemma That if you're fundamentally Reactionary you are just going to become the mere opposite of that from which you are reacting Because the thing that you are reacting against is setting the menu of the issues and again back to What is that the key to this little corner? combinatorial explosiveness selection is a big part of ontology so a Lot of that's what's been happening so what we've seen is that well in many ways the roots of Islam are a Continuation of the very old story incorporating revolutionary monotheism and then all of this now Christianity Christianity has that code in its DNA But Jesus does something different that I believe sets up Secularity Christianity is a radical changing of the messianic script right from the Gospels forward Can a Messiah be crucified can a temple be destroyed now? This is in a sense a spiritual ization Jesus ascends on high and reigns, but his followers are always sort of left to figure out well What is the will of God well God number one the will of God is what happens God number two everything that happens isn't exactly What God wills now this isn't just Jesus that sets this up this goes all the way back to the destruction of the temple This goes all the way back to the fact that Israel never ruled the earth Rome ruled the earth Persia ruled the earth Greeks ruled the earth Egyptians ruled the earth Babylonians ruled the earth Communism wanted to rule the earth all of these you hear Tom Holland talk again about universals all of these Universalizing movements well it's all coming from the same place, and it's all coming from It's all coming from the revolutionary monotheism What does the ascension of Jesus mean it means he Jesus is Lord not Caesar is Lord Jesus is Lord Caesar was ruling over the earth No, Jesus is ruling over Caesar How does Jesus reign well through the Holy Spirit? What is the what is the perfect will of God and what is the will of God the best that we can just listen to? Evangelicals just go through these will of God Conversations I listen to Muslims and I listen to I listen to other groups going through them And it's like they're hitting they're hitting all of the points on the menu how should Christians relate to the pagan Emperor and now this is in many ways where the Apostle Paul comes in and Paul and Peter say submit to the Emperor Because God number one ish the Emperor is appointed by God and people would say why would God? Appoint such an Emperor this goes all the way back to the book of Daniel Well nebuchadnezzar the guy who destroyed the temple well one way to deal with The loss is that well your God God was over God appointed nebuchadnezzar to destroy the temple That's how to deal with that narrative the destruction of the temple within the context of King patron situation well God appointed nebuchadnezzar to destroy the temple therefore get nebuchadnezzar via God number one is God's King So then Daniel serves that king but then God pushes nebuchadnezzar out pushes Belshazzar out and in comes the Persian and Cyrus is He who's he's the servant of the Lord well of course he's the servant of the Lord because is the Emperor of the world and Cyrus then has the temple rebuilt so you just watch these narrative blocks fall The end of book of Revelation of course Jesus returns and conquers The story is closed Okay, Jesus is the King of Kings, but how is he King of Kings? And so right there you can see the stress lines in these narratives between Jews my friend Jacob says Yeah, it's not the kind of Messiah we're looking for you have your Messiah ship wrong and You can go back to conversations that Jacob and I have had a couple years ago, and that's exactly where we wind up He says you have your Messiah ship wrong. I said well. This is this is where we differ Jacob We differ in Messiah ship, and this is everything to do with these civilizational religions Christianity Jesus the Gospels Paul changes the narrative on this and Does so in many ways sort of following the Hebrew prophets, that's what Christians say And of course along comes Constantine and its kingdom come just just read Read Eusebius You know for Eusebius Constantine is sort of he's not nobody's gonna put Constantine up there with Christ but Constantine is kingdom come the kingdom finally comes and so that's where you get palaces and Crowns and all of the and robes and all of this Constantine is kingdom come and Notice how this how? Protestants tend to have a negative view of Constantine well Orthodox and Catholics tend to have a positive view of Constantine, but these tensions are within Christianity and We're still dealing with these tensions today because these tensions are built into all of the conversations about Christian nationalism Built into all of this stuff. It's the reintroduction of a system of divine pace patronage So if you look at some of the scholarship around Constantine well Soul Victus so so what what exactly is Constantine's God because you can listen to Tom Holland talk about at this period You have the all of these emperors moving in and moving out of power They're all looking for a divine patron that can hold the count hold the Empire together and when Constantine basically has a vision and Under the banner of Christ conquers well suddenly it works so God number one and God number two come together under Constantine and Well here it is now of course the details You know read David Potter's Constantine the Empire the details are really complex Was Constantine a Christian was he an Aryan Christian and so what are the motivations of Constantine? Well is are his motivations fundamentally religious or political? Well, of course that assumes something that develops Has been developing but really crystallizes far later where you have a separation of the two realms For Constantine there really one wrong. He's looking for a God That will cement his power and his dynasty now that sounds very mercenary You can flip it on its head and say he's looking to align himself with the reality of the cosmos Because the kingdom that aligns itself with the reality of the cosmos best Will reign You can hear Richard Dawkins say almost exactly the same thing You can hear that under the Alex O'Connor Richard Dawkins conversation Can't you because Richard Dawkins basically says well science gives us truth And so those who do science properly will inherit the earth. Okay. Well, this is kind of a Rearticulation of the motivation of Constantine because get heaven right it's the rearticulation of Socrates of Plato of Almost everyone in very much a god number one world We're god number one and god number two god number one might be the meta divine realm god number two might be your patron god But you want an entire system that is coherent Now again, generally speaking people like an immaterial system That's what we get in science because it with it with an immaterial system I as a person have a chance of reigning and almost all of sort of the Look at Avatar look at many of the New Age films sort of have an Immaterial have the reification of the meta divine realm and so but here's the thing about people The personal wields the impersonal it happens all the time now the personal and the impersonal are always in a struggle But the personal has will If you're gonna be fair about the impersonal it has no well it plays no favorites It just is and so once the personal a la commentatorial explosiveness Can begin to look at and select within the combination of things well now You have power you know where to put your troops. You know the ideas to settle on you know where to make your investments You know which scientific paradigms Thomas Kuhn the history of scientific revolutions, you know, which scientific paradigms to back You know which country to immigrate to your choice is your power And now we're knocking on the door the free will question So you have the reintroduction of the system of divine patronage, but now it's at the heart of Christianity Look at the Christian look to the Christian God as your patron Well, if he's the true God then you'll win and he does win rule below in the mode of in Hebrew King Messiah And in some ways Constantine is the when so when you see B is sees Constantine as kingdom come well it It makes sense to you see B is because this is how that whole narrative has been developing Jesus revolution and messianism Gets a whole new layer of complexity because well Well, well who? Who really is ruling and so Constantine wants to listen to the priests? That's the role that the priests paid played in the old system But but what to do with bishops? And what to do with the bishop of Rome? because if You'll have to listen if you're dependent on the bishop of Rome for what's coming from the divine Now you can see these tensions even in the old divine patronage systems but they really come into play in Constantine now you have Rome and then you have Constantinople and Constantinople Basically replaces Rome in the eyes of many as the as as the place of the place of the coming of the kingdom of God upon the earth and and even with the Orthodox when you listen carefully to them you can sort of smell that narrative Through what they say and do now of course the difficulty is Islam Because well the Agia Sophia was first a church and then a mosque and then a museum And then a mosque again. It's like Okay, so when the Muslims say well, it's clear that Because if Constantinople is the center of the kingdom of heaven We own it Islamabad Istanbul we're gonna rename we're gonna reacquire all of these buildings and Set them in the proper order, which is the divine patronage model Except we don't have a caliphate because the European you can see why things are a mess. Nobody's got a clean narrative Tom Holland's book that is too ignored Millennium which is some is which is in some ways Dominion before there was Dominion where he begins to walk through this question of the Pope and the creation of the secular now with Pope Gregory and Henry well One of the things that the Pope sort of does is Within the imagination of the divine patronage model continues But what and Tom Holland I think is very right on this and it's a genius insight When Gregory makes the move he makes He carves out the seculum now these tensions are within Christianity already and so when Tom Holland writes Dominion, he goes all the way back to the Hebrew prophets rightly so Because when the temple is destroyed The divine patronage model for Israel breaks down How are you gonna deal with it well if revolutionary monotheism that says God is in heaven God is pulling the strings on Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus and Caesar and and and and Putin and name any dictator you want it's all within God's plan Now of course when the second Millennium came rolling around We had sort of been through this before and that's that's some kind of the beauty of Tom Holland's book Millennium where he deals with this now of course The Eastern Rome was still in power They called themselves Romans the Western Rome was very much in play and so the Eastern Rome is like no here's the kingdom and But then of course comes Charlemagne and Now you have an emperor crowned by the Pope who sits in Peter's see You can see why these two churches move away from each other They've got competing claims in some ways to God number one in the Latin West the compromise between church and State creates the secular realm a split heaven and earth in terms of administration now again. This isn't new You look at Jesus look at my sermons on the Gospel of Mark Jesus is attacking a status quo kingdom and nobody likes it, but Jesus is overthrowing Satan and what he's doing and That of course gets into the Christian narrative You have an ongoing discussion for memorandum of understanding between the two and in some ways that's sort of what happens With the seculums and the eternal is the Emperor King Messiah caliphate the mediator between heaven and earth or is the church? Now and not yet. I'm sure you have those tensions in Islam as well because You know, there've been some long stretches where you had a fairly stable caliphate But isn't it interesting that? Kingdom come was sort of located in the same place both for the Eastern Orthodox and the and the Muslims But of course in the West in the Latin West Kingdom come was in Rome Until it wasn't and in some ways the Protestants spiritualized it to an even higher realm Now dualism is abound in here Physical spiritual do its physical spiritual substance they cart heaven and earth secular and eternal now and not yet Science and religion natural and supernatural So you have all of those dualisms then you have competing stresses to bring them together Jesus is Lord on earth as it is in heaven the will of God one will of God, you know I've seen some of these Muslim, you know debating the Trinity and so, you know some of this gets sort of pushed into the questions about the Trinity and And Again, people are like well, why Tom Holland? Why so much Tom Holland? Well, you give me all this grief about Jordan Peterson um a lot of Tom Holland too Because Tom more than anyone else has really followed these threads Well, maybe you're just getting them from threads from Tom Holland. Maybe Tom Holland has colonized you well, the way arguments work is that you lay out the information and you make an argument based on the data and I don't think I would have come to Tom Holland if in fact I hadn't been Doing all of this work in the Bible and in ministry and thinking about politics and religion for a very long time on my own And then when Tom Holland comes along it's like oh Yeah, yeah, could I be wrong? Absolutely But I think I think Tom's narrative is is quite right And now some will sort of knock Tom by saying well, he's not an academic well, okay, but Part of the difficulty of academics is that they're tied down to one. They have to live in their silos part of the Part of the benefit of a popularizer is you have to pull things together And so part of what I think Tom Holland and Jordan Peterson have in common even though they're very different people Are they're both synthesizers? They're both trying to pull broad areas of knowledge together into one package and you say well Well, that can't be done. Yeah, but we're all doing it every time we choose Every time we act every time we speak We're speaking out of our synthesis. We all have them So you have the modernity and secularity sorted out this invention of religion? Religion was a way to categorize all of this secularity success within modernity offered the world a two-state solution to the problem of heaven and earth Atheism tried to address the conflict by banishing religion Mostly not working as he usually does so well on Twitter He's got all of my memes and one thread that he continues to put together. I know who he is, but he stays anonymous Here you have this meme of new atheism basically giving the giving religion the heave-ho out the door between 20 2004 and 2024 thinking up got that taken care of and now he looks behind him and religion is right behind him again Mostly not working terrific meme That's where Jordan Peterson and the ARC conference come together because The heart of what Jordan Peterson has been doing is saying not only is it religion? But it's Christianity in the Bible that is under the West and you can't understand the West without Christianity Bible and you can't Enjoy the fruits of it without Christianity in the Bible all of these all of these roots go back to the Bible which is a very Protestant move, but Jordan in many ways has is deeply it's a deeply Protestant Influence but you know, he's he's always sort of working on Protestant Catholic Orthodox some of these these questions Religion can't be banished because it's actually beneath all the systems We use to make sense of the world you lose the fruits of the West if you lose Christianity in the Bible the West must be revived and that requires institutions even the church Well, the Holy Spirit inhabit the masses because just it's very interesting to look at that note with the Caliphate Democracy, oh that doesn't when you look at God number one and God number two in some ways the entire Roman Catholic Councils are popes It's sort of councils are God number one Popes are God number two, you know, all of those tensions are built in at a very deep level into religions that all come from this root of The Torah and of the Hebrews I Found one thing I gotta keep my on the time I'm always trying to balance both my day job and my YouTube job, which there's a degree that they blur together, but Often I'll have you know, I'll short I always have to short somebody so this week I'm shorting the youtubers or the YouTube audience because I'm trying to catch up and all my in my in real life appointments and lunches and relationships so but I want to go I want to show you a video that I'll go just fed up to me and Yeah, it seems very on point Okay this lecture given one month ago by DC Schindler someone very much Corner adjacent if not all the hall if not in the corner depending on what corner of the corner your your focus is on America's theological political problem what he does in the first part here is sort of lay out Exactly what I've laid out here The title of my paper is America is a theological Political problem and I will explain what that means as we proceed The contemporary political philosopher Pierre Manet begins his celebrated 1987 book an intellectual history of liberalism With a chapter entitled entitled Europe and the theological political problem Therein one finds a striking passage right near the beginning of the book. He says quote Organizing men's social and political life is not the church's raison d'etre But by its very existence and distinctive vocation it posed an immense political problem to the European peoples This point must be stressed the political development of Europe is Understandable only as the history of answers to problems posed by the church Which was a human association of a completely new kind The key to European development is what might be called in scholarly terms the theological political problem and quote According to man then the essence of the problem The problem that he claims the Catholic Church posed to Europe is the following on the one hand The church is not a political entity The purpose of which if it were a political entity The purpose of which if it were a political entity would be to organize human existence in the world But instead the church is concerned essentially with with the life to come the eschaton Which lies beyond the horizon of this world? on the other hand Manet continues Because what we do in this world Cannot help but bear on what happens to us in the hereafter to put it sort of simply The church has a tendency to get involved in human affairs and thus constantly to encroach On the political sphere so in other words. He says this is now. This is my nance position while the church is by definition Unconcerned with politics because it's the kingdom is not of this world Nevertheless it inevitably does get involved in politics, and that's a problem. That's a that's for man and contradiction a problem Manet goes so far as to call this dilemma, and this is a quote from him a contradiction embedded in the church's doctrine End quote these words suggest that the problem is not accidental Instead the problem is essential To catholicism and again. I'm laying out manence position here what we have here in other words Is not just a worrisome tendency for the church to overstep the bounds she sets for herself and thus to betray her doctrine But rather a drive to follow her doctrine and precisely for that reason to run into contradiction with herself Manet does not say exactly what doctrine he has in mind in making this claim Beyond the somewhat vague description of the church's aim to be both otherworldly and this worldly But one suspects at the core is the extraordinary paradox of the incarnation Because you might say a kind of transgression of theology into the domain of human nature Would seem to be necessarily implied in this central Christian mystery without ceasing to be God the second person of the Trinity became man, and he is fully and uncompromisingly the one while also being fully and uncompromisingly the other so We'll come back to this point later on The incarnation but for now I suddenly want to note that Manet seems to take this doctrine Or at least its implication To be a problem that threatens the free Unfolding of life in this world even while it claims to liberate that life so According to Manet, it's crucial that we recognize that this what he calls the theological political problem is Is Something specifically Christian or in fact, he's emphatic about this specifically Catholic He explains that with Judaism and Islam We also have religions that lay claim to the way we live in this world and thus lay claim they get involved in the political sphere But for Manet, that's not a contradiction in there in those instances Why because there's nothing in their teaching that would obviously suggest that they shouldn't do that. They're sort of There's nothing about the liberating of the natural sphere in the teachings of Judaism and Islam So they're sort of naturally theocratic you might say, okay, it's specifically Christianity According to Manet that both affirms The integrity of the secular order of nature in itself, which is to say it liberates the temporal order life in this world to proceed in on its own terms in a certain sense and now you can see that When you get to the point that we have today with let's say conversations with the new atheists Questions about let's say a traditional Augustinian narrative about creation fall redemption How that is supposed to intersect with evolutionary patterns When does death come into the story all of these kinds of questions this separation of You're gonna have some separation in terms of well, what does the physical record? How do that? How does the physical record sort of God number one? Impact the narrative record sort of God number two in terms of the cohesion of your story Denies that integrity and Separation by subjecting the secular order constantly to theological judgment measuring by its eschatological aim Okay, so this is my nance position Manet's larger claim Then is that if we want to understand the essence of Europe the heart of European identity We might say the essence really of modern Western civilization We have to understand that identity as constituting itself precisely in and through The attempt to relieve this particular contradiction Manet concludes his brief opening chapter With a paragraph that contains a succinct statement of his thesis so Here's a quote again from Manet quote only by looking at this theological political problem Does the subsequent political development of Europe become intelligible? One can present the problem in an all-out way Incomprehensible one can present the problem in an almost mathematical form given the characteristics of the Catholic Church Find the political form X that makes it possible to ensure the secular world's independence end quote So the rest of his book then is to try to show how the modern liberal nation state is the X That turns out to best Protect you might say the secular sphere from the incursion intrusion of the church So in some form in that the phenomenon of European liberalism is best understood as a problem Sorry as a response To the problem set in motion by the Catholic Church So that's That's his thesis I hope that's clear The aim of my lecture now this afternoon here is to flip the script so to speak With respect to that thesis I want to argue That whatever merit there might be in Manet's account as a historical matter and I think I think it's actually very insightful to Interpret the development of the modern nation state as a kind of response to Catholicism. I think that's actually incredibly illuminating Nevertheless in terms of the essence of the matter. I think he has it exactly wrong Exactly wrong So I'm going to argue that it is in fact the liberal regime that poses the theological political problem and That ultimately the only solution to the problem is the Catholic Church Okay, heck of a heck of a Heck of a teaser. I haven't listened to it past this So I'm I'm I'm the edge of my seat except I've got a lunch appointment and then two Conversations after that so I probably won't even get to this today. I might not get to this until later tonight, but But that's where we're at That's where we're at in the conversation because Liberalism has been spun up and now modernity is receding Modi is you know is dedicating this temple to Ram Over what had been a mosque in India The Agia Sophia is being turned from a museum into a temple Christians around America are saying well what they're really sort of saying is make Christian make America Protestant again Well, well, we'll include the Catholics this time because they seem awfully Protestant to us now It didn't seem that way a hundred years ago but today they're a okay because of all of these other reasons and and and and so I think that's where we're at and I look forward to listening to the rest of his argument and I look forward to reading your comments. So leave a comment. Let me know what you think
