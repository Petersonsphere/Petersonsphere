 Hi, this is Paul and the rest is history just had a podcast on East Germany like behind the Iron Curtain which is Kate Kate Hoyer who has a book coming out. It's not out yet It's pre-order on Amazon in the US beyond the wall a history of East Germany I found this podcast absolutely fascinating and it actually touches on a number of the issues that That that interests me and listen to the whole thing But I'm gonna jump in just sort of after the break where they talk well Let's just jump in say Honika comes in so Honika made his name We're not made his name But Honika in the 60s have been a great critic of the Beatles and of long hair And if you've got so Honika is the sort of he is precisely the wrong person you could argue to take over as me in The early 70s because he's so backward looking and puritanical and but I thought that he was piling in and allowing all these Germanies to buy jeans and things Now what's what's interesting here in the story of East Germany is There obviously it's a nation divided East and West this the Soviets sort of kept East Germany and the first part of the podcast Talks about why there's a lot of interesting stuff about that But then you have sort of these two people next to each other that makes Really a very interesting test case where you've got basically the same language the same culture of people Now divided by these two regimes and they're going to try to pursue different two different ways of life obviously the West is going to continue with the Western part of the world and culture religion economics Ideology are going to divide them so obviously in the 1960s you've got this The book I really want to read what Tom Holland's gonna write hopefully is this book about the 60s you have this tumultuous Revolution going on in the West the counterculture in music and art in and Economics and everything which is sort of casting off Traditional ways or what do you do in the East and and the question is well? What do people prefer? Why do they prefer it? Do they want a good thing? Do they want a bad thing and so here well the East German the East German leadership is going to have to figure out what do we do with all of these changes in the West and Obviously there's changes in the East in terms of how they want to live life And this is going to get played out on a whole bunch of different in on a whole bunch of different levels Things I find fascinating about the GD is just how much it oscillates between Trying to open itself up and becoming more Reformist and then drawing back in on itself, and I think that's reflected in both all Briggs and Honika So Honika actually opposes some of the opening up that all Briggs does in the 60s And when he genuinely sits down with some youth leaders and says well, why is it that you're bored with our regime? Why are people leaving the free German youth? And then it's trying to open up by allowing a bit more Western music in for example and other things now now This is interesting and part of what I had in mind when I was listening to it is sort of The church thinking about in a few weeks ago. I did something on the Jesus movement and the counterculture You're bored with the free German youth. Well, what were the free German youth about it was probably sort of a Ra-ra, you know make the kids Communist it was sort of a communist youth group probably to indoctrinate the kids in the communist way of life and suddenly The kids all want music from the West and they want blue jeans and they want these things and so suddenly there's a there's a cultural competition and of course this happened in evangelical in in evangelical churches and youth groups and churches had to figure out how to respond to this how to What to do about this and now are we talking about religion or blue jeans? Religious is music with guitars rock music guitars and drums is this religion or is it politics? You can just feel the tensions in this way Honig at that point is opposed to it and then it almost turns around on its head When all big is ousted for being too old too stubborn to lecturing basically constantly trying to tell East Germans how to live their lives And Honig comes in and presents himself as the so so the first guy's a square Basically, and he's too luxury, you know, he's the man and so now we're gonna bring in somebody who's gonna maybe be a little bit cooler Maybe maybe not much a fresh breath of air who you know will bring in reforms and create a new country Because it's not just jeans is it it's also Dean Reed the red Elvis He was an American enthusiast for communism who comes over and it becomes that kind of Elvis great rock and roll star I gotta look this guy up Dean Reed Dean Cyrus Reed September 22 1938 to June 13 1986 an American actor singer songwriter director and social activist who lived a great part of his adult life in South America And then in East Germany nicknamed the red Elvis. I hadn't heard about this at all Reed was a best-selling Western performer in communist countries with his songs often topping the local charts And millions of his records sold in the Eastern Bloc and elsewhere mostly under the Melodia Melodia label he never renounced his US citizenship Despite once denouncing the US government and being seen by the Western media as communist propaganda figure So if this guy got so cool and so counterculture he went all the way over to the commies Which is is really quite amazing. I don't Here's And you can see this is this is sort of early rock and roll. This is the red Elvis Let's see if we can find anything on YouTube from him. Oh There's a whole YouTube documentary about him. This this is going to this this This looks good. And and again, I see this as sort of you know, I'm seeing I'm looking at this sort of a valence in terms of Evangelicalism, you know because very quickly what you had to have were sort of safe evangelical stars to The kids like rock music or what are we gonna do? Well, we're gonna need our we're gonna need our evangelical Musicians and so this is this is just hilarious. I'm not gonna play the I'm not gonna play the I'm not gonna play the music because I don't want YouTube monkeying with it, but I'll have to watch this later Yeah, he suited Honecker perfectly I mean you've got this kind of fresh fresh handsome American with the you know, great flashy smile He comes along and sings like Western music and country songs and things things that look and sound like the West does to East Germans, but at the same time he's a convinced communist and has been sort of touring the Soviet Union and become a huge star there And it is kind of ideologically reliable if you will so he settles down in East Germany marries an East German woman And becomes kind of Honecker's pet cowboy if you will to some extent by projecting a Western image But doing it in a communist way since Tom's brought some music. They call the pewdies. How would you call them? Yeah, Puhd We have to look them up, too. Oh Yeah, they're on they're on YouTube too. And I'm sure a bunch of I'm sure a bunch of you from from Germany are gonna Gonna remember these people and have something to say about that The pewdies and they're the biggest East German band massive in if I went to Leipzig now and started chatting to people about the pewdies that know who I was talking about. Yeah, they're still around I still give concerts to thousands of people now I mean the kind of lineup has changed a little bit over the years, but they're still going so the point of those bands is They're not covering Western songs. They're doing their own songs in German and they're not tainted by imperialist capitalists They're not doing their own songs in German and they're not doing their own songs in German And they're not tainted by imperialist capitalists forward to the future with comrade honika. Yeah No, they aren't interesting one actually because they started off playing Western music as cover songs as many GDR bands did in Instead of just pubs and village wars and stuff like that And then the local the stars he got a bit annoyed with that because they were so Effective for lack of a better word and creating a kind of exuberant atmosphere that they got, you know Young people are dancing and it was incredibly rowdy and they weren't happy with that So they told them they can't play anymore and then banned them from from public appearances and the booties actually to their credit Went back and said like well, what is it that we need to do to try and you know? To try and please you so much that we can play again And the authorities said to them if you write your own songs rather than covering Western songs and you you play them in German Absolutely fine go back and so they kind of stayed with the heroes in the West like Uriah Heap For example, you know that entire era style wise but wrote their own German lyrics to go with it and that worked so well They were really really popular both East and West Germany They actually played concerts in West Germany as well and became one of the most the most successful band In the GDR so they're influenced by Western bands and that raises a bigger question Which is if you were there in East Berlin or wherever Karl Marx starts or in East Germany I mean, do you get West German TV? Do you get West German radio? Do you get so you conscious of everything that's going on or you living in a little prison not knowing that this is happening? Both to some extent. I mean you get West German TV and radio almost everywhere in the GDR Apart from what was dubbed the Valley of the Clueless in Saxony where you couldn't where you couldn't get it Some of my family are from there and they joke that they still live in the Valley of the Clueless but other than that it was very possible and Very commonly done like the authorities themselves reckon that the vast vast majority of people watch Western TV and listen to Western radio Now I want to let's see. We're at 38 54. I want to bring you right before the break because Part of what's interesting about this right before the sort of because the rest of history it has a little commercial break if you get the commercials if you have the free version if you have the If you're in the in the club, you don't get any commercials but It's interesting the different perspectives on let's say the Berlin Wall because we would almost all think that well everyone in Eastern Germany would be against the Berlin Wall and Her perspective on this was absolutely fascinating It's a period of relative stability the 50s, but there's a continuing drain then to deal with that drain of people in 1961 They put up the Berlin Wall. We did a podcast and we told me the Emma Greger about the bird Yeah, so one of the things you talk about the about the Berlin Wall this that's quite sort of counterintuitive Is the Berlin Wall actually I mean it frees us the situation, but it ensures stability So there's almost an argument this will sound like an absolutely weird thing to say But there's actually an argument to be made for the Berlin Wall in the sense that It means that the sort of the threat of instability recedes and and actually from the East German point of view People just have to now knuckle down and make the best of the regime they have because there is no alternative Is that that pretty much your view? Yeah, I mean that's that's certainly how it was viewed by most of the political leaders at the time You've got Ardenauer doing very very little in West Germany about the same very little about it as well The same goes for Kennedy, you know And obviously all by themselves is happy in East Germany because it stabilizes the situation But it's interesting how little kind of political resistance there is and also how little resistance there is on the ground I mean, yes, you do get a Lot of unrest in Berlin itself, particularly actually more on the western side than in East Berlin You do get that but the rest of the country is surprisingly quiet and I asked almost all of the people I spoke to You know, this is one of my key questions Irresponsive irrespective of what I actually wanted from them interview wise like what did you make of the of the building of the Berlin Wall and The vast majority of them kind of just shrugged their shoulders and said well, I was on holiday I read about it in the newspaper. I suppose it was quite good because our doctor now had to stay Yeah, but they had no particular feelings about I guess it was most people they weren't gonna travel anyway And so well, I suppose it was good. My doctor had to stay so you had to certain again Class here a certain class of people are and it's you know part of what shapes up as we go through this thing is that You have this question which was it was in the plastic pills video that I used with the Contrapoints video you have this question of Of sort of sort of well, what do people want? Well people want Reliability they want stability. They want a secure place to live. They want food on the table They want they want their basic needs met if you meet the people's basic needs Is that going to be enough and so in some ways for a lot of the people who weren't gonna travel anyway It's after the war. Of course The people of Germany suffered tremendously after the war or during the war and then these are the people that had the Red Army to deal with not the French and the and the British and the Americans and So they had all of that to deal with and so life settles down and it's like I'm not gonna travel anywhere. I just want you know, I just want everything to just sort of settle down and stay okay So but yeah the doctors and the you know, the elites they're gonna be running away to the West So wall them up and keep them here so I won't lose my doctor back to the other section and very commonly done like the authorities themselves reckon that the vast vast majority of people watch with some TV and listen to Western radio and To the point actually where they adapted their own programming if there was something, you know Like a crowd please on in the West they kind of make sure that what they wanted people to see wouldn't be on at the Same time because they knew that people would watch like West German TV So it was commonly known that that was a thing that people did so so again Now you've got this question. You've got this competition between cultures So on one hand in East Germany as we're gonna get to later you have things are going. Okay Economically people have enough food people have place to live people have money, but they might not have anything to really spend their money on and they're looking over the culture divide at the West and Well Western TV is better Western music is better, you know all of these tensions again if you look at let's say the evangelical divide versus the You know the evangelicals versus the the the sinners and and the Saints well in the 60s in the early 60s You know keep your hair short basically continuation of 50s but now suddenly people are wearing blue jeans or people are talking about the summer of love and it becomes hip and cool and you have the first Elvis of course in the 50s and and then this Beatles will come in the 60s and the Rolling Stones and you have this change in music and All of this turmoil. Well, is it do people really just want stability and You were also legally allowed to play and listen to Western music in the country So long as you follow the ratio of 50 to 60 So it had to be 60% music either from East Germany or the Eastern Bloc so it's like from now Someone has to verify for me this I heard that Canada was either trying or has this rule that a certain amount of media Media consumed in Canada has to be from you know from Canadians because you know, we're always worried about those Americans and You know when I heard that I immediately thought of East Germany. I don't know if it's true. Some of you can can look it up, but Yeah, but what what what does it say about your? culture when These are the kinds of ways you have to limit it and this is very much a part of Worldly amusements the Christian Form Church dealt with in the 1920s and 30s many other denominations did as well the power of the media and of fashion and of new things But the thing I mean the thing is in the 60s and 70s there is a kind of consumer society Developing in East Germany, so they have more fridges by what what's the figure? By 1970 56.4 percent of households had a fridge as against West Germany's 28 percent. There are holidays so you have 18 days holiday a year and Famously you have the Trabant. So tell us about the Trabant which is kind of a The ultimate symbol really of East Germany, isn't it? It is and it's become a symbol of how you know decrepit the socialist system is because people looked at them kind of rolling over the border in 1989 and stinking its These are cars made in yeah, like two-stroke little two-stroke. All right. I'm gonna have to look these up, too I think that's actually the car that's on the cover of the book. So so here's my Here's one of my favorite car commentators, and I'm gonna have to look at the car So here's my Here's one of my favorite car commentators. So this is an early video of his this is six years ago this is Doug Demuro and he's talking about the Trabant and there Look at this thing So You're gonna to stroke cars Which were terribly outdated really by the end of the of the GDR in 1989 But when they first introduced them and they were actually quite modern and decent cars They were sort of modeled on the same design principles as the Triumph Herald In Britain and they look quite stylish the early ones when you look at them people were quite happy with them The problem was that they didn't get developed any further So basically you ended up with the same car model that people were driving in the 1960s Still kind of pretty much the only affordable model in the 1980s and still on a two-stroke engine Which was just you know outdated and just a kind of slightly improved model from the previous one for which you had to wait A long time you had to apply for it years in advance So people looked after these cars and they had them and I think it's worth pointing out that car ownership is nearly the same And then East Germany as it is in many Western countries on a par with Britain but people just didn't update them they couldn't because they couldn't get kind of new car models from anywhere and the regime I don't think recognized just how car loving the German people are on the whole and didn't make that the focus but focused on Other things like fridges that became the flagship sort of figure that they would constantly trump as well that they'd temporarily overtaken No, no, I might get some criticism for this I got it from the Dutch that one of the things that blew me away about Europe is y'all are in this not big huge Area and you don't get along It's not a good thing so somebody told me that the The Germans were the Americans of Europe so, you know, you like big cars and you got lots of money and the food in Germany was great and you know, I Didn't get to see much of Germany, but I was I was really quite fast Fascinated by it and look forward to being able to go back at some point and gold medals in the Olympics And that yes So the sporting thing that kicks in in the late 60s, is that right? Yeah from the from the time really when these Germany gets its own National team for a while They had to sort of form one one all-german team together with the with the West Germans, which must have been an interesting diplomatic exercise now now The use of the use of chemicals to help the East German women perform better There are actually quite a few documentaries about this on YouTube Exercise in itself But once they've got their own they're really using that to try and create kind of like a national spirit if you will So a lot of time money and thought goes into how to create the sporting success I said the stereotype is that they're pumping particularly women with steroids And so you have all these kind of bearded women with huge muscles who are chucking Shotputs out of the stadium. Yes, and I mean they did absolutely and they did and you can really see that in the you know The records that are still there There is no way of getting around that especially as they identified that if you give steroids to women early When they're still in their teens it permanently alters their physique So you can kind of temporarily stop giving them the steroids and they will still perform better in the actual competitions then without them So this happened and it really permanently damaged the female athletes that were involved in these programs So it's interesting story isn't it with East Germany because your book your pains to sort of say you've got an extraordinary rates of kind of Gender equality so more women working than in most comparable Western countries you have the paid holidays Which Tom mentioned you have the consumer society and you still have people who are quite idealistic And yes on the other side of the equation is it where you have the regime that is pumping the athletes full of steroids But you also have for example the star Z So the image that most of our listeners I guess will have of East Germany is a society in which you're being spied on the whole Time and it's very repressive I mean I've been to the stars a museum in Berlin lots of our listeners probably have Where they've got sort of examples of cameras in trees and cameras hidden in cars or something and everybody is watching everybody else and Do you think that latter image is overstated? So in other words, do you think East Germany was a better place than we commonly think in the West or am I now? Swinging too far to the other extreme. I think it was a more normal place than people think is rather than better I'd say it completely literally completely depended on who you were what you made of the state I mean if you were somebody who comes from a working-class background and suddenly all those opportunities open up for you You can go to university you get paid while you study you can have children while you study Like my mom was at university When when I was born and you know, the way that it worked was you were just put in a in a larger room Which had a nursery attached to it You could take your child literally up to the lecture room Drop them at a childcare center there go to the lecture come back out pick them back up that all worked You know You kind of never had to worry about the existential things that like Western working-class people worried about like, you know You're the stability of your job how much you'd earn from one day to the next could you afford your rent? Could you afford to heat your house? You know, none of that was an issue and if you were happy to live there it is There's all the security if within this kind of relatively small world that the state set up for you You could do that without existential fears kind of bearing down on you because all of the basic goods in life were were stabilized and As far as the stars he goes people just obviously knew that they were being watched and this is something that happened to the vast majority Of people they knew that the stars he was around and watched their lives But for the most part the stars he didn't really seem to know what it was going to do with the information I give an example of my dad in the book where he was basically it was implied that you shouldn't marry my mother because she Had Western relatives and he was in a very sensitive area in the in the army where he dealt with radio signaling Which they didn't want to trust to somebody who had kind of potentially relatives in the in the West and You know They kind of just suggested that to him and kept saying things like did you know that your your parents-in-law had gone to Hamburg again Over the weekend because they were you know kind of visiting family or something and he said well, of course I do They're my parents-in-law. Of course I know that they went you know and they just let him know that they knew and he knew that nothing would come of it Other than the fact that they wouldn't trust him was sort of really sensitive radio Technology But it was just a part of life and I've asked him, you know I don't know how many times I did that not bother you they knew everything about you There's a whole file somewhere that he hasn't even looked at and doesn't want to look at because he says he knows what's in it What's the point? You know, this is kind of just a fact of life that people dealt with I think because that's the world of Deutschland 83 brilliant drama about an East German who goes to the West to kind of infiltrate and I suppose that's the other thing that people in the West would know about East Germany It's kind of outsized role that he plays in spider-man All those kind of things and the idea of the stars he has incredibly effective and it's also it's it's some foreign mission So what is it Marcus wolf the man without face the model for Carla in the in? Carre novels that that in that sense the impression of East Germany is actually it's quite an impressive state that it's a significant player a significant actor in the Cold War But at the same time the impression I get from from your book is that the blue jeans the fridges almost serves as a kind of sugar rush for for people in East Germany and When that starts to crash that is a problem for these Germans because basically they're starting to run out of money So you have this as early as 1977 this this some this crisis in sourcing coffee, which is incredibly important Eric's brew and mocha fuck Well If you had a coffee crisis in America, especially in in the West Coast and in the Pacific Northwest, yeah, you'd probably get rebellion Who knows what that means very carefully, which is good, but it doesn't sound good. I mean, it's a kind of what is it? It's kind of basically dust and Chikory apparently I think the basis of it. Yeah, and it's horrible and these Reading about the coffee crisis actually it sounds quite significant coffee presumably is quite important It is I mean Germans do like their coffee. Yeah, I mean and this this is something I try to get that across in the book This is something that was associated with post-war, you know stability having coffee ready and available to you at all times It's like a little comfort blanket, you know, whatever happens, you know, I suppose it's the equivalent to tea You know people say like I'll just put the kettle on and everything. We find a bread and I think that Equivalent to that in Germany is coffee I think and when that wasn't available just imagine like he wasn't available in Britain You know people would freak out and it's the same sort of Thing I think and the regime notices them. It's that a canary in the mind So in the 80s is there a sense that the economy in East Germany is starting to run down relative to the West and our East Germans becoming resentful of that. Yeah, I mean that their problem is that they're trying to create a socialist society So basically a society where everyone has enough of everything but nothing Luxurious or kind of on top of that. So yeah, there it is Everyone will have enough and it's so funny because when I talk to people who like to sort of blithely promote socialism here I will ask them because many of the people that I hear do this you pull out numbers of You pull out numbers basically either in the United States or especially in the world and say, okay Well, if everyone were to have the same This is what it's going to cost you Look at me, you know part of the joke about Canada is that they want They want European social safety net on an American taxation basis. So People are really interesting when it comes to this and what's again so interesting about this this East German example is he sort of have well this this This Christian enclave versus the rest of the temptations in the world and that sort of mirrors itself now with With the Soviet experiment and again For someone my age who grew up with all of these stories and remember in the 80s the fall of the Berlin Wall and such But but I think for many younger generations this stuff isn't known at all have things like rent food holidays all of those kinds of basic things are all Subsidized to a point where they are very very easily affordable and people still have lots of money left over to do things and then They can't buy anything without money So that was you know They look at their Western relatives and the Western relatives don't tell them that they're struggling to pay the rent next month But they're wearing a pair of jeans, you know And so I think you get a very very slanted image in East Germany as to what the West is like because you view it through this very narrow lens of and and Honigers and you know even just jeans. I mean jeans are sort of this American labor class Wardrobe, I mean I wear jeans every day But but it becomes chic it becomes status it becomes all of this and so well, what do you want? Do you want security or do you want opportunity? Trying to do both he's trying to keep this welfare state that people are used to which is incredibly expensive You know free education as well all the way through to university all of that's happening If you're an adult and your employers looks at you and thinks actually you're a bit too clever for the position that you're doing Don't you want to do something else? They can send you back to university even at an adult age and you're getting that paid for so all of that's happening And at the same time when it goes now trying to give people, you know TVs color TVs and radios and later Walkmans You know in the 80s and all of those stereo things for people to have at home And all of these things that in the West only a small portion of the population can actually afford And again back to what I've been talking about in terms of this This this world that we live in which is just saturated by media our expectations are all Calibrated by the bombarding of images and you see this all the time in America Everyone is beautiful. Everyone's life is great back to the episode that I did on Lonely lonely people sitting in their bedroom and They're just they're just absorbing Instagram or YouTube and they're just sure that everybody's life must be awesome and great and they're being left out and they're being left behind And well this on a this on a national scale But it looks to people because they see the adverts and they listen to their relatives in the West It looks to people so everybody has it and you can't have both of these things by definition You can't have a society that's got everything for everyone and then luxury on top of that for everyone as well That just doesn't work economically and honey cover stretches themselves massively and they find that out in the 1980s And then so what do you choose? Which is better even at that point in the 80s? So when they've cheap oil deliveries on which they've relied from the Soviet Union have been cut They're running into massive economic problems East Germany has at this point existed for about 35 years So it's looking forward to its 40th anniversary There are an awful lot of people who've known nothing who now alive who have known nothing but East Germany You know you were for in that story that Tom told but there are lots of people who would have been older than you or a school Who take East Germany for granted and the regime is also creating? I mean one of the things I find fascinating is they're creating a separate East German historic identity based on Martin Luther And on Prussia and on a sort of separate history So is there a point there in the 1980s where most people genuinely believe East Germany is its own thing? It's not just some sort of mutilated Appendix of a greater Germany, but it's its own thing with its own history its own culture, and it will last for generations Do you think there are people genuinely think that most people did I mean if you speak to people even about 1989 of the? There's a tiny minority who say now that they they knew that the state was going to to collapse and Germany was going to reunify But the vast majority of people thought there You know there were two German states for the foreseeable future And you see that even in the conversations between the West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and in the Irikanika that they're working towards kind of what they call a neighborly relationship between the two states Because they both accept at this point that for the foreseeable future there will be two German states. East Germany has got its own You know citizenship for example There is through sport to some extent as well a kind of East German identity on the on the world stage You've got your own team basically that you look up to so I think that there was certainly a sense that maybe It was still one nation, but it would live in two separate states for now All right, so that's I'm gonna play of this the whole the whole episode is great very much recommend listening to the whole thing I am the book doesn't seem to come out until September. I hope I remember But I'm I'm really quite interested in the book too of course This is a period of life that that I lived through and you know you'd watch the Olympics You'd see East Germany and during the Cold War was quite a big deal Now it might seem like a strange segue, but then again if you watch my channel You know that there's probably nothing but strange segues to figure out what that that's a motorcycle outside my door hang on I Was listening to the Glenn show that's Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter they were talking about John McWhorter's Appearance more you know recent appearance on Bill Maher they were talking about equality versus equity Stuff that most of you have probably heard before they were talking about standardized testing they're talking about What that means in black and brown communities, and then they began to go into? again this very similar question of sort of parallel societies and the and Sort of a uniform The question of the question of standards between them And I'll just I'll just let it play a little bit and you know we need to respond to a certain kind of person who hears this and You know they're There this you imagine a black and white picture. They've got their arms crossed and they're looking down at us. You're criticizing the culture No folks you have to be more nuanced than that What Glenn and I are doing is not saying? Black people are no good That's not that's not it if I say that a black family, and I'm being specific a black American family is Less likely to make it seem like it is absolutely the measure of the human That you try your best on that test And we really want you to do well on if that is less present in a black American household than in for example an immigrant South Asian household that doesn't mean there's something wrong with black people I'm not pointing a finger and frowning and there are all sorts of reasons why it might be it's partly a matter of class It's partly a matter of what black America inherited from the countercultural mood of the 1960s Which was begun by white people it's all sorts of things that I've honestly written about Partly in the times and then in my two books losing the race and winning the race. It's not about blaming and anger It's just saying that the reason is not racism But I will say this there is a problem with one corner of black culture where I would have to have a judgment And that is much Academic and journalistic black culture where I don't think that people in that world understand how unique it is That they have this watch cry that somebody says that we're not good at something and your response is why should we have to prove it? Rather than proving it that notion that it's a valid answer to say why should we have to prove it? You must be a racist and to really think that that's a mic drop. That's weird I'll bet it's relatively unprecedented in human history. That's a black thing, but not just a black thing. It's a specific thing It's an educated enlightened post 1966 black thing and yeah, I've got some judgments on that just like you guys have judgments on me I think you need to stop that if you can't prove it then you have no right to resent people For supposing that you can't do it and the so part of what's behind here is a question of a monoculture and and the competition between cultures and the integration between different cultures and obviously in East Germany and West Germany The wall comes down basically earlier on the Soviets Needed East Germany to function in a certain way for them. So the Red Army was there and then someone mentioned last night at the at the estuary meeting that the way that the the way that the the The Berlin Wall fell was just sort of accidental in that nobody knew if they should stop these people from tearing it down or not So it starts coming down and you know in history is very funny that way But but all of this for me sort of connects I mentioned this and someone noted someone noted this book There's a So John McWhorter mentions the call the counterculture and the counterculture It's funny it throws critique at a culture it's sort of an open declaration of war against the Establishment culture that had prevailed and in many ways has taken over but there's cultures are very vast complex things and you know part of What Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter point to is that certain Streams of the counterculture have in a way given permission for groups of people to not Compete but that whole competition thing is is in itself another thing that's that's up for debate quite a bit here, too so I did listen to finally get a chance to listen to all of grail country's conversation with Paul Kingsnorth and It was very interesting because a lot of it reminded me of the 70s and 80s Where I was at you know all this talk about the machine stepping out of the of the dominant paradigm of course illich is is part of that and But then it when then when it comes to okay, how exactly what exactly does that look like and You know Sherry I thought they had a fair amount of nuance in their conversation They they left it fairly Individualistic individuals are going to have to decide if in fact you continue to resist the machine and the dominant culture You will probably be exiled by it if you don't adopt new changes. You will be sidelined by it Can this be done in community? Can this be done in mass now? Obviously certainly Groups have the Amish have done it other countercultural groups have you have communal living situations? All of that going on, but it doesn't really remove the the competition between these groups as ways of life and Whereas with East Germany and West Germany that very much had political state involvement with many other communities It's it's going to be different i'm going to let these guys get into some more interesting things here, too The fact that we were brought here as slaves doesn't change that nor does Jim Crow nor does redlining None of those things change that basic fact. I'm sorry except, you know I'm not sorry. That is something that our educated class needs to face up to when I agree with you now You completely now, but I think that's a very important thing Now Completely now both of these guys are Ivy league academics both of these guys are built deeply into the system. Now. They're also in some ways heterodox Because they're heterodox in some respects Heterodox to certain movements of affirmative action and such yet. They are they're both Deeply tied into the system. They want to see within their respective fields excellence by their students regardless of the Ethnic background or cultural background that they've come. This is the death. This is the discipline strive to meet it And and just by the way, too, I mean these I I love their I love the glen show. I I loved it back when it was on talking heads The conversations that these two have are are just absolutely tremendous I I'm trying to think now on the top of my head about what the genesis of this might be and you know what i'm thinking About i'm thinking about e franklin frazier's book black bourgeoisie This is I don't know what maybe 1953 or something like that it was published initially in french you couldn't get Maybe this is about so 53 you're you're sort of at the tail end of jim crow you're simultaneous to East germany a little earlier couldn't get published in english initially it was published and we're originally in paris uh, and it's this Uh, this is a great sociologist e franklin frazier and the uh Thing that I remember most vividly from the book that he's in ving against is phony pompous pretend status Manufactured by the black elites as a kind of Parallel to the real status which was reflected in the structures of the larger society Now now this gets interesting because of course a big part of the conversation with respect to what happened In the civil rights movement the degree to which african americans Participated even despite jim crow in many of in much of what was going on in broader american culture And and you should you should note that the ways in which african americans led The you wouldn't have the american elvis never mind the red elvis you wouldn't have the american elvis without Jazz all of the contributions by african american culture Um african american music to american culture But but yet there's there's still a sort of a segmentation obviously that was done with with jim crow Thomas soul of course goes into a number of these things thomas soul talking about his experiences in harlem Before the coming of the counter culture, which which then disrupts and sort of changes standards And they had to do it again because he broke up Glenn say it again because you broke up. Okay, but i'll say it again Okay What I said was I was trying to recall the argument of frazier's book and his the contempt the thinly veiled contempt that he has for the phony status seeking kind of uh faux grander Uh, which is not real achievement, but it's a kind of mimicking of the white world's real achievement with these parallel negro Uh, you know elite Uh, and again my pointing to evangelical world My pointing to communist world. I mean all of these in this globalist world all of these sub communities are in Conversation with each other. They're watching each other. They're establishing different value hierarchies different status hierarchies And and and trying to suss out. Well, what is what is best? organizations and and activities From the sororities and the fraternities the way that the historically black colleges are run the the class of aliens yeah, the cattilions and the and the and the secret societies and the and the and the and and the uh a kind of it being a mirror image of real status that was built on actual wealth and control over the apparatus of the society and It was you know, you're black and so you had your separate black sphere in which you could kind of create these status distinctions Among black people And uh the fact that it would often be a uh, uh dodge over actual Uh competition with your with your uh peers who were not black Uh But is that a period piece or you think that that you that sentiment you say the class of intellectuals and Journalists and writers who are black and who would exempt themselves from the necessity of demonstrating competency simply by playing this card You think that's still a contemporary? uh issue, um I think that what frazier was writing about was um A different world in many ways So for example, i'm not sure how many people are having cattilions so to speak and that that tone was a lot of what he Was writing about he was writing about a certain kind of person in a still segregated america where A certain sliver of black people felt value in things like learning greek and having cattilions and all these formal clubs The idea being to show yes, but things what they were doing was they thought they were showing Yes, we're as good as all the rest of you But you could say that all of it was kind of a hollow show the new people doing this though I think it's not so much that they're saying that they shouldn't have to show their competence It's that they're saying it on behalf of other black people Which I think that black bourgeoisie then often were less concerned with they're saying that black people in general Should be able to be mediocre that that's part of people being allowed to be human that we or that we Shouldn't have to prove it unless we feel like it it is racist to Tell us that we're not good at something because that's insulting and yeah, that's rather simplistic thinking and then with them themselves, I think um They wouldn't say that they shouldn't have to prove anything but because most of them Is this safe to say? Yeah. Yeah, most of them even today tend to limit themselves to only writing about race issues and so They don't feel themselves as in competition with white writers because they're writing about different things. They're interviewing different people So then even even with this Okay, we're going to we're going to compete within the same machine but People and i've heard pretty recently that at one One media organ that I will not name That the the editor and it's not the new york times The editor has had trouble getting black writers to write about something other than race He's asked them to and they say no what I want to do is is this and there's a value to it But if you ask me, it's a little 1970 as if nobody else would write about these things if black people didn't that's Not as true as it used to be but it does mean that you probably don't feel like you're in competition with white journalists You feel like you're in competition with other black ones, but that's a very different Feeling but now I take your point. I definitely I take your point So, you know, I kind of put these things together and they make me think about okay A lot of what has happened in Christian churches as churches themselves become these little enclaves And then as they sort of go up you have sort of a catholic culture. You have an evangelical culture You have a christian reformed culture And then when you have racial Stratifications, you have a crc black culture. Maybe a crc hispanic culture It just the nuance the nuances go but but how then do these groups? How can in this interconnected world these groups really sort of? Can you actually segment off and live? Live separate at what cost you know, this this was part of the this was a big part of the conversation in in this conversation can you Each of you basically they they didn't really talk Communally so much but that each person has to sort of step step off in their way and do their own thing But I don't know if that actually can be done without a community And yet those communities are going to be interconnected all all sorts of things are going to be pressuring those communities and Yeah, so these are some of the Conjunctions that I was thinking about as I was listening to these various things and I thought well It'd be kind of interesting to sort of lay them together and now i'm going to have to think of what a title would be so We'll see and then what a thumbnail would be as you might have noticed i've started playing with ai art and um We'll see if that's just a very passing fad for me or if I go back to my old black and yellow thumbnails with With a mosaic of of images from it or what we'll see
