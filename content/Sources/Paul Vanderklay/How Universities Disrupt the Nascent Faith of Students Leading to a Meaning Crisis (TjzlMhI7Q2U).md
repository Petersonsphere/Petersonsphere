 Okay, here we go. So go right ahead. All right, so Paul Why don't you introduce yourself a little bit because we've never met. Sure. My name is Kyle McNeese and I'm a researcher and I am in the field of communication in bioethics. And so I focus on sort of underlying substrata That we sort of rely on in order to do what we're doing right now so I look at the sort of technical aspects of that, but then also the the more fundamental aspects the primordial aspects that you know brain based things that allow us to communicate in general, so The bioethics part we could get into but I do I I spent time in the developing world and And It's a little pertinent right now because there's an outbreak of dengue fever That's that's ending Central America in particular. Honduras very hard. And so while I was living there I got I was fortunate enough to get multiple strains and so It sort of increases with lethality the more strange you encounter So they had to send me out of the country and so yeah all of these students People that I love they couldn't get on a flight and leave and so everyone that I knew knew someone that had died from a vector-borne disease or something much worse and so It it hit me right where I lived and so Whenever I study ethics, it's it's usually from an applied perspective. How does this affect real people where they live? so I Didn't come in into academia for Just just curiosity. I came with a little bit of a my own ethical purpose And so some of that was trying to get needed supplies drugs things of that nature to people that were in desperate need so a lot of great people out there doing work and so whenever I heard your story of There's a lot of similarities Between you said, you know sort of a lineage your grandfather your father you all doing pastor at work and same thing with with my family they came here as immigrants to start a church to experience some religious liberty and freedom to worship and so in in so doing Even though my parents were from vastly different worlds. They ended up meeting through this this church and that sort of was my life and Whenever you mentioned you had done mission work as well and Experienced cultures outside of our own. I felt you know a lot of resonance there, but then the most important thing I think and this may be the crux of what I really want to talk to you about is I Hear you being able to address questions that I hear Daily from students clients That most of the pastors that I deal with and have no one in my life just aren't willing to take on and you do it explicitly so I think in some ways what you're doing is More and less difficult than what say someone like Jordan Peterson is doing because You take on the metaphysical claim. So when Peterson says who dares Say they are a believer Paul Vanderklaas says he is a believer and you can be one too But I'd love to start for a moment at what some people think is a failure I've heard a lot of people say that the Harris Peterson debate on facts was a failure and I don't I don't see it that way at all because and talking with students So in our large theory class, there's usually a couple hundred students in there and they're not Kids, but they're not quite fully formed adults either. They are, you know, 20 years old something like that and They get to write a theory paper that they can apply to some real-world situation I found that over the years and this is increasingly so a Majority of the class write about how their home Being broken has affected them and their experience of What what kind of person I'm trying to be in the world it affects their self-esteem as a pastor you will have counseled many families who go through that it's absolutely heartbreaking and People may not think that even at that age they're still wrestling with these issues But going off from home for the first time not having That sense of an anchor that they can rely on at home. Yeah that kind of chaos really does affect them in a profound way and The next thing would be that they're experiencing a loss of faith And so whenever they write these papers, of course whenever they they get into details that they're willing to share something like that And I you know write notes to them. This is a great paper Why don't you come by the office and we'll talk about it? And so the theme that I feel like has emerged from those conversations is When I'm dialoguing with them, so tell me why you think you're you're losing your faith And they would say well, I want to believe But in my philosophy of science class I'm taking this class from one of the leading evolutionary theorists in the world and When I go to my pastor and I say He's telling me this is the theory of evolution and my pastor says You know what write down whatever you have to write down on a test to get an A But don't listen to him You know this the Bible is the Bible and Solely so like don't listen to your professor listen to your you know, your pastor your congregation and and going back to the debate between Harrison Peterson see what I think we're dealing with here is that students are coming up against a reality like This supercomputer that I'm holding in my hands This is a fact that they can wrap their heads around there's a materiality here that's tangible it's real and As much as they might want to deny it I don't know why you would want to deny an iPhone, you know, maybe for ethical reasons, you know You might want to deny that that people would exploit others or tech, you know just to build a technology But you wouldn't say that it doesn't exist So they can really put their hands on something like that and there's a connection there and they would say That they got there through brute facts via science and technology So if you pit that against the fact that they will have never unless they had an unusual spiritual experience Seen God Except for in their brother, whatever they think that means But that's just you know Inherently it's it's a kind of selfish time in your life So you may not be as worried about your brother whoever he or she is out there in the world or I should say brother or sister, but How how do you see God how do you experience God these narratives from 2,000 years ago. What kind of relevance do they have in my life today? I'm not really sure But I know that all of the people in my life whenever I go to them and tell them the questions that I have they react out of fear and Then that just drives me into a place of quietude where I feel very isolated And it gets so gripping for them because simultaneously There are writers who will address it this issue and they say well, it's because there is no God It's because there is no such thing as this this guy Jesus or if they at least succeed They give you that much they say maybe there is but he's some historical figure You know Josephus has a few lines about and so that's about the best we can do But even if he was real, why would you listen to him today? So what what Harris does there I think is is shrewd rhetoric in that he's able to posit this There are these brute facts about the world and then there are these nebulous Ideas that we have about God and even when Peterson Reads him his own definition of God. He says that's not really God so in some ways he's more of a fundamentalist than a fundamentalist and That's a really interesting thing. And so by knocking over that that Toppling over the fundamentalism aspect It is hitting a lot of students and maybe you can help me figure this out my wife and I were talking about this and She and I were raised a little bit differently where I sort of had a Trinity But then like a sub species to the tree. So there's got the father got the son Holy Spirit and then the Bible is sort of it's not It's not quite at the level of the Trinity but it If you question it in any way then you're out of the fold and so One of my friends when I was studying at Oxford he he was studying theology under One of the best theologians in the world and so They invited me to go to dinner with them because I didn't know very much about the Catholic faith at all and so The priest had been raised as a Baptist so we were talking about symbolism and the Bible and He tells me he said, you know, I grew up people would say This is all just simple Nothing to see here, but simple. However, if you do it wrong you eat and drink damnation to your soul So he's like, how do you how does a symbol become lethal? I don't know So that's about the extent to which some of us Thought about symbolism is like there is this some symbolic aspect, but then it's deadly serious like no pun intended Whereas my wife she she never really had Any questions arise in her faith because of someone saying? Well, this could be interpreted metaphorically It didn't impact it the truth claims in the Bible in any way, so it wasn't as if she had a Trinity plus like this this book was the only material thing that you could hold on to in the faith And so I find that you know in my own personal life. I can understand some of where this this comes from and then When you enter a Rigorous academic program your masters your PhD by the time you've done that you spent depending on What your program is, you know 12 years of your life being inundated and I can even remember times in my life where I looked at her and said Geez, you know, I don't I don't want to be an atheist. They're making a really compelling case though that this is just The fact that you would take the Bible and say well, there's any number of books that if you just scroll through them even Text books from the 50s. They're more accurate than the Bible as far as cosmology goes Therefore you should throw the Bible aside. There's nothing good to see here I find that my students are still having to wrestle with those kinds of questions because if you say to them Well, they're writers. They're not writers If you say to them Well, their writers didn't intend for this to be modern cosmology and they're writing in a particular milieu Contrasting themselves against other, you know peoples who had their own stories and narratives about their deities It really is in some ways a Compelling argument I at least find it Compelling and it's naively compelling but nonetheless In this day and age where things are very tactile This lingering question of Well, then where is God? You know, how do you How can you find him? Has he appeared to you if so? You know when God talks back You know people say if you talk to God you're a religious person if he talks back you have a mental illness You know, I think that that we really People are hard on millennials but in a way we've created this this Catastrophe of Nihilism and then a church almost universal That has been unwilling to engage them at the level that they're at and take these questions seriously I ask pastors all the time. What are you going to do about AI? and It's like this company. I was working with when I first graduated from my undergrad I said their their whole model for delivering health care was based on the affordable care act not passing Oops, what's your plan if it does pass and they're all Look at this guy. He's fresh out of you know, he's so naive it'll never pass and I was like, but that's not a business model Hoping something doesn't happen is in a business model. So You know, I I don't really know For them they the students will tell me well if I can't believe it at the level of the cosmology Then what is the purpose of what what am I doing engaging with the bible at all? And so I've said a lot I Let you Wow, you speak well. I I I think you put this together in a very in a very articulate and compelling way I appreciate that. I I just but someone like yourself who's who's no doubt dealing with See, I love the approach that you're taking You're you know, you're walking this tightrope where you're engaging a lot of people that That they can't yet find themselves able to commit to faith But there is this phenomenon for whatever peterson has done whether you think he's good or bad I was talking with john verbeke. He's friends with them and even he would say, you know, this is part of You don't have to agree with every single thing a person says and part of what we need to be doing is modeling What it would look like when we do disagree Um, so that's another reason why the debate between harrison pearson wasn't a failure Because no fight broke out. No, you know, no fisticuffs for chrome They they disagreed and then they came back and they did it again and they reached a bit of a higher plane and so Even in areas where you and I might disagree we can We can have a reproach mom where where we can say here we agree here We disagree, but it doesn't need to to rise to the level of a tent like we you know, roll up your sleeves Mr vander plaits time to you know, it's time to get this thing cool And so I I worry about that You know we Academics Priests rabbis We have I think a mandate not everyone agrees with this So this is something i'm putting on top of whatever it is that we do vocationally, but i'm saying I think we have an ethical Mandate to at least know what it would look like to be a good citizen So that when we have these moments of disagreement debate We can at least leave intact physically and mentally And you can come back the next day and pick up the conversation. So You're having to do it with the congregation Who you know you get to speak christianese to But then Some people might say well With you right now and certain person has allowed at least For academics and people who are in in the university to start to say Please to use one of their words problematizing Question how Simple we've made this native The west is just one long jury of patriarchy um It's just not that simple and if you think it is Leave the country for a while goes as much harder You would see that even that is much better than what our ancestors ancestors throughout the ages would have had And you start to come to grips with my god, this whole thing is so precarious It should have never been able to happen. Yeah, and somehow here we are we we appear to live In a universe where the things that are most improbable do have because You and I have happened and you know, there's But some talib about the black swan And there's nothing more black swanish about life than our own Just the fact that we're here I say that I just So All of the things that can go wrong, you know one thing that can go right and that's You know be on time and intact but there's in horrible things So, you know the whole thing is just extremely serious and so i've heard you use the word that Man, I don't think i've i've read the word since And heard someone else use it in in an actual And well, maybe this is the providence of god People don't even Use that word because it It sort of suggests that we're not in control that that this thing is not up to us after all But You also You're sort of speaking these These individuals who might not be able to tolerate What we've learned to accept as the providence of At least they're listening to you at least they're And a host of other people like verbecky and Jonathan Peugeot and for whatever ill Have happened in society look at these great voices that have emerged And the technologies that have allowed I mean, how long have you labeled in ministry? reaching You know, I know what it is to grow up in a smaller church in the middle of nowhere I have You know My great great grandparents minister there my grandparents on down to to my son myself Ever more than Of highs Of 80 to 100 people there and that'd be for like easter You never see those people ever again for the rest of the just you know, that's fine You know like a group of 40 people 60 people trying to do life together and so now you find yourself Conversations with yokels like myself, but then also guys like where did you have your company? Have you guys labored Just doing the necessary thing for year after year and then suddenly you make it About you know this phenomenon what's going on here and Your likes and subscribes suddenly start going up It's a bizarre phenomenon, right? Yeah. Yeah it is although You know, it's that's always the way life has been if you read Stories Your your videos your videos breaking up. It's sort of unstable, but I I was able to catch the gif of most of what you said um It's Life has always had that strangeness of selection where you know augustin is the bishop of hippo and You know augustin and jerome live at the same time in the world and jerome writes the vulgate and augustin Becomes the theologian of the west Just strange strange strange the way history rolls out and You know, I think you know, I really I think you articulated very well the The challenge that many students in the west are facing And the dissonance you know, it's one of the things that i've learned through this this journey has been We have a real problem with time span in that everything in our society has conditioned us to find solutions quickly easily and solutions that are Applicable, you know, what is the medical standard for for a drug? It has to be safe and effective, right? Well the kinds of things we're the kinds of things we're dealing with Uh there there is no safe and There's a lot of marginally effective and so What we've seen is sort of this cycle where Okay, so you so everybody throws off everybody throws off all of this religious belief and then a lot of other Things function as religions underneath the surface for them But because they're really not very good religions They you know, they they don't function well in people's lives and that then has manifestations in their practices and and I think I think part of What we've seen in divorce, you know where where you began in this conversation Is is one of the best examples of that and you know if you sit down with an unhappy couple Um, and I've had i've been on both sides of that table. Um, if you sit down with an unhappy couple You very quickly realize well these two people have All kinds of these two people have all kinds of very legitimate reasons to end this union And You know, these are very legitimate reasons and it could very well be that if if the goal that we have is some sense of Ratio of personal happiness to time spent maybe Splitting and finding someone else. That's the better way. Yeah. Okay Once you add children into that mix All of the math is different And and to such tremendous degrees and and the fact that the the curve on On the the divorce rates in this country, you know It was in the 70s that this thing sort of ramped up and it doesn't That's not too crazy when you think of all the people that got married in the 50s as a function of Now we know about trauma and soldiers and the second world war I mean if you just look at the history of the 20th century even in the united states, which has had which had just a dramatic, you know a Dramatically wonderful fortune in many ways for the middle to the end of the 20th century Even if you just look all at all this stuff with what we know You'd say well that That rise in divorce rates That's that's hardly a mystery given what we know happened in the 1940s and 50s and then um, and now given what we know well the You know these young people coming into the world with You know Issues in their trust foundations. Well, that's hardly a mystery Right what we know and and what's so amazing to me as i've been learning from jordan peterson and john Verbecky and doing all this work that i've been doing for the last couple of years is that What we so quickly do Is we forget? psychology for the sake of our religion now This is easy to Understand if you've been deeply embedded in a conservative church environment, which Especially for the latter part of the 20th century really until You know people the likes of larry crabb came along Christians and evangelicals conservative protestant people in america were very suspicious of Psychology wouldn't go to therapists, you know larry crabb comes along and suddenly, you know Evangelical churches have therapists on staff so on and so forth. They saw it. They kind of made peace with psychology to a degree but What's been interesting is that as these and I think john verbecky puts it together quite well as these pseudo religions Have developed underneath and of course peterson and verbecky kind of use different terminology, but they're really talking about similar things As these pseudo religions underneath kind of take hold well now suddenly These religious groups now, they're not calling them religions You know, they're they're calling it politics or they're calling it ethics or they're calling it morality or they're calling it progress But as these pseudo religions take hold well, they too now are starting to suppress um Psychology or science or all these other things and you know This is sort of how I before I found peterson. I was noticing these things and this is sort of how I got into this stuff because it was like These people who have overtly explicitly rejected religion Are acting so religious in all the dysfunctional ways i've seen church people do for decorating And it's like Wait a minute What's going on here? And i'm not religious you sure act like you're religious You sure act like you have a system a foundational system of moral and ethics But but as peterson and verbecky both I think say very articulately Yeah, but your religion really is stupid Okay Pointing to all These other people that you say their religion is stupid and yeah, they've got some stupidity in their religion, but At least as a kernel of their religion They actually have a whole bunch of battle-tested ideas that yeah, they've got some They've got some really dumb ideas about a whole lot of things and i'm not going to get specific with that But they got a whole bunch of dumb ideas about a whole lot of things But you know what they're usually not terribly consistent with their dumb ideas, which is really a good thing and A lot of the other ideas that are at the foundation of their religion that have been so battle-tested through the kind of Contexts of suffering that Make us look like wimps. Yes Absolutely that these ideas are actually so sound and so common sensical They're not they're not the spirit of geometry. They're not oh if you get married, then you'll be happy and your kids will do well No, if you get married and stay married chances are good You're not going to make a lot of the really painful mistakes that are so easy to grab onto But so devastating in the far longer run Because of the way that these practices and beliefs that have been encoded into moral maxims That communities have reinforced together um, you know there was wisdom in that that in this weird mixture of Anti-religiosity and embrace often of the only only the convenient Aspects of the sciences we wish to grab on to well, that's become a pretty lethal That's become a pretty lethal concoction for a generation now and that generation is starting to Get old enough because again, we're all on this curve So the sufferings you had as a kid when yeah dad got away from mom and then mom had a new boyfriend and dad had a Had a girlfriend that was just a few years older than my sister and You know and well everybody said nice things and played nice and if they had enough money We got nice presents under the tree But and those are the people we kind of saw on tv. We didn't see the people on tv That was what you know, chris r nate calls back row america, which is a really big group of people It's a bigger i've been actually living this way for a long time and then people I love that chris r nate Our neighbor because he he looks at this and says Coming out of kind of front row america Why are all these people religious? Is it because they're dumb? Yeah, we always kind of thought they were dumb because they never got good grades in school But you know, it's just beginning to dawn at a bunch of really smart people That there's wisdom built into human traditions and practices that Maybe they should think about a little bit and again it comes I I can understand the given the the nature of the quasi religious Ideas of the moment why people listening to a guy like jordan peterson say oh, he's a conservative You know In the united states spectrum, he's kind of sort of a moderate democrat really, um, but it's because they're just People just aren't seeing clearly and not thinking things through and And then what you I mean, it's very interesting The way The new moments in the culture war have kind of borne out that Psychologists were sort of on the the bleeding edge of the left for so long Now suddenly find themselves The bleeding edge is over here And and many of the really good psychologists are and social scientists are beginning to say hey, wait a minute uh, there's this little thing called data and It's really It's real And it used to be this religious group of people over there were resisting us Now there's this group of people over here that are really giving us a lot of heat and they say they're not religious and we used to be sort of political allies with them, but And and so now nobody quite knows where the boundary lines are because well, here we are man That is That's a hot take. I mean there's so much there that um Let me first start by laying some cards on the table. So If someone shows up in a black SUV, you know, i'm not Homicidal suicidal. I don't have any you know wishes to to die. I'm a safe driver. I wear my seatbelt. Um, so So I guess if you were to to say one thing, you know, what's your claim to fame thus far in your life as as a academic while I was um finishing my phd In my my master's program I did sort of a combination of cross-cultural communication and psychotherapy and so we would go to the pacific and again when people think of Say like hawaii a picture might come to your mind. Oh, it's a paradisal island, you know, but At the time where we went their service delivery system was just in shambles. And so It was kind of trying to figure out what can we do here? and There was I think that it more than almost any other real-time experience I had in academia that that experience changed my life because you're working for With and for people that had drifted in on a piece of wood Didn't know any language That that anyone could understand didn't know anything about anything but needed help And working through that um So the social service system they would call people out say we need these these people investigated because they're abusing their children And when you get there and you start dialoguing with them what it is is the parents would have the children Eating off the dirt They weren't making them eat dirt, but their belief system was that The Earth itself is like a maternal god and so the closer you can get to her the better off you are And so they thought they were doing their children an immense service By teaching them this and reinforcing it and From the perspective of you know the western mind to Who's in charge of going and investigating and saying what's culturally appropriate and inappropriate That to them looked a little bit like abuse. And so, you know once you once you start disentangling these things Um and Learn about those practices. It really then informs how you deal with With people and the kinds of things that would be resonant in practice You know, these are the things you'd want to talk about. These are things that are taboo um, and so working there it it really did change my perspective and There was this Like this excursion that we got to take and i'm trying to write about this right now and and I'm trying to have this conversation with people that are smarter than me Wiser than I am to to figure out how I can put this into words And so I was talking with burbecky about this that when when I was there I'm not an emotional person by nature. I just I don't cry a lot. Um It's just it's not I feel a lot, but I don't outwardly manifest that and so um We got to go to monicaia. So it's you know an extinct volcano and You're up above the clouds, which is already weird because you know On ground level, you know, you're wearing a tank top and some shorts and no one wants to see you wearing what i'm wearing Right now this is just absurd um, so you get up there and You're above the clouds. It's freezing cold and then as night is ushered in You get to go to the observatory and you look through these telescopes And you see things that you can't imagine And I saw the rings of saturn and I just started bawling. I was just like oh god, it's so beautiful There must be a god And my wife is she's so confused because of all things you're looking through a telescope just blabbering and As soon as I could I called my parents and I said, thank you so much And I was crying really hard and they were like, what are you what is wrong? What happened? How much money do you need? And so I I told them I was like no I just I just saw like the rings of saturn And my mom was kind of like what are you talking about? I was like um I'm on the top of a volcano The clouds are underneath us and there's no light there's no light pollution and so The visibility is unlike anything I'd ever experienced before And so there's this thing above me this sky these stars they've always been there but I couldn't perceive them and it's because of Whatever you want to call it civilization smog smog thought smog whatever I I know That the more christian you are you might say the the mind-blinding power of satan something like that Whatever you know term you would feel comfortable using it's This inability to see something that's foundational and that people have used for thousands of years to get where they're going to Navigate them to orient them to time place season We wouldn't have existed had they not been careful Studious about the stars and so My father was he was one of the Group of individuals that he was a nominee for going up in the challenger and so He was a big nasa guy my whole life and so You know I was crying because I got to see it I was also crying because they had made sacrifices that allowed me to see it and by making them meant they would never see it And so it was this You know if I could let you borrow my eyes for a minute you wouldn't believe it and so there's this this thing about perception I guess it's a long way of of getting to this notion that I think what we've done is Is the opposite of what they have going on there in hawaii where they have ordinances controlling light pollution and it's not just For the sake of the observatory the observatory benefits from the fact that culturally this is something that's very important to a long heritage of night Navigators by by ocean they would pay attention to the sun and when people scientists didn't believe that These polynesian navigators were able to do it. They have done it by stars navigating Immense distances and so I think what we've done is we've put this this substrata in between people And the thing that's transcended they they don't even know that it's there And if it is there they can't connect with it because of all this pollution that's in the way and so part of what I think I'm trying to do is say What you just said is if you haven't experienced immense suffering yet, you will And as jordan peterson would say, you know, you need to get your house in order but There is this very real sense that if Divorce as bad as it was for you at some point in your life. You will realize that the individual level of consciousness You're alone Your parents can't die for you Like they they can sacrifice themselves for you, but they themselves can't take on your death and so we've had a kind of disappearance of death a denial of death in the west whereas When I was in The developing world whenever you get something like bingay and Kind of looks there's there was a discussion that would go on like Is he just a weak gringo or is this? Immorality like is he gonna die? We don't know because we don't really know where he's from. Is he tough enough? But my friends would come by and they would just say You look all right, you know, I think you're gonna make it Some of them will be like man, you kind of look like my cousin My cousin didn't make it. So, you know do everything to Dr. Staley and I had this this this Experience of feeling like dear god, it's really a coin flip for them Like they're looking at my life and my life to them is literally a coin flip. I could live I could die Not i'm not saying that it wasn't a big deal to them. What i'm saying is it was such a part of their lives Whereas here in the states Try to do everything imaginable to save that life versus in a third world hospital, I was asking like Yes, they like what are you like? What are you giving me and they would just say like Um, this is calcium There's no way it was calcium. I know it wasn't calcium, but they did the best that they could for me and I live And that's all that I could ask but The way that we perceive things here in the states in in the west more generally I think that it is getting in the way Of this thing that's been so clear to people throughout the history of humanity when You know if you believe the standard account what? even thomas nagel And some of his companions are starting to say the neo darwinian account. It hasn't made room for consciousness we don't we don't really know what's going on there, but Even if we just came up through apes Like chesterton said there's not a point at which you see an ape drawing, you know He's he's holding a stick Scraggling something along the wall and then along comes a human hand and takes over and makes art It's it's not that narrative. We've been looking up our entire existence And something has happened to us where we no longer look up we And I guess the metaphor of the sky is just it's one that I mean we have so much light pollution It seems obvious to me that whenever I asked my students I was like when's the last time you you went and looked at it at the night sky They look at me like I have horns growing out of my and they're like, why would I do that? Like what what's the benefit? Well, there may not be any benefit but Humans have been doing it for a really long time and i'm not saying that just because we've done it for a long time Means we should perpetuate i'm just saying It's something that's so ubiquitous that we miss it and Something that people like you and jonathan and burvaki and peterson seemed to be able to do is a little bit like what I see comedians do When they take something that you've sort of known your whole life but then the way they say it it hits you and you're like I should have that should have been very obvious to me that that thing was absurd or this thing made way more sense than I thought it did um And so I think that you guys are are able to kind of speak to this this Visual agnosia where you're talking about people are acting in religious ways If you're dealing with a patient who has visual agnosia you give them an apple and you say describe the apple. That's uh, It's red. It's it's round. It has this little brown thing coming out of it and there's a little green Thing attached to it Uh, can I comb my hair with it? Like they can describe the apple What what's agnosia? So, I mean, I understand the greek of it, but I don't know so it's this inability to You can't Identify the thing that you know, like they know what it is They've actually described to you what an apple is but they don't know that this is an apple And so it's you know, it it's when the temporal lobe is affected in such a way you get things like cortical blindness Which more people are familiar with but then a far more intriguing case is the like the visual agnosia You can't remember you can't remember the thing I mean this has its roots probably if you wanted to analyze it like bervakia. You could go all the way back to Plato you can go back to socrates and talk about Their emphasis on remembering, you know, this is that's that's sort of the the point of of doing dialogue like this is so that you can remember the Phenomenal world the numinal world and how far you've fallen because you're just going to keep Living this thing until you're able to get up where like ultimate reality is But in a practical interesting thing though because you say well they can describe it But they don't know it's an apple and right there you're at the middle of you know, the the whole Vervecki Aristotle thing. Okay. Well, you're at the you're at the fight between you know, play it on Aristotle What is an apple? And you know peterson well, it depends if you act like it's an apple And you know No, that's that's a really that's a really terrific that's a really terrific illustration they can describe it But they don't know it's an apple and when you just use the word apple suddenly you and I connect In and you know part of the big the big Project that i'm working on is to try and figure out what is materiality what role does matter play in the drama Because you and I we can say well, they don't know it's an apple But you and I both have at least what both of us feel to be a connection Via this thing apple even though there's not a physical apple between us yet It's it's it's It would be different If we said they don't know it's a unicorn Yeah, you and I have had apple That is something that we share whereas unicorn Is not something that we share and even to describe the difference between those two realities Um, so anyway, i'm sorry. I interrupted you keep going. No, no, no, no, that's good and I mean i'm i'm riffing off what you you said about people verve keep talking about like they're these these autodidacts these You know These many religions that are that are popping up And if you ask them, is this a religion? It's like asking them if it's an apple Is what are you doing? Well, we have tenants we have, you know an organizational meeting. We have a bi-weekly newsletter We ask for your support donor support. We'll even send you a t-shirt or you know, something like that that you can pick um, but Um, we have strict laws about purity and um what counts as sacred to us and We have blasphemy laws if you say the wrong thing um and you know blasphemy is You know at least in the christian world that this that's the one you can't come back from And so there's no way back. Is it a religion? No, it's red it's round it has this brown thing coming out of it It has a little uh, if they knew what you know how to call it a leaf a leaf coming out But it can I comb my hair with it? So maybe this is No, but can I comb my hair with it? Um That's that's sort of the phenomenon that we're dealing with and I remember as a as a young guy being in in church when when sabbath and and the pastor he's He's saying, you know, there was this concept of My utmost for his highest and he said you guys have totally inverted this thing You've turned it into his utmost for my highest So that's a great line. I gotta steal that um So we've inverted what faith looks like and what what I see, um, and look I totally get it Because life is heart. It is full of suffering. I'm not saying it's only suffering But it is full of it And there is malevolence and then there's just stupidity as well Like some things happen because people are bad at what they do. They're incompetent Some things happen because people are truly evil um, some things happen because Um, it's a day ending in a why you know and sort of picking through which that is It's hard to do sometimes when it's stupid, you know but You know looking at this thing and And being honest about how hard it is I could see where you would pick and choose elements from Um classical Classical thinkers who would who would put forward things like Um stoicism. I mean there's a return to so stoicism right now. Yeah, okay, well which is fascinating It's extremely fascinating. You know epicureanism all of these great things um, but The one of the ones that I find truly interesting and I don't mean disrespect to anyone because I grew up as a byproduct of this era of As christians we were taught like you need to tolerate everyone's position and what what Interestingly happened with the postmodern flip on that is Right Everyone is right except for the person who claims to be exclusively right And it's well that sounds like you're excluding someone That's does it this doesn't make any sense at all. Everyone is equal except for the person who says we're more equal um I get that we need to draw from these great traditions, but I'm definitely not pointing this at verveky, but there are other Thinkers and atheists out there who it seems to me have hijacked Hey, that's a terrible word. That's an inflammatory word. I shouldn't use that they have used Practices from other religions. Um, so a famous case for me is as a sports fan You've got coaches who? They're using buddhist practices so that they can win more basketball games I mean there's There's few things that I can think of and you know, phil jackson you're on the west coast So you you know you will have You know, he was the linkers were the great nemesis of the sacramento kings in the little window. They were good So, you know phil jackson all of the sudden he becomes You know, he's not just a coach anymore He's a monk out there among men and he's zenned up And he's zinning out his team and all of a sudden the triangle offense works Because he's gotten down to the insights of what what buddha really meant How to beat your competitor how to in embrace? Um the fact that you should have no desires and empty yourself of everything except winning That's right. Except the the one desire that motivates the nba as a multi-billion dollar operation We'll let that one pass Can you imagine gandhi dunking on someone for millions of dollars, can you imagine and then trash talking? Yeah Buddha in that context and so I do find that fascinating just like people will point out the contradictions within christianity and using christ as a symbol for things that Are antithetical Yes, sure. I mean jesus died so you could have that lexus or at least so the pastor could have one That's important you should be judged on the kind of car your pastor is driving because after all Jesus's coat was seamless I don't know how many times i've heard that but that's that is a an example of prosperity i'm like he was living In first century palestine There's not even a comparison to the kind of uber world that we live in right now where you can have Any food any beverage almost anything that you can think of delivered to you If not immediately if you live in a big city then at least over a couple days jeff is going to make sure amazon gets that stuff to you and so That that in and of itself changes time changes your perception of time and materiality you've got your your work cut out for you because My grandmother um, she did she helped during world war ii she did a lot of the Phone work the operator work and you know She would tell us these stories about how they were trained to speak a certain way And so that people could you know often the lines were garbled so you had to be you had to enunciate very carefully and so She would tell us these wild stories of what that was like and then it's you know Almost eons have gone by In a matter of 50 and 60 years. So as she was approaching 90 she's on facebook and She asked my my wife and then one day what is a wall? What is a facebook wall? And this is before jordan peterson Was anywhere on the map? and I remember sitting there and I wanted to answer her question Fully, but then also do it simply and so I looked at what what is a what is a wall? Okay, so it's It's a Thing it's a place. It's a space you you write things on it You Wait a minute. None of that is true. Really like it's zeros and ones it It's it's not material in that sense It's not like any wall that you would have known of just like windows as an operating system Isn't like the thing you look out and you know see through But you didn't explain skew morphism to grandma grandma. Let's talk about skew morphism Right and so you find yourself in this world where we're I don't I don't buy this notion that we were never We were never not modern Yes Yes, we were There were times when we were not modern. That's just it's a naive thing to say and think because it shows That we have an immense amount of hubris and I do think that for whatever hubris Peterson may May demonstrate in his own life. That's between he and his maker or If he can't go that far, you know his archetypal hierarchical You know, I The acts the god he acts as if it exists, right? I mean right now I I would say you know He does bring a certain amount of Cultural and civilizational humility to at least point out how hard this thing is and that we have a role to play in it and that If you really analyze yourself one of the things that I think I didn't think this for many years but I accept it now especially having a child is you They're all barbarians it's your job to civilize them like they don't We were just on vacation and one of my brother's best friends is he brings his child over and he's only 14 months old but he my daughter is younger and smaller and so he just walks up to her and just you know, boom slams her down and You have to teach them you have to inculcate them that that like that's not what we do and We're sort of trying to play the games that lead to all possible games That's That's a difficult proposition when life is so hard and there is A subgroup of people out there who are just malevolent and as christians For a long time we had this deep humility about who we were and I Think that they you know the kind of positive psychology that infiltrated the church that that caused people to say no I'm not a worm. I'm not low Listen, man. I mean it you're not literally a worm. The whole point is that you should recognize That you get it wrong all the time and as cs lewis said if I being who I am and who I know myself to be can consider myself to be a christian I ought to probably cut people some slack and so I think that losing We could probably do better than just saying like for such a worm as I But I don't know how much better we could do than that. I mean that seems to be You know it gives you some sense of humility so that you approach the world and other people not assuming you have all the right answers and what it appears to me as as other thought leaders my colleagues They may not want to admit overtly that I can't get through this life Without something Something more than what I have and I refuse to call it a god-shaped vacuum in my heart. I'm going to call it social justice and see To show you how fast things have changed When when I was in my master's program I was a chair of social justice at lsu like art Our we were attempting though. We're trying to get like bed nets to people who are suffering from malaria Like that's that was my view of of social justice. So these things are happening so fast that you're being able to disentangle Materiality in a world that's becoming increasingly Dematerialized um, yeah That's a big and we'll all be happy to follow along the way and read what that you know looks like Because it's it's a fascinating journey and I don't In this space I hope that what we can try to do is start to Reach People that that they do need something tangible and I think that's a great way to start to think about it or for my own sake if I've lived a kind of life where Um There were so many times when I should have given up on god if you were not real Um, does that mean i'm a perfect believer? So I really do understand what peterson means with when he did the interview with bishop baron It's the weight of saying that that's so hard because it also means you've got to live a certain way and that hurts I mean the the notion that becoming a christian is going to mean um, you get a free car you can name it and claim it or The thing that i've seen recently which is the opposite like don't say you have cancer Don't speak that into existence. Don't well, how do you Yeah, how can you deal with the truth then how clearly worked well for steve jobs Yeah, how can you how can you get down to what the truth is speak truth and love and Move forward with something that's that's actually workable for you a treatment solution. Um, so it's not about the denial of What's happening? The questions the theodicy questions of suffering Why would a good god allow such things? I mean I find that I find it compelling I liked your video last week where you're like i'm not buying it because if everything were perfect You probably still would find a reason to to reject this and I completely get that but let's let's assume for a minute that I'll just lay all my cards on the table and say, you know when I I was studying at oxford. I was Studying with one of cs. Louis's protege and there and the tutorial system in oxford. It's so intense It's just you and that person and you're going at it and here in the us What I experienced at the university was you go into a class and so I did You know, I did the classics approach. I did the liberal arts approach from from my undergrad and Didn't listen to my parents who were like don't do that. It's a bad idea, especially if you go to a name School with you know some cache because you walk into the class and if it's a theology class The goal is to take a person who's a believer And turn them into a non-believer and they will state that explicitly You're in this class and you have faith raise your hand by the end of this semester. You will not it's like wait What is the name of this class? I thought I was here for a grade and a transcript Right, but this is you know, the elite harvard stanford princeton You know the the professors that have chops and so you As a young moldable mind assume that if they have Gotten that certificate. They've gotten that diploma. They've been certified by an institution as prestigious as that That what they're saying must be true, right? It must be true. They're luminaries in their fields They have status and we all look at them and we all play this game one way or another that elevate them. Yep And we can't work we confer it's why It's why ads work. It's why payton manning Being good at football. Also, he tells you where to go for insurance and you Assume that his expertise in a specific domain Translates we actually do that. And so when you hear their voice, you don't even necessarily recognize that's payton manning But you somehow Associate that voice with expertise and you should do this. You should go to you know You should buy omaha's tank or whatever Is putting out there But then whenever I got to oxford it was completely different because Because you were dealing with people that One of my professors had PhDs in five different fields. Wow 15 different languages and also taught Theology from a different perspective and I was like, wait a minute. I thought you were supposed to be You know knocking knocking this thing called faith down and So when I was working with francis warner He knew louis When louis lost his wife and it was just a brutal time and Watching someone of immense importance to the faith go through their own trial of faith They had a deep impact on him and then Getting to be associated in some way with that and hearing him say, you know these these textbooks that you're reading That's great but The intellect without the faith is like You know a skeleton Without breath, it's just lifeless and you've got you you need to Deal with that question yourself. You're going to have to wrestle with that that I didn't know that Some months later my life was going to change because I had this great scholarship that a lot of people had I had this great scholarship that allowed you to travel all over europe, you know, read the best books be at the best university and I come from a place where there are more cows than people People When I was growing up they still did this and I was an original migrant worker, you know, we picked whatever was in season whether it was Field things like peas Or in the fall something like that pecans you worked in the fields you did that and you raised pigs What the heck am I doing at oxford? You know, what is a person like this? No one in my family had ever done anything like this and so I was on top of the world everything seemed It seemed like if prosperity gospel was true. I was living it right It's going great And I just thought that it would be like that for in perpetuity Your life's just gonna keep getting better and better And all because you're so smart to know how to live it right unlike all those idiot people in the past Exactly all those other people today Yes, and and yes you it sort of creeps in it seeps into I must be doing something right and so a long story short I When I got back for my christmas break, um I was invited back to do my my grad studies there at oxford and And I came down with what my physician's called the perfect storm of illness. It's just a conglomeration of various things that hit something knocked my immune system out and then once it did I got attacked by all of these viruses and I got this horrible form of pneumonia And I was absolutely Bedridden for three and a half years. I lived in isolation Okay, I couldn't go anywhere. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't I couldn't even really speak I had to sign over power of attorney to my parents so that they could negotiate things with our insurance company And the thing is there were days Whenever I would look um Yeah, just be staring at the ceiling and When I would wake up it was like a groundhog day of suffering every day It was the same thing and so I would say you know god I don't know whether or not i'm going to praise you or curse you today But it would probably be one of those two things But the fact that What my physicians ended up telling me after all of this happened is the greatest miracle is not that you are better now It's that you somehow survive in a state of Extreme deprivation where there's not really a good explanation for that and so Again I came to academia with Trying to answer some questions that I had for What is the nature of existence like how how I experienced states of consciousness that a lot of other people Have not and will not until they're on their way out and there were so many times where I had those close calls that I would be lying to you if I said it wasn't scary and frightful but for someone Who was as young as me there was no I had no roadmap for this and so you have you meet with a lot of People that are that are wrestling with decisions and i'm not a preacher so i'm not gonna have an ultra call right here But i'm just saying like If you think your life is going great And it is Enjoy it be happy enjoy it be happy but No one has beaten father time yet you will run out of negative entropy at some point and and game over and so If it's not the suffering itself bodily or psychologically then existentially And so we've given Our youth nothing to deal with that Nihilism Let me tell you something when you are wracked by pain and you can't leave and you can't see anyone and you can't speak You can't walk. I was a college athlete. That's how I paid for my education I was working out in plankton as four hours a day Every day to go from that and traveling around the world to not being able to go to the bathroom on my own And having like, you know, my parents spoon feeding me again It it makes you realize that Life happens in such a way it unfolds itself in a way that you couldn't you couldn't ever predict But that In those moments You become more who you are you become like your real self is revealed and The amount of people that prayed for me the amount of people that wished me well See rather than having a problem of evil I think we have I think if you're not a person of faith and you have a problem of goodness The problem of goodness is inextricable to me Because there's no explanation for why even when I was suffering as extremely as I was Why I felt the mercy of god why I felt compassion Why other people cared about me at all and you can look there's only so far you can push this thing and say well Altruism is an outflow of selective pressures so that we would commune with one another and not kill one another Okay But there's there's still a problem of goodness that you could Experience moments of reverie and Lyrical moments with god even in the midst of that kind of suffering, um, so For me, it's just What? On day one nihilism failed. Okay. It didn't do me any. Okay, so nothing's over and then I die. Okay, awesome like then we're already here and so the question really is Start had it right or camu Both of them like why not end your life then that's right You know extend the amount of suffering you're going to do if in the end it doesn't matter anyway I'd say that's the wrong level of analysis that There would have been no way equally to predict that I'd be where I am now that I would have a wife who's just out of my league in every way and you know a baby that Makes every moment of that suffering Worth it There were things that I get to experience on the other side of it and maybe maybe there are people You know that you you speak with that That isn't the way it Felt for them. Yeah. Yeah, and and there's no comfort there in the sense that they didn't get better There's no recovery narrative. Yeah Um But i've experienced that you know in the life of my family as well and There'll come a day when there will be no recovery narrative for me I mean, that's a really grim thing, but I think we've done such a disservice. Yeah vervecki tells some some hilarious it's hilarious to me stories about you know his his Kid and his kids friends like not having what you would think of as like the kind of existential resiliency to Go through problems that you you would think Wouldn't ruin somebody but these We've just done them such a disservice by not having any kind of foundation for them At all and so I love the fact that you're Trying to rebuild that scaffolding that says Okay, then We're not reading a book of outdated cosmology. It's a different kind of narrative here um But i'd be interested for the people that that I interact with the students that I interact with what would you tell them? What's the place of the bible? Like what what would you say to them if they say then you know, what do I what do I do with this book? Yeah, it's so funny because as a preacher i'm supposed to be able to answer that and just kind of lay it down there Yes, you are. That's what you get paid the big bucks for. Yeah, the truth is in my experience. I mean Ironically people often ask me It's often parents whose children have gone a bit astray How can I get my child to watch jordan peterson and it's like well, this is a christian family asking me How can they can get their kid to watch jordan peterson? How can I get my child to watch jordan peterson? How can I get my kid to watch your videos and I usually say don't bother trying um if they you know, and what I tell people all the time is I mean the most powerful this is there's absolutely nothing new about any of this it is so It is so completely unoriginal That that it almost bears not saying but it's almost always the most obvious things that need the most repetition Which is you need to you need to Be you need to you need to be the thing that you want them to be That there's nothing more we can do. I mean it's it's jesus at the At the beginning of the book of acts and you will be my witnesses the whole you know the um The the disciples ask him when when will god restore the kingdom to israel? Which a lot of christians read that and they're like What kind of question is that? Well, that was actually the question that was on the mind of the christians Of the disciples throughout the gospels that jesus and the disciples just keep butting heads and jesus and everybody keeps butting heads over This question in the gospels when will you restore the kingdom to israel and jesus doesn't answer the question He says uh, you will receive power When the holy cut spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in in judaea and samaria to the ends of the earth and Well, that's a funny answer too especially because You know, I often tell people well if you if you live the life of jesus, you'll get what jesus got and People who have science some of this sort of this romantic idea about who jesus was think oh that sounds lovely And then if they read the bible at all, they'll say oh wait a minute I don't want to get what he got He seemed to have a fairly reasonable life until he starts this crazy ministry Then he leaves lives for three years seems to really tick a lot of people off To the degree that in the midst of a raging culture war political adversaries can only agree upon the fact that The world would be better if they shut him up by killing him Uh, that doesn't sound like a success strategy, but that's exactly what happened and well he had friends around him Yeah, but they pretty much all ran away Except for the politically insignificant people around him Which were the women and the youth who were the only ones who dared to show up at golgotha to watch him die and of that the only words they Remembered him saying apparently did not include Oh in three days i'm going to rise from the dead which was probably the craziest among all the other crazy Undiscernible things he said to the degree that the only people showing up on the tomb were the third on the third day Where the bunch of women who had the dirty work of an bombing and already smelly corpse So, you know the whole story is just nuts and so if you really want to if you really want to To to riff on jordan peterson a little bit if you really want to If you really believe that stuff and you want to share it with someone else The the only thing the best thing you can probably do is act as if it's true And and maybe along the way with all your yapping you'll say something that's of some use to someone and it'll probably be accidental I mean, it's at that level that we human beings actually live. It really is And so well, there you have it. You want to be of help? Why don't you begin by being like jesus? You'll do a bad job of it and you'll probably mess things up But and this is why you know people well, are you going to become orthodox or bro? It's like hey, i'm a protestant why i'm a calvinist very happy in my tradition And what i'm happy about my tradition is that we're finally saved Paul van der klee is finally saved not by his ability to mimic jesus but by jesus Ability to rescue this idiot and i'd much rather have my hope on jesus capacity than my own and so that's why I remain as I am and so That's You know, i'm in in many ways people don't believe me when I say in many ways I'm a very simple man. I have simple tastes and when it comes to my religion, it's pretty simple That if I have to choose on who's doing the rescuing me or jesus i'd rather trust in him than trust in me Sure, and that's to me the bottom line. So when people like well, what can I do to be helpful? Wow, why don't you just why don't you learn a little bit about who jesus is and start acting like him and maybe in a moment where I think it completely lines up with my latest videos with how we Instinctively respond as people you might try talking to him And I know it's a little crazy and it's so funny because when you get into a christian worship service people are nitpicking about What's the style of music or that style of music or these words or that words? Well in this secular frame, it's just completely nuts They were all singing songs to what we represent as a man in the sky and hoping he talks back And a lot of the lovely little old ladies who have had a whole lot of suffering in their life say things like Well, jesus answers prayer and all of us skeptical educated people say i'm not so sure Yeah, but that little old lady has suffered and lived and done a whole lot of things that some of us young smart people You know have for all of the books that we've read. Yeah, the truth is we don't know a lot I like your skeleton illustration. So we do not know very much at all and and The kind of limits that we have what is available for us to know is also constrained by the fact that um I've written this 12 million dollar grant that the federal government um, it Accepted and funded over four years to make sure that people in rural areas were getting the array of services that they needed um for treatment and um looking at that doing study and finding out, you know Why are these why are so many people? Who are so young struggling so mightily with mental health? and having like the worst diagnoses out there and so While working for the government It's just wild the kind of things that you would see that like studies would be embargoed that I'm not trying to start a conspiracy theory. What i'm trying to say is that Incompetence and malevolence are real and that If you have a self-interest and there's a report or a study that's been commissioned that's going to make you look bad during an election period You put the kibosh on it. But what happens is you're never fully in touch with what scientists would consider up-to-date truth and so I'm i'm dealing in the midst of of two cases right right now. The first one was um, I won't say his name because he's a prominent researcher at a prominent university and he came down with Leukemia and it just so happens that He's a research oncologist and so The kind of leukemia that he has there was no hope for him based on the current model of treatment and so It happens to be the case that I was working with another physician Putting together a study that looked at the transmission of a particular disease through Parent to child Was there a vertical transmission? That's what I that's the only way I came to know this guy and He shared his data with me that Because he had access to a lab and because he was an N of one he could really just test himself to the nth degree And so he put himself on a different type of drug regimen than anyone else would have And what the data shows is well one he's still alive and this has been Probably about five years running and that every data point as his numbers would Would get worse. He would interject another medication of this type and boom it would respond. So there's a clear dose response And when I asked him was like why are you using why are you reaching out to you know? piddly Nobodies, you know at at a state school to look at your stats and things of that nature and he was like listen where It's just a fact that we happen to be funded by Pharmaceutical companies that's who? Funds a lot of our research nobody wants to see the fact that this alternative approach worked and i'm not talking about Cures, they don't want you to know about this is not you know, some kind of homeopathic remedy book or something like that I'm actually talking about a leading research scientist Up against existence with no possible chance to live. So he tried something novel and it worked. Yep But it might not work for anybody else or everyone but right it worked for him it's an end of one and it's an Interesting and important research. Yep, but he's been shut down by the research community. Yep, which is interesting that that scapegoating and blasphemy laws Have sort of been been reinstituted but it's precisely at those places that The common person feels That they have no argument against. Yep in the realms of science. It's in the realms of philosophy where Some of this is taking place. But if you don't know it, you don't know it. Yep. So I I think they're making the the smarter Pascal's wager they're they're putting their money on the right thing. Yeah, because the the truth that You never have informed consent really you never really know the truth. No, no, so I think we've done Not that we can't do better, but we've done about as good a job as we can to this point and Much room left to go. And so um I have to we have to land the plane here kyle because I got I got some stuff I got to do and I got another Conversation in about five minutes. So and then the but the the lady that runs the child care center has called me twice So it's like oh homeless person a building problem Clogged toilet, you know, that's that's the that's the scope of my life As we say in the biz handle your scandal that's like Well, this has been a delight kyle I'm gonna send you this video and you look at it and and then we can decide what we do with it All right. So so wonderful to spend some time with you. Yeah, this is a delight kyle. We should talk again All right. Sure thing. Take care You too. Bye. Bye
