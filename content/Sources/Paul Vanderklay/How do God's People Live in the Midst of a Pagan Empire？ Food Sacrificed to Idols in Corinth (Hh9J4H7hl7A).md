 Hi, this is Paul and this is rough draft for Sunday where I run through the current version of my Sunday sermon in 2001 the Taliban destroyed the world's largest Buddha statue and They justified the destruction of these very old Silk Road statues Because they claimed that these were in a front to Islam. They're located in in central Afghanistan had been there obviously for a number of centuries, but they dynamited them and they are gone today They are giving tours of the area now without statues Question for you is were these idols? Was it a good thing for them to destroy these idols or was it a bad thing? How should Christians regard such things? are these merely Cultural Culturally significant items that should be preserved as elements of antiquity or are they? Idols that cause people to stumble. How about Protestants Protestants have this legacy of of destroying Destroying such statues now It's a little easy to talk about Islam in Afghanistan. Well, what about the temple of Athena? Greece has been Christian for a very long time and I would imagine that the Greeks have a degree of pride about these ruins of temples all the way back in the Going back to the ancient period. Is this a religious site? Is this a cultural site? Is it worth preserving or should it be destroyed as an affront to God and Christianity that this pagan temple remains? and again Chris Christianity has been in Greece and dominant in Greece for a very long time we're gonna look at this question today of meat sacrifice to idols and I like the way Kenneth Bailey approaches this in his book Paul through Mediterranean eyes because he sees this as a basically a case study of a much larger question which is How in fact does the God who revealed himself in Sinai to Israel that he liberates from Egypt How do they then how is that God then worshipped in the broader pagan Roman Empire? It's the question of the God of Israel and the Gentile world and these kinds of questions we have by no means left behind So Kenneth Bailey sees this essay starting in chapter 8 and going all the way to the beginning of chapter 11 And there's an outline that he has here foods offered to idols freedom and responsibility Paul's personal freedom and responsibility 9 1 2 18 freedom and mission 9 19 to 27 Old Testament sacram sacraments and idolatry partial identification beginning of chapter 10 new covenant sacraments and idolatry no identification chapter 10 and then coming back around to Conclude the section Paul then finishes his study on food sacrifice to idols freedom and responsibility a final word to wrap up chapter 10 Bailey says the overall essay focuses on the question of how Christians are to live out their lives in a pagan world Are they to accommodate to that world and if so to what extent are they to blend in or stand out? The question of food offered to idols offered Paul a concrete case study for a discussion of this critical concern As he notes this topic is extremely sensitive at the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 The Apostles agreed to request Gentile believers to abstain from what was sacrificed to idols What was sacrificed to idols for a Jew such food was strictly prohibited some Gentile believers inevitably thought this requirement was unnecessary if idols did not exist well God's behind the idols that is then why the restriction most of the meat available Was first offered to one of many idols and then sold in the market in the ancient city of Corinth was virtually surrounded by pagan temples and the great archaic and the great archaic temple almost overshadowed the meat market he goes a little bit further a Greek pagan by the name of Palsenius traveled through traveled across Greece in the mid second century and wrote description of Greece which has survived discussing the central Agora the market square of Corinth Palsenius mentions temples and statues for Dionysus Artemis Bacchus for fortune Poseidon Apollo Aphrodite Hermes Zeus Zeus of the underworld Zeus most high and of the Muses Two general markets hugged the wall of the great archaic pagan temple and a fish and meat market were across the narrow street on The west side of the Agora of the Agoura there was a huge temple dedicated to the imperial cult all of this was within 150 yards of the center of the town The sacrifices were the property of priests of the various temples and what the priests could not eat they sold During the numerous feasts there was an inevitable glut in the meat market and the prices would drop accordingly For many of the poor of the city which certainly included at least some of the Christians That was probably the only time they could afford to eat meat Furthermore if a person didn't ask the butcher or he he or she would not know whether a particular piece of meat had been Offered to an idol or not. None of the idols existed anyway, or none. There were no gods behind the idols So why not enjoy some rarely affordable beef or lamb? Now this actually gets into what is a very interesting conversation About how in fact does the Bible regard these pagan idols? There's a very interesting book the religion of Israel that makes the point that Part of what's really unusual about the Old Testament is that these idols are stock and stone. They're wood and stone they're nothing and The Old Testament regards them of that. So are they nothing or later in the Christian tradition? Their covers for demons were they human constructions trying to account for the mysterious world we live in These would be the kinds of ideas that you'd see arise in the secular period Where they confused dreams reaching out to the one true God? Was was there a significant transition after the writing of the Old Testament? Now Paul begins here in chapter 8 now about food sacrifice to idols We know that we all possess knowledge and as I've mentioned in the last few weeks pay attention to the quotation marks in your contemporary translations Because the assumption here is that this is what the Corinthians are saying to Paul. This isn't necessarily what Paul is teaching Paul continues then but knowledge puffs up while love builds up Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know But whoever loves God is known by God now the Corinthian Elite are call themselves the mature and as what often happens when people become wealthy or very successful in the society they believe themselves to be experts on just about everything because Whether they have sort of a divinized version of it that they are somehow blessed by God as exhibited by Their good fortune in the world or whether they've earned their way by their smarts or education or whatnot They now are experts on everything and so they are instructing Paul that we all possess knowledge Meaning they possess knowledge and why should Paul lecture them? Now Paul doesn't challenge them directly on the knowledge front But challenges knowledge as such or at least as they are exhibiting it Paul warns that about being puffed up by that knowledge But knowledge puffs up while love builds up so he contrasts knowledge with love He points them to knowledge gnosis to love points them from knowledge to love as the truly as The truly godly Quality Then he says something that we think is opposite we imagined He said well those who love know God, but he says those who love are known by God Now in our Sunday school class at 930. We've been wrestling with this question of the source of righteousness It's a great concern Plato wrestled with it Paul wrestles with it in the book of Romans Where do the godly get their godliness from what is the source of that godliness? It's you know a remarkably difficult question even today We have ideas of well were they were they raised right are they intelligent is it their temperament? Is this nature or nurture? Righteousness is the engine of goodness in the human heart and It's a mystery of what my what makes one person righteous and the other person corrupt Now Paul now introduces to be known by God and in fact the one who loves is known by God basically saying or at least implying that one's capacity to love is evidence of God's knowledge of the person or perhaps God's favor or a gift of God upon the person and to the person Bailey goes on The term to know is biblical language for the marital relationship and for the linking of to love and to know Reaches into the heart of intimacy God's love is always there searching for the faithful the act of accepting that love opens the flow of love from God to the believer and Through the believer to the world of course we see this most clearly in Christ The father in the parable of the prodigal son loves his son from the beginning But only as the son accepts being loved did that love become a life-changing force in the son's life One of the things that Kenneth Bailey has written more extensively about than just about anyone is Luke 15 Paul tells his readers that the one who loves God is known by him Pick it up chapter 8 verse 4 So then about eating food sacrifice to idols we know that an idol is nothing at all in the world again within Quotations we can assume that well the editors are assuming that this is what the Corinthians are asserting and stating and That there is no God but one and so these Corinthians for all of their Troublesome ideas have at least embraced that there is only one God There is only one God For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven or on earth as indeed many of them As indeed there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is but One God the father from whom all things came and for whom we live And there is but one Lord Jesus Christ through whom all things came and through whom We live now This is actually the center of his argument and there's a lot of debate as to whether or not this is this very stylized Section that I put in the red box is in fact a christian hymn that perhaps Predates the writing of this book could be from Paul could be from someone else, but it's sort of a nice It's a nice formulation of Christology in this section Now there's a lot of repetition. That's pretty much what What poetry does and so then you look for the differences one God? One one God the father from whom all things came For whom we live and there is but one Lord Jesus Christ Through whom all things came and through whom we live Now when it comes to the question of how to regard these ancient gods This gets very complex very quickly and doesn't get any less complex in the modern period as we think of all kinds of structures and All kinds of structures and Spiritual influences let's phrase it that way Because well, there are many gods and lords So those ancient gods were clearly functioning in the minds and lives of the people You can find a lot of conversation in the christian commentaries using very fancy philosophical words such as ontology Or psychology with respect to these What Paul is making clear is that not only is this one god claim a claim of existence There is only one god, but also when you go from god to lords You're also talking about function in people's lives The key movement in the little poem Is the change in the prepositions? The father for For whom all things came or from whom all things came and for whom we live That god the father is the source and the destination And there is one lord Jesus Christ through whom all things came through whom we live Jesus Christ is the manner Through whom all things came and through whom we live But not everyone possesses this knowledge now that's really a key move that paul makes because In many ways they are saying well we the elite know best we have this knowledge in other words The rest don't and paul says that's right the rest don't Some people are still accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food They think of it as having been sacrificed to a god a functioning god and so Since their conscience is weak it is defiled now This is also very tricky because When we read the word conscience we have Sort of a mental narrative about what that means and it's usually something predominantly Psychological the greek word behind conscience is quite a bit more Mythological your conscience is your helper. It's not really too dissimilar from let's say jiminy cricket in panokia And your conscience is your helper almost a spirit helper We would think of it as a psychological helper that is supposed to lead you to the good Now what paul is saying is that well y'all might imagine that you're full of knowledge and you have this Very sophisticated view that there's nothing behind all these idols. So Eating this meat is something indifferent But you're in fact in relationship with people who are not seeing it that way And their spiritual guide their conscience The jiminy cricket on their shoulder is weak now you all imagine you're mature. You're brilliant You're elite but these other people aren't and in fact What you really have to think about is not so much your knowledge But rather the relationship of love that you have with these others So since their conscience is weak it is defiled it is stained it is sullied their helper No longer leads them in a path of purity and strength But in fact leads them away from christ and leads them back into the ignorance where they once lived But food does not bring us near to god We are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do Now again paul might seem quite secular here but his point here is the fact that What the elite and the mature and the strong should be thinking about is the rest of their community The purity the integrity the single-minded single-hearted devotion to god is corrupted by the gods And participation in them for the weak Be careful, however that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak For if someone with a weak conscience sees you with all your knowledge Eating at the idol's temple Won't that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to an idol? So this week brother or sister for whom christ died Is destroyed by your knowledge that now that for whom christ died of course accentuates love builds up Knowledge puffs up in other words knowledge is weaker When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience You sin against christ in other words, maybe in and of itself eating that meat isn't a sin for you In terms of your relationship with loving god But it is it very well may be a sin in terms of your relationship of loving your neighbor or your brother or sister in christ as yourself Therefore if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin I will never eat meat again So that I will not cause them to fall So the question really is am I my brother's keeper and the answer is yes The wise the smart the urbane the sophisticated the knowing ones that have a love Have a love obligation to those for whom participation in the temple might put them on a slippery slope back to an old way of life That they are struggling to emerge from They might not sin against god in eating the meat, but they might be sinning against the body of christ now As we saw in this little poem christ is the manner and the means that we navigate life in a pagan world One god the father for whom all things came from whom all things came for whom we live And there is but one lord jesus christ through whom all things came through whom We live and what paul is saying as is consistent through the book It is in fact the love of christ that we must keep our eye on and that should be what guides us in our relationships With a world which is far from christ Now navigating these issues is by no means easy And we have many missteps and there have been many missteps through history we blithely think oh if we love then it's clear Mistakingly think that love is somehow about nice or benign libertarian feel good you do you In other words even paul's admonition to love Confuses us we think oh we'll love our neighbor We think oh we'll love our neighbor let's have our neighbor do basically what they want well you might not be able to control or guide your neighbor, but What is going on in your neighbor's heart is your concern love is something as costly as the cross of christ The cross of christ is the manner and the means by which christians operate And have to make their decisions in this complex world We have dramatic freedom and paul doesn't take any of that away Let us use our freedom in love for our brothers and sisters knowledge puffs up love builds up Now What we ought to seek is in fact to be known by god Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know and that's all of us to one degree or another But whoever loves god is known by god And in fact it ought to be that righteousness from the inside out That we seek from him that righteousness that is in fact Right at the center of the table When jesus meets with his disciples Just before he would be betrayed and turned over To the cross he broke bread and he gave it to them And he said this is my body broken for you do this in remembrance of me
