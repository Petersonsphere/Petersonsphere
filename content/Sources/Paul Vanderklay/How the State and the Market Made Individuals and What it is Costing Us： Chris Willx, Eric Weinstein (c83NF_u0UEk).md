 Hi, this is Paul. Eric Weinstein was on Chris Williamson's Modern Wisdom podcast and I haven't ever quite figured out what I think about Eric Weinstein. There are moments when he says just really brilliant things and that there are other times when he's talking that I think he just keeps saying, no one is trustworthy in the world except for me and the people that I think are on my side and he goes off a lot into we've got to get off this planet so that's I listen to him sometimes and there are moments when I think wow that was that was really good and then other times he says stuff and I think, ugh, this is and that's sort of how Eric always comes across to me. Let's start at the beginning here where he says some really interesting things about family. I say before about how a lot of the time you don't realize the last time you're going to do a thing with a person and a lot of friends especially ones that are fathers have told me the same thing the last time that you'll bounce your daughter on your knee you don't know when it's gonna happen but it's gonna happen there's also a really... And I remember that I remember with my youngest child who's a boy I remember because the kids you know they wake up in the middle of the night they get scared and they come into bed with you and they sleep with you and on one hand it's always kind of awkward because it's elbows and knees and it might even wet your bed for you or you know you never you never quite know what you're gonna get and I remember our youngest one I don't remember how old he was but I remember him crawling into bed and I thought to myself I wonder if this is the last time and I remember when I was this was I think it was when it was at one point when we were doing deputation we were staying in Grand Rapids in a mission house and my parents were coming for a visit and we had them sleep in there was a double bed or a queen bed or something in one of the bedrooms that my wife and I usually slept in and so I had my parents sleep there and we slept in it my wife and I slept in a twin bed we're young and skinny and and and one of my kids I don't some oldest son or my second I think was about oldest son of the second son came into the bedroom and climbed in thinking he was with mom and dad and then my mother woke up this morning said oh we had a visitor in the night and she just she just enjoyed it because of course they stop and and there that she got to via the grandchild she got a chance to to relive that so that's precious a strange realization when you get deeper into adulthood and work out that probably by the age of 18 or 20 you've spent 97 or 98 percent of the time you're gonna spend with your parents and all that you wanted for the last four years was to be away from them and now all that you want is to have a little bit more time and it's all gone and you and I never wanted to be away from my parents a great parents but I do remember so after college we lived in the Dominican Republic and then after that we moved here to California and somewhere in the back of my mind I always thought well I'll live by my parents a lot more time and of course my both of my sisters lived quite a bit closer to my parents and their kids got to know my parents better than my kids got to know my parents and then my father died and now my mother's getting up there she's in great health but I just don't know that I'll ever live in the East Coast again and so there's something sad about that and and again as a Christian I have the consolation that I don't know how it will work in the next life but I don't think we'll have the same time limitations we do and so I will get to spend more time with my grandparents who I didn't necessarily spend a lot of time with as a kid and I'll get to spend more time with my parents and so that's part of the consolation of everlasting life squandered it while it was there I'm on the ethnic program we don't believe in this stuff my I don't think his kids are very old my children don't become adults at the age of 18 I don't care about the laws of the United States or the state of California now that is true but what he's about to say now was the first time I've ever this is this was an example of Eric Weinstein saying something that I thought was brilliant but then I'm gonna qualify it I think we do family wrong in the States well you send them off to college and then you tell them go follow your dream and they bounce into some locality that you aren't in and you don't get the benefit of these very strong families because the market has been so strong in the US for so long the market more or less took over all sorts of duties that were assigned to families historically and so the reason that people always say oh your families are weak it was because our markets were strong right and so insurance and opportunity all of these things that um could be handed over to the market were and as a result when we find out that the markets are not safe we we realize that we've abandoned the structures that we needed to retreat to that our families are quite small below replacement rate very often and we don't live in the same place and so you know I married a woman from India and I basically carry a lot of eastern European norms and so my feeling is that my children are my children forever and I'm not letting go of them and this idea that it's your life and you can do what you want is only true up to a point you also have a continuity issue and this is normal by the way and it may sound weird in an American context but I think that the world recognizes that we're links in a chain and there's a certain amount that you get to do that's just yours because it's your life but never go full Billy Joel it's my life Billy Joel that's what he referred to yes and I I'm glad that he mentioned the market it's interesting because I've read this a number of times in videos and some of you have watched all my videos know that I've read a number of times in videos and markets are mentioned look at this all this changed dramatically over the last two centuries the industrial revolution gave the market immense new powers provided the state with new means of communication and transport and placed the government's disposal an army of clerks teachers policemen and social workers at first the market and the state discovered their path blocked by traditional families and communities who had little love for outside intervention parents and community elders were reluctant to let the younger generation be indoctrinated by nationalist education systems conscripted into armies or turned into rootless urban proletariat it's also helpful to remember that humans my great great grandfather sent my great grandfather when he was 18 years old uh through Rotterdam over the ocean into Ellis Island all the way through America to western Michigan in order to make a way for them to go so the family did hold together but uh they also left all of the rest of their family and it appears they left all the rest of their family because my great great grandfather married married dutch instead of jewish and so out of the community they went but this was the rise of the individual over time states and markets used their path their growing power to weaken the traditional bonds of family and community the state sent its policemen to stop family vendettas and replace them with court decisions the market sent its hawkers to wipe out long-standing local traditions and replace them with ever-changing commercial fashions yet this was not enough in order to really break the power of family and community they needed the help of a fifth column the state and the market see i i'd always just read the state boy perception is so tricky the state and the market approached people with an offer that could not be refused become individuals they said marry whomever you desire without asking permission from your parents take up whatever job suits you even if community elders frown live wherever you wish even if you cannot make it every week to the family dinner you are no longer dependent on your family or your community we the state and the market will take care of you instead we will provide food shelter education health welfare and employment we will provide pensions insurance and protection romantic literature often presents the individual as someone caught in a struggle against the state and market nothing could be further from the truth the state and the market are the mother and father of the individual and the individual can survive only thanks to them the market provides us with work insurance and pension if we want to study a profession the government schools are there to teach us if we want to open a business the bank loans us money if we want to build a house construction companies build it and the bank gives us a mortgage in some cases subsidized or insured by the state if violence flares up police protect us it's a little interesting because later on he'll talk about the fourth amendment and he'll say you know we have police people say want to disband the police but then you know what about the second amendment what about I mean those things stand in relation to each other if we are debilitated for months national social services step up if we need around the clock assistance we can go to the market and hire a nurse usually some stranger from the other side of the world who takes care of us with the kind of devotion that we no longer expect from our own children if we have the means we spend our golden years at senior citizens homes tax authorities treat us as individuals and do not expect us to pay the neighbor's taxes the courts to see us as individuals and never punish us for the crimes of our cousins not only men but also women and children are recognized as individuals throughout most of history women are often seen as the property of family or community modern states on the other hand see women as individuals enjoying economic and legal rights independent of their family and community they may hold their own bank accounts decide whom to marry they may even choose to divorce or live on their own but the liberation of the individual comes at a cost many of us now bewail the loss of strong families and communities and feel alienated and threatened by the power the impersonal state and market wields over our lives states and market compose an alienated individual can intervene in the lives of their members much more easily than states and markets composed of strong families and communities when neighbors in a high-rise apartment building cannot even agree on how much to pay their janitor how can we expect them to resist the state the state the deal between states markets and individuals is an uneasy one the state and the markets disagree about their mutual rights and obligations and individuals complain that both complain that both demand too much and provide too little think about um think about oliver anthony rich men north of richmond they're not doing enough think about john meet john doe they're not doing enough we protest the government the government should be there to provide for all our needs but hopefully not at a european tax rate or a canadian tax rate for breaches countless generations of human social arrangement millions of years of evolution have designed us to live and think as community members within a mere two centuries we have become alienated individuals nothing testifies better to the awesome power of culture the nuclear family did not disappear completely from the landscape when states and markets took from the family most of its economic and political roles they left it some important emotional functions the modern family is still supposed to provide for intimate needs which states and markets so far incapable of providing and this is where ai and how many other things sort of come to the fore the modern family is supposed to provide yet even here the family is subjected to increasing interventions the market shapes the market shapes to an ever greater degree the way people conduct their romantic and sexual lives whereas traditional family was the main matchmaker today it's the market that tailors our romantic and sexual preferences then lends a hand in providing for them for a fat fee previously bride and groom met in the living the family living room and money passed from the hands of one father to another today courting is done in bars and cafes and money passes from the hands of lovers to waitresses even more money is transferred to the bank account of fashion designers gym managers dieticians cosmetologists plastic surgeons who help us arrive at the cafe looking as similar as possible to the markets ideal of beauty the state too keeps a sharper eye on family relations especially between parents and children in many countries parents are obliged to send their children to be educated in government schools and even where private education is allowed the state still supervises and vets the curriculum parents who are especially abusive or violent with their children can be restrained by the state if need be the state may even imprison the parents or transfer their children to foster families not long ago the suggestion that the state ought to prevent parents from beating or humiliating their children would have been rejected out of hand as ludicrous and unworkable in most societies parental authority was sacred respect of and obedience to one's parents were among the most hallowed values and parents could do almost anything they wanted including killing newborn babies selling children into slavery marrying off daughters to men more than twice their age today parental authority is in full retreat youngsters are increasingly excused from obeying their elders whereas parents are blamed for anything that goes wrong in the life of their children mom and dad are about as likely to be found innocent in the freudian courtroom as were defendants in a stalinist show trial like nuclear families the community could not completely disappear from our world without any emotional replacement markets and states today provide most of the material needs once provided by communities but they must also support tribal bonds markets and states do so by fostering imagined communities that contain millions of strangers and which are tailored to national and commercial needs as imagined community as community of people who don't really know each other but imagine that they do such communities are not novel inventions kingdoms empires and churches functioned for millennia as imagined communities in ancient time china tens of millions of people saw themselves as members of a single family and the emperor as their father in the middle ages millions of devout muslims imagined that they were all brothers and sisters in the great community of islam yet throughout history such imagined communities played second fiddle to intimate communities of several dozen people who knew each other very well the intimate communities fulfilled the emotional needs of their members and were essential for everybody's survival and welfare in the last two centuries the intimate communities have withered leaving imagined communities to fill in the emotional vacuum this morning i caught richard beck's latest blog which i found really interesting addiction and modernity i recently had a conversation with someone about addiction and in that conversation i made reference to kent dunnington's argument in his book addiction and virtue in what follows i'm reshaping a 2017 series about addiction and virtue this is also a timely series given their the recent attempt concerning increasing rates of death of despair dunnington makes the case that addiction can be viewed as prophetic criticism of modernity addiction points to locale locations where secular modernity has failed to deliver vital existential and social goods this very much sort of comes into harari's points that he was making about the market and the state addiction fills the voids created by modernity patching up its existential and social holes consequently wherever we see addiction we see failures of modernity addiction in this view serves as an implicit critique and rebuke of modernity this is how dunnington described this in the preface to addiction and virtue a thesis of this book is that the prevalence and power of addiction indicates the existent the extent to which society fails to provide non-addictive modes of acquiring certain kinds of goods necessary for human welfare addiction is therefore an embodied critique of the culture which sustains it i propose that addiction as we understand it is a particular modern particularly modern habit and that addiction can be viewed as a mirror reflecting back to us aspects of modern culture that we tend to overlook or suppress persons with severe addictions are among those contemporary prophets that we ignore at to at our ignore to our own demise for they show us who we truly are addiction back to back addiction thrives because it uniquely and particularly addresses the failure of modernity to offer us any compelling vision of the good life fascinating now i want to switch back to the end of the conversation with chris williamson and eric weinstein which i thought was actually the best part of the whole video there were some other good moments in between but the end i thought where chris really sort of stepped up i thought it was very good so what we're in is some sort of warfare for mindshare and i'll be honest i'm not seeing high level interactions the way i was five years ago between people what's happened i think that they've done a pretty good job of disconnecting us you remember the old data and society report where you looked at chains of association and the whole game was to tie everyone back to milo enopolis or something i so i got to interject i go to qatar to do this debate about masculinity about six months ago and they put up on one of the segments i was pro-traditional masculinity and there was a gentleman on the other side and they said here is a montage of some unspeakable people that represent masculinity and there was joe rogan and jordan peterson and blah blah blah blah blah but the first person was milo enopolis i said look if you have brought me to the middle east to defend milo enopolis i did you have brought the wrong person i'm like you know that we need to shift that get that to one side milo can go over there do you see his debate with destiny that you know a couple of weeks ago maybe three months ago now milo looked like a old touring singer in a rock band still doing the shows but can't hit the high notes anymore wow and he the whimsy yeah and that sort of playful jester joker kind of game gamesmanship had been abandoned in place of bottom of the barrel backbiting and genuine emotional sniping and then destiny said after he's been pushed and pushed and pushed for 90 minutes yeah he says to destiny uh back in the olden times they would have left your kind on the side of a hill a hill to die and destiny said well i think that the gays would have been left there first milo said well i don't think that you can tell whether a baby's going to like dick when it comes out or not destiny said well you'd know all about young boys liking dick wouldn't you wow and it broke milo it broke his brain so what sorry what was that and no one had any sympathy because for 90 minutes he'd called destiny's wife a public flashlight he'd said everything under the sun why are we dealing with these people because it is entertainment it is mental masturbation it a story about people will always be more seductive to a broader group than a story about ideas and we're completely disconnected from these people we're relating to them in terms of somehow some part some some imagined community tribal connection unlike the great divide of right versus left it's a poor substitute for community dears got it i think am i wrong i don't know i just despairing so much stuff so much beauty in this world and i just i wonder at what point does middle school lunch table when you compare it to amino acids you compare it to you go scuba diving i have done i suck what's the most beautiful place you've gone scuba dive uh gilly tee off the coast of bali okay i remember scuba diving off menjungan island in bali i can't tell you how little i care about milo vianopoulos and how much i care about scuba diving in the red sea i don't know maybe i'm just to talk to each other and then this thing started dividing us you know you started seeing all these messages oh your boy said this your boy said that time to come collect your boy he's like who talks like this um the internet and then we stopped seeing each other in our feeds and i said well oh this is vijaya gade under jack dorsey jack had gotten some system whereby he took his hands off it because he knew that terrible things had to be done i think and he just had this idea well if i have to intercede at twitter then something has gone wrong with the system and you had this person who was just very happy bringing health to the to the internet but it disconnected all of us it was very clear that our engagement just dropped and then if you complained about it it was because you actually sucked and nobody cared about your tweets you had no idea where you were and so all of this kind of good feeling evaporated in part because people didn't know how to fight as a as a team and this is just i would love to get back to the masculine masculinity riff a little bit now i want to play something and i hope hope it doesn't get me in trouble so i'll withhold your name but if you if you go back to my meet john doe video hans georg mueller had made a video before about oliver anthony and then it pulled it down now somehow one of my viewers got a hold of some of this video and this is really quite good and it's exactly what we're talking about rather than seriously engaging with the actual working class problem addressed in the song over time hours for bullshit pay it is primarily observed in the mode of second-order observation less than observing the song itself the media focus on observing how it is observed in short the public is warned not to like the song to avoid being labeled as right wing by the general peer the main purpose of the guardian article is to tarnish the profile of the song and by extension of its listeners if the right wing loves it then you become right wing if you love it too what is more the song dares to bring up the image of fat jobless americans buying junk food with their welfare money this image is not just highly realistic but also a critique of an unjust capitalist economy where the wages of workers are so low that they are little different from welfare the song depicts a capitalist system producing a choice of lifestyle for large parts of the population either you work endless hours for bullshit pay that leaves you with not much of a life to live or you collect welfare and become part of a debilitated underclass who destroy themselves physically and mentally with the cheapest forms of consumption now it's really interesting how he frames that and he basically sort of then saw oliver anthony as someone who could be viewed from the left as sort of a revolutionary and but his main point was that you can't like this music or you'll be one of them and these games are played again and again and eric talks eric talks better about this than than a lot of others kind of framing it and understanding it because of course the whole idw thing happened and and that's where we're at and a big part of you can see why as states and markets sort of tear up all of this underlying social fabric it reduces us to these polarities that can just will just sort of be an endless war with one another maybe i'll read something what john vandonck wrote for crc voices i'm sure he wouldn't mind this is what john wrote on crc voices i apologize in advance for advocating for estuary in the middle of this profound discussion of the another way to divide up the estuary population population is how they divide how they learned about it out of the 12 who attend regularly ford previous connections with crosspoint church four learned about estuary from participating in conversations online on paul van der klees youtube channel and had attended the chino conference and four know and four know neither about chino church nor about this little corner but had seen the advertisement i run on meetup.com these different demographic groups represent a full spectrum of political preferences yet by adhering to the estuary protocol they are able to converse deeply across a wide variety of topics of mutual interest and have been doing so for several years now a similar observation can be made about the people who participate in an online leadership training program we run for a number of years already where over the course of its existence more than 100 people from around the world have come together to familiarize themselves with the estuary protocol for the purpose of starting estuary groups on the ground to facilitate face-to-face conversations across ideological lines again i know for a fact that these people are not homogeneous group in terms of their religious or political beliefs frankly i do not know what is the common denominator that brings them together to offer leadership in the estuary project it all seems like familiarity with pvk's online presidents may be a factor but even that is not an unambiguous factor i'm sure that even pvk does not know what all the people under subscriber lift off and god i certainly do not again it would be interesting to study that but i don't have the bandwidth to do that all this to say that as long as we keep looking at the same variables churched versus unchurched political liberal versus political conservative we will not likely understand the complicated relationships between these polarities this is what makes the estuary project so interesting and exciting it introduces some new variables in the mix which may help us better understand how these different groups could realign towards a more productive conversation the definition of addiction is that you can find fulfillment alone is something that i heard a few weeks ago okay i think that's really fascinating i'd never heard that the atomization of everybody the generalized risk aversion syndrome that we are seeing something called extended adolescence or slow life strategy from gene twangy talking about young people are getting their driver's license don't know it but like it immediately from the title people getting their driver's licenses later they're partying less they're drinking less they're leaving home later they're getting occupations starting jobs later um could this have been contributed to through covid yeah probably um but it was catalyzed it was already a trend that was happening it's affecting men particularly because male friendship groups are more fragile in some regards than women's in 1990 the number of men who said they had zero close friends was around about three percent 2020 that number was 15 percent that's insane the most common answer it's insane so to the question how many friends could you call on in an emergency is zero the most common it's not the average but it's the most common more people have zero friends to call on than have any other number the challenge of modern masculinity relates to that addiction quote the belief that you can find fulfillment alone and you see this in the the sigma male meme sigma male grind set you know i don't know this so uh you have you know alpha beta the sort of red pill the blue pill the purple pill halfway between the two i don't know this either okay so the sigma male steps outside of the existing dominance hierarchy he doesn't try to lead he doesn't try to do anything he is a lone ranger law into himself over the top of over the top of a lot of this meta meme which has been created is a guy called chris bumstead who is a three-time four-time classic physique champion mr olympia okay classic physique is they have weight limits which means that they have a much more arnold-esque it's all about shape and sculpture massive but not a mass monster phil heath was sat in that seat not long ago mass monster uh i sit down with chris this guy who is the face of the sigma male meme okay perhaps the one of the driving forces behind young male belief at the moment and i asked him how much of what you've done and achieved in business in personal life and in your sport could you have done on your own zero i could have done none of it i couldn't have gotten through the difficult times emotionally without my fiance i couldn't have built my personal brand without my best friend and videographer calvin i couldn't have run my business without vaughn and my other business partners that are here i couldn't have done any of this stuff and this is the guy that the he's in the ice tub as there's dubstep music over the top of him saying you don't need anybody else and so on and so forth the belief that you can find fulfillment alone is a lie it is a lie that people who have been hurt and scorned and rejected by the world retreat into there is a safety blanket of cynicism that people can use it's sour grapes at an existential level the belief that the upside of never trying is never having to feel the pain of failure and the generalized risk aversion the extended adolescence the slow life strategy strategy permits that to seep ever more into people's lives in a world where we have hyperconvenience why should i feel discomfort that was a brilliant speech it's a brilliant speech so what's going on with the modern masculinity movement it's fractured uh so there is the manosphere which is the broad term that describes people talking to men i've never identified with it i'm not a part of it in as much as i speak to men about things that i struggled with and they listen perhaps someone could put me in it but i i don't think that they help i think fundamentally at the moment the masculinity movement sees women as adversaries and competitors rather than compatriots i think that they are they treat women largely like an enemy to be avoided or a resource to be used and discarded i think that largely much of men's advice benefits some men at the expense of most others that if being a high value man means sleeping with as many women as possible but a low value woman is a woman that slept with many men what you are doing is creating a wake after you that other men have to pick up the pieces of if your goal is to be this high value many but high body count male i think that let me give you this so this is actually going into a paper my first academic paper that i've ever been a part of all right so this is the male sedation hypothesis okay there's a an effect called young male syndrome you heard of this nope if you have a large number of dispossessed sexless men throughout all of history bad things happen yeah testosterone drops when you get in relationship it drops again once you have kids this means in large part that women have sex with part that women domesticate men i guess that's why i bought that yellow car in some regard they have to you don't want to take risk taking behavior when you've got a newborn at home don't jump off that fucking cliff okay like let's be go home go home so when you have large numbers of dispossessed young men who aren't having sex what's their reason for integrating into society they take a brilliant study is done of men crossing the road and the difference between when they cross and the distance from the nearest car with or without the presence of women you put a woman there the distance closes massively no women there they're not bothered risk taking behavior is a show look at my excess fitness yeah look at all of these risks that i can take look at the plumage on the back of my of my tail right so throughout all of history it seems like they set cars on fire and push over granny and cause havoc in portugal 1700s they the first son there was a disparity in the sex ratio i'm not sure why the first son was allowed to marry every subsequent son was put on a ship go explore the new world don't burn our home was what they were saying there is a question we have very high rates of sexlessness and we have very low rates of integration amongst young men at the moment why are we not seeing them going around and setting setting cars i'm fine there is a jordan peterson was featured as the incel god in a he inspired a movie by olivia wilde starring harry styles a little while ago i brought it up to jordan and uh the incel god he was the king of the incels yes this in cell i am so pissed to hear this jordan laughed it off in classic him fashion yeah but as a guy who eric sort of the last to know on a bunch of stuff here who opened for jordan peterson on harmonica i've been to some of his shows jordan peterson recognized this demographic early and he had the courage to speak directly to it and if you want to see something you want to see me break out in tears have me tell you the stories about the people who went up to jordan peterson and said i was smoking weed masturbating in my parents basement and six months later i've got a job i've got prospects i've got a fiance etc etc and to turn him into the incel king or whatever no jordan peterson tried to become the one person answer to the world uncle shortage but we do have to deal with the individual and if you go back to the video that i did i'll shoot what did i title it was god waiting for heroic moses to arise to be able to deliver israel from egypt jordan sort of backs off his individualism a bit because i think jordan is recognizing that this invention of the individual while in many ways there's so much that we enjoy because of it and we lean on it it has the serious downside addiction depression in many ways the meeting crisis is an individual crisis and mark lefaber navigating patterns would say it's an intimacy crisis okay and i just have no patience for dismissing that much good if if some of his message seemed off to you it's because you didn't need it you didn't understand what clean your room was about you laughed it off because you weren't screwed and he gave people a path just the way sam gave people a path from that abusive religious household where they didn't know to escape and you know to an extent all of these people spoke to people at different stages in their lives a lot of this female behavior which is oh you know i'm on only fans i'm going to get my this i'm going to get my that well good luck to you i hope it works out but the gold digging or the misogyny it's of a piece people are listening to each other's strategic conversation and saying why would i want that for my life so i'll round out the sedation hypothesis you have this large cohort dispossessed young men high t high risk taking they cause problems there is a question to be asked although many of the almost all mass shooters including the ones that hit all of the headlines were sexless young men given that we have the highest rates of sexlessness amongst young men that we've seen in a very long time there is a question why have we not seen an in-kind increase in antisocial behavior it's my belief that young men specifically are being sedated out of their status seeking and risk taking and reproductive behavior through a combination of social media porn and video games i was waiting for it so there is an idea from diana sorry social media porn and video games does not include weed i think ubiquitous weed the motivation killer we don't have a ton of culture around open weed we have a lot of culture around open alcohol about open coffee we use this is the eric i like best when he when he sort of steps back and make some observations of this is true this is true this is true and then turns out to be this is true this is true and then draws that point to have culture around open nicotine we don't have a lot of culture around open we do have culture around closed weed surreptitious weed yeah yeah but i do think that in part the video game thing is an absolute as if drug what's that you meet people who come from the gaming community or social media and they have an idea that life permits you to do certain things that are absolutely not tolerated in civil society like a lot of the people you know an interesting feature of social media is the difference between critics and trolls who call you names and people who actually try to find a way to ruin your life offline like there's a huge connection between the gaming community and certain sort of bulletin boards and this freak game about how can we destroy people offline yeah yeah and once you meet these people and you and you read their messages to each other they're talking about oh yeah i've got a cool exploit where i'm going to invite somebody to so-and-so's house because i think that person might be dangerous you realize it's a video game yeah so i i had this idea specifically about uh jordan but it would apply to yourself it applied to joe after a while there is a particular threshold of exposure notoriety that people cross and when they do they are no longer treated like a human it's easy online to dehumanize because you don't see any there there right you don't see that but there's something specific about crossing a particular threshold where you're no longer a person you're a representation of ideas you're a conglomeration of viewpoints and i think that really allows people to dehumanize the other you're not even an individual you're just an avatar for a principality or a spirit side really really there is no one reading these two well you think jordan peterson's reading these tweets about the incel god thing yeah is he i don't know i think he is i think jordan spends i would i would love jordan spend less time on twitter okay i think that would be i think that that would be good but even if they're not there is a person there that is the representation of the person and i don't know like saying something to somebody online that you wouldn't say to their face to me seems like a coward's way of communicating or you view it as an adaptive landscape which is new exploits have been created i mean if i explained to you a mosquito life cycle back to the video game metaphor okay you're gonna find somebody with excess blood and you're gonna steal some for yourself that's my video guy he's been eaten alive since we've been in la is that right yeah okay but you see the same cookie cutter sharks do the same thing for large marine wildlife they'll just take a plug of flesh out it's like can't afford to go after cookie cutter sharks when you have those kinds of strategies am i going to sit around in the ocean and say no that's not a legitimate strategy you're a parasite it's like yeah like that's my whole game where i'm a predator i just murder things for a living it's really what predation is about and in a certain sense what you've done is you've changed the adaptive landscape and these are the new exploits yes so they to get back to the video games porn and social media diana fleishman has this idea she calls uncanny vulvas and tell me more she says that uh porn has been able to hijack the mate seeking behavior specifically of men by giving them a very titrated dose of what it is that they uh would usually get um which means that part of that motivation to go out and do the risk-taking behavior has been tuned down but what do you get from uh video games you get camaraderie you get a progressive overload in terms of your achievements you get a sense of belonging you get uh dopamine when you achieve something you may even get some serotonin because you feel like it's all junk food you're lumped together with your group of friends okay and then what you get on social media with social media we've gamified the status hierarchy it's there there's a number right in front of you and there are levels that you can get to there's your silver plaque on youtube there's your gold plaque there's your blue tick look who followed me today elon musk followed me today whatever whatever i got a retweet from paul graham um it has been able to and i don't necessarily think that this was by design it could be by by side effect it has been able to specifically for men by side effect it has been able to specifically for men maybe also for women give a titrated dose of most of the key drivers that got people out of the house to go and do things scott galloway trended uh earlier on for saying that unless you're asleep as a young person you shouldn't be in the house and his point is life is for living there is lots for you to learn outside fuck off go out come on uh and he got tons and tons of pushback and maybe he's wrong but when i get advice sometimes on q and a's people will say young guys and girls will message and say i'm 13 and i love your podcast what the fuck you do fantastic you are in a growth period that is unbelievable and the people that you're getting exposed to i wish that i'd been i'd had access to at 13 what should i do if i want to improve myself what books should i what practices should i do i don't mean to be patronizing but just go outside and live life there is so much low-hanging fruit from knowing what it's like to have an eye he's just moved to la maybe it's a little different in the uk what he doesn't realize is you've heard about food deserts a lot of american cities are people deserts go outside you won't see another living human being these are suburbs you will see a bunch of garage doors and cars go cars going by you're going to have to go somewhere you're going to have to go to a school you're going to have to go to a sports event you're going to have to go to a church you're going to have to go to an estuary you're going to have to go somewhere to find people it's many american cities are people deserts so anyway there's there's more to this they go on and it's it's really very good i think it's the best part of the conversation and and and you know chris chris really leads it so good for him addiction and modernity addiction you know they did that study with the with the rats that basically showed they put a rat in a cage with cocaine and if the rat was living in a good rat community the rat could take a little little bit of cocaine but would be fine you impoverish that rat and put that rat in a in an impoverished environment and that rat will become a will become a junkie on cocaine and that isn't to say that these issues aren't very complex but those who have even more will be given those who don't have even the little they have will be taken away but the first will be last and the last will be first so um for all of you who are living off screens screens are great i i hope that you've learned a lot from this podcast but there's no substitute for real relationships with real people in real time and real space so let me know what you think leave a comment
