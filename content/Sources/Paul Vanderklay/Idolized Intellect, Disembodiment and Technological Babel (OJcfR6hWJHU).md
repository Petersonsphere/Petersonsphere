 Hi, this is Paul and this is my second conversation with Luke and well Luke, I don't know you introduced yourself quite a bit last time and I usually put the link up in the little exclamation point on top so if you want to see the first conversation I did with Luke you can find that but here we are again. What's up Luke? You're not on Twitter anymore. No I don't know. It's been a few months now and it's been great. I honestly haven't missed it at all. I feel much more sane. It's a little insane. Yeah, well and I mean it can be a good thing. It really served a nice purpose in my life when I was kind of things very similar to people who call you talk about you know it was a it was a way for me to find and relate to people who have similar interests and passions and things and but I just found I don't know it served its purpose I think and it was creating more heat than light for me I think and so I just decided to shut it down. There are many days when I want I also want to shut down social media get off Facebook get off Twitter but it's I've got all these connections now through it and it's kind of like so I haven't done that yet. No I understand that for sure. So what's on your mind for today? Okay so I've been so I wanted to start by saying a couple things. So and pardon I'm going to forget her name so who is your the wonderful woman you spoke with from Silicon Valley? Oh Karen. Karen yes so at the beginning when she was describing the way that her mind works wow perfect those three points which is which were I think she's an external processor for sure I'm the exact same way and that she's also at the same time trying to lay a foundation or a basement she wants to give this is how I describe it I want to give the context and the thinking and the journey of every thought I've ever had so that you understand me and where I'm coming from but that just usually ends up confusing people because it's too much information and then the interconnectedness of all things I really relate to all of those. So in my discussion with you I have a few main topics I want to hear I've written some notes to try to hopefully be intelligible and so I wrote this sentence and so we'll see hopefully I think it will make sense to you particularly and lately you've been talking about technology in a way that is right in line with my thinking and so I have just a sentence that kind of is a broader summary of kind of everything I'd like to say or talk about and get your thoughts on so oh I want one more preface sorry see here I go again the basement I so in this I mean I'm sure it comes across you know I'm I'm on my way to becoming Eastern Orthodox and it probably comes across as I rail against the West a lot and and that's true in a sense and like you and I have spoken about some of that is woundedness like Tim Keller talks about in his meaning of marriage book woundedness and I've found that to be a really helpful category for me and I'm sure some of that's true you know there's there's personal pains and then there's broader systematic pains that I see within evangelicalism that I think could be fixed and and I feel like there's not a lot of desire to want to see to see inside and look and see those problems and so that just pains me and so anything that I say about the West I just want to preface this to say that I don't think it's my critique isn't universal it's more about I think the broader way of seeing the world that I think is inherent to the West and it's not even Western Christianity it's the broad West that's universal but this is this is my caveat to that is I don't think that it manifests in every individual or institution like I think there are individuals and institutions who who won't who won't fall under my criticism but I think that's because they're living contrary to their way of seeing and profession they're enacting something different than their broader worldview but I think they're going to be the exceptions rather than the norm so anyhow this is the sentence the modernist West has idolized the intellect and is on the way toward complete disembodiment via technologies and tools and transactionalism toward technological battle hang on I'm typing as we go the modernist West has idolized the intellect and is on its way towards complete disembodiment via technologies tools and transactionalism toward technological babble babble with a capital B yeah now don't you think you know if you look at China or Korea or Japan they're doing it too yeah yeah I do and I would I would so technology isn't it's it's not completely connected to the West but I but I would say the spirit the spirit of technology that I'm gonna try to articulate in this discussion with you I think is specifically tied to the West and I would say we've exported it through through industry through globalism through consumerism but I would say that's because all those things are inextricably tied and connected if this reminds me of Slate star codex how the West was won do you read that blog at all no I'll put the I'll put the link in the notes here he talks about universal culture in the way you know Coca-Cola takes over the world there's there's something there's something there's something that happened in you know after colonialism with the with the the spread of Western values that have taken over that have taken over the world in many ways that that very much that very much get into this and I you know it comes out of modernism and the West but when you look at for example what China is doing in terms of their morality scores keep you know keeping morality scores like keeping credit scores and there's there's there's obviously a different background in the Far East with respect to a lot of this but I don't know that it's and if you talk about Western Christianity it's it's certain you know there Eastern Western versus Eastern Christianity there's a very big difference there but it's it's beyond I think by using the word West it's it's isolating it to it's it's certainly far broken out of the West I agree we have no we have no idea we have no anticipation that Africa or South America will resist it either for that matter so I would think about it more in the lines of what what Scott Alexander talks about in his in his piece how the West was one universal culture because it basically says here Western culture is no more related to the geographical West than Western medicine people who complain about Western culture taking over their country always managed to bring up Coca-Cola but in what sense is Coca-Cola culturally Western and any on he goes from there because what what happens is that there's sort of a globalism that has taken over and this some of this mindset that I I understand you pointing to has in many ways taken over this you know infiltrated through this globalism has become sort of a necessary part of this globalism yeah yeah I agree I mean it's and this is part of my this gets into part of my connection of concerns I mean I have I have Luddite kind of tendencies and I'm a romantic so I mean it's easy for me to romanticize that I think that's a little reductionistic and simplistic but so so this is maybe this will help clarify a little so I define so I was talking to my wife about this and I think this is a good grouping but I I kind of see technological babble as a as a combination of these four things that are I think like I was saying inextricably tied so individualism progress technology and materialism slash consumerism and so what I think I think what you're talking about with the global culture and how we've exported and how it's in China and Taiwan and all of that that's very true and I think we've done that through technology and consumerism materialism primarily but I but I would say like the broader worldview categories and ways of viewing the world I think all of those things are connected and I think where it's different is the East is not as individualistic yet they're very I mean they're materialistic I mean a lot the whole world is kind of because of Hollywood and the internet and globalism and all these things but you but my concern with it all is is that it's it's bound up in the intellect I mean this is this kind of gets it because I all came here through intellectual study and church things and I think it's much bigger than just Christianity and church even though I mean like Jordan Peterson says I agree the deepest categories are theological and so even though you can see these things and the secular world and politics and stuff those are just superficial manifestations as far as I'm concerned these are really it reminds me of almost and I made a comment I was critical of you did a video it's one of your non-discussion videos recently where you were quoting you played a little of who's the apology just guy that your buddies with and you follow you start off the video with it and he was talking about Glenn Scrivner yes okay yeah and he was talking about being ruled by principalities and we are not masters in our own house you know which was right out of Peterson's that was that was a big point in Peterson's how I why I dared not say I believe in God video so that wasn't from Glenn okay but it seemed so it seemed to me that he affirmed that a little bit that we are essentially committed to two principalities and rulers that are that are bigger than us and that we are some in some way in submission to maybe he wasn't saying that maybe I'm conflated yeah Jordan the Peterson point in that video was much more that we are we are we are not in control of ourselves Peterson doesn't really make the principalities and powers argument Glenn might because Glenn's obviously a Christian but well yeah he wouldn't use that language but I think he would say like when he says in his answer to I mean I've heard him say this in multiple places but when he'll say something like you know how do you know what you want you have no idea who you are I mean what he's essentially saying is you have it's in the same way that you talk about how like there are things your mind knows that you don't know I mean there's there's things that you know and commitments that you have and desires and passions that are bigger than your conscious awareness I mean that's the elephant the elephant and the writer yeah but the problem with when you've idolized the intellect is you've essentially you've put the writer on the on the top of the monarchical vision on the top of the hierarchy and that's just foolish it's a really really bad idea and I actually think so my whole like technology consumers and materialism I think a really simple way to illustrate it is it's it's Asgard it's Salron it's the ring it's Tolkien I mean it's the difference between Asgard and Hobbiton and I think we're headed there the church I think the Western church and I mean you talk about this it's like the mega churches and and how we model things more based off of business than other things not all churches are doing it that way but I think that that spirit is deeply within us as Americans and as Westerners and and this gets into one of the big things that was my catalyst for all this is I was wanting to talk to you about grace and works and the difference of and I'm not as well versed in this I just have intuitions about it but and and I got this from Nathan Jacobs in listening I don't know if you ever listened I think I shared with you his podcast with Hank Hanegraaff I didn't listen to that I'll watch it that could because that would be very interesting so it's on the sophistication of the early Church Fathers and and he articulates incredibly well kind of the history of he has a few sections in there and he and he contrasts East and West and how they see things and he says one of the reason a lot of Western Christians tend to struggle and and have a hard time conceptualizing the way that the East I don't even like to say paradigm or worldview it's a way of seeing it's deeper than that they see the world differently because and he said it's hard for Westerners to get their heads around because they're all their frameworks all their questions everything comes out of Augustinian assumptions comes out of Augustinian foundations and they can't really get deeper than that because they're everything is rooted in Augusta and he said and that was and that's never been in the East the East it's not that they're unaware of Augustin or they don't value him or they don't think he had good things but there's certain things about his framework that that have never been fundamental assumptions in the East and so the West will come to a lot of discussions and they'll be like talking about salvation they'll be like well the East thinks of it with justification sanctification differently and I'm like those aren't even categories in the East those are those are coming out of Western assumptions and I think it's really hard to this is my struggle with a lot of these discussions we never going back far enough like we get a get we got to get to the root of the problem which to me is the big divergence started Augustin it's you know I've been reading this book on I can't pull up the title off top of my head this book on Erasmus and Luther yeah which has a lot of what's what's sort of nice about that book it has a lot of other church history look at Jerome Jerome was a very interesting guy a contemporary of Augustin it's it's you know part of what part of what I suspect we're going to see and we're seeing it now interestingly enough sort of via Jordan Peterson with Jonathan Peugeot Nathan Jacobs and the rise of the the the rise of the visibility of the Eastern Church in the West is this is going to open up a lot of new conversations because for the most part the Eastern Church hasn't been a part of hasn't had a very big part of the broader Christian conversations at least in the United States and that's changing so it's so yeah it's it's going to be you know it's it's hard to it's it's hard to appreciate what the how cut off the East was from the West for how long and what formative years you know it's sort of like it's sort of like a divorce happened in a household and the kids went to live with dad and they never they never knew mom and so suddenly you you get reacquainted with mom in your 30s it's gonna be you know it's going to be a very interesting conversation because you don't relive those formative years right and and you know one of the things that I've been struck by and I just mentioned to you before I had my first ever zoom mishap and that I had a really wonderful conversation with with Nathan Jacobs this morning that I I thought was just stellar and he enjoyed it as well and for some reason zoom did not record and so there's no getting that conversation back but the devil yeah one of the one of the one of the things that I have thought a lot about is why you know Peugeot father David that I spoke with earlier Nathan all of these individuals coming out participating in this conversation somebody sent me a link to st. Elijah's church somewhere in the Midwest where this ongoing class on YouTube about mystic OJ yeah gospel of John and since I'm doing these gospel John in my belt Sunday school class the you know as as is often the case the immigrants sort of bring the church over but it's the you know it's the it's the converts it's the former evangelicals or former Protestants who are now using YouTube using cinema this is going to be a very interesting chapter in church history because of course the church that boy I could I don't know if Jonathan will listen to this but I don't want to say anything out of school that the church that when Jonathan Peugeot goes to church goes to the Eastern Church he is having a different experience than those children of immigrants who brought the church over yeah oh yeah and so the just like the churches that grew out of the immigrant churches in America became this has happened in the Christian Reformed Church I was not an immigrant the you know the church of the church the Christian Form Church that I express in some ways is very different from the Christian Reformed Church of my grandparents that they brought over from the offskiding in in the Netherlands and so I mean this is going to be a very dynamic situation and even just the fact that you know here we have the Orthodox Church in some ways proselytizing and I use that word guardedly yeah YouTube there's no there's no disentangling from the technology there really isn't and and so in some ways you know if you don't want to be tainted by the technology stay off YouTube and Twitter and Facebook and so this is going to be very interesting to see how this stuff plays out in America America's going to change the Orthodox for the better and for the worse probably so so that I have a couple thoughts on that so I don't did you watch all of the recovering the nuns videos yes okay so at the very tail end of that I didn't know this but so through your YouTube comments I've met another guy through your channel who lives in Minneapolis and we've gotten together since then and we and he mentioned to me that toward the end of I think it's probably the second video there's a Q&A and and one of the priests that does a Q&A is from another of a OCA temple parish my priest told me the right word is temple actually I spoke with them this week but in Minneapolis yeah well he said like the confusion about the church is the body is something that just he said there's other words in other languages yeah yeah and so he said that's just a confusion where there's only one word for it in English that's a significant word though yeah in English I mean and that's just it what's a language once a church gets into another language it starts to become a different church these hey fossils man fossils in these words barfield yeah but so a different priest from Minneapolis was one of the questioners and he was the one who and I mean thank I love people like this but he was one of the ones who pushed back a little bit with dr. Jacobs and said my experiences that I've seen a lot of nuns and people who are apathetic to the faith from within orthodoxy from within my own church my anecdotal spirit experiences that I don't know that it's gonna be significantly different and and so which is a great question and and I think dr. Jacobs response was you know I haven't I haven't looked at that yet so I can't speak to it I spoke with my I'm just gonna call him my priest yet although we're not in the church this week whom I loved by the way if there's anyone in Minneapolis father Andrew at st. Mary's is one of my favorite people and and I was posing and I kind of asked him about this because my intuition and he agreed with it was that the orthodox in the what in America will grow up and become nuns and they'll become apathetic of the faith but but in my opinion it's not because that's what they're being taught in church it's because they're Westerners and it's because they're they're they're rejecting religion based on categories that are inherent to the Orthodox Church and I and I framed it this way and I think this is true he agreed with this is that the way that I really see it is that the Orthodox way of way of seeing is pre-modern yes yes they never went through yes yes and so and he even said this because they recently took a trip to Georgia and he said if you go out in like remote Georgia in a place that's a little bit backwards and untouched by technology and Hollywood and consumerism and in the modern world and you go to a to an Orthodox temple and you attend a litter he said it's a very different experience there it's really like stepping in a time machine and it's it's it's almost like we and we've talked this is all John Verbeke stuff too it's like pre-axial age it's if you ask those people if they believe in God it's like the whole belief doubt thing those aren't even categories for them right right right I mean they just don't even and you could and we can have a talk about whether or not that's good or bad and you can't go backwards and we have gone through modernity and we are conscious and there is doubt and there's existential angst what do we do with that I agree with you we can't go back but my concern is is that we really have to address some of these negative issues that I think come out of the West and Augustine and Descartes and dualism that that allow us to live in our disembodied abstractions because I think if we don't there there won't be a way forward there'll be babble yeah I really I very much agree with with what you said that it's so hard and this is where in some ways I'm sort of caught between Verbeke and Peugeot because Jonathan Jonathan in a sense Jonathan in a sense says you know here's you know I don't know that Jonathan says that so I need to I need to contact Jonathan I have another talk with him probably a longer one because but but I do agree with Verbeke in that there's there's in a sense no going back and this is part of my point with respect to what what Scott Alexander calls universal culture because it there's I mean part of what oh boy this gets so complicated you know so so the whole icon thing so I so actually Nathan and I talked a little bit about that today too which again it was really good conversation it's been very enlightening for me the there's there's so much to this this is so hard because again a you don't you don't unlearn what has been built into you and and so then the way forward you know one one RCA pastor made the comment you know before any RCA pastor gets ordained he should have to renounce Hegel in all his ways but but Hegel Hegel at the same time has a point yeah that we I we take all of this stuff you're not going to reconstitute orthodoxy as it was and there's no and I think most Orthodox would agree that that's wrong part of the difficulty that part of the difficulty part of this difficulty part of the questions I have and I've never I haven't really looked into this is why the East was lost okay hmm and and that is something that hangs over my head in these conversations and that the Orthodox Church and I don't know that period of history anywhere near well enough but or orthodoxy found a way to found a way to incorporate and synthesize synthesize the Greeks and and found a very potent found a very potent way of looking at the world and managed to convert Greece Russia you know that they can they converted a lot of the East they also they also lost the East and and in all fairness the West lost North Africa too to Islam and and so at some point some of these some of and although they they also managed to survive communism and and Islam so there's we've only begun having this conversation and so when I watch when I watch for example I forget the man's name that the pastor in the mystic OJ videos and I listen to him it's right away I knew he was raised Protestant I could tell it just by his turns of phrase maybe I should get him on the line one of these days and a lot of American priests are yes we're Protestant well and and what was what has interested me is that father David was for a while in the South Bend CRC yeah David Jacobs or Nathan Jacobs got his got his PhD at Calvin Seminary and he and I thought that he had a terrific experience at Calvin Seminary mm-hmm and so you know that was part of what was fun reaching out to him because he at least has some awareness of the the soup that I come out of at least yeah but Stephen Freeman who's one of the father Stephen Freeman who's one of the best American Orthodox intellectuals that I know of is brilliant like if you want to this is a like this book Everywhere Present is it's really it's short and it's orthodoxy in a really simple way Christianity in a one-story universe oh really that's that's what he that's what he has that's interesting yeah that's the subtitle because and he's he did a you should check this out too he did a lecture at Peugeot when he was recently in Seattle father Freeman was there also and he did a lecture on modernity and it's wonderful and and I could find that I'll email you it's on YouTube okay okay I can't remember the name because you know part of what I'm wrestling with just in terms of my own putting the world together is in fact the the relationship between heaven and earth and I can see you know I can see in Jonathan's work a a unity of heaven and earth that is that this isn't pre axial I mean the actual age comes before this but it it you know it and that's that's obviously one of the one of the big crises of the West right now and you're right that in some ways you know the heaven just continues to move further and further out until you know and and Charles Taylor makes this point in terms of providential be deism as being a critical step on the way to secularism now of course Jonathan has this idea of of kind of a circularity that this will come around again yeah maybe it will none of us will I mean we're talking we're talking we're talking movements that are measured in centuries at this oh yeah and so there's good are you familiar so you're familiar with Ken Wilbur and we've talked about spiral dynamics before yeah I don't I think it's the best visual I have yet but that is my understanding best understanding almost of the movement of time and there's actually another really good times another chick tricky subject but this book Loris is a wonderful now if you want to understand Eugene Vodoloskin so V O D O L A Z K I N but if you want to like this is the beating heart of the orthodox way of seeing I mean he captures I love I've that and Lilith are probably the two books I've resonated with most in my life George McDonald's Lilith but George McDonald's Lilith yeah and it's but but in here he has a section where he talks about the it's essentially I was gonna try to find it but I would be inefficient right now but it's essentially like a spiral dynamics the time moves in circles and it comes back around my concern is and this is where to these things take centuries I agree with you like there is there is something to kind of the Nietzschean time move it's a circle there is some of that the tail you know things come around and around but but there's a it's going somewhere there's a there's an end there's a T loss and and my concern though is is you can you can do that in a in a nonviolent way which is called repentance and reformation and you can do that in a violent way which is revolution this is something I've heard Jonathan talk about and I'm and increasingly I'm I mean we see this and I mean this gets into the I you know social justice warrior Peterson stuff what's going on in the northeast you know it like evergreen and stopping people on the road and and you know the Antifa and all that stuff like that's the political thing but but all of that like we're if that's all spiritual and theological deeper and and my concern this has always been my thing is like the what the church that I've experienced in the West is reactionary why are we not leading the way showing people how to fix this stuff by embodying it we're not we're we're we're contributing to the tribalism on a whole well the embodiment is of course the key thing yes because nobody nobody will be impressed by your way of life if you don't live it no they'll they'll it'll be even grosser because it's hypocrisy right and and part of what I mean part of the be caving in of a lot of Protestantism now is exactly that point I think I think part of see this is where this is where language gets tricky because a lot of Protestantism doesn't go to church and I Jesus and my individual relationship that it's it's the atheist it's the atheists who are in many ways you know deeply formed by Christianity in the West and and the you know every now and then there's a moment in which I forget what I was listening to recently or watching but every now and then there's a moment in which the the the church this the secular church is revealed and seen you know it's almost like in a movie of when you only catch a glimpse of the monster when there's lightning outside because other other than that everything is just dark yeah and and the because you know nearly everyone in the culture is is deeply formed by by Protestantism and the values that that came through there and the lightenment and even the Catholics and the Orthodox in America Protestant Absolutely and and even I would argue I mean part of quite likely why Christianity is growing so well in the East is because in some ways people have already begun to take on the values via this as Scott Alexander calls a universal culture and and religiously they're just finding that the shoe fits in some ways now the the Christianity that comes out of China that will probably probably won't be revealed for another 25 or 50 years this will look quite a bit different from the Christianity we find in the West but you know this this stuff is is really hard to get a handle on and to and to really see and talk about so I yeah it's it's so hard it's so hard to really sort of get out there so this is this I mean so this kind of if we take it back to my initial comment sentence and the idol the idolatry of the intellect which I think is inherently tied to individualism because and this is something you've been working through with all this is that all knowledge is inherently subjective we tried to get the subject out you can't everyone is an individual so therefore all the knowing that we have until we get hive mind is subjective and so what but when you ideal idealize the intellect this is so this isn't a flattering way to say it but I've been toying with this idea in my mind that the Protestant Church is basically just religious intersectionality and it eats its own because that's the nature of it because it's all bound up in its own its own ideas its own mind its own orthodoxy its own binding and blinding and eventually that breaks down all the way to the individual which if you look at the history of Protestantism it's kind of hard to deny that there's not unending splitting and schism yeah well but in all fairness to the Protestants there's been that that didn't start in the 16th century and a better you know one of the things that one of the some of the propaganda I if you read Augustine you find you bump into the Donatists and you bump into the or if you read church history you bump to the Donatists and you bump into the Aryans and I mean church history has always been full of splits and there are there are other forms of unity beyond organizational unity this this stuff is is really hard to talk about and and I you know I appreciate what you're saying about Protestantism but I think the the problem with it is that there's more to Protestant Protestantism than just that and when Luther you know so this book on Luther and Erasmus is I think quite helpful partly not just because it illuminates some of the missteps of Luther and what became Protestantism but but it also illuminates some of the issues with Erasmus and and that the the Protestant the Protestant Reformation never would have happened without corruption in the church yeah I mean it's it's just the fact and sure and it's it's I think probably right now the the Orthodox Church in America is is entering a golden age and golden ages can last for centuries and so I absolutely celebrate that if the you know if the Orthodox Church in America grows to become a major player on the on the American religious stage I would love to see that the the challenge to Christianity perpetually is power yes and yeah we saw that in the West with the Roman Catholics you see that in evangelicalism I just finished reading Frankie Schaeffer's crazy for God book yeah which was just so much fun I loved that book I loved that some people listening to me say that are just going to cringe because they see that as nothing but betrayal but and and that doesn't mean I agree with Frank Schaeffer on all of his character relations of everyone but yeah there's the heart of that book is that in some ways you know money and power corrupted you know it's the power of corruption yeah and and there's no end so it's the way of the world versus the way of Christ boy but now now we're good we were running out of time and I want to take a little break in here but you're coming back right yep yep okay okay because that's that's an experiment I really look forward to we'll see how it goes and I'm thinking you know I'm also thinking about I just had another talk with Mary from the comment section and and some people said maybe I need to start a sub channel I'm trying to figure out you know how because they're I don't want to stand in the way I want to facilitate conversations I don't want to stand in the way of them but I'm also not so naive to know that you just stick people together and have fruitful conversation right and I think you're a so when you were mentioning that on the tail end of I think you're mentioning that on the tail end of the I forget Cassidy? Cassidy? No the Silicon Valley girl but you were talking about Cassidy. Yeah I so when no matter how well you know we think we're motivated I agree with you I don't think a lot of people will watch if you're not in it and so I think that's true and also I think conversations do need a facilitator because good communication is is hard and bad I don't know and like I've even there was someone I was interacting with someone on your channel in the comments and I said I don't want to talk anymore because like I really I get to the point if I think people assume if people assume bad faith or say something a little off I'm just like I'm done I'm not gonna talk to you you know and I think I just don't have time for it you know and and so I think it can be conversations can be hard and temperament dynamics you know yeah but it's a great idea it's fun the potential is awesome. I have to figure this out anyway Luke this has been great I'm gonna stop now and the irony is if our if our if our four-way conversation doesn't go well where you gonna we just we just teased everybody into frustration because that'll be the epic lost conversation but. Oh I have high hopes. All right we'll see you in a few minutes. Okay sounds good.
