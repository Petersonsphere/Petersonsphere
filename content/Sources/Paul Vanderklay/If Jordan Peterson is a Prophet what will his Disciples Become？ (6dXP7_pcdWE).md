 Hi, this is Paul. A lot has happened this weekend in the wonderful world of Jordan Peterson watching and So I'm going to talk about the rest of thought and a little bit of the masculinist today. Someone sent me this opinion piece by Russ Ross Doothought. I listened to him the other day and still don't know how to say his name, but on Jordan Peterson, he goes into this essay He goes into a lot and mentions CS Lewis and if in fact my conversation with Peterson happens this Wednesday CS Lewis is definitely on my list in terms of conversation with him but he goes into CS Lewis some of the recent things including the Scott Alexander piece that I posted last week and He goes into a number of those things. Now one of the the person who sent this to me made a comment about It seemed like Doothought didn't have a very well-rounded picture of Peterson and I think that will be typical of high-status people One of the things that I've been thinking about with respect to Peterson is that hierarchies filter as much as they give access and one of the things that I've learned through my own little Jordan Peterson journey on YouTube has been I have learned so much from I've gotten a little behind lately in the YouTube comments, but I have learned so much from from commenters and From emails and from having lunch with people and from hearing your stories I've learned an incredible amount about all kinds of things. This has been just incredibly resource rich the the number of people who have have approached me or sent me something and And I can't even keep up with all of it necessarily But what I've been impressed by this is that again, this is to a certain degree Fairly low status here. I don't have you know, I get one or two emails a day or so from from strangers But you know, this is this is fairly low status And so the amount of stuff coming in is manageable for the most part and that also means it's it's relatively unfiltered it's obviously biased in terms of the things that All of the different elements of this conversation have if you're a Jordan Peterson fan Usually if you're a male on YouTube if you're of a certain age so on and so forth Although I've I've had a lot of interesting comments and conversations with women, too But but it's very interesting how how hierarchies filter so then when you think about okay, I've you know, I've gone from zero to You know almost 5000 subscribers in the last four months well Peterson's got a million well, what does that mean? Well, it means that he can't possibly read all of his emails It also means that now he's got access to people and to platforms that I never would and it also means that he's extraordinarily busy with with all kinds of things now Hierarchies filter and and as well as get give access and so for example You know Ross do thought at the New York Times. He's been doing opinion pieces as kind of the conservative voice religious voices is one of the one of the one of the people in the New York Times who who who is a believing Christian and an Observant Christian, let's say it that way who takes his faith seriously and writes about it. He's Roman Catholic and and came to Roman Catholicism Via you can if you if you dig up on the internet you can hear do thought tell his story but So but how much Jordan Peterson does he actually have time to listen to and I know many of you watching this video have watched You know tens dozens even hundreds of hours of Jordan Peterson and and so your knowledge of him is not only Extensive you've also been you've also absorbed it deeply now many people like to thought will write a piece like this and he's Again, he skimmed through the book and and this is again where that where the media the media matters in terms of Did you learn about Jordan Peterson from the videos? Did you read his book? Are you getting your information about him from the other little? YouTube hashes that have been put out about him You know what what is the access and so so do thoughts piece here is is that I thought it was okay what what I thought was Interesting was that again? He's read the Micah Meadowcroft piece and the Scott Alexander piece both of which Mentioned CS Lewis now for do thought he wrote a book bad religion a number of years ago, which was actually quite a good book I read it and and he He talks about Oprah being that basically the high priestess of American I'm not sure if in that conversation he uses moralistic therapeutic deism But he goes into that so the thought is not a novice when it comes to the American Quasi religious scene and and in some ways I could understand why he would associate Peterson with that milieu so he walks through this and and finally he just Kind of ends on the question of what will happen to to Peterson's followers and this this obviously for me has been a Big motivation in terms of my entry into this conversation Both in terms of meeting Jordan Peterson fans face to face starting the meetups doing lunch with a number of them Peterson clearly is committed to Helping those who listen to him have a better life and you can hear that in his videos again and again and sometimes when people Come to me with just the tiny little low resolution Snapshot of Peterson that you know Peterson is is shilling toxic masculinity You know I'll you know then I'll then I'll show Jordan Peterson crying With a British with a British interview breaking down when he's talking about how he's been able to help young men now most people's Definition of toxic masculinity is that toxic masculinity means men don't cry well Jordan Peterson You know he's breaking down in his interviews. He's breaking down on stage He's breaking down or he's recording his audiobooks for Pete's sake this this is not a guy who is unable to show emotions both You know what might be characterized as strong and weak and so you know and I'll often tell people no I think Peterson is actually quite balanced with with a lot of this stuff and and so the thought peace wasn't I didn't think it was groundbreaking But I can very much understand why he wrote what he wrote having read a lot of his stuff over the years What it what it really reminded me of is the the masculinist now Did I not have that one up? Yeah here it is If if some I'll put the comment I'll put the link in the notes but if some of you are unaware of of Aaron Wren and his His email newsletter called the the masculinist a Lot of Jordan a lot of you Jordan Peterson folks would especially the men would probably like reading this now He is a Christian and he's a conservative reformed Christian but he's spending a lot of time talking about male and female now when I posted some of his stuff to a broader a Broader listserv that I participate in a lot of the women objected to the title, but okay Everybody's got objections, but I encourage them to read more deeply because his last few ones he's going into You know the issues that really Here's my broader point What what do thought is seeing what gives Jordan Peterson traction in our culture has everything to do with what's going on in the culture in other words Jordan Peterson was was out there having these ideas and you fans who have watched his videos all the way back into the into the Harvard days Why now why is this the Jordan Peterson moment well, it's because of everything that's been happening and and so So when you hear When you hear Aaron Wren and you see the kinds of things that he's writing You know, yeah, he's writing about very similar things as Jordan Peterson one of the things that I noted with with Wren is that he's Now this is a this is a conservative reformed Christian and and what he does in Masculinist number 17 is he's he's criticizing a lot of conservative reformed leaders Al Mohler Kevin DeYoung And at the Gospel Coalition, which is a major conservative reformed Website He's he's he's critiquing the the basis of attraction that that these that these groups are putting out And he's doing this as a conservative reformed Christian And and also an urbanist. He's a he's a city planner That's his that's his day job and and so, you know He goes through the the alpha and beta characteristics of attraction and a bunch of these things and and he's using basically Biology and you know, I would say just offhanded, you know Darwinist biology Which again if if you're part of conservative Christian subcultures, these things are often not appealed to but he's appealing to them You know without any apology and and using them to construct, you know his his ideas about Masculinity and men and women and attraction and women not marrying You know if women if a woman doesn't get married by the age of 40, she's gonna have a tough time Finding it and then even in this particular one in number 18 He goes back to Jordan Peterson a little bit which he had mentioned in a previous one But he too, you know, he admits here he hasn't watched He hasn't watched many of their videos He's not really a fan, but I was struck by reading his thing how how aligned he is in many ways with a bunch of Peterson's stuff and and so You know here here he weighs in on the Christian thing. Peterson is definitely not a Christian and You know, that's it's pretty dogmatic. But okay, and I have some issues with his psychology based approach I'm not endorsing him. But here's the thing Is there a big name Christian pastor anyone anywhere in America who would do what Peterson did in that video? Which is basically standing up to Kathy Newman and Peterson fans out there know exactly what video that is Would any of them completely reject the secular framing of the issue and stand on firm politically and stand firm on a politically incorrect Answer while being deeply knowledgeable about the issues from multiple perspectives I've never seen a Christian pastor do anything like this This is why they are increasingly irrelevant and why YouTube gurus like Jordan Peterson are drawing hordes of men and changing lives even if not always in the ways we would agree with and And I thought that was that was very much that was very much dead on and so I'll leave Links to the masculinist. So if some of you want to get on to that newsletter It's it's just an email list that you subscribe to and then whenever he puts one out you get one And I've I found them to be quite helpful and I've enjoyed reading them. I first found round I found round I first found them through through Rod drear whose blog I've read for a number of years and So, you know very interesting and I thought that was interesting especially compared to let's say Nicholas Nicholas Christoph's Easter Opinion piece and I'm thinking about maybe doing a little video on Jordan Peterson's Opinion piece in the Times of London that that also came out this weekend But you know Christoph's opinion piece was just you know Oh how how bad women have it in the Bible and how bad women have it in Christianity? And how how bad women have it everywhere and it's like, okay, but both the thought and And Aaron Wren make the point that of the major religions Christianity has been You know, okay male absence and female energy has also been the story I'll be at less starkly and dramatically of Christian practice and many times in places since today most Christian churches and denominations in America Conservative as well as liberal male-led and female-led both have some sort of gender gap sometimes modest But often stark despite their varying theologies evangelicalism mainline Protestantism Mormonism and Catholicism all have about a 55-45 female to male split in religious identification and for black churches It's even higher and if you go to some of Aaron Wren's earlier I'm gonna find his If you go to some of his earlier pieces You know, he very he spends a fair amount of time going into the male-female Split in Christianity why Islam seems more male-friendly while why Judaism seems more male-friendly and and Even despite this and despite the numbers you've still got a lot of opinion pieces like like Christoph wrote where he just says Oh the church is you know church is terrible to women Well, why do women outnumber men across the spectrum and almost everywhere in the church so these are these are good conversations to have and Again the masculinist I think quite a quite a few of you out there might enjoy him. So I'll put I'll put the show I'll put the I'll put him in the notes and that's just a little bit I hope to do a few more videos today
