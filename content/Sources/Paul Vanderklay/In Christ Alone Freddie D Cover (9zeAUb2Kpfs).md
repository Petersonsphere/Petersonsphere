 In Christ alone my hope is found, He is my Latrine, my song firm, Through worship's drought and storm His ways, And He loves that depths of peace, When fears are still, when servant sees, My Comforter, my all in all, Here it is you see, I love Jesus Christ, Ye in Christ alone who take on flesh, Forlorn of God, helpless babe, This gift of love and righteousness, Scorned by ones He came to save, The wrath of God has satisfied, For every sin on Him has laid, Here in death of Christ I live, And I'm Freddie Dee, Down with the showbiz, Don't forget about Paul, and Rick the editor, That's not all, Don't forget about Living Stones, Cause we come in and we stand at the throne, At Christ alone He's here to say, I love you anyway, Thank you for turning into the Freddie and Paul show, Really though, and that's all, Peace out, One Love, I gotta go.
