 Hi, this is Paul. What this is is a conversation between myself and Rick Repetti. Now it's a little bit different because we had a fairly significant part where I intended to just keep it private between us where we could get a chance to get to know each other and not have the presence of a camera where I could share some stories that maybe I don't share on a YouTube channel and he could do the same just so we could build a little bit of rapport. I always feel a little nervous when I make commentaries about things that other people do on the internet which of course I do as any of you who watch my channel know especially when I make commentaries on when people are telling their stories because it's really a danger that I might misrepresent them that I might get things wrong and that they might be hurt by my commentary more observations on their stories because our stories are precious to us. That didn't happen at all for Rick. He's had I think four or so conversations with John Vervecky. Rick very graciously reached out to me and we were able to talk and we had a wonderful conversation but not all of you probably saw I've seen much of his conversations with John so I am going to begin this with a segment from his conversation with John Vervecky where he goes through some of his story. Now he'll go through another aspect of his story when we talk but I thought that including that segment of his conversation with John would be helpful for understanding what we had to talk about and the subject that we talked about with respect to the relationship between institutions and spirituality. So I will begin with this segment of his conversation with John Vervecky and then we will go right into our conversation and I thought this was a it was quite a moving and a real wonderful experience talking to Rick and I hope we get a chance to talk again and I'm anxious to share and I'm curious to hear what all of you have to say about it so leave a comment and thank you for your time and attention. Ten thousand things I want to talk to you about after what you have to say. That's why I said an hour and 15 minutes might not happen. Well maybe we'll have me back another time. I'm really hoping for that. So I guess the one thing I want to start in on is I mean I well you know you've seen this series and I do work on it I mean you had what I would call a higher state of consciousness that led to a transformative experience. You have this experience it's of the really real it's more real than somehow your everyday existence and you transform your life right you transform your life you take a philosophy like and you build and you reorient to come into right relationship with that which is exactly what you know that's what a transformative experience is and so first of all be able to talk to somebody with your astuteness about this directly is very exciting to me. Have you had did you have like a single experience or did you have several of these experiences that were like that? Multiple multiple it got to the point where yeah I mean I was meditating like four hours a day. I would sit in meditation sometimes and be gone like somebody kind of disappear yeah and come back and thought it was ten minutes or something and it was four hours you know this kind of thing. I was maintaining consciousness sometimes through falling asleep this lucid yeah of awareness that I go to sleep I'd be in these altered states all night lucid dreaming kind of out of body astral travely kind of very like some of those just to me I know the terminology of lucid dreaming is when you know that you're dreaming without waking up that's the standard interpretation but I would like to have another word and I don't want to just use the same word because everybody takes that word to mean that but there have been dreams that are so real and so lucid in the ordinary sense of lucid. Yes yes brilliant clear like what's that word ontonormative that you use right have such a reality to them that they seem more real than the waking state. I've had a lot of those and I call them lucid because I don't know what else to call them but I understand lucid one and lucid too but I've had a lot of precognitive dreams like really like I think I mentioned are multiply precognitive dreams I've had those kind of transcendent Samadhi like experiences you know I have all kinds of you know weird psychic phenomena senses of telepathy seeing people's energy almost like psychedelic experiences you know yes yes but once I started doing this I stopped taking drugs and all that you know I did acid and stuff like that you know peyote and all that in the first I did do that actually I should say that there was a there was a short period after I got into meditation where I was still doing that stuff right right but then at a certain point I just you know I flipped and said that I got to stop doing that this is better one what was one of my meditation teachers quoted some Indian guru who said something like drugs are like plastic grapes and God is the wine or something like that and like you hear these phrases and that just something clicks and I thought yeah you know and then Ram Dass is guru Ram Dass was one of my teachers by the way I studied with him. Wow. He was a part of my Sangha for a few years in New York City that group that first teacher that I found maybe six months yeah six months into my going to her weekly meditations I finally talked my best friend into coming Barry real hippie acid freak kind of guy at the time I finally talked him into coming after he read you know be here now because I carried that book around like it was my Bible the first time he came Hilda wasn't there Ram Dass was there in her place he's like Hilda's not feeling well she asked me to you know substitute for her and Barry was like oh my God this must be the right place you know because we've got Ram Dass so but Ram Dass and after a short period of time of being in the group there were all these little private group meditations going on the splinters that private little Sanghas and in one of the teachers basement for like the elite followers or whatever we jokingly called them the God squad but I wound up getting right into all that in a short period of time and I had Hilda Ram Dass and another woman named Joya was very very spiritually advanced person she was like a walking ball of psychic energy of what do you call Shakti or Chi or you know depending on your tradition yeah I lost my train of thought I forgot what question I was answering oh did I have just one no it got to the point where 24 hours a day seven days a week I was in an altered mystical kind of state right right for a few for a few years and it got so bad I mean I was in my late teens at that point and then what happened this is this interesting thing because you'll like this story Ram Dass had been with the group for a few years and he had a falling out with the other two teachers particularly with Joya who according to Ram Dass wanted to induct him into tantric training oh I see yeah yeah and Ram Dass felt like he was sincere about it because he's gay and he thought he he's always been uncertain about his sexuality and he thought maybe this would be good for him and he tried it but he thought that she was more human than tantric in the experience I'm paraphrasing what he wrote about this when he left he wrote an article called egg on my beard or something because he felt bad because he brought all of his students to Joya and Hilda and then he left when he left the other two teachers were were pointing the finger at each other and Hilda said yeah yeah it's Joya you know she's kind of like she got the power too quickly she's kind of like Darth Vader or something you know too much power not without spiritual evolution enough you know her ego is still there and so they were all pointing fingers and they separated and to me I was with them for a few years my life had been radically transformed I mean I really felt like like one of the apostles with Jesus wow for years and then as if there were three Jesuses and they got a divorce oh boy it was horrifying and I didn't know what to do and I kept wanting to be with all three of them Ram Dass stopped being a teacher he would give an occasional lecture in a public forum and I would go to that but I kept going to Joya's meetings her separate little meetings her sangha satsang we call it back in that the Hindu name is satsang a community of Satya's truth you know a community of truth seekers so and I kept going to Hilda's but then Hilda didn't want me to go because I was one of her close people and like there was there was no love lost between them and and they were well Hilda was vilifying Joya Joya was not vilifying anybody but so I was like that kid was like I'm not going to decide between my parents but then Hilda at one point challenged me and said look if you keep going to Joya's you can't come to the private meetings you could only come to the open one at the church once a week so I went there a few times but after a while I just didn't like that whole scene and it was a horrific loss of support for me and even though ideologically and philosophically I've always revolted against this idea that I read it mostly in these you know contemplative traditions that you need a community because I had such a bad experience with community I like resisted that narrative whenever I come across it but on reflection just recently thinking about it and having a discussion with someone else like you just the other day I realized that I went through which I didn't mention yet I went through a kind of dark night of the soul really like negative supernaturalistic psychic you know mystical experiences after I lost the connection with the satsang with the sangha sounded very traumatizing yeah and I was you know I was in my late teens I don't know 18 something 19 I forget the exact age but I had all that it was like I was completely psychically open like my chakras were wide open I was very sensitive but I had no supports right and so all of a sudden I was having all these negative spiritual experiences and it really felt like like I was waiting for myself to have a stigmata or something like I felt like I was being attacked you know because I just didn't have when prior to them splitting up I was in a garden of Eden kind of state right all the time I was so in the flow everything was so natural and connected and and then it just became very alienated and I got I had a lot of weird overnight dreams I felt like I was battling demons and everything it just got too freaky for me and I had some symbolic moments like I had this one dream that was lucid not I you know I wasn't awake but it was actually my lucid dreams are almost both senses of lucid in that period because I would be awake I would not I would be aware I'd be conscious yeah during the dream and I knew that it was an altered reality I knew I wasn't in the waking world so I it was lucid but it was so normal for me that it didn't hit me like oh I'm in a lucid dream you know it was all the time for me but one of them many of them were so lucid they were lucid in that second sense of more real than real and in one of them I was climbing up this tower this wooden shaft very high and I knew that it represented my spiritual ascension and the higher I went the thinner it got it was wood and it was being blown about by the wind and it was rickety and the higher I went the more dangerous it was and I was almost at the top and I knew I if I went any further if the whole thing would collapse and so I just turned around and went back down and after that dream and a couple of other things like that I had a whole bunch of these kind of you know noetic omen like yeah insights that let me know I was playing with something that I was not equipped to play with I did not have the right skills I didn't have the right development so I decided I had a bunch of clues like on what I could do and I remember what's his name Ramakrishna Sri Ramakrishna Viva Kananda's teacher in the 1800s I don't know if the Vedantist yeah I remember him I remember reading that he smoked cigars or cigarettes or pipes whatever to keep him in his body that was one clue and somebody else some Buddhist you know shaman guy told his student that you need to eat meat or something because you know you're too imbalanced or whatever and you know so there was a bunch of these clues and I just decided I did this intense sadhana you know spiritual work to that brought all this on opened me up I've got to do like a reverse sadhana right shut it down and that's what I did so I started smoking and everything I gave up I brought back and then there was another period of my life where I started doing everything again and that was fun it was like being born again in the flesh other than born again in the spirit it was like going from a black and white world into a colorful world like I had ignored what in the two worlds ontology I was not in the lower world for years so I was happy it was happy to come back to that world and then I've been I kept I kept all I kept was my yoga practice my mantras two mantras that I've been doing one is like the the Jesus prayer or the from the church fathers curia liaison you know and all money put me home the Tibetan daily money mantra um you know Ram Dass had taught me that like he initiated me in that and gave me a mallor and all this kind of stuff um and put me into samadhi I had a phenomenal experience just me and Ram Dass once but um like I kept what I thought would sustain me because I knew I needed to keep my spiritual practice but uh what would shut down the chakras and all that whatever all that other stuff was you know I just tried to avoid anything that would like certain kinds of pranayama practices you know like chief cultivating practice I eliminated all of that I just kept a simple mantra which I could do throughout the day uh you know while I'm jogging or whatever doing anything you know and my mindfulness thing which guess who taught me that he was a member of that same group Danny Goldman oh wow you've known a lot of the stars that's for sure Danny's name back then was Jagannath Das he was one of uh him and Ram Dass had the same guru the little old man in India Maharajan named Kurali Baba oh so Danny was in the in our satsang back then and he taught me mindfulness so I thought yeah that's kind of clean and simple um and it's you know there are places where you could go like insight meditation whatever where it's it's just there's no guru thing involved I was averse to gurus I could see why anything Hindu theosophical anything that sounded like that I just avoided it I wanted something like zen but I didn't know any zen you know other than just you know whatever I could do on my own you know zazen or whatever but I didn't have any teachers but I knew how to do vipassana and so I've been doing that for decades as my primary practice and yoga um wow yeah I mean when you were doing it you reminded me of Hessa Siddhartha yes very much except you lived it um so no I was going to say that but I don't know if you would remember that scene that part of his life where he stops being a samana yeah and becomes a worldly guy yeah that image I got from him about color coming back right exactly in this world in in world one that was one of the two books that really opened me up in my late teens um me too so did do you do you still have I like do you still have mystical experiences or transformative experiences or are you in a place where that's no longer something you seek or or that comes to you or so what's like like usually people do this and then they go down and then they then they learn to sort of do this like right integrate uh where are you at with respect to that yeah um I've been reluctant to open any of those floodgates I can imagine ever since that happened so I have a good practice um when I when I'm more steady in my practice you know my practice goes up and down of course um but I pretty much I do yoga virtually every day and I do various different kinds of little meditative things every day and if you've been a multi multiple decades practitioner meditation infuses a lot of your life of course your wishes or what no you know so many different but I also sit and um but when I when my sitting practice gets a little deeper I go deeper um but even if I'm only sitting for 20 minutes sometimes or a half hour or 40 minutes or whatever yeah I'll go in the zone where it's a gnostic place yeah where my philosophical concerns don't matter to me at all yeah it's the weirdest thing and when I come out of it I'm like I feel great I feel connected but then this skeptical philosopher addiction of mine comes back and I'm like okay how could I you know how do I how do I integrate that yeah how do I so that's why I'm writing all the stuff that I'm writing because I'm hoping that just by keep delving into this and talking to other people like you and yeah you know that this will this will grow but I do believe that I'm moving back I'm starting to feel confident and mature enough that okay I was a kid I had a libido I had an ego I had all kinds of stuff that I didn't know about like that you see like 99% of what we do is not consciously calculated you know but like I feel I feel kind of grounded enough to where I'm not I'm not so worried about that anymore but I'm very busy so I don't have time to meditate four hours a day um but I am moving in that direction yeah yeah yeah that's amazing that's amazing I'm glad Rick first of all I'm really glad to have met you and I hope this is an ongoing thing oh so do I listen to me after hearing all the things not just the series of the 50 lectures but a couple of these voices with Reveke just yesterday I listened to something that published I think the day before but it was recorded in September the Four Horsemen of Meaning oh yeah that was awesome yeah everything I listened to you that you're on I'm like wow I wish I would have known this guy you know when I was in grad school you know so my trajectory would have but would have been you know I would have been more equipped I think to deal with the issues that I'm struggling with but it's never too late but I even think that I might it might be the case like I don't know when you talk about providence and things like that like you know I'm very skeptical of this mantra almost it's like a proverb everything happens for a reason you know like I ripped that thing apart with Occam's razor and error theories and like there's no way you could possibly calculate that or you know test that or anything so like it's like useless but sometimes is that there are other ways of understanding the same thing like it maybe even if it's just well it worked out for the best right okay so you know that's that's naturalistic it worked out for the best okay let's go with that minimalistic version of it but like me struggling and going through analytic philosophy going to it because of that vision that said you need to study philosophy not getting what I need but becoming such a skeptic and an empiricist and everything that that made me challenge like I really doubt my incredibly gnostic noetic experiences I'm capable of doubting them from a rational perspective yes better than anybody else I can you know I ask people I'll tell them this is what happened to me debunk it right but I could do it you know like this yeah yeah but I think like that was good because like you you want to reverse engineer enlightenment right if I can address the skeptic in my own head to my own satisfaction yeah about the validity of my experiences then I've done great work in my life yeah if I could share that with others yeah so I think my my struggle my existential philosophical psychological spiritual struggle is a good one yeah I wow I I think that's I think that it's extremely well said and and and extremely pertinent oh okay there's one there's there's a thread I want to pick up I want to ask you now you said this because I had a somewhat similar experience I you know I break out of fundamentalism I start doing all this stuff and you know and I'm I'm in the depths of the meaning crisis and all this stuff my own personal version of it and I get to university and I encountered the figure of Socrates reading the republic and I have some of my first mystical experiences you know I remember having I was sitting in bed and I was meditating and I had I don't know what to call it it was both a visionary experience a mystical experience of the platonic forms and it was like and it just sort of hit me like this and it was very much right and it for me it's become like a touchstone phenomenological touchstone taste because and you and you and you spoke it to you you have you get to this place that is trans conceptual yet nevertheless completely impregnated with intelligibility in a way that's yeah exactly it's amazing and how the platonic stuff somehow is very good vocabulary for trying to talk about this this is what I've been trying to articulate and I think in a clumsy fashion in many ways because people will do the same thing to me is like what you're some kind of neoplatonist but you're you're committed to you're committed scientists like what's going on how does that work um and yeah and trying to work that out very much did so it's with John that caught your eye and we could talk about that because I was I was kind of interested in some of the things that you said about my experience from your perspective now I have a little bit more understanding of your perspective but um but it not all of it felt like it really captured me the frames you know so I thought we'd have a discussion about that but also um you know I saw that you recently you posted something about the free will discussion that I had with John recently so we could talk about that we could talk about anything um I'm hoping those those are the two things I know that you have interest in me so I thought we could talk about either of those or anything else you know I'm just happy to talk with you so oh why don't we talk and this'll this'll very much bear on some of John's project and and even some of my project because part of what I've been trying to support is better conversations both for people who are sort of leaving church and for people who are curious about church and and part of and you know please correct anything that I if I misrepresented you in any of my commentary I'd love to be corrected I didn't take it that way at all okay I'm very open to the possibility that my hearing new interpretations of my experience might be insightful and helpful okay okay but but the the whole question of the whole question of institutions and structures with respect to um even what word shall we use I mean spirituality it's it's such a yeah I know but you know and especially you know one of the things that I am re-listening to your talk with John you know I thought a lot about um Paul's letter to the Corinthian church remind me of the content of that letter been a long time so Corinth Corinth is right in the middle of Greece and so in order to you know everything in the Mediterranean goes to Rome all and so basically Corinth is a way that you could bring your grain up from Egypt up the coast and then go to Corinth and then you take it off the ship and it goes just a little ways you put it on another ship and then go to Rome so Corinth was destroyed by the Romans and then rebuilt sort of like New Orleans you're always going to have a city there and it became I don't know a major temple to Aphrodite became a major um you know could have been something like the Vegas of you know that part of the Mediterranean and a church grew in Corinth and it became a wealthy you know probably not wealthy on Roman standards but wealthy on church standards in terms of the very very early church um also that all the all the biggest um all the biggest names would go through there Peter went through there Paul went through there Apollo went through there everybody everyone who was anybody preaching went through there and they had um and they boasted of the best spiritual experiences in the church anywhere they were the most spiritual church so you know the the analogies don't probably work but something along the lines of you know the the biggest Pentecostal churches that would be able to sort of like Reading in California this whole other world there but you know so they boasted of that and Paul Paul writes to them and basically says you know you I've had my spiritual experiences make yours look dull um then he he talks about that but but what Paul sort of doubled downs in that double downs on that letter is number one the the cross of Christ that that that's really at the center of Christianity but then also in that letter you get the formation of what will become the Eucharist um in Christianity because there oh there's a lot of speculation about what that was like early on but um it was that was just sort of whenever they broke bread they would that would be their communal meal celebration but Paul goes after them because of course the the the wealthy people in the church would be feasting and drinking and getting drunk and the slaves would have to you know make the whole thing work and Paul just excoriates them and says it'd be better if you didn't mention the name of Christ at all during your feast the way you're handling it and so um and so part of it in in Christianity there's always been this tension between the the the charismatic the ecstatic the participatory you know what we might call the spiritual experience versus the institutional the the religio you know the binding you know turning intentionally turning some wine to water for the sake of the rest so and I listened to your talk and you know you talked about you know you you obviously had you were together with the best teachers you had amazing spiritual experiences I mean it seemed to me listening to you like very quickly and very early in life you you were sort of opened the doors and in a sense given the keys to the kingdom and you went all the way to the top and realized I'm not ready for this this doesn't fit me or the story of my life or where I'm at right now and but then at the same time your community went away and then you sort of reverse and you go in a different direction so yeah so where for you does community and or institution fit in your thinking of what it means to not simply be a carbon trousered ape really good question yeah I'm not sure Paul to be totally honest with you like you know I I grew up Catholic and I don't remember exactly what changed it was a very slow and gradual process over the years of me not trusting the Catholic Church it might have had to might have had to do with just the representatives of that church being mean-spirited and you know all kinds of weird encounters that I had with them when I was little I think maybe I was in the first grade when we had some kind of sacrament I don't know if it was an official sacrament I just don't remember because I was really young where we were supposed to come we were given these little scapulas which is like a string around your neck with a little some kind of icon thing inside a little plastic holder of a saint or an angel I don't remember it was some religious weird Latin looking thing you know and we had to we were supposed to come back on Saturday school was Monday to Friday and and have it blessed and my school was like two miles away I used to take a public bus but I was a first grader and I my older sisters went to the school so I would go with them because I was too young to be on the bus by myself but I couldn't go by myself on Saturday and my father didn't want to go he had a hangover and I didn't understand that when I was that age but he just told me I can't take you or whatever and so on Monday my teacher who was a nun asked me where were you and I said my father said I couldn't go and she slapped me in the face this kind of thing those were the nuns right so I had that you know and they would beat kids and everything you know the corporal punishment was totally normal and everything but then there was also all kinds of weird judgments about sin and you know they treated us like we were dirty and it was just like a whole negative experience being around that and so and then you know you hear these great gospel things in church and everything and it was just like a kind of total disconnect and I also remember arguing with them like so I was like a natural born philosopher you know I remember hearing in catechism class or whatever it was called you know religious class you know we had regular subjects but we also had the religion the story about baptism that like I'll never forget this story two babies both die at the beach one bay apart one of them is fortunate they're not Christians one of them is fortunate that somebody comes over and baptizes them right that baby gets to go to heaven the other baby goes to limbo limbo is some kind of weird neutral place where you can never be with God or anything else happy or good you know there's purgatory there's hell and I remember thinking didn't you say God knows everything God's everywhere God's good he knew everything beforehand not a hair you know a leaf or whatever he knows about that babies are innocent that doesn't make sense and I don't remember the answer but it was some kind of like you know because mommy loves cream cheese you know it's one of those non-explanations that you know but I had a lot of those those kinds of things and you know I got I picked up early on that that wasn't really encouraged in that space yeah yeah so I had all that kind of thing going on and you know I held on to the you know belief in God and in Jesus and all of that and and when I was a teenager I just wasn't that serious about going I stopped going to church religiously yeah obviously I think I I well we moved from Queens which is one of the boroughs in New York City like Brooklyn when I was 13 and I had always gone to church there but when we moved to Brooklyn I went for a while to a new church I didn't really connect with the one nearby and it was called Holy Ghost and then they changed it to Holy Spirit I thought that was what what is that about you know it was one one change after another like oh now you can eat meat on Fridays or whatever like the Vatican II you know they stopped doing the mass in Latin and that kind of mysterious thing I enjoyed that and then when that was gone it just it felt secular or something and like so all these different things and eventually it kind of just faded out of my world view although I still believed in God and in Jesus you know so and but then when that yoga thing happened to me it it opened me up into a larger uh I forgot the question I'm answering right now no but you're doing great yeah I just don't remember what the question was because I don't I don't want to go too far in one direction I don't remember what your question was I don't remember what it was either but it was a good story oh what do I think about church or institution yeah that's where you're going yeah yeah so and then it was also the hippie era I mean I'm a little older than I look I'm 64 oh wow yeah I'm I guess I'm younger than I look I'm only 58 how old am I yeah I'm 59 no I'll be 59 this year I'm 58 so I'm six years older than you so then you know when when when we grew up well I grew up in the tail end of the 60s era yeah so there was pot smoking and LSD and all that hip stuff and that that was just kind of like cultural osmosis and all the rock music and all the lyrics imagine there's no heaven all that you know you know that all came in and that's around the same time that I have found yoga and meditation so and that kind of opened up like oh you know it's not just Jesus it's Buddha and Krishna and all that other stuff and you know that's what happens with people who that that's that claim I remember reading people complain you know Christians pretty much complaining about yoga it's not so secular you know it's a kind of gateway into other religions and mysticism and all this and my first reaction was oh don't be so this paranoid but the truth is it really is it really is it's a kind of stealth you know Hinduism or something like that so but and that happened to me and I got drawn into all that stuff and I managed to find really powerful charismatic sage-like teachers and there were when I the first time I went to one of the meditation meetings the very first one I went to my teacher's name was Hilda she wore a sari she was older she looked like Glenda from the Wizard of Oz spoke like that yeah I'm not exaggerating and you know the the mythos around her was that she lived for like 20 years with all these you know evolved beings and recognizable big shot names in yoga in India and whatnot and there were like hundreds of people in this church basement in Greenwich Village and they were singing songs waiting for her to come in and there was all this devotion and love and beautiful hippie looking people and it was I just felt like wow this is kind of like I resonated with this and then when she came in there was hundreds of people there and she was walking down the middle of the aisle and I was right near the the middle of the aisle and she stopped and looked me up and down and I just felt this tremendous love and something it was just something transhuman or something you know I had never felt that with the priests or the nuns well except once I remember when when I was a choir boy singing Oh Holy Night on Christmas Eve once one of the nuns looked at me like as if she saw something coming through me like I touched I could tell by looking at her that like I brought tears to her eyes yeah because I was just some innocent little kid who got pulled up into the spirit of that I might have been like seven or something um in any event so that was like a church it was in a church basement and there was there were Christian songs being sung you know folk music and then Hindu chanting and all that and so that that became you know but then like you know you know the fast forward that whole thing came tumbling down um four or five years later when the teachers split there were three of them you know Hilda was the main teacher after a while I realized there was two other teachers connected with her Ram Dass and this other woman named Joya or her later name was Majaya yeah they split up so then I became kind of allergic to any kind of spiritual groups I became suspicious of any kind of guru type preacher leader you name it that was a kind of angry fearful reaction I suppose how old were you in that phase about 19 okay yeah 18 19 rebelling against the rebels yeah yeah that's funny but it's true and um you know I had a kind of born-again-in-the-flesh thing um one of my interpretations of myself that I thought was a little bit different from yours was that that wasn't a failure it was an organismic important thing for me to do like I had been in this upper register for too long and I was like floating around I felt like a character in a supernatural movie or something you know I just was completely disconnected and I just felt like I needed to reverse course yeah um one of the other things I wanted to tell you about I hope that noise isn't too loud that's all right don't worry about it um was I remember you caught my use of the word skill when I described this to John I said part of my realization was that I didn't have the skills yeah to do that and I remember you talking about it in a kind of Protestant way about it's not about skill my friend it's about grace you know um so you know yes and no you know I kind of agree and partly disagree because well your practices do sustain you and they're important and they ground you and all that kind of stuff um but I just I knew that I needed to retreat for a whole bunch of different reasons and saying that was I didn't have enough skill was probably not the best description um it's a hard thing to get to figure out how to talk about so yeah you're right you're right it's a difficult topic but um and so for the longest time I mean my teachers even though I lost faith in them on one level I still respected them and loved them almost like a puppy whose master beats him he still loves the master you know they never abused me or anything like that but you know I love these these three people they're all gone now but um it just I you know I couldn't trust I couldn't outsource my moral or spiritual compass to anyone anymore that's how I felt like I need to take I need to take my path into my own hands and like they never charged anybody for yoga meditation any of that stuff and so for years I had this purest attitude that I would never pay to go and take a yoga class or or any kind of course like that's fake you know your priests don't charge they pass the bucket around you could put money in there that's that's the Indian way too and that like in almost every real religion you don't pay you donate you know voluntarily so and I had that attitude so I stayed away from almost any I didn't want to go anywhere where there was some guru or an ashram or anything and I also didn't want to go and take classes or anything like so I was kind of on my own for many many years but I realized only recently just pretty much around the time I started talking to John about this sort of thing that you know you were right on one level that if I had a community that I felt comfortable with my spiritual path would have been different there's no doubt about that but I'm not so sure that the way that I retreated and then came back around very slowly and gradually at a way you know with the kind of somewhat autonomy of my own and my philosophical explorations of all of these things I'm not so sure it's a it was a loss or a pathological thing you know I think it was organismically kind of a gestalt thing that happened to me for a variety of good reasons one more little tidbit in one of my deep meditation experiences it was a trance it was like a vision but even that word is not appropriate I was in this kind of space where it felt like I really felt like I was inside the mind of God like Plato's form all pure ideas and everything was intelligible as I had this deep non-conceptual understanding and when I came out of it I remember thinking I don't know how to even express that but I felt almost like a message from divinity to me like my job in this life was to to learn philosophy so that I could talk about these things and I remember almost feeling like this was a command given to me that I resisted I didn't want to do that but I didn't want to ignore it so I went to the local college which was Brooklyn College and I went to the philosophy section in the bookstore and I was looking at the books to see what is this philosophy I had a very you know limited conception of it my father happened to have some kind of it was like an encyclopedia of philosophy this one old book about the size of a bible with hundreds of philosophers in there and I never understood any of it when I would read it and he used to try to encourage me to read it I was like I don't get it dad so when I went and looked in the in the books I was like this is all dry logical analysis empiricists all that you know like analytic philosophy was pretty much the norm in western colleges philosophy departments and I was like this is dry it has nothing to do with those experiences that I had I'm not going to do it and I went for eight years between high school and college before going back to college I wound up by accident serendipity thinking okay I've got to do something with my life I had blue collar jobs driving tractor trailers and things like that I had all kinds of jobs but like I thought I'm not going anywhere I have a brain I have to do something with my life and I thought well computers was really interesting and I thought cognitive science and computers maybe there'll be an interface we could read what the brain's doing all this kind of stuff and I went to college I hadn't done math in like 10 years because I didn't do math in the last two years of high school I did foreign languages you had options and like I passed the math entrance exams but you needed a lot of math for computer science so my first math class that I took which was the next level it was so hard for me I was spending three hours a night just to do like three problems I had to keep looking up in my old high school algebra book I didn't remember formulas and it used to come totally naturally to me but I just didn't use that muscle so I thought you know you have to love what you do but you have to be good at it so this isn't for me but I loved my philosophy class so yeah yeah so my life took a different turn you know and I wound up here I am as a philosopher and the funny thing is I majored in philosophy but the attitude among philosophers towards religion is very very most of them at least in the ones who teach in the colleges dismissive religions aren't really philosophies they're more like ways of life their belief systems you know there's a saying that philosophers use to try to make themselves seem smarter than religionists and it goes something like this religion is a set of answers that shouldn't be questioned and philosophy is a set of questions that can't be answered right that's very kind that's very kind so so but I never found I never got you know answers to any of my deeper questions in philosophy anyway but I did get a lot of conceptual linguistic rational tools from philosophy so that I can at least try to articulate and reason and examine and inquire on my own and it's an ongoing thing for me I'm just beginning to realize that I said about institutions that you know institution I growing up as a hippie age kid you know forget institutions let's do everything new but now you know as people say when you get a little older and wiser now you realize there needs to be a balance you need to have hierarchy competence hierarchies as Jordan says are good things but you need to have you know the prophets yelling about that and all that kind of thing so like I've come around but you know I've always hoped that there's a name what's his name Rupert Shell Rupert Sheldrake yeah that's the guy I think that's his name who talks about anatheism have you heard him I haven't heard him on anatheism yeah and what he I don't know if he's if that's a neologism of his but what he means by it is when you reach a certain level of spiritual exploration outside the religion you gave up for those of us who did it might be wise to go back and revisit your original religion not necessarily in a nostalgic way of trying to believe myths that you don't no longer believe but to just try to you know re-embodied your original faith so I try to do that I'm open-minded but you know it's an ongoing exploration for me helpful if I talk to you about that because you know you're the man I'm not I'm not Roman Catholic and and it was but your story very much helps me because I you know when I listened to you I thought you know this this guy's not this guy's not been away from I have a friend who stops in here often he's Sikh and we have he's a he's a young man and he's just really getting into his Sikh religion now and studying it and everything and so he listens to my channel and so we're often comparing notes and we have wonderful conversations and but I listened to you and I thought there's there's some church back there because it it gets in I mean if you're raised in it it it comes in under the radar it's it's part of the formation and it doesn't go away well let's so also in terms of you know I noticed with the philosophy I mean you on one hand you know have you know a degree a vocation a career within formal academic philosophy but of course philosophy you know there's I think a greater recognition now and John certainly has been helpful in bringing this up philosophy to the Greeks was probably closer to something that a secular person might look at and say well that's kind of a religion than what where we see philosophy today so um is you know where is that for you right now I mean where is your philosophy and your spirituality where where do they how do they relate to each other yeah yeah this is an ongoing rediscovery for me because you know what attracted me to philosophy originally was just um what was the first thing that I read in college it was um Plato's Apology um and two snippets from the Republic which was the line and the cave I don't know if you know about the line uh metaphor but the cave and um so reading about Plato's forms that Socrates as a character he just that seemed like he's like a sage so or a prophet you know he really was like kind of holy man he believed that he had a divine sign and he'd stand there in trances and you know his his own teacher was Diotima who was some kind of uh like a mystery cult leader you know so there's all that stuff but then as once I majored in it that like like John says academic philosophy just kind of took a turn uh after um some emperor shut down Plato's Academy around the fifth century or so um you know you had people like Maimonides and whatever there've been certainly people throughout that you know who are religious and philosophical but you know in the modern era with the Enlightenment most philosophy has been it's not a way of life right so like just like psychology is not a way of life it's just like an academic subject you know therapists who have clients full book of practices they don't go home and live a psychological mode of life right right and most philosophers don't either you know they teach they grade papers they go to conferences they debate they you know they they write they have to publish and all that it's a it's a it's a nice thing it's like being a mathematician who's just taken by abstract pure math not not engineering math right or like theoretical physics not you know science you know applied physics applied right yeah so philosophy is most of it's that you know so it's just a kind of interest like being interested in chess or something for most philosophers not that they're they're not trying to solve some interesting and important problems or map things out and you know it's kind of like being an artist on one level artists like to make paintings and philosophers academic philosophers like to make arguments and theories and all that and and you know and play them off of each other and all so and i got sucked into all of that because you have to become good at that to succeed in that world but it throughout the entire journey for me i i felt that there was philosophies missing something and it's missing this other aspect that's why i really love meeting john because john is connected with a bunch of philosophers who are living philosophy as a way of life and they're they're developing these these other practices that really embody the spirit of philosophy that socrates and all these other dudes you know i believe that they really were not logic crunching geeks like most academic philosophers are nowadays but so only after i finally got my phd got my tenure you know and then like did i start to be able to feel like okay i myself can start doing philosophical research on things that really interest me as a human being which is free will meditation buddhism all that kind of stuff so you know and and it's all just starting to come at come into integration in it's that part of it has always been missing for me private interest of mine i mean i've had a meditation practice a yoga practice all that kind of stuff i had my you know journaling i've been i've been living i've been living i kind of by myself as a philosopher who lives their philosophy because of these other spiritual practices of mine but it hasn't completely you know and actually you know what happened to me ironically if you remember now you know it's like a divinity told me you need to learn philosophy so that you could explain this divinity experience that you just had but the philosophy was almost like a trojan horse that a virus got into me which is the super skepticism about all things spiritual right so once i was exposed to these really brilliant philosophers who just cut anything in half that you don't have evidence for concrete scientific evidence for there's been a schism in my own psyche because i like i i kind of took all that philosophical training in but i've got this other side like thank god literally that i've been inoculated but it's almost like the cove inoculation it's not that good yeah you know because like i still got cove it you know and no because i and i say you know i have friends who've been who were in that original spiritual community with me who are still in one or another of those three spiritual teachers communities even though the teachers have all died who've been meditating and practicing the teachings that like they never left they just went with this teacher there were three teachers someone with one the other or the other right so the ones who were with hilda you know they still in a little ashram land that she has upstate this whole big estate and they're living there and they're some of them say they've never had a real spiritual experience right they've been practicing so this is the kind of thing like and i think well i had all those if i took my all my experiences like playing cards and doled one out to each of them they would all be like half enlightened or something or at least that's what they think like they think they're missing something because they didn't have those experiences and i know well they didn't enlighten me they were they had an impact on me a huge impact on me but and i've heard these i've heard people claim i don't know john hick is one of them but i've heard some pretty respectable philosophers of religion or mystics claim that if you've ever had one of these authentic experiences you could never doubt it right but philosophy has led me to be able to doubt every single one of my experiences that's why i said it's like a trojan horse so i like i don't know if this was a blessing a command or a punishment that said go learn philosophy because that's it's like a schism in me part of me the the larger part of me like you said i was raised a christian you know the larger part of me wants to believe and does believe but i'm also always struggling with well you know uh you might believe that but you know all the people who are your respected colleagues and peers the standard that you've accepted with them whenever you argue with them it's where's the argument lead what's the best argument for that conclusion and if you don't have the best one you know the burden's on you you know this kind of thing ockham's razor and all these things and it's like i struggle philosophy and faith i struggle and i remember early on in my philosophical career one of my sweet professors stanley malinovich a very sweet man i don't remember we was in ethics class and i forget how it came up but i remember him asking us you know forget the curriculum he said but do you guys think it was a small class maybe eight of us in there because it was a high level ethical theory class only philosophy majors were in it do you think philosophical inquiry undermines your faith and everybody in the class said yes except me me i said no i think the philosophical tools i can use them to support my faith that was how i started out because that's why i wound up in philosophy that's what i thought i was supposed to do but it had this weird effect on me but then i i keep thinking okay if i can conquer that then the mission was worth it it's important what i think my my calling or my purpose is to to is to try to be able to be somebody like john hick or some other philosopher who makes a coherent case for for you know something better something deeper something else where other people who are on the fence and they go you know i wasn't sure if i was entitled to believe that if that irrational but rick repetti's argument helped me that's one of my motivations to help other people who are where i've been and i'm still there really so that's me being completely honest i'm i and i call myself semi-agnostic which implies that i'm semi-gnostic because all those experiences that i have i would count them as gnostic type experiences absolutely when i was inside them i was absolutely certain that i was in touch immediately with a deeper reality yeah and that's the thing about losing the church or losing it losing a container and all on one level yes but on another level no i had like total faith when i turned around the metaphor that i like to use it's almost like i knew i had to dive back into the world it was like diving into a lake of mud i might go down into hell but i have a pure soul and i'm going to come back up the right way at the right time because i have faith in the universe i mean i really felt that and when i was having that dark night of the soul paul i mean at night i i'm embarrassed to say this publicly because sometimes people will think well you must be nuts i used to have respect for you rick but you really believe things like that but i mean every night when i was going through that dark night of the soul i was battling demons all night long in my sleep i had like an archangel come rescue me once in one of my dreams you know those were real things they were more real than my embodied daily existence at the time yeah yeah that doesn't surprise me that doesn't surprise me at all no i really thought if i don't turn around i'm going to start having the stigmata and i like i didn't want that life i felt like i'm being called to do something i don't want to do it like that's not the life for me i'm 19 i don't have a girlfriend you know lord make me celibate just not yet right yet make me taste sort of soon wow yeah so many things so many things um i want to mention i think john john i know bought the book i think you only read a couple chapters of it um it's just a small book c.s lewis's miracles wow i heard you talk about it yeah that book has been i have to read that yeah after what i heard you say about it well i guess i'm gonna get i'm gonna get way late on how many you said so many things and there's so many points i want to i want to touch on but that book for me um i mean part of the reason i i i found peterson interesting i didn't know about young or anything like this and then he just kind of comes on the scene and it's like wait a minute wait a minute i i had a full realization that on one hand you know when i'm preaching the bible i'm talking to people about let's say the story of genesis where ancient near-east cosmology of a dome you've got pillars you've got you know and but everybody in the church listening to me has a you know a sun and then the earth and you know and it's like how on earth do these two worlds relate to one another and you know i i i dealt with that you know always dealing with that and and it was louis who um you know louis is is in many ways i think a a predecessor there've been lots of meaning crises over the centuries but but louis was very much a an early 20th century one he had went to the first world war got exactly the right kind of injury where he he sat out most he survived the war because he sat out most of the war in a hospital and then went to teach at oxford um xford cambridge with this new discipline called english and it's like why is that a new discipline um and of course had met tolkien and a couple of tolkien's friends and began to believe that christianity was the true myth and that you know unlike all these other dying and resurrecting gods jesus was one in history who died and was resurrected and you know all of this stuff and so louis of course has been a a really big deal in a bunch of in a bunch of christian communities but i you know in the in the midst of all sorts of things just always feeling the pull of sort of the the secularist materialist perspective and so i would read csl's miracles two or three times a year just to sort of oh wait a minute oh wait a minute is you know i i needed that for some part of me um and and so for me you know this the question of reason and what is it i mean for louis in miracles reason is like one of these minor miracles in that it's just this little gift of grace that allows human beings to sort of every now and then ascend from you know the the maelstrom we live within you know and when you mentioned you know philosophy the one with the best argument it's even it's even a strange thing to ask well what what what what is it that makes this that makes each of us listen to this one argument and say oh that's a good argument and then to have a group of people listen to that argument and say well that's the best argument when you've got this other group of people over there and looking at say no that's not the best argument that's it's it's not just math although it's not disconnected from math but it's not just math there's a weird thing to us with with all of this supposed rationality and objectivity that at some point you look at it you just say no that's not that's not that's not all that's going on here yeah well you know john's made this very clear point about the four p's propositional perspectival procedural and participatory and the philosophy that i was raised in and trained in is all the first one propositional premises and conclusions and logic and what's the evidence for the premises and and that's you know and that is somewhat mathematical but you're right whether or not a premise is plausible and john makes a big deal about plausibility in his 50 some odd lecture meaning crisis series plausibility is really important it's not we can't really prove hardly that much so it's it's more about what's plausible whether or not something's plausible to you depends on what your participatory and procedural and whatever the other third the third one was sometimes you know all that stuff you know so so that that was one piece another piece was i don't have this i don't have the major book here but um it's you know swinging back through the institutional question it's difficult for most of us to realize that 150 years ago the discussions in philosophy in american academic settings would have been radically different from what they are today on exactly the points you just described so one of my one of my teachers at at calvin college george marston this is one of the minor books it's not his major book on um um on the academy but the the this massive transformation that happens at the end of the 19th century whereby you know you enter the 19th century where harvard yale amherst brown these are princeton these are all religious institutions founded for the training of clergy who are in many ways sort of competing with each other they're battling with each other over over protestant confessional orthodoxies back and forth that you know by the beginning of the 20th century and well into the middle of the 20th century they all sort of become homogenous in this other project which has nothing to do with what they were about 100 years before and that's a that's a major transformation that touches on this question of institutions and spirituality where suddenly all of that has to go away because we have this other project which is all about propositional truth that is the main project and sure we'll have all our internecine rivalries back and forth between academics but for the most part all of the big institutions unless they're these catholic or christian or these religious institutions all of these institutions are doing the same thing and again it's been interesting watching you know the you know the the you know we will have to see how much longer that game will go it's not at all certain so so then to kind of swing back to kind of science envy i would say oh well and that hit theology in a huge way in the 19th century as well especially protestant theology i mean all the protestants wanted to do was turn their theology into a science and basically by you know the the middle to the end of the 20th century it's all abandoned it's just it's completely abandoned and the and many of the divinity schools that are still connected to some of these ivy league schools i mean they're just either the the the the the the the the the the the the the the they're kind of swept up in the religion of activism today you know post 60s or there i mean you can you leave you leave yale law school with a law degree or you leave yale divinity school with a divinity degree your expected employment prospects from those two schools can hardly more dissimilar so i have a my my son's girlfriend you know has a law degree from from yale law and you know you leave that institution and the doors just fling open yale divinity well oh that's nice what's what are you gonna do with that you know find some mainline church with a fat endowment that's about your only prospect so um you know so part of this so you know your story is so interesting because the desire to to have philosophy once again be recognized as a conversation that impacts and and alters a lifestyle i mean all this i mean over the have you ever heard the name dallas willard no okay dallas willard was a phenomenologist taught at usc in southern california died several years ago very interesting guy he was one of the few sort of top tier american philosophical academics who also became a a leader of a christian movement which was all about practice spiritual practices and very very very interesting guy but you know he in some of his books you know he wrestled with these questions because you know for him when he read i mean it it was only after rereading dallas willard i don't know how many times that i finally decided i was going to open up plato's republic in greek you know i'd learned greek as part of my new testament formation as a minister but it's only after reading dallas willard a number of times that it ever occurred to me i should open played i should open up playdo in greek and what does playdo read like in greek when i'm used to reading the new testament and it's like oh wait a minute um you know it's a big conversation how conversant maybe how much playdo how much jesus knew of playdo as a big conversation but certainly a few generations hence with church fathers you very much have people who are reading jesus and are reading playdo and that of course will come then into the greek fathers and on and on and on and on and on so well they all spoke greek too didn't they yeah yeah yeah that was like english at the time yeah yeah yeah well it was the common language well aramaic of course in the persian empire was so jesus likely spoke aramaic but chances are you know all these academic debates of course about serious when jesus spoke with pilot what language did they speak do you know my guess would be greek coiny yeah yeah yeah that would be my guess yeah me too so so you know i even though i i can very much imagine that um your interests and john's interest at this moment might feel on the fringes of the academy a little bit of historical perspective suggests that the anomaly might in fact be what is at the center of the academy now now say more about that well interesting of course you know john did a conversation with a couple of people about um you know universities where the universities in the west luther of course was an augustinian monk who was also a lecturer at the the vittenberg you know university that um his patron was trying to beef up they also had one of the best collections of relics in europe's one of the ironies of the protestant reformation um and the universities were in many ways in protestantism sort of became a replacement for the monasteries or so the monasteries so so in the protestant reformation some of the divorce monasteries sort of both became the nuclear family and also universities and so you know almost all the the universities the older universities in america they're all founded by sectarian protestant organizations until of course the catholics come and they're a lot later in american history there's not a lot later because it's just not a lot of american history but they're later they're later to come and they've really of course taken on they're able in some ways to transplant a lot of their their gravitas to america which really gave them a boost but that's that's the majority story in terms of the university and this this modernity and the analytics and the the fetishism over propositionalism that's again that really only got going in the 19th century and it looks to me like it's nearly it's we're beginning to see the end of it it's playing out and so looking at a historical perspective where this will likely be the land will be something probably a return to the longer pattern which would be that universities pursue truth within a religious container that that seems to me but see the the idea of secularism has always been secularism is going to sweep away religion because of course religion itself that entire framework is all a framework of this modernist period but you know just looking at the way things are going now no i think the modernism is going to get swept away and the secularism is going to be eventually continue to sort of lose its grip the terrifying thing is that secularism afforded sort of a coin a atmosphere whereby sectarians who previously drew each other's blood could have arguments and leave and go home and have common systems and you know we're seeing this break you see this breakdown in the rise of islamism in the i was talking to my seek friend about india you know renewed persecution of seeks and christians you see this in various christian realms as well so rise of certain fundamentalisms that can get violent so you know there there's a lot even though the orthodox and some catholics would say hooray for the end of liberalism i'm a little bit more sober because with liberalism and secularism we also had a fair amount of ending of bloodshed and that's not a bad thing so i i when i when i listen when i look at your you know when i listen to you talk and i look at john's project i think in those terms and and so i i really do think that that you and john are actually you're much more to the norm of the far longer project of philosophy and of course now cognitive science is a is a new thing and that you know you're the future is bright even if we have a lot of really scary questions about what the future will look like yeah one of them is about this secular religion of wokeism which is taking over the universities and that's part of the reason and i think that's that's a sign of the decline of the secular of the secular and and post you know post-modernity sort of began to undermine the secular and so when you see let's say in many ways jordan peterson the idw types were sort of those who sort of stood up and they're peterson's a weird guy because he's both a modernist and he's you know because that young thing sort of goes different ways but um you know classify yeah but but the you know the big push back against wokeism in many cases is a you know let's preserve modernity but there's no going back there's never a going back and that's of course something that the orthodox and the catholics always have to deal with there's never going back purely because you can't unsee everything that has come and so wokeism is just a sign that yeah if you don't have a religious foundation you're going to have a hard time having a degree of stability and continuity over multiple generations and and and part of especially in america we are we we don't think in in terms of lineages older civilizations do that asian civilizations do that you know the catholic church does that these are very old institutions that are always thinking you know five generations down the road after me today it's like i want my best life now that's that's that your your people will never endure if you think that way yeah yeah you make an awful lot of sense paul which makes me like i said earlier i've come around to respecting the importance of institutions but i'm not quite sure which institutions i can throw my support behind completely well you're not i mean and that's part it's a part of my estuary thing is exactly about that because so a lot of people i talked to a lot of people now who are basically like i what you just described that they're so thoroughly disenchanted part of them just hungers for a spiritual experience and so okay well you're going to go play with psychedelics and you'll have your experience but that's not enough one of the key things we're wrestling with is okay well now we've got all this technology we've got this power we've got this affluence what exactly do we want what will what will finally satisfy us and of course in an augustinian tradition we will say um god and that sounds like a tride answer and then many lips it is but you know it isn't but yeah what exactly does that mean for those of us who are you know continued to be wrapped in skin and maybe if we have in you know in clock time a few minutes hours or even days but in in in mental space seems like eternity we come down and then you know there's there's bathing and eating and talking and bill paying and and so what are we looking for and can we ever get there i mean those are those are the enduring fundamental questions yeah and and those questions are go all over the world yeah socrates main question i think is summarized sometimes as how should i live or how should one live yeah yeah you know so so i don't know if any of that was helpful or yes it was all very helpful i very much enjoy our conversation well what shall we land the plane here or what would you like to do i've got about a half hour left if you want to use it or we can land the plane here and um i can do a little bit editing and send something to you and you can say yeah that'd be okay to share or you can say now let's just keep it to ourselves or let's just send it to john or you can do any of those things yeah no i i think everything once we shifted gears from the personal stuff is fine um i'm fine with that yeah well i i hope this was i hope this was worth your time oh it absolutely was i hope it was worth yours oh no it's i love it i i i can't get enough of this kind of thing so which is why i why i'm in the profession i am i suppose you know what before you go i've heard you mention and discuss occasionally the estuary but i i never looked it up so tell me about that what is that that i have for almost 25 years been the minister of a little church on a seedy little corner and not the most important city in america um sharing my life and giving my life to a lot of older people who never watch any of my videos would have very little idea of a lot of what we spoke about in this conversation never think about playdoh or socrates or any of these things and at the same time have always wanted to have conversations like these when when jordan peterson came around i made my first video suddenly my buddy rick stops in church the first sunday after i make my video gives me this poster and says i've never been to church before in my life but here i am and for the next couple of years after church says well what do you think of this ricky says i have no idea what's going on with you people it's inconceivable what's going on here but after you know after a month or so of making videos rick is and some of my friends said well let's why don't you do a meetup and so i'm sorry jordan peterson meetup i thought nobody's going to come to this doesn't people come i mean what am i going to do with these people i don't know we're just going to sit down and talk so we talked for about two hours and then we keep talking in fact we talked so long that it's 1 30 in the morning and the church phone rings and i thought i know who that is that's my wife who are these people you're with so at that point it was like okay i need to have an end time so then we would do it the next month and we just have a conversation we do it the next month one of the things that i realized in how many years of church work is that very few people would imagine you know just like that woman who knocked on the door here i need some gas money or i need some food or i need 20 because i really need some beer or you know whatever they knock on my door for nobody would ever knock on the door and thinking i'd really like to have a good conversation with someone about what's important yeah and so i also noticed in running a lot of bible studies in church that just like you mentioned before in terms of you're a little kid and you have a question and you get these you know one baby goes to heaven and one baby goes to limbo say well well what about that and you know don't ask questions like that in church we have orthodoxy to maintain oh okay well i certainly don't want to mess up your orthodoxy i didn't mean to do anything wrong but i noticed that even in wonderful well-meaning bible studies that people would not say what they really thought they'd certainly not tell their pastor because they'd lose lose status in the community well maybe they're no longer believing like the rest of us are supposed to but the more i would talk to people privately i realized that there's whole ranges of beliefs that people have and don't have that they won't fess up to not to mention the other stuff going on in their lives that they know they shouldn't be doing that it's really going on and on one hand in a community like that you sort of need those kinds of tensions and boundaries and expectations i get all that but without a space in which to process and explore or people just sort of hold their breath for as long as they can and then get out the door and now i can go do whatever i think i should do whether it means i don't believe in jesus or i i want to you know leave my wife or i i want to go say socrates is great and jesus is meh i mean you can't say that in church so i got the idea of having a space outside of church but it's often inside the building of church because that's the space i got where people can talk and they can say what they think and we can listen to each other and we have this little protocol that tries to help keep the small group dynamics good so nobody hogs the conversation and you don't wind up spending two hours talking about what nobody else in the group wants to listen to or any of that kind of stuff so we have a few little rules about that but basically the purpose of it is let's have a space where people can talk and tell their truth and form a community together somewhat and and i think actually it doesn't have to be in a church or connected to a church but in my opinion churches need this because right now by virtue of everything that's gone in the culture and also the internet and everything there's a lot of people who are just sort of wandering out of church and as a pastor the pastor is often the last to know and for as a pastor it's kind of like i wish i wish i wish i'd come and talk to me because i'm not necessarily hurt that you're leaving the church i'm more hurt that you didn't feel you had anyone that you could talk to about these things and and you know i wind up being the pastor for lots of people who will never go to church just happens that way in a neighborhood and that's you know i'm fine with that even if i love for them to come to church i will love them and listen to them and i will be their pastor and i'll be their friend even if they never come to church it's totally cool i get that but what estuary is supposed to do is to say here's a space nobody's going to try to evangelize you nobody's going to ask you for money nobody's going to lean on you and try and make you believe something that you don't believe but why don't you tell us what you really think and be willing to listen to what other people really think you know in some ways it's exactly what we've done just in this little conversation but with maybe a group of four six or eight people and then you do it with some regularity because you know after we know each other's stories a little bit now the next time we come to the conversation we don't start from zero you've got some friendship you've got some mutual understanding there's trust growing it's a reciprocal opening as john might call it exactly well that's awesome so you've been doing that for a long time no we've been so the group here said this is great we ought to share it with people and so we've been sort of trying to help other groups start there's a there's a friend of mine who was very much on the ground floor of this he sort of runs a training thing that has about 50 people and the training thing is just doing it you know it's not unlike yoga and that's it's just doing it together with some repetition but then their job is to you know start their own groups and and so we've we've got we've got that going so it's kind of like a movement like a pyramid it's spreading out yeah that's good so you do it physically not online we the goal is for people to do it physically sometimes especially during covid some groups moved online um we're we're going to continue we're still exploring the online physical thing the priority though should be the physical because when things happen in the physical space they're much richer more enduring they're more real and then people are living in the same community too yeah yes yes anonymity online you know people from everywhere and so you know my group has a lot of atheists um ironically enough and but yeah we can help each other when there's someone has a crisis they've got a pastor if they want one you know you know that's great what a great idea yeah that's estuary that's great so how many groups do you think are out there doing that already about right now there's about a dozen that are active right now and we've got about 50 so i'm going to europe um at the end of the summer because we've got a group in germany they're doing a little festival and so i i'm going to travel around the little bit of celebrity i have from my channel sort of leverage that and people can decide if they want to have something that's more of an ongoing basis so very good good work you're doing paul good good luck with it thanks really great meeting you oh it's great meeting you i so enjoyed your stories and getting to know you and uh likewise well we'll have to do this again maybe we'll rope john in maybe me you and john will have a conversation together that could be fun sure uh on on one of the episodes that i had with him after i saw those things where you were talking about me john and i talked a little bit about um your interpretation of my experiences i don't know if you saw that one um i'll have to look it up yeah i don't remember which one it was oh i'll send you the link for it i know okay okay as soon as we get off i'd like to see that yeah so he's interested he had some of his own he said he told me that he's been kind of like debating with you about the container issue that religion without a religion might not be so you know long-term lasting because it's lacking something and all that so he's definitely as you already know he's interested in this topic yeah yeah oh yeah that was fun the three of us and we're going to you know i'm finally going to get to meet him next september we have a big thing going up in thunder bay with peugeot so um that's that's going to be a good time and that's going to be a lot of the people who've been sort of talking on the internet for four years getting into one physical space and um hopefully having more conversations so that's great all right paul wow all right rick this was a this was a treat i yeah likewise totally wonderful thank you man all right we'll speak again yeah take care man bye bye
