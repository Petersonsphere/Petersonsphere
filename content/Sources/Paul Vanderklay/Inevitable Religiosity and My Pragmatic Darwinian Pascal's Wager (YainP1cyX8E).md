 Hi, this is Paul. Last week I did a video, Can Atheism Save?, and a number of people commented on my use of the word save there, and it was quite intentional because as critical as I am with often how Christians sort of throw out that word as a code word, usually for making the cut after life, in a lot of ways the word is important, and while this isn't a word that fudges, it is a word that fudges in some ways, people fudge a lot with the word, and part of what I wanted to continue getting at was the definition, the working definition that we have of the word religion, and how this interchanges with the word salvation. If you pay a lot of attention to the word salvation, as I do partly because again of how it's used in the Christian community, you'll hear people use it all the time, even in non-religious contexts, or contexts that we don't identify as religious readily or easily, it's a very important word, and like many words, and if you think enough about language and you pay attention to it, you'll notice that we're always using words that are quite ambiguous, they're poorly defined, we're not defining how we're using them, but we all sort of know what we mean by them. That slipperiness of language is very, I can't say interesting now because someone commented on how everything is interesting to me, and that's very true, and so I should pick better words than just interesting, but we should pay attention to this slipperiness of language, and how in fact we're able to live fairly well in the world, even with all this slipperiness. Now in the last video, again, I had some of the Coleman Hughes, John McWhorter conversation, and I really liked that piece where Coleman is wrestling with the question, can we recapture Dr. King's magic without his religion and the church? That's really what he's asking, and McWhorter, you know, because they're dealing with say woke religion, and where Coleman Hughes and McWhorter, when John McWhorter says that sort of the new ascendant chapter of race relations is religion, he obviously means it negatively, and I deeply appreciate how John McWhorter characterizes that, and I agree with him, and I know completely what he says when he says, you know, this is religion, this is Jesus, and he means it in a very atheistic negative sense, and in his mind it's not empirical, and whereas I agree with his use of the word religious there, I think there are other ways that the word is appropriate that we're not paying enough attention to, and so Coleman, in a way, asks this question that, again, if you, once you see this and pay attention, you'll find that all over our culture, and for a very long time, people are, in a sense, recognizing the power of religion and say we need a new one, but this new one has to, and then they have all of these expectations and frames that this new one has to fix what we need to have fixed, it needs to be a religion because we very easily see how religious people are naturally, and any movement that's actually going to gain traction and supremacy and power and will shape and influence the world, any movement like that must have a religious aspect to it. We've been following Brett Weinstein, and his main thing is we have to stop this genocidal spelling bee, and again, I'm not going to play it in this clip, in this video, but I played it often, and I think what he lays out in that unbelievable conversation with Alistair McGrath, he does it very well, that human beings have sort of a two-track system. We can no longer afford business as usual, we're too powerful, and we'll end life as we know it, but human beings both have a genetic track, but then also the culture track, and this culture track moves at a very different speed than the genetic track, and in fact, over the last not that long 10,000 years plus, many of the amazing accomplishments and achievements of humanity have been a direct relation of how we've transmitted information in that culture track. We were discussing this at our meetup last Sunday night, and one of the things that it's sometimes hard to get a word in edgewise at our meetup, because it's a pretty aggressive group, and the conversations go fast, and it's really a tremendous amount of fun, but one of the things that we noted was human beings, we have these flat stomachs because we don't have all the intestines that let's say chimpanzees have, because we cook food, and in many ways we have culturally outsourced parts of our biology, and the cooking of food is an example of that. We cook food, therefore unlike chimpanzees, we don't need to sit and chew forever on leaves, and sit and have eating take up how much of our time. We have agriculture, we have cooking, we have all of these things, and this has continued to shape and change us, and the speed of change in the culture information level is in many ways what completely separates us from the animal kingdom. Now what Brett wants to do to stop the genocidal spelling bee is we need to rationally determine sustainability and do it or perish. Now if you watch the video, the one the monologue preceding this where I played some of John Gray's lecture, he really brought to the fore Auguste Comte, and there's a couple of really good videos on YouTube, I'm not going to play them, they're very large videos by significant channels, School of Life has one on sociology, Auguste Comte, and also Tom Ritchie on Auguste Comte's positivism, and just as John Gray sort of laid this out in the last video I did, I've got my conversation with Eric Dirksen and my rough draft between that one and this one, but I'll put them both in the secular humanist playlist, so hopefully it'll make it easier for you to find if you didn't watch the previous one to look at those John Gray lectures. You know Auguste Comte saw this clearly and he saw on one hand he's the father of positivism, which you hear trotted out by how many new atheists and where well humanity has three stages, first there was the theological which was fictitious, and then there was the metaphysical which is sort of abstract and philosophical, and today we have science, and science must be the measure of all true knowledge, and so when you hear Matt Dillahunty or Sam Harris or how many others who like to be out there arguing for science and that science is the way we know things, they are children of Auguste Comte, and when you listen to them and their humanism, as John Gray spelled out very very very well, they're also children of him, and in fact Comte was way ahead of these guys and he established these temples for humanity where they were going to have daily services and they were going to replace the Christian calendar with calendars of humanists, and you know just look at Bart Campola and how much of the humanists out there, these people don't hold a candle to this movement, and Comte at the end of the 19th century this was a massive movement and it all went away, which is amazing, the whole thing just sort of collapsed. Now you would imagine if rationality is so much greater and so much better and if we can marshal all of this stuff with our intentionality then surely we can do better, and so when I listen to these celebrity atheists and now when you look at what Comte did you begin to say their program is a failure, it's been tried and failed, and what's alarming is let's say compare it to Mormonism. Mormonism arises at a little bit before but not that much before, and look at the relative success of Mormonism, of the LDS church. Now I have got a lot of love and respect for Mormons that are my friends and all of that, but I don't have a lot of respect for their ancestral narrative with the seeing stones and the golden plates and the angel Moroni and all these things, and in fact unlike the way a lot of atheists want to look at the stories of the Bible, well this stuff isn't that old and you can sort of track this down and you can try to look for elements of the lost tribes of Israel and North America, I mean just the whole thing, you just look at it and you say, you know I can't believe that, but look at the Mormon religion, they're booming all over the world and this rationalism of Comte, it went nowhere and died a fairly short death and you know some went to Brazil and some went to other places, but if you compare it to the Mormon church it's not even close. That is data, what does that say? Now you know Sam Harris has his definition of religion as supernatural stories or faith is belief without evidence, you know it's just a load of crap and you know because again look at Comte and say okay well maybe you're right about your definition, but guess what? Which one's going to win humanity? You better put your money on the Mormons because you know Comte didn't work and you know he laid this all out for you, he did it more than you know Sam Harris did, well maybe Sam Harris is going to do it with his app, I don't know, but again get back to to Brett Weinstein's two-track information, you have the gene track and the culture track and Darwinian fitness is that gene track and its fittedness for survival and again watch John Verveckis' Relevance Realization in Darwin, I thought that was one of the best lectures and that you know the way John sort of laid that out just really you know turned lights on for me and it's like oh wow this is you know this is this is really interesting powerful stuff, but now what draws or pulls the culture track and the reason I say pulls you know in some ways the culture track is pulled from the future and that really sounds weird, but it's our imagination of the future that sort of pulls us into this and you can hear that when you listen to the new atheists and those who are debating and arguing in that track and you know is it glory, is it religion, in many ways they're seeking the celestial city and it's the celestial city of reason and again Comte understood human beings and you know had a new calendar and had rituals and traditions and understand that people needed solace and so rationally tried to account for all the human needs of people and lay it all out there and institutionalize it and all of that and again dramatic failure whereas Mormon religion whoosh which seems to say that in fact the supernatural aspect and again I don't like using that word, but for the sake of communication I will, the supernatural aspect is not a bug but a feature. That's we simply must be pulled into a world that somehow we deeply know we ourselves cannot completely achieve on our own. Now I think religion and then we're going to you know we're sort of chasing the definition of that word. Religion is what pulls us into that future and now sort of like again if you go through John's series the relevance realization is there an essence to relevance and well you can't really have an essence to relevance because it's contextual. It has the whole picture integrated into it yet it's and I know all that the non-dualists will be jumping in at this part but it's not just non-dual it's both dual and non-dual because it's the relationship between the two okay and so it's hard to find the essence of religion but it's a word that we use we know it well enough to use the word even if it's slippery and fudgy for us and it's somehow analogous to how relevance realization functions via Darwin I think you know it pulls because there is a hazy good future we Now again Sam Harris tries to get this as well-being but is as Peterson often says of him he's not taking it seriously. Well-being does not really satisfy it points in the right direction but as I'll get in later in the video it's part of all of our other little internal gyroscopic approximations that try to reach out and navigate by the stars but in secularism our skepticism makes us not be able to see the stars. It pulls because there's a hazy good future we seek but it also pushes because there's a bad future we flee and again I think Jordan Peterson has a sense of this in his future authoring program where the person sits down and you're supposed to in a sense envision the good future that you want but then you also excuse me envision the bad that you flee and it's really that that same thing. Now those of you who followed Verbeckis awakening from the meeting crisis know that he brings in Paul Tillich and he's a he's a fan of Tillich and so I listened to Verbeckis treatment of Tillich and I hadn't really read any Tillich before then and so I've been you know he's on the list of all the people that I'm taking a look at but he's germane to this because he Tillich wrestles with this question of religion and the difficulty again if we sort of look at Tom Holland's dominion Tom Holland in a video that is really terrible sound Tom Holland wrestles with the idea that you know in these books I'm actually reading his book Persian Fire right now which is just too much fun it's really hard to put down I mean Tom Holland takes some of these great stories of history like the the Greco-Persian war and just turns it into a Tom Clancy page-turner it's just it's just too much fun I start reading it's like you know it's like Eric Dirksen said you know you feel like a kid with Harry Potter you just don't want to put the book down you just keep cheating and the wife's like are you are you at that thing again honey it's really good I can't leave it alone but but Tom Holland makes the point that you know in a sense part of what Jesus does is and part of what happens in in the middle ages is that now we have this split world of the the seculum and the eternal and you have the secular and the sacred world and and so we're we're wrestling with these things now and in a sense until Christianity especially in the colonial period comes along people don't know that they have a religion they're they're just doing you know and and then of course the British come along and they're trying to figure this out and now suddenly there's a religion and so this you know after a few hundred years we're still wrestling with the concept and and trying to figure out what we mean by this and I think this is part of the reason why you'll see Coleman Hughes or Brett Weinstein or or or John Verveke with his religion that's not a religion with separation of church and state this experiment in the in the American constitution you know we're all wrestling with this and and trying to figure out what are we what are we what are we trying to do here so so Tillich weighs in with with a definition of religion and and that of that which is of ultimate concern the first is that so the first is is his understanding of religion and this really is fundamental it's basic to understanding telling he he distinguishes offensively between two uh forms of religion or two definitions of religion on the one hand we have a kind of narrow official notion of religion which identifies religion with specific traditions specific confessions and specific and and again if you know if you could see this in my conversation with Eric Dirksen my pastor friend my church planter friend from Davis where you know after in kind of our post-modern even even in church planting on the ground people are wrestling with propositional truth is it only propositional truth and then practice comes in and so Dirksen you know Eric and his this group of young church planters that we you know that that we set loose on the Sacramento area myself and Kevin Adams I want to have Kevin Adams on the channel too um you know they're they're all dealing with practice oh we have to get down with practice and that comes up in the woke religion and that was very much there and in liberation theology we're talking about praxis and you know but in in a low resolution way if you're not paying any attention to all the philosophy you don't understand well why are we dealing with practice and and what is religion and and so these are these are very very difficult things to to wrestle with specific ideas that go along with those the second notion of religion is a much broader understanding and here we start to get some of Tillich's own kind of key notions yeah he talks about religion as directedness towards the ultimate yeah towards the unconditioned uh the idea now if you watch the vervecki stuff he gives a pretty good understanding of Tillich is dealing with some of the stuff in this book that I'm reading transubstantiation I'm gonna have a conversation with the author of that you know the the the the nominalism realism debate of the of the middle ages you know uh I mean I know the philosophy here gets deep but dear that religion is about our response to that which transcends art the everyday um he talks about the idea of uh um ultimate concern yeah so that religion isn't for Tillich to be identified with a particular part of the human life or in his words at that point in early 20th century talks about the human spirit and he identifies that can't as identify as equating religion with morality shlaya macha identifying religion with feeling um and he says these these are restrictive you know or even you know his contemporary barbs you know identifying religion with the word of god with with some kind of uh specified narrowly specified form of revelation yeah for Tillich religion is about this directedness towards the ultimate and this this is manifest this occurs in all forms of life in all aspects of human existence so that's the first the second and then he goes on and you gotta jump to the channel to get to get the rest of it but that idea of ultimate concern where it it's it's directing everything and and I think this is this is really helpful and if we're going to take this idea of this of this directed towards the ultimate concern this is all of human beings we do this and and it touches all of the various aspects of our life then it's kind of fun to revisit Jordan Peterson at Lafayette College in the question and answer about religion both this guy's question and the next guy's question and just just just keep that in mind as we try to put these two pieces together Thank you for being here I really appreciate it um so I was watching a few of your interviews in preparation for this and I heard you speak about religion quite a bit and if you look up what religion means in the Webster dictionary you get something like a system of faith centered on a supernatural being or beings or something like that but I've heard you use religion to describe things like punk rockers for example that that's a religious like punk rockers for example that that's a religious experience so my first question would be now what's really helpful here is is Peterson's not doing philosophy Peterson is much more like a preacher he is talking to the masses he is trying to make this accessible to regular people and you know it's a tremendous gift that that Peterson has how do you define what is considered religious and then sort of as a follow-up to that um if say Sam Harris is what you act out what's that religious is what you act out anything you act out everything you act out is is predicated on your implicit axioms now your implicit axioms well how do those relate to ultimate concerns the system of implicit axioms that you hold as primary is your religious belief system it doesn't matter whether you're an atheist or not that's just surface that's just surface noise so it has nothing to do with divinity or no I didn't say that or it doesn't necessarily have to do with those no it probably necessarily has to do with it too but it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with your voluntarily articulated statements about whether or not you believe in something like a transcendent deity so I mean what you act out is much more what you are than what you say about yourself and what the hell do you know about what you believe anyways you're complicated man fair question well seriously people are complicated you know like we're we don't we're not transparent to ourselves at all that's why we have that's why we have to go to university and study psychology it's like you know we're we're we're not exactly black boxes but we are the most complicated things there are right and we can't even program our vcr clocks so it's like how the hell can we propose to understand ourselves and you know I'm existentially oriented which is to say that I think that what you hold to be true is best determined as an as a consequence of an analysis of your actions rather than as a consequence of an analysis of what you purport to believe now in order to act you can't act without a hierarchy of value which I tortured the other poor question you're about you can't act without a hierarchy of values because you can't act unless you think one thing is better than another because why why would you act otherwise so that means that you're embedded within a hierarchy of values whether you know it or not or maybe multiple fragmentary and competing hierarchies of value which is all the worse for you by the way because it just makes you very confused that hierarchy of values has an axiomatic it's it's based on axioms and the probability that you understand them is very low now we struggle to articulate those axioms in propositional and that's part of the reason why propositions can never fully seem to exhaust these foundations yet we at the same time can't really live without them for for reasons he's about to go into now because generally people don't understand their axioms but that axiomatic system is essentially your religious system and there's there's no way out of that as far as i can tell and you can say well it isn't predicated on conscious belief in a transcendent deity it's like okay have it your way but you know most people in this room act out a judaic christian ethic and not only do they act it out if they're treated in a manner that's not commensurate with that ethic they get very very very annoyed so for example now now i want to get into the morality what is morality quite a bit more but what he just said there is really important because i think in some ways morality is this what it's between us and it's this way that we continue to are continue able to react productively there are all these implicit rules that go on and and we're always stretching these rules to sort of test them and test each other and and often try to get our way but also recognizing that we have to live within these rules in order to actually continue to be in community and work productively and those those those rules are also going to have relationships to axioms and to propositions because that's that's also part of how we negotiate with each other and figure out how we can work productively and so much of this stuff is actually simply built in that we're always looking for signals with each other whether or not we're you know we're going to abide by these things which is why if you look on twitter for example and they have all these little videos from from homeless people and part of the point of those videos is that these people who are on the street for reasons of mental illness or something or another excuse me these people who are on the street are not safe because for one reason or another they are not abiding by the same set of implicit rules that can be that are based on axioms they can be expressed as propositions one way or another loosely they're they're hemmed in often as laws but right away even just with a look of an eye how someone is dressed how someone behaves and and what should be a common interchange whether or not they're following the rules we're we're very focused on these things Peterson talks about this quite a bit in his maps of meaning we're very focused on this and and quite intuitively able to just grab it and know and if we find someone is breaking the rules bang we react and our biological systems just react and and this is the way that these you know this genetic tract this this matter verse this biological self is deeply connected with the story verse and the culture self if i fail to treat you as if you're an embodiment of a divine fragment let's say that's characterized by the ability to the ability to make free choice and to determine your own destiny in some sense or if i fail to treat you as if you're a valued member valued contributing member of the polity as a sovereign individual then you'll find that very offensive and become angry it's like okay then that's what you believe well if i ask you if you believe any of that well that's a whole different story you might give me some radical leftist nonsense but that doesn't i try not to from what you've that doesn't take away from the fundamentals of your action as one final thing so when you and say sam harris argue about religion you're arguing about fundamentally different things it sounds like his conception of what is religious is very different from yours yeah well he tends to think of religious religious thought the same way that a smart 13 year old atheist thinks about a fundamentalist christian it's like yeah okay that just you're just not getting to the heart even even yeah okay notice how subtle that is and and there it's dismissive i mean this is this is how we communicate with each other we're we're we watch each other carefully we look for these signals where we're paying attention to status i mean we do this all the time and we don't even know that we're doing it part of them it's like yeah okay that just you just not getting to the heart of the matter you know and i just finished reading all of sam's books in the last couple of weeks and as far as i'm concerned he doesn't ever get to the bottom of the issue he doesn't address the fundamental thinkers there are some profound thinkers dostoevsky's one tolstoy nicha young it's like they're completely absent from and the same with dawkins it's completely absent all that conceptualization is completely absent from their corpus of works they don't even have an understanding for the psychological utility of religion and it's a big problem which of course com did which is why he set up what he set up they have appreciation for the site i mean even if you say it's all just story the story doesn't matter you know why again does mormonism far outclass this you know temples to humanity that that comp tried to set up problem you know you you don't get to be an atheist when the people you attack are fundamental like like naive fundamentalists and i have some some sympathy for the naive fundamentalists it's like what they're basically saying is something like this look we have an ethos that's valuable you scientist types are casually dismantling it what the hell are we supposed to do well the fundamentalists don't know what to do about that so they say well creationism is science it's like well no it's not but that doesn't mean that they don't have a point their point is there's something valuable here it's like don't break it casually what are you going to replace it with the new atheists wish wish that everybody becomes rational it's like yeah sure that's going to happen thank you thank you dr peterson i'm a i'm a student of religious studies and and currently i'm writing an honors thesis on religious imagery in an indo-perish literary genre there's a poet philosopher who said the following which i think you like who by the way was a huge fan of goitre and he said that in addressing god he says he calls him the hidden reality and he asks the hidden reality to reveal itself but using the rope of metaphor because he thinks that metaphor is the only way i think stories are the only way that human beings can comprehend you know the hidden reality i know you've written a lot about you you speak a lot about uh about religious stories i just wanted to ask you although it may be a very broad question what is the place of the religious in stories and uh religious is something like the grammatical structure of stories like if you go down and you look at what makes a story a story that's religious yeah it's not a story otherwise like a story is a particular sort of thing like in its simplest sense the story is an account of how to get from point a to point b it's like a map but there's a value structure inherent in that obviously because otherwise you wouldn't go from point a to point b so just to make the map means to adopt a value structure but but the story is actually more complicated than that because as you move from point a to point b processes of radical transformation are often necessary and the the deep stories about the processes of radical transformation that occur as you move from point a to b are basically they're they're indistinguishable from religious stories now the reason they i think the reason they they tend to become religious let's say is because it has something to do with the gap between the finite and comprehensible and the infinite and uncomprehensible it's like we live in the finite and comprehensible but we're surrounded by the infinite and incomprehensible and there has to now now we live in that's that's in terms of our consciousness that's in terms of i've used this illustration before my you know i had a i had a friend who had low vision and he thought he was seeing the room but he understood that his he only could see through this and so if i was he also was hard of hearing and so if i would just walk up next to him in the process of the day you know it would be like barbara eden i jean i dream of genie bang i'd be right there in the middle of his world before he jumped back and um you know i you can have that if someone walks quietly into a room and there they are we get startled and we understand that there's there's way more in the room than i can ever appreciate than i could ever know because my mind is finite so so how do we navigate the that which i can actually apprehend in my consciousness and the unbelievable amounts of other data and information out there that i can't pick up or don't pick up or have to limit out or have to represent in other ways in order to grapple with this how do i how can i manage the interchange of those two things to be a border between those of what we're surrounded infinite and incomprehensible it's like we live in the finite and comprehensible but we're surrounded by the infinite and incomprehensible and there has to be a border between those of some like a mediating border that's poetry and art that's narrative that's religion and it's that it's that strange metaphorical reality let's say but but notice the definition of religion that he uses there it's hard to nail down that that's the that's the that's the piece that we call religion that we identify as religion from the from the place of our secular perspective that's what we call religion but well religion is all that which is of ultimate concern so religion is also deeper and broader and integrating everything that we act out because again in order to act you implicitly adopt a hierarchy of values and as he says maybe you have a whole bunch of fragmentary ones you haven't really integrated them but but you you act that out and this is part of the reason why so often you you seem double-minded as the bible says because well there's this hierarchy of values and there's this hierarchy of values and so when i'm with with christian people i act out their hierarchy of values and when i'm at work in a secular realm i act out this hierarchy of values and then we say well that person lacks integrity they haven't brought their hierarchy of values together well you you recognize that there are conflicts between these two systems and so you're you're trying to work these things out and that then gets expressed in your action and you know this this is all that he's taught all what he's talking about here it's not factual and it's not comprehensible but that's not infinitely incomprehensible either see it's not factual in the in this in this sliver of scientistic acting that we must do and you know fact is this tiny little i've i've i've talked about it before sort of like an amazon box a factual okay but but we seem very we seem very comfortable with that because actually we're comfortable with that because of the narrative that we've embedded it within in modernity and now that of course is passing away so but what he's getting at it it's not sort of the the common the at handness that is manipulable by us but there's there's the way more out there and so something has to do it and so that then gets encoded in story and you know peterson's of course getting getting a lot of this from young and you know this is this is sort of what i've picked up in terms of again back to young story of of working in the mental hospital when the you know the other doctors say well don't talk to those crazy people they're crazy and young's like what are we going to do here what are we here for supposed to help them and he starts listening to them and he begins to realize that the the stories that they say are connected with you know bible stories religious stories mythologies those things out there and you begin to wonder well why that strange correlation shouldn't if they're just crazy and the wiring is bad shouldn't everything just sort of be random but but you know if your computer if your cpu or your motherboard has a problem in your computer your computer doesn't work at all well we're a lot more fail safe than that but then he begins to notice correlation and and so i wonder i i wonder and this is in very many ways what pastoral care is all about i wonder if we can i wonder if we can achieve greater health whatever that means if we can achieve greater health by trying to work on the relationship between the story out there and the story in here and and and by working on those two things maybe i can well maybe i can actually in a sense be better in touch with the world out there that world out there isn't just the stuff of the matter verse because it's so thick with other human beings and so thick relationally and so thick in terms of what's going on that that i've got to be in sync with this with the cultural story and i've got to be in sync with the the great cultural stories that go back thousands of years because those are within the individual culture stories and this whole thing is just going on constantly and we we actually manage it but we manage it in the story verse you can't manage it any other way which is why you know for all of the imagined positivism by the by the the the receding positivism by the celebrity atheists you know it's just it doesn't work and it can't work and it never will work which is why you know mormonism kicks the butt of the of the temple of humanity it's a bridge between the two so and as you move closer to the infinite and incomprehensible across that bridge you get farther and farther away from what you understand right but how could it be otherwise given that you're finite you are a finite being surrounded by infinite what's infinite in incomprehensible and that was his critique of the strict rationalist that they can't that it's hard for them to to make this to to that's where poets come in and that's exactly exactly well this is i learned a lot of this from yung because yung's idea was that rationality is embedded in a dream like there's the infinite unknowable and then there's the dream and then inside the dream is the rational domain and i believe that to be the case why else would we dream we have to dream if we don't dream we we go insane it doesn't take very long and so there's there's an element of poetic conceptualization that grounds us and it has to be taken seriously you know the the rational critics of dreams think about them as random neural activity it's like there's nothing right when you look at a tv screen that's not on a channel that's random when you dream something when you dream something complex and sophisticated that's not random so yeah so the metaphor surrounds us let's say and we can critique it rationally and we can undermine it but there's real danger in that so uh sometimes pull up a slide it's like what was i think when i made this slide you know so we have we've got the the great willy wonka meme that someone made in the discord um you so you've a okay now i remember what i was going to talk about we we live in a context where you gain status by being secular this is in certain places of certain parts of the world of the world uh very true of a secular university not true of your church not true of your christian day school or your christian college maybe not true of going to dinner at your mother's erin rogers has been in the newspaper because danica patrick her his new girlfriend on the podcast where he started criticizing the religion that he was raised in and surprise surprise parents aren't happy and so all makes for uncomfortable dinners you know over the thanksgiving table and and so here you have these contexts these realms which are you know you know it's transmitted relationally and and it seeps into the walls and it's and it's it's embedded and encoded in the decor of the house i mean we're we're that subtle and we're that pervasive that there's a there's a sociology of the secular and the sociology of the sacred and and what we so often do is we confuse the abstract with the ultimate that we think oh that the that's the that's abstract so it's ultimate no no that's that's not really necessarily how it is we naturally split between the matter verse and the story verse remember we're two track beings and so and these things are are deeply intertwined yet we we sort of distinguish between them for the sake of well that's perhaps what the scientific revolution and modernity has afforded us and this is perhaps this loss of participation that that owen barfield was talking about and we're looking at you know you have ancient participation original participation this loss of participation and then final participation when the two will be wholly put back together you know we so we have weinstein's two threads but but they're both essential to humanity one can't live without the other and brett makes that point passionately and he's exactly right they must come together at all layers and and in many ways that's always what religion is trying to do and so again reading that book on transubstantiation this this is why the the sacrament the the body of christ becomes such a pivot point in the middle of the protestant reformation there it all is it's how do heaven and earth connect and in some ways luther's reformation was a psychologizing and i would i would assert unnecessary psychologizing of this in order to address the corruption and you know it stands to reason but these things can't stay separate forever they have to come together and so the protestant reformers try in many ways to put them back together and and the corruption in a sense what had been earlier sort of expressed by the religio as as tom holland notes and now you have the religious monks you have the two-speed religion where you have ordinary people in the secular and then the the sacred people who are in the monastery and they're doing things together and then of course john calvin comes around and wants to make the entire city of geneva holy but he's always bumping up against you know all of these issues and you know and wanting to do it you know i wanted to do it in a way that didn't express the totalitarian impulses that in fact drove martin luther into the reformation that that he would that he would express so so they must come together and they seek to come together and this is why all of this stuff is inevitable now c.s lewis and in parsing this stuff out you know very much wrestled with this and actually you don't find this so much in c.s lewis's writing but in another book of his not not of his by by sheldon van oaken which is a really an amazing book called a severe mercy this is this is a letter from lewis to to sheldon van oaken and they they they were friends and and there were a number of letters from lewis that that sheldon put in his book i don't agree with your picture of the history of religion christ buddha muhammad and others elaborate elaborating and original simplicity i believe buddhism to be a simplification of hinduism and islam to be a simplification of christianity clear lucid transparent simple religion dao plus shadowy ethical god in the background is a late development usually arising among highly educated people in great cities what you really start what you really start with is ritual myth and mystery now now again the the people working the temples of of persia or greece or egypt you know this is they do so in a sense innocently of sort of the two of the split that comes in in the the loss of participation in barfield's middle position it's it's all it's all initial participatory and so when when the runner who ran from the battle of marathon to try and get the get the spartans up there for the battle when he's on his way back discouraged that the spartans are they're not going to break off their festival for a battle that would be suicide and we secularists think oh no you should you'd better you know don't worry about your your little ceremony no the ceremony is is the foundation for life for the spartans and and so on the way back he you know he bumps into the god pan and you know pan gives him a good word and the athenians win the battle of marathon um you know panic is from pan i mean all this stuff is built in so you had your original participation and they're they're in a sense innocent of the split that will come and and in fact this split doesn't just come in the protestant reformation you can you can read the tensions in the old testament amongst the prophets it's obedience not sacrifice that i want you can you can you can read the tensions when you read jesus where he says it's not what goes into a man's mouth that makes him holy but what comes out of a mouth and and it's it's in bright lights then in in luther's reformation but you know they're always dealing with these tensions and so so here lewis is dealing with them you know what you really start with is ritual mystery and and myth and of course lewis good friend of owen barfield in the great war had worked through these kinds of things the death and return of balder or osiris the dances the initiation the sacrifices the divine kings american native american you know when you put on the mask and you put on the costume you know see even the language that we use we we can't get away from you know we become the god what does that mean um over and against though those are the philosophers are aristotle or confucius hardly religious at all what sense does lewis is lewis using of the word religious there he's using that sort of common sense oh a church is religious in the way that the courthouse is not supposed to be religious oh better take down that ten commandments they'd better take down that ten commandments that you can see we're always dealing with these with these tensions and sort of what happens in american politics is that you know we set it up in a way to to in a sense heighten the tension but but recognize the tension when we're dealing with it back to lewis the two systems in which the mysteries and philosophies come together are hinduism and christianity there you get both the metaphysics and the cult continuous with the primeval cults that is why my first step was to be sure he's talking about his own conversion that is why my first step was to be sure that one or the other of these had the answer for the reality and and i would i would argue that it could be hinduism is is this does hinduism actually exist i mean it's a it's the religion of the of the of the people of india well how many religions is it really i mean is it the is it the meta divine realm or is it a theism i'm not going to be able to answer that for you this is why my first step was to be sure that one or the other of these had the answer for reality can't be one that appeals either only to savages in a sense original participation or only to the high brows divorce of participation real things aren't like that for example matter is the most obvious thing you meet milk chocolates apples and also the object of quantum physics in other words in a sense when you hold an apple there's potentially no divorce okay but what does the apple mean oh what is the the bread and the wine mean what does the elevated consecrated host mean i mean this is this is where we're struggling in the middle here there's no question of of of just a crowd of disconnected religions the choices between a the materialist worldview which i can't believe says lewis b the real archaic primitive religions which are not moral enough now lewis has his own moral you know he's dealing with his same contemporary morality but again partly what happens when you get deep within i can't i can't avoid using the word deep within a religious tradition is that the morality of that religious tradition starts to inform the the present moral matrix that you're swimming within and that's going to cause tensions within the larger group and you can you can see those tensions all the time played out in the conservative and and progressive magazines in american culture this is this is the in a sense part of the central tension surrounding donald trump the claimed fulfillment of them in hinduism now pay attention lewis is looking for fulfillment of these issues the claim fulfillment of these in hinduism and the claimed fulfillment of these in christianity but the weakness of hinduism is that it doesn't really join the two strands and he says strands and he says god made man bread his presence right there in the bread and the wine the strands are joined but the weakness of hinduism and that it doesn't really join the two strands unredeemably savage religion goes on in the village the hermit philosophizes in the forest and neither really interferes with the other and in this sense lewis i think is a protestant leaning towards the resolution of protestants and catholics and we'll throw the orthodox in there too he's leaning in towards the consummation of all things and the oneness of the church and the resolution of all of these tensions it is only christianity which compels the high brow like me to participate in a ritual blood feast and also compels a central african convert to attempt an enlightened universal code of ethics so for lewis all of these various things come together in christianity which is why he goes there so let's deal with this word saved religion is the question of how to save the world well what do we mean by saving saving from what that can to sam harris's well-being really get us there we try to imagine um we try to imagine a perfect world now if you sit down and you think about that long enough you begin to realize this is not easy and in fact well you know brett weinstein well we want to have a a sustainable world well that's sort of a materialist knockoff of eternity in some ways and and and colman hughes you know reconciliation of of of racial strife well that's a that's a that's an attempt to see the you know peace on earth um but if you really start to try to imagine it it's a lot harder than many of us imagine it would be and this is part of the reason why peter kreefe makes this point often when it comes to his treatment of aslan in the narnia chronicles that it's it's far easier and often very interesting for us to see representations in literature and film of evil than the good in fact the good is so difficult to represent we often don't believe it and we critique it and we abandon it whereas we find representations of evil more engaging and that that question of engagement is a tell that we are learning from it whereas it's extremely difficult to represent the ultimate but but we're always trying to get there it's an ultimate concern we're being pulled by it into the future and and most of our impulses are our negations are simplistic comparisons you know sort of like ab testing here within the iron box of secularism you know food is better than hunger joy instead of nihilism security instead of fear health instead of illness life instead of death freedom instead of loss of agency and so so we can see those comparisons but but as as we work them and as they get pushed into the future and and pushed into bigger and broader spaces we and as the complexity of the world bears on in them it's it's enormously difficult to sort of represent them and imagine them and this if you go back to my sermon last week i think i posted it on the church channel this is why you know people like jesus become so endlessly interesting because he he seems to bring strength and kindness into a person into one and so you take these things as as jonathan edwards talked about these these these diverse excellencies i should i should pull up that slide this this is what tim keller got from jonathan edwards and you can find it in his book making sense of god and i read it in last week's rough draft and it was in my sermon particularly impressive to the readers over the centuries has been one writer what one writer has called an admirable conjunction of diverse excellencies in jesus christ that is in him we see qualities and virtues that would ordinarily consider incompatible in the same person we would never think they could be combined but because they are they are strikingly beautiful jesus combines high majesty with the greatest humility he joins the strongest commitment to justice with astonishing mercy and grace and he reveals a transcendent self sufficiency and yet entire entire trust in and reliance upon his heavenly father we are surprised to see tenderness without any weakness boldness without harshness humility without any uncertainty we couldn't do this without words but but we have a sense when we read this that words aren't fully capturing it indeed accompanied by a towering confidence readers can discover for themselves his unbending convictions but complete approachability his insistence on truth but always bathed in love his power without insensitivity integrity without rigidity passion without prejudice and this is part of a sermon where i talk about the lamb of god you take you take these two ideas god this power domination winning and lamb is is prey and you put them together behold the lamb of god that takes the way the sin of the world how can a lamb of god do this and then you read in the in the the testimony of the patriarchs this this strange this strange image where you have all the beasts of the earth attacking a lamb and the lamb triumphs and so we can and this is this is where again the stories and the imageries and this is why the book of revelation artists try to capture it and and put it into things but you know put it into literalistic pictures but you can't a tree that grows on both sides of a mighty river well how can that happen and and this is where of course you get into jonathan peugeot's icon it you know iconography iconography iconography where where you're trying to represent things and that's why jonathan peugeot for us literalists you know becomes sort of an interpreter and says well this means this and this means this and this means this but but but the explanation cannot exhaust the image and and and even the the image that we can express in stone does does not exhaust what the image is pointing to and this is again with with trans transfiguration where you get into jonathan peugeot or john vervecky and and and christopher mastro pietro you you get into that question of sign well it's again when i get into the transfiguration the uh the trans substantiation book you know the question of nominal nominalism and realism does that sign how does that sign participate in the reality okay so so we're dealing with all of those things now american dreams of well-being are so shallow in my conversation with bern power again bern powers i can't believe he only has 323 subscribers on his site he's such a he's such a a source of wisdom and and such a resource in terms of understanding the the art and imagery that he's lived through in his lifetime you know fun has become the summa bonum of american culture which betrays our shallowness hallmark movies shoot for romance and nostalgia and and that's the best we can do diversion is the you know diversion is the main vehicle you know if we can't capture it or at least have a representation that enthralls us sufficiently let's just let's just feast on junk food thrills and action sex and drug escapism streaming tv self abdicate um abdication living in a stream of others curated stories better than our own i was struck when i read charles taylor's a secular age how he tries to grapple with this and that was very interesting looking at a philosopher okay what words will you use in an analytical format to try to get at something as vivid vivid and bright as what you find and say the book of revelation or the lamb of god charles taylor here in the last chapter i described um various narratives of secularity i told these stories partly to show that there is no apodictic proof here but also how but also to show what is attractive to its proponents about various forms of unbelief as i indicated in the previous section i believe there is no escaping some version of what i call in an earlier discussion fullness that's the word that he's using and he's using it because how do how do we you know i would probably use glory fullness he wants it to be more experiential lewis maybe would use joy or sense such fullness for any livable understanding of human life there must be some way in which this life looks good whole proper really being lived as it should that would be you know sam harris is trying to use well-being for that the other absence of such would leave us an abject unbearable despair so it's not that unbelief shuns christian ideas of fullness for nothing at all it has its own version it must we can't live without it we can't help but be religious in the the the sense of ultimate concern pulling us into the future the swirling debate between belief and unbelief as well as between different versions of each can therefore be seen as a debate about what real fullness consists in the debate has two facets take a debate between two kinds of unbelief on one hand a standard utilitarian position you know it's interesting that comp was influenced and john stewart mill and the relationship between them is fascinating take a debate between two kinds of unbelief one on hand a standard utilitarian position being beings have certain needs and desires for instant prosperity a family where people grow up healthy and adjusted good times with friends and family and against this we have one of heroic propositions and this is exactly where we see peterson coming into because what does he what does he sort of bring up that that sort of that sort of jump starts a generation of young men it's the heroic because they're living in in in affluence and they can be 30 years 30 years old you know still living off the generosity of parents who are scratching their head wondering when will he grow up and as i mentioned in the other thing he in a sense infused these these young men with ego or agency it was like a hit them with a cattle prod and said wake up be a hero be an agent of course you know peterson wasn't the only one or the first one to do that but so you have sort of the let's meet all the needs and then we'll be happy really then why are people in in in fat communities that have have terrific security offing offing themselves but you know it's the meaning crisis let me read that sentence again take a debate between two kinds of unbelief on one hand a standard utilitarian position beings have certain needs and desires for instance prosperity a family where people grow up healthy and adjusted good times with friends and family and against this we have one of heroic positions which in our culture often owe a great deal to frederick nicha for example an ordinary happiness is a pitiable comfort there is something much higher in life or it might be the heroic humanism of dr i don't know who this is uh rick and camus la peste i mean taylor is a canadian and so he's fluent in french and i am not who acts for the good of his fellow creatures in spite of the absurd even in the even of the last instance the ultimate futility of such actions so on one level it seems that the heroic critique too say of of a humian is that the satisfaction she seeks for self and others are real but there is something higher in life which she is missing out on but the critique in the other direction seems to take up a different issue it calls into question the supposed satisfaction itself the sense of a high that the heroic figure finds in his action is seen as suspect and going on you can continue reading taylor from there the bible itself when it tries to talk about the ideal the eschaton the ultimate uses images and and this is where again where jonathan peugeot comes in i think you know part of it's so interesting talking to people about jonathan because on one hand you get the sense of wow i really like what he's doing but i don't understand him at all well and this is exactly what you know some do and some don't obviously but this is exactly sort of what john is doing and so so so jonathan peugeot is sort of a burning bush out there and people look at him and well there's something there and i'm getting something from it but i don't exactly know why because he's he's dealing in symbolism and he's dealing in images and and he's an artist and look look at how the bible does this the lamb will day down with the lion and and the tree of life and the water of life and the new jerusalem and and and there'll be no need for sun because well because the lord's presence will be the light in the city and there'll be no sea but yet there's a sea of crystal and and you know again and again in the book of revelation people keep trying to draw it because they have said well it's imagery i ought to be able to draw but then when they make the drawing it's like you can't really draw it it's sort of again like a dream it's evocative rather than descriptive and and so it's it's right there at the margin like like peterson was talking about now now lewis plays on this at the beginning of of christian of mere christianity which was taken from some radio shows that he had done during the second world war in england and he and he has this argument from desire you can hear peter devry peter creafed that peter devries that is an interesting little slip peter creafed you know he debated on unbelievable um you know whether the are you know how good is the argument of desire and you can find that in the archives saturday july 20 2013 on on on justin briley's radio program um you know we law lewis says we long for a world we've never seen and and so this is the section of you know lewis again lewis's life a little short biography he loses his mother at age six and and his mother was the emotional warmth of the household and and his father just simply did not know what to do with himself or his two young boys so sends them to boarding school and and warney you know warney loves it warney eventually goes into the military he loves it lewis hates it you know suffers abuse in these boarding schools you know can't stand his father can't stand the the anglican religion is is is you know doesn't know why he's he's angry he's lost his mother he lost the emotional center of his life and then you know then he tried then he finds joy in mythology he finds joy in the heroic but then he goes into world war one and not heroic has exactly the right kind of wound that saves him life his life and and takes him out of action and his best friend dies and you know has the situation with mrs more but for lewis it's it's the true myth he's got to have it all it's got to be put together for lewis he can't have it any other way that's why as he says in in the passage that i read it's got to come together he's he's got to have the sense of final participation and he's not going to live in this world where people say oh yeah you can dream of that but you'll never taste it you'll never know it you'll never see it you'll never see the real narnia is it just a simple negation or somehow do we have a sense a deep sense of how things should be is there really a real and true narnia i was really struck by some of the last lectures that john vervecky had of the of the second self and maybe i should relisten to those before i talk to him again because you i mean because not only the second self but the second world at the end of the bible there's the new heaven and the new earth coming down from heaven and you know the church is the bride and jesus is the bridegroom and the reconciliation of heaven and earth is consummation and consummation of course links us to the sex act and you know and marriage bed and you know the sum of all of our dreams and louis in a sense says i'm not going to live i'm not going to live without really hoping and really believing and larping in the midst of the church with with people with squeaky shoes and and music he can't stand and and priests who only know half of what he knows but but figuring out how that works you know in my videos i try to figure out you know why am i still a christian and i did that video and you know how can i put this stuff into words and maybe right now my best answer is i'm sort of a pragmatic darwinian version of paschal's wager you know if we are living in a materialist or a meta-divine realm and and evolution has clearly demonstrated that religiosity is adaptive you know i'm going to be religious i have to navigate the knowable and the unknowable we all have to navigate that to to live in the midst of the knowable and the unknowable and say i can know anything i do know everything that foolishness i won't abide but but then why not be religious if all of this is true and again the the comparison between the mormon church and and the temple of humanity temple of humanity well you know got kind of going you know you can find sunday assemblies around and you know the universalists are are still going at it and you know they're they're trying to make it work but not like the mormons the mormons kick their butt in terms of adherence and finding people and again i'm not one who has a lot of respect for for the mormon stories i'm not a mormon but you know in terms of how well people take to it well they take to it really well and so okay i'll be religious but what will my religion look like which religion well i'm going to be a a pragmatic darwinian worker of or a mutator of pascal's wager i'm probably going to pick an old one because it's been around the block it's battle tested it has rich deep resources there are plenty of books there are there are plenty of people i want to pick a big one i want to i want to pick one where i can where there's where there's an outlet in my neighborhood where there's a community of people that i can try this out in and with that i can embed myself within jesus ethic now now lewis you know he tried to work it with his morality and you know via tom holland well jesus morality has really in many ways been a powerful contender for the last two thousand years it's sneakily willing even when people say i don't believe that jesus yet they embrace his moral system you know we can hardly escape it that's the power of the book dominion where it shows how often jesus is on both sides of the fight and and no matter who wins jesus still influences and colonizes and this is what i see you know right now churches are being torn apart by the the question of same-sex marriage but you know right away i saw in that debate well people who are purporting same-sex marriage that's very jesus-y well also staining against it is very jesus-y jesus influences us on both sides of it what's going on with that and then you see it again and again and again and you know there are some jesus ideas and marxism and you read acts two or acts four and you say oh this you know sharing all things in common that's that's not really marxism but certain kinds of communism you know is is that jesus-y jesus just seems to win and then of course when when when marxist communist turns into a bloodbath we say well maybe we'll not include the bloodbath part and maybe we'll not include some of these other parts but jesus had his influence there too you know one might lead to you know it might lead to death this following jesus but that's a matter of a few years evolutionarily speaking even in terms of human culture if i if i die at 45 or 65 of 85 it means a lot to me it means a lot to my family but again if you the rough draft for sunday that i just will be posting on saturday i'm gonna post this on monday you know jesus lives 33 years and 30 of the years we know nothing about what what kind of economics does god use you know love your neighbor as yourself when we hear that say ah that's the morality that's all we need is love i love the love chapter and and and and dominion i thought that chapter was a masterpiece love your neighbor as yourself well pastor that sounds beautiful but if you live that way it's really costly yeah might cost you your life it'll cost you your money it'll cost you your time you know all the way up and down including up to and including your enemies who is your neighbor oh who knows read the parable of the good samaritan well a happy life what i mean a happy life imagining that in fact that misery deliverance gratitude that i've been rescued from my from my poor moral performance and and christ's moral performance has been offered me instead and and that and that what is your only comfort in life and in death that i am not my own but i've been bought body and soul and life and death to my faithful savior jesus christ was fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood and has set me free from the tyranny of the devil first question and answer of the heideberg catechism you know these things fill me with joy i i don't know why a materialist says oh you ought not to believe him what pride really i i looking at your system i i see no ought from you that brings me to not be a in the words of john piper a christian hedonist generosity towards my neighbor so it's it's not a selfishness that sets my needs up against my neighbor it's a joy of meeting the needs of my neighbor we're impressed by how this works for the homeless and the philosopher let's add this on top of the pile what if the resurrection is true what if jesus morality which was exemplified and acted out in the cross and then in the resurrection and ascension what if it is in fact a true myth what if it's true what if he rose from the dead what if the disciples weren't lying what if jesus i don't care to go so pilot anything it's you my friends that i want you to know i am alive so he shows up with his friends and the road to a maus he breaks bread this is how he's the most influential person in all of human history what if it's a true myth why not want it to be true why not live as if it's true so that's my pragmatic darwinian version of pascal's wager
