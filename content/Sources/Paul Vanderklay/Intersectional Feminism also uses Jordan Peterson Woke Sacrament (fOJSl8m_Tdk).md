 Hi, this is Paul. I had a great meetup in Southern California in Bellflower with John Van Dock and a whole bunch of other individuals who came so thank you everyone who came out to that and last night after the meetup, I listened to the new video that dropped from the distributist and on intersectionality Feminism is for nobody reviewing bell hooks book Feminism for everyone now before I got into Jordan Peterson or YouTube or any of this I was paying pretty close attention to What was happening in terms of feminism and woke Christianity and everything that was going on and So this is my thesis now I'm gonna end with a bunch of Jordan Peterson stuff and some I think some new insights that I gained About Jordan Peterson in Processing this video and planning for this video. I thought about to doing two videos, but I don't have time today to do two videos So I'm just gonna do one. It's probably gonna be a long one Intersectional feminism is still woke Christianity in denial So like I said, I posted this on my blog back in 2017 February 2017 Because I was noticing a new religion forming and I was very excited And I wanted to and I was noticing it around many of the issues that Jordan Peterson spoke up about with gender identity and those conversations and so I I had always just assumed feminism was something for women and Watching this new woke Christianity develop. I knew I needed to learn about it So there was a website everyday feminism and I decided I was gonna add that to my RSS feed And so I'd read everyday feminism every day and I would try to figure out what the new religion was what the new rules were and In the process I came across this video and a response video to it that I'll play some of because this video has about 6,000 views and the response video has about 65,000 views it'll give you an idea which video was more popular and why well the distributist read this book by by bell hooks called feminism is for everybody and When he started out in this I thought the little Mike my consciousness Congress someone way in the back seat said hey Wait a minute. You remember you remember that video you watched that that taught you that feminism wasn't just about feminism. Oh Yeah, and so instead of I haven't bought the book and I'm I just I'll just take the distributist word for it but I saw this video and this and This video made a world of sense to me back in back when I first watched it so Because I've been Busy going on a trip and then moving to Montreal and now starting my PhD and it's all been really busy and overwhelming But now that I'm starting to settle in a bit. I want to start making videos more So in that vein, this is another video in a series with everyday feminism Which is a website dedicated to helping you break down and stand up to everyday oppression and in this video I want to discuss the ways that People use the same term feminism to refer to to actually different movements and scopes So one way that the term feminism is used is to describe a woman focused movement focusing on Sexism and sexist oppression against women It's a historical movement and it's the way that the term is most easily understood I would say however, there's also another way of feminism is used and that's refer to a broader movement So feminism might also refer to like what we do here at everyday feminism the fight to end all kinds of oppression So this may or may not be directly regarding women Women will certainly gain freedom if oppressive systems are dismantled as women are still oppressed In many ways due to their identity as women However feminism as a broader movement is interested in freeing all genders and a gender people From all oppressions. So it's a movement which focuses on more than gender-based oppression against women So let's talk a little bit about these two kinds of feminism First there's the woman centered feminism and that's the way that most people think of feminism at a surface level So men's rights activists here feminism and think FEM that means for women only feminism hates men. It's in the name And feminism evokes this woman focused movement which fights for the liberation of women from patriarchal oppression The movement has been going on for many decades and has focused on legal inequalities Women's suffrage educational reform cultural inequalities gender norms femininity, etc It's a fight that is far from being over but we have made historical strides within that movement and there are valid reasons I think for wanting our feminism to be woman focused it began with the study and activism of women against our oppressors Woman focused feminism I think does have the ability to recognize that patriarchal systems constrain more than just women But remain focused on creating spaces for women to be safe and working against societal pressures And constraints still placed on women women qua women However, this kind of feminism is also hurtful and potentially harmful It hurts gender minorities and trans women by focusing mainly on the oppression or only on the oppression and experiences of cis women And this is exclusionary and it doesn't actually help to advance women as a whole as it leaves out some women who don't fit a certain mold It also excludes people who don't identify as women or men But who still experience gender-based oppression too So some feminists identify with the notion of feminism as being for women's liberation the women's limb movement And well, that's technically true of feminism It doesn't actually capture all the ways that different kinds of oppression will affect women And it does nothing to account for the ways those oppressions affect people who are not women So that leads me to the second I think more modern version of what feminism is And that is feminism as a broader anti-oppression movement So often people just call this intersectional feminism and that's a term coined by an american professor named kimberl√© crenshaw in the late 80s So this concept has been a part of women of colors and especially black women's feminism all along But it has made its way into the mainstream more recently. No doubt due to the tireless efforts of feminists of color And this broader feminism is intersectional in the sense that it describes multiple critical theories Avoids the different but related oppressions And oppressive institutions are interconnected and they can't properly be examined separately from each other So these institutions include racism sexism homoantagonism transantagonism ableism classism and more These are all related and to look at only sexism the plate of women without looking at other oppressions Which intersect with sexism for many women so racism will intersect with sexism for a woman of color Or ableism will intersect with transantagonism for a trans person with disabilities There are millions of people who live at the crosshairs of different oppressive Institutions and systems and its modern feminism's goal To address all of these institutions so that we can all be free And Think of it like this If you have an infection and you want to cure that infection you could try certain techniques for cleaning it or trying to eat differently something like that, um But let's say you eventually realize that there's a larger condition that's causing that infection and in fact that condition is infecting other parts of your body too So it's obviously in your best interest to treat the condition so that all your infections can heal Rather than just focusing on one infection So there's a deeper infection beneath all this that is causing That has caused depression against women and First we noticed it with oppression against women. Let's call that let's say the flu And then we realized that we had a compromised immune system Which meant I get the flu and I get a cold and I have infections in my mouth and all these things So let's deal with the underlying problem And then the individual manifestations of that problem will be resolved but instead of changing the nomenclature to Not to say that feminism is just about women. We're going to continue to call the whole thing feminism And well, maybe we'll just add something we'll call it Intersectional feminism now Back when I saw that at the beginning of 2017 I thought boy that's that's really helpful because now I can understand the website everyday feminism now I can understand why they're talking about everything and now I can really see why This this this is this is not just about women's rights. This is its own religion But but what kind of a religion is it now? Now one of the things that the distributist noticed is that um, you didn't hear a single dropping of the word Postmodern in any of this But obviously if you've been listening to a bunch of jordan peterson now a year later you'd run into um bloody postmodernism cultural marcus marxism identity politics and moral relativism ontological crisis And the jordan peterson syrup might just be what you need to drink down to Well, at least that's the hope isn't it or that's the experience that people have had but you didn't hear anything about postmodernity But intersectionality. Well, that's what she says. Well, that's modern feminism and I was thinking That I I always kind of get annoyed by the collusion between contemporary and modern because well, the words are always slippery, but But you know, I would think the beginning late 19th early 20th century in my mind is modern but modern feminism means we're going to address the underlying problems that get manifest as Oppression against wisdom with women or the patriarch or whatever, but all of these oppressions all the oppressions so well Every feminism is for everybody Well, this seems this seems this seems right up our alley by by bell hooks And so what the distributist decided to do was read this book and see what he could figure out I had never heard of this author I finished college back in the 80s and I went to a christian college I didn't get educated in any of this stuff so I got to get educated in all of this stuff just like many of the rest of you guys by Reading stuff and watching stuff and listening and doing all that kind of thing But the distributist decided to go right to the source and to say, okay. Well Let's see what we can learn And so he went to the book So i'm going to comment here once more that feminism is for everyone is not what it represents itself to be It's not certainly what I was expecting I know a lot of people have different ideas of what they're going to get when they pick up a book And I have for the longest time really wanted to find a kind of manual some manual for converting people to progressivism Something along the lines of what lee strobel or c.s lewis is to christianity some apologist Who's going to walk me through and try to convert me to the religion of progressivism? Get I never find this document I never find this book and it seems that the progressive side really has no interest in writing one bell hooks and once again The people the progressive side really has no interest in writing one To uh to use sam harris terminology put a flag in that Who are the preface to bell hooks present feminism is forever bell this book and it seems that the progressive side really has no interest In writing one bell hooks and once again the people who are the preface to bell hooks Present feminism is for everyone as if it is going to be a manual that will convert your average citizen your average skeptic To feminism as if it's going to contain arguments to why you should be a feminist in some kind of way that Lee strobel or c.s lewis or any christian apologist would this is my observation about the universe that I think is uncontestable This is my moral premise. This is how the ideology unfolds from the moral premise and observation about the universe So so the distributist is looking for something that will approach the subject in a very let's say it Rational way now that says a lot about the distributist too But the lack of being able to find such a book says a world about what's going on in this conversation Here are the rival ideologies and why they're not as compelling you get this all the time if you read literature of a conservative Or a moderate bent but not so much in progressive literature and certainly not in bell hooks Instead what you see in bell hooks is a different kind of apologia And one that has become increasingly popular post 90s in progressive circles just to give a broad breakdown of the book Feminism is for everyone. It's divided into 18 chapters an introduction that sets out the mission of bell hooks Essentially to show that feminism is something that everyone should support and be interested in oh So sounds like bell hooks is very much on the same page as everyday feminism This is this this feminism is for everyone That's the title of the book followed by a series of chapters discussing feminism's interaction with a particular concern chapters two through five now he's going to go through this but I want to first address his expectations a little bit because This is how rational these are rationalist how-to and you can read peter begosian's manual for creating atheists And you can read lee strobel's the case for christ and he mentioned c.s lewis in there and and well these this is how moderates and conservatives go about things that's important to pay attention to Why don't the progressives go this way now moderates and serve conservatives are going to jump in and say they're irrational. Well maybe maybe not but the thing I thought of immediately when he said is Most preachers don't go about this In that way either you will find christians that do this And william lane craig comes up quite a bit and he's made a career out of these kinds of rational debates And the celebrity atheists are big into these rational debates and our own I'm going to put it here in a video esther the the annoying the annoying kid sister of the intellectual dark web When she had her conversation with benjamin voice, this is very much what I thought of Preachers don't do this usually and I know some of you wish your preachers would do this more But the reason preachers don't approach it this way is because preachers have learned it doesn't work well Because I can notice so if you listen to jordan peterson talking about his new extended experience in preaching Otherwise known as a book tour He talks about he gives you his method. He looks at an individual and if you watch him This is exactly what he does. He looks at an individual and when he hears the crowd hush, he knows He's onto something well What hushes the crowd is there reasoned arguments? Sure But that's not really what moves us and and whereas I love apologetics. I love reading cs Lewis I like reading cs lewis partly because he's not like a lot of the other apologetics cs lewis is much more literary and I'd see him as a cut above But who really calls the shots in us? So here you a number of years ago I read jonathan heidt's the happiness hypothesis and that book That book is jonathan heidt's maps of meaning. Okay, so if you've read his second book read his first book because in many ways Before before I knew anything about jordan peterson. I was following jonathan heidt and I was paying very close attention to him because the elephant and the rider very much agreed with What I was experiencing people the elephant is this is this is most of our unconscious self most of our Consciousness congress and the rider is this thing that is imagining He's he's moving the elephant but often the elephant is going where he wants to do and the rider's trying to influence him But the the rider doesn't stand a chance against moving the elephant and ian mcgillchrist So someone i've come across much more recently the master and his emissary guess. What is the master? It's your limbic system, baby That's the master and in fact now he uses right brain left brain and and those are that's that's as much a schema as it is a description of things because people are different, but the basically the the right brain the the intuitive that the part of the brain that is that is dealing with unexplored territory works with the Part of the brain that deals with explored territory the mapped territory And but the the boss the boss is the right brain That's the boss and what ian mcgillchrist says is that well we're in a culture where the left brain has is trying to is trying to mount a coup And and get control of the whole administration. So let's say i've got a left and a right in my consciousness congress Well, well the left is trying to take control and the left thinks that everything can be deduced and reduced into into propositions and abstract arguments now in this case left and right are inverted because the political left is understanding to a certain degree that we are not rational And so they're not bothering with rational arguments, they're telling a story And and that story is moving people And that's how in many ways they've been winning because they're telling they're telling a story that individual people can connect with and The elephant trumps the rider if you move if you convince the elephant if you move the if you move the elephant The rider goes along and usually what the rider winds up doing is making up stories that justify the elephant Making up stories that try to make the elephant look good telling stories that explain what the elephant has already decided To do we are we are not very rational creatures and you know to say this sounds To me, it's just the most obvious thing because if you watch people People are not rational people we are not in control of ourselves now part of the problem when we talk this way is Whenever I hear people say people are not rational. They usually exclude themselves. Okay. I am not rational I'm sitting here making youtube videos right after I got back from southern california Why because I want to are there other things that I could spend to do my time? Yes, would some of those maybe be better use of my time right now possibly but I really want to do this Why maybe it's because i'm getting all this affirmation by having a youtube channel maybe because i'm high because we had a meetup Maybe because i'm excited because you know every time you know Someone likes a video or every time my numbers of subscribers go up. That's just pinging my system And my reward center is just going off Making a video right now might be a very irrational thing to do But the rider still wants to get his licks in so, you know, he's moving my mouth And if you're liking it hit subscribe hit the notification bell ding ding ding ding ding and hit my reward centers and off I go The elephant calls the shots the rider makes up stories the master is the right brain the emissary Well, this is stuff we know so left brain you go manage that stuff while I deal with The really big stuff, which is this large mysterious Universe that i'm trying to get a handle on and this large mysterious self that is really That that I really that is not transparent to myself Okay And so at this point I think it's never really rationality now, I don't know why adam took down this video I thought it was a terrible video Because I thought you know adam is adam is trying to to lead this guy in a conversation But the guy doesn't even seem to know what a conversation is. It was like pulling the string on the back of woody And and every time you set up a village atheist they tell you the same thing over and over rationality rationality rationality I don't think they win because of rationality Rationality And and I think you can the tells are the smugness and it's always reducing everything to a zero-sum game Okay, that's a that's a sure sign of the of the left brain reduce it all to a zero-sum game reduce it all to Rationality reduce it all to winning and losing You want to destroy Your adversary but your limbic system is showing Okay, and and the contest with these kinds of things is almost always disappointing so I don't a lot of people imagine Well, I think I think they're making a better argument. Okay, what argument did they make? Well, well, well, he just said it so well, okay So what you're telling me is that he said something that you had an emotional reaction to and you were moved by it And so you basically in your in your very limited reduction of everything I'll be on his side because there's only two god no god rational emotional And so you divide the world that way and that's how you're going to win. I think that entire game is emotional It's not even rational because you know what rationality is really hard It's really hard And and even when we do it and can do it over an extended period of time and it's really complex Even then we don't we are not moved by it We we usually want to do it watch the verveky stuff I come home. It's like yeah, you know I I could still stand to lose another 15 10 to 15 pounds, but You know the reason I didn't buy ice cream last week is you know, if I don't buy the ice cream It's not in my freezer and then at the end of the night when i'm sitting down relaxing with my wife We're gonna watch some korean korean soap opera on tv and I think there's ice cream in the freezer Go get a bowl of ice cream. No, you shouldn't eat ice cream. It's full of all full of that sugar But I really want that ice cream No, no, no, no see so then when i'm at the supermarket, it's like should I buy ice cream? But it wasn't jonesing for ice cream when I was at the supermarket. So i'm not gonna buy ice cream So it's not in the house. So I won't eat it at night I gotta play games to control myself to not eat ice cream You know not real rational here So let's get preaching Been in the working class and of course, how could we forget it race finally in the last set of chapters Bo hooks returns to the personal to the social issues between chapters 10 and 17 Where she goes over violence in a relationship the development of a feminine masculinity or an image of men feminist parenting marriage sexual politics And of course lesbianism and gay issues afterwards bell hooks includes a few chapters Dedicated mostly to rhetorical flourishes where she draws all of these concerns together into what she calls visionary feminism And what really is what we know today as before we go any further I was thinking the other day about because the united methodist Churches this week has been dealing with the question of what to do with same-sex marriage chapter 15's title total bliss Jordan peterson in a talk in australia with uh anderson Made a point about We don't know he's made this point a lot. We don't know the consequences of the pill well why is Unreproductive sex bliss. Well heteros have known this. This is a great desire. Let's have sex without consequences lesbianism and feminism total bliss Intersectionality now what's so entirely odd about this entire book is that again it is directed towards a layman someone who is not Converted it's supposed to demonstrate why I as a conservative why I as a white male should be a feminist Presumably why I should be a progressive but there is well why you should be not just a feminist in terms of feminism Number one, but why should be an intersectional feminist why this should this Distributists has this pegged exactly right. This is a lee strobel book. This is a peter bagojen book This is this is what this is for But the truth is they don't really need a book because let me give you let me give you a little Let me give you a little bit of advice atheists by the manual for atheists Christians buy the All these apology books and they mostly read them themselves And they try to give them to other people but one of the insights that that tim keller had was who was a very effective evangelist was In order for people to become Christians, they first need to Want to become a Christian and if they want to become a Christian Truth is that's most of the battle The elephant wins is really nowhere in this entire book where actual arguments in the stephen mollanu or Cs lewis or lee strobel sense really exist at all instead what bell hooks has included are a series of narrative Constructions designed to tell the story of feminism Why narrative constructions designed to tell the story of feminism? See I would argue that the most Potent The most potent atheist tools for turning Christians into atheists are stories This is the subtraction story, you know back in the day. We used to be ignorant. We were superstitious We were afraid of spirits Once we got over the idea of spirits and became basically, we saw the world through a Rational way where all of this stuff is only stuff Then suddenly everything came right. Well, how do Feminists tell the story back in the day when women were oppressed and weren't allowed to be legal Agents and have jobs and be self-determined and all of those things It was horrible to be women now Because of liberation everything is great, but it's not great enough It's got to be greater still so keep the movement alive It's all narrative mind you bell hooks is very concerned about people's conception of feminism and making sure that the bad press Feminists got in the 80s and 90s is undone and confronted but to counteract this bell hooks is less Interested in confronting the arguments of the anti-feminists that she opposes or even the radical feminists who she politically supports But things need to be corrected and she's more interested in telling a story about how all of these narratives are largely Incorrect when taken in whole with other political movements of the 20th century And that's how you do it Preachers know this That's how you do it The first set of chapters basically are set to recapture the narrative of the second wave before moving on to demonstrate how Anyone who cares about any progressive social justice issue is essentially going to want to be allied to the word feminism Finally she moves on and tries to expand on the social issues the issues that the second wave brought up and grappled with during The 70s and 80s and provides a way that both moderate feminists and radicals can move forward together mind Now again pay attention to the community aspect of this When I was last week when I was doing some processing of adam friended's objective morality Because we don't have access to the monarchical vision. We tend to crowd source We want to surround ourselves with people who think the same way And so really it's a matter of the riders on top of the elephants trying to convince each other And if you can get enough riders to steer enough elephants and if those elephants kind of want to go in that direction Well, the more elephants start going there the other elephants they don't even have to hear the rider They just see the elephants moving and because they're herd animal. They all start herding together This is how we work sociology of knowledge. Remember you bell hooks is very concerned She wants a feminism that can be embraced by everyone that can be embraced by black men and white men and male homosexuals She wants a feminism that can be embraced by everyone Now if you go back to the previous little video that I played of the woman talking about the two feminisms We've got an eschatology here. We've got a a we're waiting for the kingdom to come here If everyone will embrace feminism Then the world will be as it should be I'd say this is religion And because of this she does technically disagree with a lot of radicals a lot of radical feminists who gain their popularity In the late 70s more or less as separatists. We know these people exist most famously in figures like andrea dworkin But what's odd enough about bell hooks approach is that she never really contests dworkin's premises Instead what she tries to do is emotionally conciliate her with other more mainstream figures of modern feminism Why does she work emotionally again now the rationalist job that's just emotion I'll tell you you want to move a nation you use emotion. We all know this This is less a contest about what argument is right or what line of reasoning will eventually carry the day And more a political story about how all different threads of feminism came together in one vision of social justice again This is polytheism becoming monotheism This is nothing like an apologia you would get from a christian author likely strobel There is no premise syllogism conclusion formulation in this book bell hooks takes it as an assumption that you're going to be holding Progressive assumptions and simply wants to tell you the tale of how you are part of the heroic movement that she calls feminism Put a flag in that one, too Because when we get into understand The sacrament of the church of jordan peterson, which is meaning well listen to that again And if quill you're going to be holding progressive assumptions and simply wants to tell you the tale Of how you are part of the heroic movement that she calls feminism You think you're not going to feel meaning when you're part of that heroic movement. She calls feminism when well you can Maybe you weren't lucky enough to be born a woman Maybe you weren't lucky enough to be born black. Maybe you weren't lucky enough to be born gay well You can be too Oh, there's too good of a link. I gotta drop it in here. Hang on Miley cyrus who had declared herself to be Pansexual who had declared herself to be gendered pansexual in 2015 Gender neutral gender neutral in 2017 if she was born that way she'd at least be born again a couple of times then she marries a hollywood hunk and it's like Huh? Well, this is interesting. So now well, we got to do a lot of talking about this Miley cyrus says that marrying liam hemsworth was not stopped her from being a proud member of the lgbtq plus community Well, well, why isn't she acting like a a heterosexual a straight heterosexual female? Well, it's not about the people it has nothing to do with sexuality. She explains relationships and partnerships in a new generation I don't think they have as much to do with gender or sexuality Really? Look at him Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha You can be gay and have your straight sex and your hollywood hunk and not lose your gay credentials This is truly kingdom come The 26 year old american star said it was true of her marriage to hemsworth despite Seeming like a relationship between two straight people to the uninitiated Oh, i'm sorry. They just looked like a couple of young healthy good looking adults to me She like my favorite woman in the world hillary clinton said we're stronger together That may that makes me get emotional That's what she meant by it. Oh Like who gives a If he's a guy If i'm a girl if he's a woman who cares? We're really stronger together One is the loneliest number The singer reiterated at her wedding in december Which saw her don a white dress do not take anything from her identity as a proud does not take anything from her identity as a proud queer person Being someone who takes such pride in individuality and freedom being a proud member of the lgbtq Plus community i've been inspired by redefining again What a relationship in this generation looks like There it is Sexuality and gender identity are completely separate from partnership. Oh And note in the network, um pulled this up and said Huh, that's funny if you had this isn't a whole lot different from what someone in the 1950s might have been counseled to do If they found themselves same-sex attracted and say well just marry the woman anyway, okay I wore a dress on my wedding day because I felt like it straighten my hair because I felt like it But that doesn't make me some instantly polite hetero lady Oh ps straight women are badass, too Cyrus said her relationship with helmsworth is very special to me. It is my home I've I feel less misplaced when we are in the same room no matter where it is and Yeah, I I couldn't let that go by so Well, this movement has room for everyone and you can be a hero of the lgbtq community If you're a young good-looking famous wealthy Woman with lady parts who marries another big good-looking strong wealthy actor With his man parts It has nothing to do with the parts. I'm sure And of course even the definition of feminism is rather vague bell hooks explicitly gives a definition herself Which she is very proud of obviously that feminism is simply the political opposition to all forms of sexism But this simply begs the question as to the real definition of sexism It can't simply mean to jur discrimination against females the kind of discrimination that would be opposed by a sargon of a cod or Jordan peterson certainly bell hooks means sexism in a broader cultural context But at the same time the author mentions in passing in several places That she can see a future world where men and women have slightly different roles and different capacities where there are slight Inequalities, so certainly some amount of differentiation must be possible or acceptable This is of course never answered nor did I really expect it to be still I She has an eschatology I think the author shows her hand in the first two chapters of the book her introduction and her following first chapter When she examines contemporary female issues and the perception feminism has gotten for itself in the past 30 years Since the women's movement of the 1960s and 70s Here in the introduction bell hooks lays out what she sees as the problem and the culprit behind Feminism's momentary defeats at least across the 80s and the 90s Why do people have such a bad opinion of feminism generally? Well to bell hooks this was for being insufficiently broad for not having taken into consideration The manifest and myriad different ways in which the bad things in the world can have oppressive impacts In other words, she started her religion in one area Felt a lot of meaning But realized this one area was too limiting and her religion needed to be broader She had the temple of aphrodite And realized she needed apollo and realized she needed another so pretty soon you just pile up your polytheism and you get God with a capital g you get monotheism On a variety of different groups and here we bring up bell hooks favorite trifecta white supremacist capitalist patriarchy essentially bringing in the boogeymen that will unify the concerns along three axes race class And gender bell hooks is somewhat sympathetic to men's issues at least on paper She is somewhat sympathetic to the issues of white men who are working class And are suffering under our present system at least on paper But what she is adamant about is that these groups use the language of feminism use Please use the terminology that we have Someone comes into church and what do we say to them? That's sin Oh, that's sin in your life. Oh Now jesus takes care of sin oh So in other words a standard part of religious indoctrination Indoctrination making indoctrination. Why can't I say my own religious words indoctrinating people? well is Give them the vocabulary frame the construction And and you begin to I listen to this and it's like I know all this stuff We've been doing this stuff for years now suddenly Shows up. Oh feminism Feminism doesn't cut it. We need well via intersectionality We now can go all over and talk about all oppression and that's what we're really about The language of the third way feminism to be more specific and the progressive movement of the 90s to describe their issues and struggles Essentially she wants to have a certain amount of linguistic control a certain amount of linguistic uniformity That extends over all political problems and this is where the distributor shows. Hey, you know what that postmodern card That's really easy to play As they exist in the contemporary world and here is where I think we arrive at Intersectionality now, I know bell hooks has used the word intersectionality throughout her career But i'm not aware of forever giving a very concise definition of the term and if it exists and if feminism is for everyone I may have missed it. Nevertheless, if she did give a definition I'm fairly sure it would be something along the lines of the intersection of different oppressed identities has unique vectors of oppression For different individuals again more or less along the line of the tautological intersecting identities intersect Which which he had pointed out earlier in the video, which is exactly right Not particularly interesting, but I think we come to a more true or a more salient definition of Intersectionality by looking at how bell hooks approaches the problems of different groups inside feminism is for everyone We will understand that first and foremost that despite the fact that bell hooks locates feminism Specifically as an issue having to do with sexism. There is really no objection Any person could have anywhere in the world There is no problem that could not in some sense be addressed under this framework that could not be addressed using its language I could be complaining about my village getting burned down by warlords If I live in the congo I could be complaining about the dollar menu getting downsized or even about the latest video game I bought from ea not being very good and it would be a feminist issue Although there might be some limitations on the priority feminists give to those issues But again, this is fundamentally a religious game. Well, it's all sin And that's what it is. It's sin. Well now it's not sin. It's well This is all bigotry and oppression regardless of what human hardship is being suffered bell hooks makes it an issue That involves feminism the only requirement the only requirement for the issue to be essentially Something that feminists care about at least a little bit is that the language of intersectionality And feminism is used to describe the problem and how it originated as a white male and how it originated That's key male and feminism is used to describe the problem and how it originated as a white male You can be unhappy about the crime rates in your city Even if the crime rates come disproportionately from black areas as long as you blame those crime rates ultimately on capitalism Or white supremacy as a male you can be unhappy about divorce settlements As long as you blame the problem of the divorce settlements on the concept of patriarchy Now I think everyone at this stage knows that white supremacist capitalist patriarchy doesn't mean anything except for a few fringe communities White supremacist is virtually unused even by people who openly call themselves white nationalists Usually these communities describe themselves as separatists Now that's key too because when again when you look at the monarchical vision you You totalize and so you imagine you see the world as it is and what all these separatist movements again I think it's it's really helpful to study malcolm x and study the trajectory of malcolm x because At that point in the civil rights movement. You had dr king and you had malcolm x and in a sense they they They expressed the two poles of the question Are we going to live together? Are we going to live apart? and It's not supremacists furthermore capitalism is another very vague term something used to describe economic systems That are privately owned but in the modern day most people who describe themselves as socialists believe that there's some form of private Ownership over industry that is required if not preferred and need I even go into the vagueness associated with patriarchy? Classically, it's ruled by fathers But increasingly fathers have less and less a role in family life even supposed experts like christy winters in her youtube series Why patriarchy is real shifts the definition of what patriarchy is several times in the course of the same video series In essence, I think that white supremacist capitalist patriarchy are simply linguistic placeholders placeholders for a much more specific System for deciding priority and unifying all human concerns under one system Okay, they're placeholders. That's really key here one system to rule them all that progressives call intersectionality This system essentially determines the priority of the problems even if it recognizes all human problems as its concern Ultimately, and how does the movement or ideology construct the priority it gives to all of these problems? Well through linguistics through an implicit set of associations that make certain problems nearer or further away to progressive boogeymen This creates an implicit hierarchy in the system whose justification no person or advocate can really fully explain But nonetheless operates consistently Let's uh What's the cause I was noting the the chatter on twitter surrounding the united methodist church and It's interesting where you have non-methodists Who are very very committed to what's happening in the methodist church and now it's also very interesting the Nadia bolts weber. She's a lutheran Um, there is a god and then there is the church the less we conflate the two the better That's really interesting The church may reject god's children, but god never does to my queer siblings. I'm sorry. You are glorious And now it's interesting that You want to on one hand diminish the church Because the church has made a decision that you disagree with Well, why were you so invested in the decision anyway if it's just the church Why didn't you tweet beforehand no matter what the united methodist church does? It doesn't matter because it's just the church. It's really hard to fight for something and then lose and walk away and say It's it's just the church Matthew vines does a similar thing your god's beloved children and no vote could ever change that my heart breaks that your spiritual Family is hurting you like this, but remember that god and the church are not the same thing And god's love for you is unconditional very interesting Grieving the loss of a church. However, says rachel held evans or your place in it Can be as painful as grieving the loss of a loved one Sending love and prayers to all of your who are grieving that loss today. I'm sorry so What's going on all theological distinctions vanish? This is about the cause now What is a religion? This is something that has I've talked about quite a bit my definition of a religion Is basically religions answer the big storied questions of life now we ourselves our stories again, this is We're not bodies so much our bodies continue to change I when I see a picture of myself as an infant I say that's me Listen to john vervecki and benjamin voice's conversation where we talk about story and identity. Well my The the I that I imagine the closest thing I think in many ways we really come to understanding The concept of a soul is my soul is my story And and this is the story that has gone on through me now it's a special kind of story because It's not just the story in my head that I tell myself because the story is distributed to My wife my children the people of my church the people that meet me It's in fact my story in a sense existed before I was born to a degree Because it goes back in time through the stories of my parents. My story will continue after I die to a degree because To whatever extent I am remembered my story will continue this gets into sort of the greek sense of immortality Because if you were a greek and you wanted to be remembered Well, you do some heroic deed so that there could be stories about you so that you would be remembered and then in a greek Sense you lived on through your story many ways The hebrews had more biological sensitivity you lived on through your children So the worst thing that could ever happen to you would be to be cut off which would mean to have all of your children Die so for example when the king of babalon wanted to impress upon an israelite king That now you lost i1 He first had all of his children executed in front of him at least his sons and then gouged out his eyes So that would be the last thing he would ever see so he would spend the rest of his life thinking about being cut Off So what is a religion what are we? Are we are we these by these physical these physical creatures having a strange experience? Are we spiritual beings having a physical experience? Are we stories are we? What are we we are we our nationality? Are we our class? Are we our gender? What are we made for there's the final cause well, what are we made for well Meaning purpose. Well, well, what is that? What is our problem? Well, why why does the world not live up to? What we want and expect from it and in fact the nicer things get the more our expectations Grow that's first world problems. What is the solution? How can I have the life i've always wanted? Will it all someday be fixed will I Now what am I maybe on my story maybe on this experiential story that travels through time and changes things in the world Will will I participate in the story in the future? Now a number of last year in 2018. I preached a couple of sermons on Jonah and and I used some of will schroeder's Excellent story every excellent video every story is the same And before there was jordan peterson there was joseph campbell and joseph campbell talked about the mono myth And you can read all about that because stories have shapes. Well, what is the shape of this intersectional? Inter intersectional feminism. Well, it's kind of the same same story as all of our other shapes But where do we really get this story from? Well university of toronto, you know, I keep bumping into you guys up there in toronto you've got some uh, You've got some pretty sharp tools in that shed good old northrup fry and if you watch node Node in a network, you'll know that northrup fry is a big influence on jordan peterson A big influence on his reading of the bible and you can see on university of toronto's website Northrup fry videos from 1980 where he goes through basically, uh A literary analysis of the bible and here he shapes stories You have infidelity you have bondage you have return you have deliverance This is part of the reason why jordan peterson is motivated I hope to do some lectures on exodus because exodus follows this story Well, how many other things can you relate to this story? Well, there are the bad old days when women were oppressed and subjugated They were in bondage and they were in bondage because men were evil or men themselves were victims of well victims of what? well victims of bad ideas Uh, you can do you can do the the secular subtract you can do the atheist subtraction story this way Um Once upon a time people were ignorant and used obsolete technology In order to try to figure out the world and that obsolete technology got carried on and we kept ourselves in darkness until the Enlightenment and in the enlightenment we began to use rationality and rationality has delivered us from all those things of the old Dark age that that used to suppress us The story of the bible basically begins with our rebellion our fall into sin And then the jesus story in terms of our redemption and deliverance All the others depend on a human confession of helplessness and divine intervention. He was talking about He was basically saying that that's how the stories of the bible go There's the big story of the bible the big arc of the bible But almost all stories of the bible depend on human confession of helplessness and divine intervention And he said the one exception to that was the parable of the prodigal son And I would say northrup fry you should read kenneth bailey on the parable of the prodigal son Because I would argue the parable of the prodigal son in fact complies with this story arc And I know this is controversial and a lot of people out there don't like it But read kenneth bailey who has studied the proud the power the parable of the prodigal son Probably more than anyone and bailey's argument is the quotation of the son in the far-off field When he comes to himself He echoes pharaoh's Rebellious line i'm going to go to my father and i'm going to dupe him And i'm going to save myself by making the father save me The deliverance comes by the father because the father Understands that his son who is now standing before him is only trying to put food in his belly and isn't really repentant and his father Still throws the robe around him puts shoes on his feet to protect him from the village elders Ostracizing him from the community well northrup fry's dead. He's no longer available to read kenneth bailey, but all of you can So look at Augustinian Christianity versus let's say woke Christianity Well, where did we come from you have the garden of eden you have the perfect garden. There's a snake in the garden Well woke christianity doesn't doesn't go into much in terms of where we're from people might say we're born to be stars Or we're made of stardust. It's usually some some hallowed Well, everything was once upon a time great and right we can imagine. Maybe it's only an imaginary past When augustinian christianity there's my rebellion But but notice that oppression comes from the outside in I'm not the agent of my rebellion in woke christianity I am the victim of the oppression of others and then that that That victimization becomes internalized and I go on to Victimize others and victimize myself, but again notice the fundamental difference in In direction, but many people will see it as the same thing Well, what does that mean? That means that my rebellion yields my sin but over in woke christianity, it's bigotry plus power That's the problem in the world an augustinian would say augustinian meaning Since saint augustin who really framed it this way and it's carried on and I used augustin because he's a And the orthodox will have to pardon me But augustin is a deeply influential in terms of at least western christianity latin christianity the roman catholic church and the pristian churches You could run this similarly with the orthodox and there'd be slightly different answers, but i'm just using augustin So so the problem with the world is the problem with me in terms of an augustinian christian is my rebellion The problem with the world is in fact my sin In woke christianity the problem with the world is oppression that's outside in And the and and then the problem is bigotry plus power. I again am the victim of that I start out pure But i'm corrupted by the world All right, and there's There's a long line of of of history to that to that premise Well, what's the satisfaction in augustinian christianity? Jesus does it for me What's the what's the redemption in woke christianity social activism? I do it. I release myself I stop the oppression of myself and I stop it in others I stand up for myself and I call it out when it's going on with others With augustinian christianity you spread the word by Evangelization you go out and you tell people what jesus has done for them for woke christianity you educate them The climax or the eschatology for augustinian christianity is the new heaven and the new earth for the living and the dead everybody participates in it Well, you've got some realized eschatology in woke christianity. Hopefully there'll be a new world. So if I Get in touch with my oppression and release myself from my oppression and release myself from the oppressors Well, then I can experience liberation And then it's my job to carry liberation out into the rest of the world now you can run this in terms of atheism, too and basically You get different answers, but the structure remains the same now but then you run into the wrong kind of feminism and Whereas the distributist does a nice treatment in this I thought a more fun treatment of this was from the first video that I found Because I think this is actually how I found the first video Today i'm going to be making a video response to everyday feminism for those who don't know about everyday feminism It's a neoliberal publication which makes again. It's uh, i'm going to turn on the closed captioning because That's what I saw before. It's a neoliberal publication. So she's speaking from her perspective and she's Well, she's probably more of a classical feminist who doesn't want these intersectional feminists mucking up You don't know about everyday feminism. It's a neoliberal publication which makes profit from bastardizing feminism and Pay people to do articles such as four reasons why I don't consider orgasm the goal of sex where some poor woman is Making excuses for her boyfriend who's shit in bed five reasons why first world feminism isn't trivial Making excuses for the fact that their publication completely ignores the plight of women in the third world And you can already begin to see the problem You have and and distributist was talking about this you're going to have a hierarchy of issues and problems that develop and the filter through which you manage this hierarchy Well, it depends on who you are and where you're at everyday feminism Also pay people to do video blogs people like riley j denis and a youtuber called Celia adelle she goes by the name of seedling on youtube The video in question is called is feminism for everyone or for women comparing two ways people talk about Feminism celia here is going to explain the difference as she sees it And everyday feminism sees it between real feminism and their brand of feminism, which they call Intersectional feminism people use the same term feminism to refer to two actually different movements and scopes Yeah, and i'm really really getting annoyed with this one way that the term feminism is used is to describe a woman focused Movement focusing on sexism and sexist oppression against women that would be the more accurate Description of what feminism is and what it's always been There's also another way feminism is used and that's referred to a broader movement So feminism might also refer to like what we do here at everyday feminism Not feminism the fight to end all kinds of oppression surely if you believe there is a patriarchy Globally i.e men run the world you wouldn't put the fight to end All oppression on women who have the least power and influence Feminism as a broader movement is interested in freeing all genders and agender people From all oppressions all oppressions. What are these oppressions? This sounds like a really big task you're putting on women here first There's the woman-centered feminism and that's the way that most people think of feminism at a surface level not a surface level That's the actual feminism that has achieved stuff for women But unfortunately what people now think of when they hear the word feminism is your version of feminism the version which Attacks people's rights. So men's rights activists hear feminism and think fem that means for women only feminism hates men It's in the name so your solution to the problem of men's rights activists hating feminism Is to make feminism inclusive of men's rights activists the men's rights movement was set up over 100 years ago to oppose Feminism and again, you can see her biases through this but you can see this You think christians fight you think churches fight? Well This church fights first wave of feminism and it continued from the second wave of feminism Opposing the second wave of feminism and now it's continued into the third wave of feminism Actually opposing second wave feminism through the medium of third wave feminism the movement has been going on for many decades It's been going over actual centuries way. It's a fight that is far from being over But we have made historical strides within that movement the feminist movement has actually achieved quite a lot Woman-focused feminism, I think does have the ability to recognize that patriarchal systems constrain more than just women How do you figure that then but remain focused on creating spaces for women to be safe safe from what though? You should really be asking these questions. You should really be asking these questions Safe from what ask the religious questions Because if you ask the religious questions, what are the big questions? What what really are we fighting? Is this? Is this coherent and I looked on everyday feminism On your violence tab and the first page didn't have a single article about actual violence uh I just uh, I just find it incredible. However, this kind of feminism is also hurtful And potentially harmful It hurts gender minorities and trans women by focusing mainly on the oppression or only on the oppression and experiences of cis women Well, why don't they set up their own movement then why do they have to hijack the feminist movement? And this is exclusionary shall I tell you what else is accused of being exclusionary the black lives matter movement you can see the Reason why black people might need to organize among themselves about issues which disproportionately impact on them, but women aren't allowed to organize amongst themselves to deal with issues that Exclusively affect them. It also excludes people who don't identify as women or men But who still experience gender-based oppression too If you could explain to me how agender people experience gender-based oppression that would be really Interested some feminists identify with the notion of feminism as being for women's liberation feminism is not an identity It's a movement with clear Feminine feminism as an identity There we go. There we go. And of course this woman says wait a minute. It's not an identity It's a movement with well, maybe clear aims and goals goals and aims and well, that's technically true of feminism Yeah, it's technically true and it's literally true as well It doesn't actually capture all the ways that different kinds of oppression will affect women first of all If you're going to talk about a revolutionary situation You have to have people who are physically able to wage revolution who are physically able to organize and physically able to do all that It's done and it does nothing to account for the ways those oppressions affect people who are not women Yeah, why are women the only ones that have babies? So that leads me to the second I think more modern version of what feminism is And that is feminism as a broader anti-oppression movement just about oppression solving oppression people just call this intersectional feminism Not really being honest there because intersectional feminism was talking specifically about Black women in america and that's a term coined by an american professor named kimberly crenshaw in the late 80s Kimberly crenshaw wrote about specific case studies impacting black women in america in the 1980s Her model cannot be used to advocate for gender identity So this concept has been a part of women of colors and especially black women's feminism all along But this concept doesn't include men. You need to read kimberly crenshaw to see that she wrote about women in America, but it has made its way into the mainstream more recently No doubt due to the tireless efforts of feminists of color because black women in america have all this power to Dictate what happens in a mainstream? It's not men that have decided that they'll get to be included in feminism at all different but related oppressions And oppressive institutions are interconnected and they can't properly be examined separately from each other Sex as a basis race as a basis class as a basis mathematically They're on different axes racism sexism Homo antagonism trans antagonism ableism classism and more all that switching across tasks Comes with a neurobiological cost it depletes resources. These are all related It's a fun video But what about bloody postmodernism because If you listen to peterson well this you know, this is all the this is all the result of bloody Postmodernism and one of the critiques of peterson has been pretty consistently He's he's he's not really being clear on marxism and he's not really being clear on on post-modernity They transformed the marxist dialogue of of rich versus poor into oppressed versus oppressor and that the Postmodernist types is they're nested inside marxism So what they did instead being highly intelligent individuals was play a game of sleight of hand and transformed These marxist presuppositions into postmodernism in the 1970s. The sleight of hand was oh, well fine We'll just play a different oppressor versus oppressed game and we'll introduce identity politics peterson claims that postmodernism is marxism in disguise because All it did was take marxist class conflict and replace the rich and the poor with the oppressed and the oppressor in general now I think this person has a point but I think actually the distributist I think really gets this right better than peterson because You know when peterson is was in Was it san francis? Oh palo san jose recently for the book tour You know, why do they want to destroy I think they want to destroy competence I don't think it's that I don't think it's that nefarious And again the rule don't attribute malevolence when ignorance stupidity and incompetence can account for it And even a calvinist like myself watching the success of woke Christianity won't attribute it to overall malevolence except perhaps satan so I think they I think here the Distributist really gets this right East this is because the tool of intersectionality isn't ideological or methodological It is simply a political alliance that that that that intersectionality isn't Ideological it isn't methodological. It's it's something they're using for a political alliance That's all it is. And that's why it doesn't take much to watch it break down It's only uses political and I think the distributist is right here Into ideal is not eventually embraced. This is because the tool of intersectionality isn't Ideological or methodological it is simply a political alliance brought into existence to procure certain ends It's at its base something that cannot contain self-reflection in it It can only conceptualize tactics because it is at its base as cynical tactic But it's not a cynical tactic that I think is engineered I do not think that the feminists and the other progressive activists in the 70s and 80s when these ideas were being developed were evil or had any kind of Malicious intent for humanity or society as a whole instead. I think they were being reactionaries both in the sense that they became skeptical of the enlightenment but also in the sense that they were Reacting to a certain circumstance that had befallen the progressive movement in the 70s and 80s Now I think part of what happened with the hoax papers has a lot to do with this too because the hoax papers comes out of the the rationality segment of Atheism and they basically say you're not being rational. Well, that's right. We're not very rational but but this group really wasn't rational so they expose them with the hoax papers and The group the group just doesn't care And what particular event were they reacting to? Well in short I would say Post-modernity as much as people like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson and the entire staff of the National Review talk about Postmodernism as if it's some single engineered idea to come out of the Academy I think their mistake falls in understanding what is actually meant by postmodernism It is less an idea that was manufactured and more something that happened more something that progressivism Realized and tried to react to being against progressive postmodernism is kind of like saying you're against Progressive climate change. I think what they mean is that they're against progressive reaction against postmodernity or Progressive reactions against climate change we can argue over what the policy should be in light of these circumstances But not the circumstances themselves Postmodernism is a state we find ourselves in not anyone's decision I think it is very clear that it progresses themselves if they could decide between Postmodernism and modernism would choose modernism every time at least if it worked now Well, I certainly think that a discussion of postmodernism deserves its own video and I will make another video if I get around to it I might try to lay out here what I think the crisis of postmodernism is In short, it is that modernism and in so implicitly modernity failed in the 60s and 70s the phenomenon of modernity essentially loyalistic family religious and belief human bonds slowly disintegrating in the wake of capital and consumption inspired and brought about the idea of modernism the idea that we should try to Deconstruct the norms surrounding traditional Western societies that behind everything behind religion behind the state behind sexual norms behind Loyalty and honor there would be some kind of foundational utopia early efforts of this obviously include communism and other utopian ideas that were popular in the 20th century, however after World War two and the subsequent totalitarian failure of communism I think most people who genuinely believed in the project of political modernism put their faith in the West if the West could simply Deconstruct and remove our old hang-ups with religion and class and race. We would be in a utopia We would essentially achieve John Lennon's imagine where there's nothing to live or die for but simply the equality And bliss of the entire human race now if you if you listen to Sam Harris talk to Jordan Peterson Sam Harris has the same eschatology as John Lennon, this is this is That's that's Sam's vision Well, where does that come from? Well, there's something underneath There's a story underneath and there's a story of how you get there. And so Sam says well, it's going to be Rationality that's going to get us there. Well woke Christianity says no, it's going to be oppression and Bigotry plus power. Those are the problems. So what we need to do is well, then he's gonna talk about it You mean other people need to have power. Oh I think due to a variety of circumstances that I'm not going to get into here This hope was ultimately shown to be a failure a partial failure If not a complete one leaving many people who were wed to the modernist project to understand that something Fundamentally wrong had happened There needed to be tools to explain how progressivism could move forward in the wake of these failures Of course postmodernism started with radicalism sometimes with separatism Sometimes with a deconstructive approach that seemed to consume all meaning away But these strictly academic approaches didn't have political legs at least not like the civil rights movement initially did and so I think That the academic progressive left was in limbo during the period of the 80s and 90s Until intersectionality was developed and popularized and what is intersectionality? Well, simply the less technology to approach postmodernism in other words Intersectionality gave the less technology to approach postmodernism. I think he said it very well It gave them a flag to rally around now. Why is that important? What kinds of creatures are we what would now again? Back to Jordan Peters and stuff we seek meaning. Oh Now we have a flag The idea that modernism has failed at addressing the issues of modernity There might not be any kind of unifying concept of rights There might not be any kind of John Lennon's imagine waiting for us But through the power of language a political coalition can be formed a power can be forged That can contest for all of the interests of the original progressive coalition The fight can continue and all members can share in the struggle for liberation As long as we adopt the common language of intersectionality It's a tool perhaps a cynical one, but a tool nonetheless to procure an activist good now Why? Why do we need to do this? Why do we need people around us? Well again? Why do we need to do this? Why do we need people around us? Well again? We cannot achieve the monarchical vision and so we crowd source this stuff and well if it's just the feminist and if just the black folks and if it's if it's just the disabled folks and if it's just the you know the the the gay men or the lesbian women or those who feel some gender dysphoria Well, you're not gonna have any political clout. Well raise the flag and here they all come and well as long as Well now you have the dynamic as long as there's The man to push against you can have your coalition And you're going to have to keep alive the man to push against in order to keep your coalition together This is this is one of the things that I noticed in the church fights The church even even if the progressive Wing won battle after battle. They always had to posture themselves as losing They were they weren't losing at all But but they needed to posture themselves as losing in order to keep their coalition together. Well This is again human sociology. We see this all the time Americans fight like cats and dogs with americans until there's an external enemy and then all the people get together and Cooperate and they cooperate around some identity. We're Americans during at the end of world war two the big concern was nationalism people are too Nationalistic we need to break down Nationalisms because that that's what brings us to war. Well nationalism gets triggered when There are other threats outside and all the identities Line up that way same with 9-eleven islam We're we're simple creatures and we look for simple things to rally around Now in this I do think there is a separation I do think there are those among the intersectional progressives who realize that post-modernity Actually means post-modernity and that there is no john lennon's imagine waiting for them over the hill But for the most part I imagine that quite a few progressives Maybe even bell hooks herself haven't fully internalized the lessons of post-modernity and the reactionary view of politics They're still laboring under the idea that we're part of some kind of civil rights movement that there is some Implicit human right that we can discover by continually Deconstructing more and more pieces of the traditional society and replacing them with intersectional language. There's something underneath at all you see In john one the word becomes flesh. What are we always trying to do? We're trying to make the flesh into word so we can make it into flesh again Because we can manipulate words Well, we're having a little trouble manipulating each other. That's why we use words A recipe I think to make the academic class like bell hooks a new priest class for determining how power is divided up But i'm not going to argue that point here instead I will finish just by giving my final thoughts on bell hooks feminism is for everyone Surprisingly enough. I did learn something from the book Although I think it's quite obvious that the book was never addressed to somebody who had so many core philosophical disagreements with progressivism itself Still I know in fact it is very much addressed to people with core philosophical positions It's these books are written for their own people not for other people they're bought by their It's christians who buy apologetic books and give them to non-christians And they don't always get read or it's someone who thinks they maybe want to become a christian who might buy lee strobel books Understand after reading it I think more about what excites progresses so much about the idea of intersectionality In why they append it to everything in anything that they do Before intersectionality in the wake of modernism and modernity's failure All progressives had to fall back on were a myriad of different movements each with different priorities Each with different levels of radicalism and each which would fight each other if it came down to it with intersectionality in place All can march together. It is a common banner a vanguard that can carry the progressive movement into the future Well after the original circumstances that led to its origin have faded away and have shown themselves to be ultimately destructive well Here's the thing when you start something the thing usually a business a government office a bureaucracy when you start something Because it has a mission Once you organize it and get it going Once you achieve that mission Remember what the march of dimes was about polio. Can you still find the march of dimes once polio was once polio was Was conquered. Well, what does the march of dimes do? It was oh shoot. I hope I didn't get that wrong. I better check hang on I was right. It was polio. So march of dimes was founded in Nonprofit organization founded by fdr 1938 foundation to for infantile paralysis to combat polio march of dimes was coined by eddie canter after funding jona jona salk's polio vaccine the organization expanded its focus To the prevention of birth defects and infant mortality. So if you go to their site today, well shoot we're gonna We're going to banish polio But once you banish polio, you can't banish the march of dimes It has to live on well, how do you live on you live on by? expanding And that's how You continue to live on and that's exactly what happens with feminism and how many other things? Well, we got the vote. Okay. Well, what's after the vote? Well, uh better better treatment in In employment. Okay, what comes after that? They're never going to die And in Intersectionality progressives have found something they have found something useful that traditionalists that conservatives that Libertarians still haven't even begun to develop they have found a way to make progressivism Postmodern they have found a way to make progressivism survive the initial consequences of modernity's fall and under the banner of intersectionality as Contradictory and as cynical as it might be they will eventually win That is of course if nothing further is done by their opponents to learn from their mistakes And this is where the the I I have a little bit more optimistic view than the distributist does but You know the point about the march of dimes that's feminism and and so And so this woman asks, you know, well, what about well, what about feminism? Well, we already have feminism you don't need to call the other thing feminism And then you've got the feminist heretics You've got the you've got the power feminists who who want to lean in and now I I thought Capitalism was to blame but now you tell me you want to lean in in order to climb the corporate ladder Or you've got the right to life feminists and they're like well, guess what? Guess how many babies in indian china are being killed because they're female infants You might not consider them to be a baby, but you might recognize their gender even before they're born Well, I suppose that gender is assigned to them by the ultrasound But but their heretics are the wrong kinds of feminists So this stuff continues now If meaning is the sacrament for the church of jordan peterson How does that connect here? When I drive to san francisco, I often notice on the side of the on the side of Interstate 80 over near berkeley. There's the big people statues Okay, and you can find that on roadside america.com or you can find it actually over in berkeley by i-80 and last time I drove by there I noticed all the homeless people around what's what's really interesting about this statue and what I noticed right away is What is being? Realized what is what is what is being embodied by this piece of art? It's the it's the act of protest Okay. Now now remember go into jordan peterson 101 in terms of maps of meaning and personality first you act things out Well, what's interesting is this this sign is about? protest protest itself Is the sacred thing? now Anyone reading jordan peterson should definitely have read victor frankl's man's search for meaning. It's a it's a classic It's a it's a terrific book and he talks about the role that meaning plays in our survival Now again, if you listen to jordan peterson meaning is the sacrament of his church. I've talked about that in past videos that's that's you know, this is how you have meaning and I was having a A discussion with someone is it is it responsibility or meaning? Well, really meaning is the bigger thing and responsibility is perhaps the action of meaning but meaning is the sacrament It's it's it's by means of meaning that in a sense we we ascend um To to pawl into the vercaki stuff the verbakey stuff. It's it's meaning you know meaning in the flow state meaning is in a sense where The kingdom of god comes into the world and the kingdom of god saves us but This gets complicated when we get into intersectionality and you've heard peterson talk about this before and Peterson quite says well, you know intersectionality. That's that's really problematic if you follow this up Sense of a lot of the progressive people that I know Is that they're not? They're sort of from a new generation. They're not generally materialist. They're sort of very spiritually aware And I I sense a kind of implicit message in what you're saying that i've never heard made explicitly that In some sense materialism is a deadening doctrine I mean you look at the opioid crisis in america you look at a lot of these if if poverty is seen as a more sort of Also also as a sort of spiritual crisis or a crisis of the soul as much as anything else Is it mostly that like it? It would be a lovely thing if if poverty was caused by lack of money We could fix it really easily then but it isn't My point I think is to say that if if you were framing your message in that way I think there would be a lot of people on the left Who'd be receptive to that message sort of that that actually there is a crisis of that the crisis of um What would you call it? Like worldview has real consequences and a lot of the poverty we're seeing in the world is to do with this kind of materialist worldview that has become Um become um corrupt or at least kind of stripped all of the meaning and purpose out of the world. Yeah, that's a good point Well, right. Well, I mean I don't believe that materialism materialist hedonism Is a sufficient solution now. It's a bit more complicated than that because I do think that functional democratic systems are actually pretty good at Reasonable hedonism like i'm pretty happy that our system produces A variety of toothpastes and a variety of toilet papers and a variety of sanitary napkins all of these things that that are basically oriented towards What would you call them individual creature comforts? There's something about that. That's really Merciful and properly egalitarian and so a certain degree of material hedonism is a good thing, right? Because it's nice that people can have Their basic needs taken care of in a dignified manner but as a as a Ultimate solution to the problems of life. It's insufficient, which is again why I don't really like abraham maslow's hierarchy of of of of needs You know, it isn't It isn't a progression up the moral chain because of the provision of additional material resources doesn't work that way That doesn't mean that you don't want to you want to set up a situation where as many people as possible are absent the terrible strictures of privation But we are doing that quite rapidly. Thank god so so I think where the leftists are less happy with what i'm doing is the case that i'm making that The meaning that transcends mere materialism is to be found in the adoption of individual responsibility Because I wouldn't say that that's a core message certainly not of the radical left Now the adoption of individual responsibility. That's not a core message of the radical left. Let's go back to our slide of Peterson is a real point and this is why when you talk about Uh peterson's I did a I did a podcast with preston sprinkle and preston made the point that augustinian peterson when he talks about theological anthropology Peterson sounds like an augustinian Personal responsibility. Well that fits in well with an augustinian worldview. It's my rebellion I need to clean up my room. My room is a mess because of me My sin I need to clean up my life. My room is a mess because of me that's that's opposed to Oppression i'm oppressed oppression is what's out there. It has come now inside of me bigotry is out there It's come now inside of me. So in that aspect responsibility peterson has a point but Responsibility and meaning aren't exactly the same thing because there is implicit in the next segment in the next turn comparing christianity to augustinian christianity to woke christianity a difference because with augustinian christianity Jesus saves me Well with woke christianity I save the world So there's your responsibility There's your meaning this meaning impulse Is you can you can get there either way it just comes in at different points It's not that at all because generally they construe the individual as Either the oppressor or the suffering oppressed but not as the active agent As either of those active agents Yes, and no they're the they're the they are in terms of the the question of who am I and what's my problem? Well, my problem isn't mine now. That's a huge problem and peterson is great at pointing that out because At least with christianity and peterson made this point with respect to the old testament, which I thought was an excellent point that When the babaloonians come and they sack Jerusalem and they destroy the temple the israelites say it's my fault I need to address it. So they took on responsibility They experienced meaning it was sacramental for them and by taking that on It's transformative in terms of life in the world and what you can do So in that segment of it peterson is exactly right But when you get down to the empty placards by the big people statues in berkeley The left are going to experience meaning there And so why is why is the left so successful? it's not because They're trying to destroy competency. It's because they've placed their meaning engine in a different place from christianity and Where they placed it is directly a result of Secularity You have the iron box of secularism. You are buffered from god There's no jesus who's going to come out riding a cloud to save you You've got to save yourself. You think you're not going to experience meaning there. That's exactly where you're going to experience meaning Jordan peterson sacrament can work in either church The problem with the oppressor oppress Narrative is even though there's an element of truth to it Each of us can be subdivided into so many group identities that there's at least one dimension along which we're all oppressors that's right, that's intersectionality and This is why he's this is what he's talking about and that's identities that there's at least one dimension along which we're all Oppressors and that's actually when when i've been looking at what happened In the aftermath of the russian revolution That that was the bloody error So to speak because you could take virtually every any individual And you could find out it's like if there's one dimension of your identity that makes you an oppressor That trumps all the elements of your identity where you're a victim And the problem with that, right and it works the other way around if there's one element of your identity where you're a victim that trumps All of the oppressors and when when peterson was having the gq conversation again one of his more combative interviews peterson I mean I I do this with people people like well, you know These this other marginalized group of people over here. They're not getting any jobs. Why don't you give them your job? I like my job I don't want to give it up. Oh, well You're oppressed because you're a white woman, but you're an oppressor because you're white. Okay, but now we're going to get Calvinist Oh, but i'm owning my privilege and all I have to do is say i'm owning my privilege or i'm totally depraved And now suddenly that absolves me from all responsibility. Well, if you have to win your own salvation You're still kind of on the hook That is there is one element of your identity where you're an oppressor and so that's sufficient Justification to throw you in with the predators and do whatever is necessary to dispense with you And that's sufficient the other way around Everyone can line up and say i'm I was discriminated against by southwest airlines because i'm tall You know how uncomfortable that seat was I had to sit in that little seat and my knees were up against the thing and I I had to sit there. I was oppressed today because of my height. Well, there we go I'm i've been i'm oppressed well and peterson says that but it always goes both ways That's exactly what happened in the aftermath. Well, not only of the russian revolution, but all of these radical leftist revolutions. It's like Well, if you're a socialist, well, you're not sufficiently Pure from a doctrinaire perspective and if you're a student, well, then you're part of the emerging bourgeois class and if your parents were reasonably What would you say efficient farmers then you're part of the kulaks and Like it just went on and on and on and on there wasn't anybody who escaped from the From being tarred with the brush of oppressor and that's because that is because each of us are in fact oppressors and oppressed Every single person shares both of those things in common And that's right. And and that is in a sense augustinian christianity we are victims of sin and we are sinners and so Well, you can't necessarily do a lot about being a victim. But what you can do a lot about is Well my rebellion I have to address my rebellion, but it's always in this Active mode that you're going to get meaning And its payoff and all of that stuff that peterson has spent a long time Cataloging the the connections to biology all this meaning mechanism that's built into us the experience of meaning What's important here is that it works for both? sides and when you have the That big people statue in berkeley with all of those bronze people and the empty square boxes Of the placard that's begging you to say put your put your Cause in here the cause itself is incidental. What's important is the action of protesting? Do y'all remember? Well, now i'm gonna pull this up. Hang on. Do y'all remember the woke? Uh kendall i didn't know her name The woke kendall jenner ad remember remember what that was about It was all about this it's We're protesting and actually I use that for a sermon too and you've got all the different people and Oh there she's gonna get woke and uh Hold my hold my oh no, she sees a dude. So it that's that's that's of course the money shot. It's like Hold hold my wig a person of color. I've got some liberating to do that's meaning That's you know that triggers everything well Here's the problem with that trigger. Well, let's let's jump back to this interview a second Um Got a couple of minutes left. So this might be quite a big question but just come back from the us where we interviewed paul vanderkley a christian pastor who's been doing quite a lot of Videos about your your thought He one of his questions was he says he he sees a real sort of stoicism in your thought Pick up your cross and drag it up the hill his question is what's at the top of the hill? He doesn't hear that Well, that's because he hasn't listened to the times when i've been talking about it I guess because i've said it repeatedly you stumble uphill with your burden towards the city of god That's the that's the story. What does that mean the city of god to you? I would say that that's that's a place where everyone bears Maximal responsibility and speaks the truth That's what it is Verbs and nouns Verbs are about the world being a form for action drag that cross up the hill responsibility That will connect you with god Where you tell the truth well What you've really got is this different truths being told. Are you a victim? Yes. Are you an oppressor? Yes, one side wants to say well nobody wants to say they're an oppressor i'm a victim Yes And see what's deep underneath all this is nobody wants to say i'm oppressor. Why? Christianity The the caesars didn't have any problems saying they were oppressors the greeks didn't have any problems saying they're oppressors In fact even israel to one degree or another David ran a small empire david and solomon. They were oppressors over They were oppressors over the edamites. They were oppressors over the over the moabites They were oppressors over the ammonites They they they oppressed and put down the philistines and because the philistines had been oppressing them And so here you have world history Christianity comes along and says nope It's not a good thing Now now christianity is a very subtle Interplay between equality and hierarchy Okay christianity plays lots of games with hierarchy You have the son of god who has the highest status becomes nothing Tells his disciples the greatest in the kingdom of heaven must be the servant of all you have all this Hierarchy stuff and then jesus goes and does what he heals regular people and he he he in a sense transforms the story to see through the eyes of The the the sinful woman who's anointing his feet The eyes of he gives the beggar sight and so there's there's Equality comes from christianity And it maintains hierarchy at the same time and does so in a certain way now Jordan peterson is sacrament is meaning it's all about verbs. It's a form for action drag that cross up the hill But then david asks him god City of god Which city of god? What god what is god like? Intersectionality has a hill too and they put a flag on it and and and again This is all inherited from christianity In a sense you if if you're going to tell sam harris, you're a christian You also have to tell the intersectional people. They're christians, too Because they're playing the same games And and all of this game has been so deeply formed in us in the west from christianity And so the question with peterson is hey, you're going to get meaning by verbs by taking responsibility By dragging that cross. There's your sacrament that ties heaven and earth And when you when you're doing something on earth, you're moving something in heaven and and and the world becomes put back together In the correct way when you're doing meaningful things. That's the verb But what meaningful things? That's the question of nouns every story has sentences and the difficulty for peterson is always going to be The nouns he's worked his whole life on the verbs and he's gotten He's really been helpful with the verbs and I think he's dead on right But now the question is nouns A lot of crit critiques of peterson say he's fundamentally a modernist the gq ad the woman says to him You're just you know, that's always the criticism. We're marching up our hill jordan We're taking our cross We actually we're trying to get other people to carry our crop, but we're marching up that hill I'm an activist. We're trying to save the world here. They're feeling meaning And and they're feeling meaning in that way And i'll tell you I know a lot of left leftist people with very clean rooms And they have their lives together and they've got their vision their verbs are straight their verbs are very petersonian But their nouns are different And and so a lot of people look at it's very interesting to look at where jordan peterson and steven pinker differ and agree Because in many ways they agree on the nouns He and steven pinker share the noun the city on the hill they're working on the same city It's modernity and and the distributist is right. It's the left is They're dealing with failed modernity and in a sense peterson and pinker say It's not that bad And and he spent his life figuring out the verbs and he's done great work with the verbs Other critiques say he's got post cold war ptsd And he keeps going back to that and both sides have critiqued him with that and well, what's he doing? He is fearing we are going back to that. Is he an alarmist is a legitimate fear Seems legitimate to me We've often been on the we've often been on the brink of this in the 1930s. We were in the 1970s We were the cold war had a way of in a sense focusing america On the external enemy, but I remember the debates between right and left How much should we fear the soviet union in the 30s and the 20s? Oh, that's a it's a utopia and then well the curtain was pulled back and well, it's it's it's a utopia if you don't mind genocide Oh shouldn't go there But we keep coming back to it. Well, is it marxism necessarily? Well, there's certainly some marxist elements to it, but is it the thing beneath marxism? that Is the same thing he's fighting is it is it actually the elements of the religion? That have sort of been inverted and again Peterson's meaning verbiage works in both ways and so all of the people in Miss Jenner's pepsi commercial, what are they doing in that commercial? They are acting out Meaning or what kind of meaning are they acting out? Well now we're going to get into the nouns The kind of meaning they're acting out is I would argue fundamentally Self-righteousness to be to be part of the crowd set to be part of the protest says We are right. You are wrong and what's built into protesting is Our righteousness now It's a very different thing when I think about the kind of stakes that were Well, this is obviously developed during the civil rights Movement there were protests before that obviously but but I think part of what gave those protests that power was the sacrificial nature of it because when When the african americans of the south lined up to march they knew very well about the fire hoses and the dogs And it was the fire hoses and the dogs that changed the hearts of white America and the change of the heart was exactly that augustinian move And and it's very petersonian because he's very augustinian there I am responsible for my failure. It's my rebellion. It's my sin. So you got the augustinian anthropology But then you've got the soteriology what soteriology I shouldn't use those terms then you've got the the salvation story Well, the salvation story for the oppression is well the oppressed need to change And again, well, yeah, the oppressed do need to change but I am oppressed and oppressor and the emphasis is on me. I am oppressor I need to change now that gets complicated too because Owning your privilege. Well, that's sort of the white person saying i'm the oppressor Well, then I need to change well that meaning verbal that meet those meaning verbs then kick in and energize that whole system That peterson has laid out and so his real challenge are going to be with the nouns What does the city of god look like? I've got real i've got a real I get frustrated by the never-ending book tour a lot more videos and But at the same time y'all have been very generous and just about any city he goes to he's if he says something significant Someone will send me a tweet or an email and i've gotten a few out of sydney So so george has been very generous. He's been very generous. He's been very generous. He's been very generous I've got a lot of people sending me a tweet or an email and i've gotten a few out of sydney So so jordan in his is crazy random. What am I going to talk about tonight over in sydney? He goes to the christian stuff a lot in australia On his previous tour in melbourne. He hit it a lot now. He sits it in sydney I don't know what it is with jordan peterson in australia, but there's there's something going on there Well, the the point of the article was seven things jordan peterson taught me and this is in eternity Uh, i'd say it's a christian website Point five peterson ants peterson's answer to whether he believes in god You're going to the city of god. You'd better know what god is Whether he believes in the city of god was illuminating and brilliant Essentially, he is convinced by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche That there has only ever been one true christian And he ended up on a cross Yeah christians can say that We are all Substandard christians every single one of us peterson in a sense says there's the north star That is none of us live as though we believe in god. Yep. He's right Because saying we believe in god is actually a comment on how we live we all manifestly fail to live Consistently with the idea of a transcendent personal good and powerful deity. Yep. That's right. That's the noun This is spot on and boy did it resonate with the crowd Because it is true Wow It seems to me the point of departure from orthodox christianity is that peterson gets all the way to a crushing awareness of our inadequacy I am the problem But then doesn't take into doesn't take us to grace for theologically minded friends. I'm channeling jb torrance and carl bart here The vicarious faith obedience and life of jesus See, there's the connection How are we connected with jesus? So jesus is the one true christian. How are we connected with him? As the son of god jesus lived precisely the life. I cannot live My friends who had found peterson most helpful spiritually are the ones who have come through addiction 12 step recovery where peterson Excruciatingly where peterson's excruciatingly accurate diagnosis is combined with the extraordinary grace made manifest in jesus or a a So what do we have here It's it's all versions of christianity folks That's where this is all going and rationality isn't going to win We are elephants with riders the master is the right side The left side is its emissary. It's it's a useful tool to try to talk back and forth That's why the riders do it but that's not the native language of our bodies We want to be christian before we can ever be christian and and this show of rationality It doesn't really get there And and so once we once we find the march of dimes we can't give it up Now suddenly we have to broaden it. Ooh feminism won. Let's make everything feminism Okay, feminism will feminism will save the world. We can all be feminists But now you've got the Now you've got the differences so My sin my rebellion The meaning system gets engaged Jesus died for me. It's done for me Well on the woke side the meaning said i'm gonna i'm oppressed everyone's an oppressor I'm gonna forget the ways that i'm an oppressor conveniently and point the finger to everyone else It's basic self-righteousness But I need to save the world Now you're gonna engage your meaning it's nouns and verbs Peterson's really got the verbs right the noun Seems like he's working on
