 Hi, this is Paul and this is my Rough Draft for Sunday video. I usually do this on Fridays, I preach on Sunday, and I'll usually remember to throw the link of my Sunday sermon into the stream here. I keep a separate stream for my Sunday work. I have my sermons and my Sunday school class, I have a pretty rigorous adult Sunday school class, and I'll usually post them Sunday afternoon or evening or Monday when I get around to it, but they're on a separate channel, so if you poke around you should be able to find my church YouTube channel, which is different from my church, my personal YouTube channel. But I do this Rough Draft for Sunday here basically to get comments from you. What did you think of the sermon? What points did you like? What points didn't you like? It's nice to get that kind of feedback before I present it live, even though a lot more of you see it on my Rough Draft video than see it on Sunday, but there it is. I've been in the liturgical calendar for quite a few months now, but now after Pentecost I'm going to switch the liturgical calendar switches into ordinary time, and I've been working on a series that I started back in Genesis 1 years ago where I'm just basically going through the Bible, and right now I'm in the middle of the book of 2 Kings. So over the next number of weeks that's where we're going to be. We're going to be in the middle of the Old Testament, in a part of the Old Testament that a lot of people don't pay much attention to. So I like to listen to people when I hear them answering the question, are things getting better or worse? Because what I find is that people are all over the map depending on what they're talking about. Are things getting better? We look at technology, we look at maybe we look at politics, maybe we look at social issues, or maybe when we look at these issues we think all things are getting worse, the world can't last that much longer, we're killing ourselves, we're all going to die. Do we have a bright future or a dark future? Is it the right track or the wrong track? And one of the things that I notice is how much apocalyptic we see right now in our movies. Most superhero movies are apocalyptic. One of the top rated television shows, The Walking Dead, is apocalyptic. We're very conflicted about the future. This is nowhere more easily seen than in politics. And here we have Kanye with his Make America Great Again hat. At every election we seem to flip-flop. When Trump was elected, Alan Sorkin wrote a letter to his daughters where he, the world changed last night in a way I couldn't protect you from. That's a terrible feeling for a father. I won't sugarcoat it, it's truly horrible. And he talks about how horrible Donald Trump was and he basically promises that this will never happen again. And it's like, really? This is, well, this is really a religious embrace that you have. This is really a religious belief that you have that somehow wellness in politics only goes one direction. I call that progressive liberationism and it just imagines that through politics and through technology and through science we're just going to keep progressing and the world is getting better and better. But I notice amongst the same community, they're the ones that are most active in terms of imagining that, well, we're cooking the world with CO2 and we're destroying the planet with our technology and, you know, 50 years from now the polar ice caps are going to melt and New York is going to be underwater and so then I just have to ask, well, better or worse? And then you have Kanye with his Make America Great Again cap and it's like, well, but this is what people are like. You know, this is, we all have these imagined scripts and we think things are going to flow a certain way. One of my favorite characters in this is Ray Kurzweil who a number of years ago, he wasn't very healthy and he decided that, you know, at some point very close we're going to reach what he calls the singularity where we'll be able to upload the conscience of our brain into computers and we'll be able to upload our consciousness and if we can upload our consciousness then we'll no longer be dependent upon these physical bodies and while he's 70 years old now, I don't know how much longer he's going to have to live but the way I read it, even despite the greater computing powers that we seem to possess, we still don't have any clear, any very clear idea about what consciousness is and so the idea that we'll actually be able to upload ourselves and this me that I experience myself as being will somehow be able to transcend the death of this physical organism and then I'll live, what, in my laptop? I'm not quite sure what he's going for but this is what he's banking on and certainly there's no harm in eating better and trying to stay alive as long as you can but he's certainly imagining that somehow things are going to improve and get better and better and he'll be able to offload and he'll be able to live forever. Well, Ted Williams, you know, of baseball fame took a different track and he had his body frozen and I don't know what he died of but apparently he's hoping at some point they'll be able to thaw him out and rejuvenate him and have him ready to go. I don't know if he left money to have that happen too because I think probably the government closed his social security. Now this kind of thinking is is, you know, very present when we get into religion and philosophy. If you're a secular materialist you have to answer questions about the future. Now maybe for you death is the big sleep and you die, your consciousness goes away and there's no heaven, there's no hell, it's just nothing and so I don't know. It's funny because every time I watch a science show and they talk about the death of the sun, well the sun's going to run out of gas and the whole universe, in fact, is going to get to a point that it's going to die a cold death but don't worry you'll die sooner which always kind of makes me chuckle because it's like someone might say, oh don't worry at some point you'll die of old age but guess what you're in luck you're going to get hit by a car tomorrow. It's like this is good news but if you're a secular materialist this is, you know, you look forward to the future and you say well this is how it's going to go and good bad right or wrong however you feel about it that's just it. That's what you believe according to your religious philosophical system. If you're a Hindu Buddhist new-ager, now again this is complex and a lot of people have different ideas about this but Hinduism generally has this idea of reincarnation that I'm right now I'm living this life and I'm trying to work out my issues and not really the conscious part of me or the memories of me or what I call Paul Vanderclay will kind of get recycled and if I've done well with karma I'll get an upgrade in the next life and if I've been a jerk or a problem person I'll get a downgrade and then I'll have more to learn and basically what the point of many of those traditional religions is that I can escape this cycle of reincarnation and I can join the collective thing that we call God, the great sea of consciousness of being and I'll lose my individual self and this experience of an individual self and then I might ask well why am I having this experience of individual self if this in fact is a problem and I just was listening to a guy who was basically saying that no one should have babies because what we do when we have babies is we consign people to a prison of pain and it's like wow that's a pretty radical idea but it's not necessarily that far from this other idea that this personal embodied experience I'm having now is actually some kind of torment and punishment that I would like to get rid of and my goal for my moral performance is that I can transcend this and then no longer have individuality but of course all of the things that I prize and value as me that I associate with me even if all the cells in my body are different from the basic matter and materials that I was born with I still value me and part of me really wishes to endure and for this life that I experience as a story to continue on forward even past my physical body and then you get into all kinds of other religious and philosophical systems where we imagine that this happens we've got all kinds of scientific arguments about well well can we really be me without my body and this gets into all of these all of these discussions so if you're a Christian then what is your future well even in Christian theology Christians are a little divided about that there's the the pre-millennial dispensationalists who are take the old testament highly literally and so there has to be a a recreation of Jerusalem and Ezekiel's temple has to come and and so on and so forth but if you read the left behind books then you'll get all of this stuff about an antichrist and a rapture and and all of those kinds of things that that isn't my position and it's not the the historic position of the church I would argue that position arose mostly in the 19th century in the context of the modernist fundamentalist fights there's the post-millennials this was a very popular group towards the end of the 19th century when when you have kind of this fusion of Christianity and science and culture and and they said look the world is getting better and better and better and and maybe via science and technology we'll put away death and may be maybe via social progress we'll put away suffering and bias and prejudice and bigotry and and maybe we'll just work our way out of all of this suffering that we have and and then in the future you know our children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren will live wonderful wonderful lives and you can see how this kind of perception about the future is is sort of based on the perception of where we are now if you're living an affluent North American lifestyle that is tended to be seen on a human scale full of security and prosperity you might say yeah things are getting better and better if you're living in a gaw if you're living in a garbage dump getting cancer from the environmental waste of of some other affluent people some other place you might say well the world is getting worse and worse and then this all gets into this question of consciousness and evaluation and and and with what criteria can we judge better or worse happy or sad if we can somehow transcend from see me seeing myself now and evaluating am I having a good time could I be having a better time what what would I need to do to have a better time right now you know what what kind of lengths could I go to to have a better time right now now the Amillenials which is which is my camp don't necessarily see the certain chapters in the book of revelation as necessarily literal and you know there's a lot of questions about the Thessalonians man of lawlessness and and the the antichrist and the book of revelation Amillenials just in some ways often just kind of punt and say well you know we'll leave God up and we'll leave God in charge of the future and we'll trust him for it and but what's interesting about you know these questions about Christian eschatology is whereas there's definitely a shape of things and and the shape very much includes that that me the mice the myself I know the Paul VanderKlay will in fact be resurrected and and will reign with Christ in a new heavens and a new earth that the nest the path of how to get there Christianity really hasn't kind of all gotten on the same page as they have with things like let's say the trinity or the the doctrine of christ or some of these other creedal doctrines that the church has has talked about but now we all sort of want the brightest future and so some people say well I don't know if Christianity is that bright you've got hell afterwards yeah but you know if you really start thinking about that you have the questions of justice in the world people are like I think there should be justice and I don't think there should be a hell and that goes off into a big huge conversation the difficulty of course is that if there's no if there's no judgment or punishment can there really be justice those are really hard questions Christians of course have a new heavens and a new earth and not a not a cycles of reincarnation and you know in some Hindu in some Hindu streams when they ask the question well why why did this great perfect sea of consciousness devolve into this individual experience of us right now and you the answer that I've seen is usually kind of a shrug and well God play well tell God to knock it off if if this is so much worse than than losing my individuality and just being in this great stream of consciousness you know it's not always and and one of the things that Christians have often experienced is that it's darkness before the dawn and so you you have this imminent apocalypse that that goes on throughout church history if you read the apostle Paul and the New Testament they thought well Jesus is coming back soon right and you you get to you go all throughout the early church in the middle ages and you know Jesus is coming back isn't he when's he coming and you get to the medieval period and even you get to the modern period you know I grew up and it was Hal Lindsay 1980 countdown to Armageddon that's like well 1980 went came and went Harold Camping just a few years ago you know bought billboards all over the world you know fine you know Jesus is coming in in October and so you'd better get ready and people sold their houses but they're selling their houses was in anticipation of a glorious future not a depressing one now some of you might wonder well why are we getting back into the Old Testament well well the Old Testament was the Bible for the early church and Jesus quotes it more than anyone and so some people like well I like the Jesus part of the Bible not the Old Testament but Jesus thought a lot of the Old Testament enough to to quote it and bring it up and reference it and and have it and and say such amazing things about it like it's not passing away and and and you don't find hell in the Old Testament in fact the afterlife is is pretty murky in the Old Testament the New Testament is really an updating of the old in the light of the revelation of Jesus you have Jesus as new Israel and the church as new Israel and the focus on the world rather than specifically on on Hebrew nationalism and so now we're going to get into the book of kings and so for us part of it's going to be well well how can we understand the book of kings with respect to the book itself how can we understand it with respect to the story of the Old Testament and how can we understand it with respect to let's say the Christian New Testament and now here here's the difficulty that you have as a preacher is that those of us sitting around in in 2018 might be asking the question well why should I read this old book about these you know this iron the the politics of the iron age with people I don't know about and a lot of people would say yeah that's why should you and some might say well you might have something to learn and others would say well the god is is still the same god there and this is how you know him and so on and on and on I find a very a very good website a very good youtube channel where you can find a lot of really helpful guidance in terms of understanding these books is is the bible project and this is this is their treatment of the book of kings and you know I think it's a good basic orientation to say well well what is this book about well this is what this book is about now where this book lands in terms of the ongoing story of the Old Testament is you have these tribes and then you have Saul and David and and under David and Solomon Israel really reaches in some senses an eschatological peak they become a a minor empire and they're part of the world and Solomon is wise and he's fabulously wealthy and all of these things going on and so in some ways the the promised fulfillment up until that point gets reached in in David and Solomon but now the book of kings is written about the decay and corruption of that kingdom that kingdom is split in half and you have the northern kingdom of Israel with its capital in Samaria and you have the southern kingdom of Judah and both of those kingdoms are going to be eaten and destroyed by empires and and actually this this story is what preoccupies this story and its relationship with God is what preoccupies the people of Israel now if you want a lot more talk about this you can go and look at my discussions for example on the book of Daniel or the book of Ezekiel because how this plays out in relationship to God preoccupies and dominates the imagination of the people and and and as well it should and so this question of are things getting better are things getting worse what really is our hope for the future what really can we hope for in the future and and not unlike today whereas if you ask them are things are getting better depending on kind of where they're standing they might say yeah things are getting better i can you know i have better medicine for my diabetes or my my cell phone is a lot better than the one i had four years ago or let me say are things getting worse they'll say yeah they're getting worse we're destroying the environment and and trump is president and you know or maybe things are getting better because trump is president i mean again if you just ask it's that's a big fight we can't come to consensus well well in many ways this kind of situation is an enduring experience and so the the people of God are trying to orient themselves in terms of the promises of God that they have for the future where they are in the story of God where they understand themselves in the world and now the authors of the book of kings after the destruction of both kingdoms look back and say this is the destruction of the people but now a big part of the central story of this are the role of the prophets and the two main prophets we see in the book of kings are Elijah and Elisha and Elisha of course asks to inherit the mantle of Elijah and and so he's given a double portion and so Elijah there are like the seven dramatic miracles that are given to Elijah and there are 14 dramatic miracles that are told of Elisha and they're all dealing with the kings and and now these prophets are are revelation of the future even in decline and and so you begin to see the complex and ambiguous nature of their work is are we to hope for better things in the future yes are we hope to hope do we should we expect calamity in the future yes the future is both going to bring hope and calamity now the main role of the prophets is to denounce the failures of the king and the people for their for their their failures of covenant faithfulness and if you read back in the story you have the book of deuteronomy where the covenant is reiterated the covenant israel has this ongoing relationship with god which is supposed to be administered by the covenant it's supposed to be administered in obedience but israel is really bad at obedience and so they fail and part of the reason for the contamination corruption decay and destruction of the people is because they are unable to keep this covenant but but the the the prophets at the same time facilitate the revelation of god because the king and community are not and and that is in fact the role of i should probably put that slide in so a big role of of what israel itself was supposed to be was to represent and embody the kingdom of god on earth and and this was what how israel is supposed to bear witness to god in the midst of the nations thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven and and and because the king and the prophets were failing at this so so miserably the prophets the king and the community was failing so miserably the prophets attempt to attempt to reveal god to the people and to the nations now it's a little bit difficult to jump into the middle of the story into the middle of the story here and and especially with this story because if you read back over the other stories you find the the bible is very particular about names you've got ben haydad you've got the specific king northern kingdom you have names for the for the for elijah's servant gahazai with the whole story with namon what's interesting about this particular story it's told fairly generically and and i think that's because the it's it's told in a way that the characters are supposed to kind of be stock characters so the king of aram who is israel's rival to the north not yet the great world the great empire of assyria that's going to come down and destroy the king of aram was fighting with israel so he consulted with his officers saying my camp is at such and such a place then the man of god sent to the king of israel and again notice no names saying take care while crossing over to this place because the arameans are descending there so the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god said to him and warned him so that he was on guard there continually so basically what's happening is that as is common at this point in time there's kingdoms raid from each other and again this is a this is a this is basically the way normal life was throughout much of world history throughout many places in the world i was reading i was reading a book um blood and blood and thunder i should probably put that in throughout much of the world and even here in north america raiding cultures persisted you know well into the 19th century and here in this and here in this interesting book by hampton sides where he tells the story of karsin and the conquest of the west the navajo were continuing to raid on the another on other indian tribes around them and on the mexican settlers and then when the americans come in the americans have to try to figure out how to break this raiding culture and because this you know raiding was simply a a way that that people that people survived now the king of aram is unable to raid like he normally wants to and so he summoned his officers and demanded of them tell me which of you is on the side of the king of israel surely there must be a rat here because someone keeps leaking our plans none of us my lord the king well said one of his officers but elijah the prophet who is in israel tells the king of israel the very words you speak in your bedroom now again if we just have a peek into ancient near-east cultures you can see this in the book of daniel kings had wise men and the job of these wise men was to give intel and sometimes you could get intel from the stars so you look at astrology or or entrails of animals or or seers and and so elijah is famous for foreseeing and knowing and so well you know you can't you can't fight this nation because they always have intel ahead of you i think about the story of the allies cracking the german submarine code and you know if you can read if you can read the enemy's code you have a real advantage when it comes to this kind of thing especially with these raiding parties this is an all-out war at this point where where aram or the nation of syria is trying to capture and hold land they did that sometimes they'd hold a city here they'd hold a city there this is this is these are raiding parties looking to capture goods capture crops capture animals capture slave this is just basically the way the way life was but obviously a very hard life and a very difficult life you know then we can you know look at the vikings too i should probably put them in the slide now some of you might notice that i'm using a strange translation for this and this i chose to use this translation here because it tends to be a little literalistic and it drops it it uses some of the words that a lot of the more contemporary translations don't use because what i want to be able to demonstrate in this passage is is all of the all of the see look that happens throughout the passage then he said to them go and see where he is so i can send and capture him then he told him look he is in then then he was told to him look he is in dothan which is a town so they sent horses chariots and a pressing army there they arrived at night and surrounded the and and so what you have in this story is a lot of there's a lot of literary imagery about looking and darkness and light and so the king of aram descends down upon the town of dothan and and they've seen where elijah elijah is and look they're there and they come at night and the attendant of the man of god again no name here um arose early and went out and look the army was surrounding the city with horses and chariots and his servant said to him oh no my master what shall we do and he said don't be afraid for more are with us than are with them then elijah prayed and said oh yaweh please open his eyes that that he may see and yaweh opened his eyes of the servant and he saw and look the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around elijah now this is this is very interesting you can see the the symbolic nature of this story and you ask in the middle of all of these stories where many of them are getting into the nitty gritty of the of the failures of the king of israel how we have this story dropped in and this story where okay we're not going to pay attention to ahab or or any of the the bad kings of israel and and we're not going to draw attention to the the characters of the specific ben hay dads and and kings of the arameans we're going to tell a story here about well about what it's about seeing the story is about seeing and it's about elijah knowing everything that the enemy does and and you'll notice in fact here elijah is almost god they came down to him and elijah prayed to yaweh and said please strike this people with blindness and so he struck them with blindness according to the word of elijah now again i i actually expanded that out because even the translation i had hadn't expanded it out but again this is in a sense the center of the story where according to every metric of politics and and science of the day elijah should be captured and and the assumption is he'll be captured by the king of aram and he'll be he'll then become a weapon of war used against god's people israel but god won't let this happen and and in fact now the blindness is interesting because the word for blindness isn't the word normally used for just kind of regular old blindness it's it's more like a dazzling light or a or a deception um you know culturally we always can connect blindness with darkness but remember the other armies came in the darkness they're the armies of darkness and now it's the light it's the dazzling light that elijah asks the lord for and that's what takes over the situation then elijah said to them this is not the way and this is not the city and i can't help but think about that that scene in the original star wars these are not the drones you're looking for this is not the way and this is not the city come after me and i will bring you to the man you seek then he brought them to samaria now this is now this is very interesting and very deep because they're they're obviously seeking him but elijah's taking saying you're really not seeking me i'm i'm really not the focus here i'm really not the attention here now we might like the story better if you'd bring them to jerusalem but he brings them to samaria and again we don't have the evil king mentioned here and we don't have the the temple of baal that was built in samaria mentioned there well well what are these men really looking for well what are what are the raiders looking for what are what are they seeking for in this world they they want plunder they want wealth they want political power and in a sense elijah comes out and he dazzles them with light and says it's not me you're looking for you you really want the brass ring you want the gold star you want the golden crown let me take you to what you're seeking it happened at that moment they came to samaria elijah said oh lord open the eyes of those that they may see now now pay attention at first the kings of aram they come in the darkness and and they come in the darkness around the city and then the servant of elijah sees them but only with normal eyes and he's he's frightened because this is this is this is the way things are going we're going to be trapped and taken prisoner and he'll probably be killed because he's just a servant but elijah says no you have to see with other eyes and so then the the army is blinded and he brings them to samaria now he says okay open their eyes too that they may see well what are they going to see so yaweh opened their eyes and they saw and look the middle of samaria but they're a raiding party even an oppressive army a strong raiding party they're now in the middle of the city and the and the king of israel has had an opportunity to to handle the situation and so now they who wanted to take elijah prisoner are themselves prisoners and and so now we wonder how will the power of the lord be used how will the prophet reveal the lord what what will this mean for for regular life what will this mean for politics and technology what will this mean for for god's project now again the story is kind of lifted out of history and and everyone but elijah is given without names here then the king of israel said to elijah when he saw them shall i kill them shall i kill them my father and he said elijah said you shall not kill them would you kill those whom you took captive with the sword or the bow in other words will you use the power of god to kill your enemies put food and water before them that they may eat and drink and then go to their master so he made a great feast for them and they ate and drank and he sent them and they went to their master and the bands of arameans did not come again to the land of israel so you see this is here in the middle of this story of of decline where where we're thinking you know this is all just going to seed and and how can god do anything it's you have the story that's it's almost a fable it's kind of taken out of the rest of the story and said we're all paying attention to what's going on around us and we're all paying attention to the to the politics and to the technology and to the economy and to the things in my life and and maybe science is getting better and medicine is getting better but my health is getting worse because you know as you get older your health gets worse and and on and on and on we're paying attention to all of these things that we see and here elijah kind of plops into the middle of the story and says you need to open your eyes to a bigger world a bigger reality oh well that that sounds kind of nice pastor and i like when pastors make points like this because then i can have this moment and say oh well i just i just i just i just had a moment of inspiration or calm or peace because this is you know this is what you look for pastors to do when you're upset you say oh pastor make me feel better and you know pastors have kind of been displaced by psychologists and entertainment and music because pastors perhaps are not as reliable at making you feel better as as youtube or valium or a good bottle of something or a nice drug or a good therapist that can that can help you see but this is here is an image of shalom you know the the wars of this world this is you know again we're just set into normal place any place but where there's raiding culture and and you have these petty feudal insecure tyrants playing god but they're lousy gods they don't know that much they can't see very far and they're they're scrapping for the the meager spoils of this world and here you have god who is not at all threatened by these tyrannies and this this really bothers us because we feel very threatened by these tyrannies because look after all what we're talking about we're talking about raiding parties who come and rob and steal and enslave and and lord are you are you indifferent to this well god here isn't indifferent to this he's he's in a sense playing with them and saying you know if i'm not going to let you raid you're not going to be able to raid i can do things that you won't know and you will be feudal in all of the ambitions that you have but now with loving kindness he exposes our blindness and he exposes our power as impotence and and in a sense we have a swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks story here but now very quickly someone's gonna say now come on pastor you know this story i mean yeah this story kind of looks like a fable and it smells like a fable and and you're not going to put this over on me i believe it i know the real world the real world is not like this i think about steve martin's character in that movie the leap of faith you say the meek will inherit the earth but i but uh but i say all they can count on is the short end of the stick because that's the way this world is and in fact we know this now better than we ever have that if you're born into poverty you'll probably stay in poverty your parents won't raise you right and generation after generation after generation and and this world has so little power to actually turn it right what we have more power to do is distract and amuse and medicate ourselves so it just doesn't feel so bad but in terms of actually fixing this world can you really this is a religious fantasy god doesn't do miracles like this military political and economic power is real and wielded by tyrants every day i'd say the bible knows this i'd say god knows this now part of what goes on with elijah and elisha if you read the new testament you often hear that john the baptist well he's like elijah he's like elijah well that sets up the idea that well if john the baptist is like elijah who is elisha like and and theologians and bible readers have have picked this up for centuries and now so so now we might imagine that everyone is imagining that jesus will be like elisha and if the romans or the herodians or anybody comes down on on jesus then jesus will just blind them on on jesus then jesus will just blind them i'm not the man you're looking for and there's some of that in the gospel of john but in the gospel of matthew going at once to jesus judas his friend greetings rabbi and he kissed him jesus replied do what you came for friend then the man stepped forward seized jesus and arrested him with that one of jesus companions reached for his sword drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his ear which is exactly what we would imagine protect jesus with your swords defend him with your strength don't let anyone take jesus have a battle put your sword back into place jesus said to him for all who draw the sword will die by the sword do you think i cannot call on my father and he will not put at once my disposal more than 12 legions of angels well this is the story of elisha isn't it well why doesn't jesus call on the angels well why doesn't jesus blind them and and here's the crazy thing every time we see an angel show up you know everybody just hits the floor because this angel is so full of glory that that people are just so unnerved by it so you would imagine 12 legions of angels coming to jesus rescue and here's the thing in the story that jesus displays the kind of power that that the people around him really do believe this because one who could stop a storm can start a storm which is easier to raise the dead or to make someone dead if jesus has this kind of power why doesn't he use it to to even avoid his own arrest and then as the story plays out we'll try by pilot and you know pilot it's pretty clear from the story pilot is looking for an excuse not to crucify jesus and jesus won't give him one so it's like what's with you what's the point we we kind of want elisha and and the and the angels and and jesus says no no no go ahead there are two ways to expose the impotence of this world one is defeat as we saw in elisha and one is my defeat as you'll see in me well how do we respond to this what is the story about it's the story about jesus who gives himself why because he can't stop it or becomes because he becomes its victim now what does it mean that jesus doesn't stop it does it mean he doesn't care does it mean he can't or does it mean that in his case he looks around and says if anybody's blood is going to be shed it will be mine because throughout history it was always assumed that what being god meant was to have the privilege of avoiding pain and suffering and in the story jesus himself becomes our pain and suffering becomes the lamb who was slain becomes the sacrifice and he does so why for us now where does this lead us into the future you see right away we have the question how is jesus a better elisha because we look at this and say well we want we want we we want the old elisha because we want well we want security indemnity invulnerability when jesus comes and becomes vulnerable well how does this make us think about the future right track or wrong track well it's intended to make us think about the future because the question that we're being asked to focus on is is how the enemy is transformed you see what what we really want is that the enemy the arameans in this case are killed and and so when they draw swords in the garden this is really what peter is and the other disciples are looking for that we want our well-being at the expense of the oppressors and jesus comes and says that's not my revolution my revolution is very different the well-being of the oppressors at my expense but in a very special way because what i'm deeply interested in are the hearts and minds of the oppressors now you'll notice that elisha is like christ here in that the bands of arameans did not come again to the land of israel now maybe they didn't do so because they were afraid maybe they didn't do so because they thought their rating parties would be futile maybe they didn't do so because somehow they imagined that elisha was the biggest and best weapon but what the story points to is a shalom a peace a a pointer to the future but but even in that time they didn't dare imagine what it would look like jesus brings us to that place why did the aramean stop rating how can god make friends out of rebels because that's the situation of the world and then how can we participate in this new chapter of god now you might say again well i want the elisha method because i'd feel a lot better okay but jesus isn't willing to stop there well how do you know he's not willing to stop there because of what he did for his life well okay what does that mean well he's inviting you to do like him and you'd say well i don't know if i want to do that because i only live once ah now all the right track wrong track pros and cons positives and negatives now all the rubber hits the road and you might say well well jesus knew he would be raised well what does jesus say to you well he says that i will be raised with him if i die the death he died i will live the life and the resurrection that he gave so then you have to ask yourself do you believe it
