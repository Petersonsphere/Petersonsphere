 I was just rooted in the idea of faith and get your opinion of that because what had happened to me on my journey or not journey but just my phases of my life when I was an atheist and when I found my way back from atheism I Kind of was a disciple of people like Richard Dawkins I was a disciple of people like Sam Harris and both of whom I respect immensely and and have learned a lot from but what what had happened was this degradation of the word faith almost I feel like and to where it had been redefined or possibly Re-evaluated into a term that is associated with this this imaginary belief in non logically rooted thoughts and this this giving up of your Your your coherence to this deity or something a man in the sky or we're kind of something like that And I feel like you would be a great person kind of to ask on when you were take on faith because I started to Reframe the word faith to myself recently and kind of see it more as I had to have more faith almost as an atheist in Something I was faithful that the next day would come I was faithful that I would go to work and get paid I was faithful in something I was faithful in the acts of human beings to serve, you know to supersede my logos essentially and I think that was pretty detrimental to To kind of my understanding of religion and I wanted to get kind of your opinion on how you define faith So to speak and and how you see it and how you preach about faith. I think When when faith is defined as Attempting to know something for which you don't have evidence. That's a really lousy definition of faith I think at least faith in terms of what the Bible talks about has much more to do with trust now every time you get on an airplane you trust in an entire network of persons and usually netted together through institutions that everyone is going to do as they say and You have a competent pilot you have competent mechanics You have competent engineers that constructed the airplane you have competent business people that are running everything there's an entire network of trust of Individuals and institutions that you place your trust in to get on that airplane. Yeah now it's it's absolutely impossible to live without a level of even implicit trust That there isn't a tiger behind the bush that The people that with whom I'm sharing a home aren't secretly plotting, you know my death there's all sorts of things like that and And this is all these are all the faiths by which we live and So part of what happens in Christian faith is that a big part of I where I think the conversation Went wrong in the late 20th century sort of kicked off by the new atheists was on one hand God became a little bit too It's hard to say too because that that that's true a certain aspect of God that had already been Assumed and understood within Christianity was lost and that is sort of the the presence of God throughout the system and so whereas obviously I don't think it's unreasonable for someone to look at Evil in the world suffering in the world and say oh I've I've got some doubts. I've got some wonderings could this world in fact be run By a benevolent God. I don't I don't hold that thought against anyone given the given the The amount of suffering in the world If you sit down with that question long enough You then have to deal with the question What is the source of good in the world? Because on one hand there is a lot of suffering in the world But there's also a lot of good in the world And once you realize both of those things you're now sort of thrown back on The kinds of conversations that human beings have been having throughout their history is the is this world the product of two opposing Deities who are sort of duking it out together Deities who are sort of duking it out together. So is it sort of good versus evil? And once or is this world the product of let's say a gnostic cancer, which would be a substandard God who wasn't smart enough to sort of put the world together And you know, we should all aspire to an immaterial God Who will you know, once we are loosened from the confines of our decaying flesh then in in In now then being immaterial we can then like live as forms in some sort of platonic heaven, I mean People have been talking about these ideas for a very very long time trying to sort of puzzle out The way the world is so so over a long period of time and especially then through the the the teachings and the assertions and the resurrection of jesus and then his followers different answers about how the world is constructed came to be and Those things have been debated and pushed around and nuanced for for 2000 years now But much of it much of it winds up of course built on the the substructure of Of the old testament and the story of the hebraeus most of this You know the apostle paul, for example at the beginning of the book of romans says The righteous will live by faith. Well, what does that mean? Well in many ways to Continue to move forward with our stories Believing that let's say being itself is not evil And it's not nearly neutral which would sort of set up the two gods But being itself is good Oh, wow, then despite the evil despite the doubts despite the sufferings you move forward in faith and that's not functionally different from let's say Let's say you're a foreign missionary and instead of flying what you believe are all of these trust worthy first tier airlines you're going to get on Some little rickety airplane and you're going to look the pilot in the eye and say Are we going to make it the pilot's going to say? I think so but We we need to try and so you get on that plane and that in fact is faith And so what christian faith does is looks at all of these elements in many ways pinned by the resurrection of jesus christ to say All right. I've got my doubts There are certainly challenges out there It's not really a syllogism that i'm building up But i'm going to take on faith the witnesses to the resurrection the credibility of centuries of christians before me The credibility of my parents who taught this to me the credibility of the kinds of people in the church Who continued to convey this message that this is in fact how to move forward in this world? We do it by faith It doesn't mean I have all the answers. It doesn't mean i'm not going to suffer. It doesn't mean any of those things But faith is the posture by which we move into the future And I think that's what we mean it's not that we have No evidence. No, i've got plenty of evidence It's it's not that I have certainty the book of hebrews contrasts faith with sight I don't always have certainty sometimes. I feel certainty as a feeling but in fact many times in the world I decide Okay, i'm going to trust jesus and on behalf and because of that I'm going to do the kinds of things jesus did such as Loving my neighbor all the way up to and including my enemy That requires faith because often in this world loving your enemy Doesn't help you too much So that's that's the kind of thing that I believe christians believe faith is
