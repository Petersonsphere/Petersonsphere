 Hi, this is Paul. I hope you've been enjoying all the conversations that I've been posting lately I just haven't had time to make too much original content lately so when I do conversations if it's appropriate for public sharing and if everybody's willing then I share them and I've really enjoyed a number of the conversations that have been posting lately a lot of Interesting people have been willing to talk or wanting to talk and I've got more conversations on the way So I'm sure they'll keep coming this the conversations are actually a favorite part of the channel for me as I said to the as I said to the meetup last night that I'll talk about in a minute the I learned I Learned so much from all of you in the comments and the conversations It's this has been just one of the most intensely rich learning experiences of my life and In that vein we had a meetup last night in San Jose I'll talk a little bit about the Jordan Peterson Book tour event that happened and we had this meetup before the book tour a special thanks to the San Jose Christian Reformed Church who gave us a room to use and we had six of us drive down from Sacramento and I think five or six drove up from Fresno and Kyle and Erica came up from San Luis Obispo, and we had some new faces from the from the South Bay Area and And you get you might notice Nick over there in the corner Nick came over from Santa Cruz So it's it was just it it's just so much these meetings I don't know if there's much fun for everybody else But there's so much fun for me and so I meet I meet new friends there and we just spent two hours talking and the one of the comments from one of the Sacramento contingent that drove down was two hours is just not enough time because here in Sacramento we go four or five or six hours sometimes and we just talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk and Just just loving it all over the map and all kinds of different in all kinds of different areas wherever the conversations go just terrific conversations and Just had a terrific time at our meetup, but it that's at seven o'clock We had to break down the place and and clean up our mess so we could leave the you know be gracious Guests at the San Jose CRC and clear out of there and go to the event and so back to the event This was my third time going to one of these events the first time was that a an event in San Francisco before the book tour That that event didn't go so well the first one didn't the simulation event But then the second one was in June in Sacramento where I did the VIP line and got my picture taken and I talked about That and I talked about some of the content this this third one was another book tour talk and he Sort of gets up there and does his thing and and I think a lot about I've got a lot of mixed feelings about the book tour frankly because I wish like many other people that he'd do the biblical series But he's doing the book tour now, and that's what he's doing And he's getting up and he's trying to think about material for the new book as he talks about the old book He's he mentioned that it's I guess last night was one year since the release of 12 rules for life And it sold three million copies, which is really incredible It was seemed to be a sold-out crowd again there in San Jose Downtown San Jose I gave sort of a summary This was his first new talk of the year and gave the I guess the Zurich talk wasn't the same type of public talk Gave a summary of sort of summary of 12 rules for life and maps of meaning and a lot of the stuff that I've talked about In this video that that node has talked about in his channel a lot of recycled material in this talk It was interesting because after the talk we compared notes between some of us who came from Sacramento and Tyler who's in my group I'm trying to get some people from my group to do videos online with me, and they're oh, we're not ready We don't want to do this but these are these are super smart people and they have so many interesting ideas to share that I Just would like to share them with the rest of you well Tyler and I were kind of on one page and Joey was on another page and And Tyler and I kind of felt that there was more recycled material But Joey and Rick that thought that there was more new material So well well we can debate that a lot about the rats and the chimps and the wolves the heart of the lecture seemed to be that Morality which is obviously the big fight that's going on in our culture war right now Morality isn't arbitrary and that's why he goes through the rats and the chimps and the wolves that this stuff is built in from built in from Below that there is a moral order and this is where we get into natural law and where we get into Natural theology that stuff is built in from below and we can discern to a degree What is normative by what we can see in the animals in a sense beneath us And this also gets into Peterson's bigger issue that all this isn't simply arbitrary or socially Constructed that we're not going to escape this because this is this is how nature is built now for people who don't like Particular ways that things are built. It's kind of too bad This is the world that we have and we have the world that we have He talked to a few of new additions where he talked about the APA guidelines a bit and of course He he didn't like them and I actually thought his comments about the API guidelines were helpful that was something new that I hadn't heard him speak about and he Exposed some things in it that I thought were that I thought were really helpful And maybe I'll check my notes and go back into them another time I noticed towards the end of the speech when he got to his conclusion that Conscience came up again And if you've noticed from some of the other things that he's been releasing he's been talking more and more about conscience and so I think we're probably going to hear more and more about that in terms of well is You know, what is what is conscience? Where does it come from? And again from Peterson stuff? It will come from below and filter up to us and we should listen to our voice of conscience And if you don't listen to your voice of conscience, you know You can be Cain instead of Abel and so on and so forth So the main talk was it was it was pretty much what what you would expect now I had I Like I said, I haven't had a lot of time to make videos But I've been thinking about videos and one of the videos that I've kind of wanted to make I don't know if I'll make one is There's a is a treatment on Adam and sitch they did a live French sitch and a lot sitch and friended. I think it is where they had The new congresswoman AOC on the cover with her her college years dancing and Adam confesses why he wanted her on the cover in the in the live stream these their live streams go hours And so it was like a three-hour thing But I listened to all of it I listened to a lot of it a few times because I thought they had some good conversation about Jordan Peterson and and Adam Basically asserted and this didn't surprise me when Adam said it that Jordan Peterson is a more successful Jonathan Haidt in terms of the goal of reducing polarization and and Adam thought that this is in fact the center of Jordan Peterson's mission now in the hierarchy of what Jordan Peterson's mission is I'm not sure I agree with Adam I think I agreed a little bit more with sitch and that Jordan Peterson wants to help individuals and But figuring out exactly how Jordan Peterson's hierarchy with respect to these values is shaped is no simple thing Most of us don't even know how our own hierarchies are shaped with respect to these different things But one of the things that that both Tyler again Tyler and I we talked about this so kind of Joey and Rick from our meetup were on one side and Tyler and I were on the other side and and And Tyler mentioned too which I had noticed throughout the night that the big applause moments in the room were the tribal moments Almost always in in in the two both in June and now Dave Rubin's warm-up act often says things like we're winning and so right away when you frame it that way it's us versus them and If Peterson really wants to reduce polarization You really have to watch the us versus them talk and Jonathan Haidt is dead on right with this stuff that that religion binds and blinds and morality binds and blinds and and you strengthen your tribe by By pointing to those that are against you and if you're in a very blue state like like Silicon Valley San Jose and you go to a meeting like this you can feel like here We're the it's a very religious dynamic We're the we're the chosen few who see correctly and we're standing against the man you know it's very interesting because in a lot of ways the what I call progressive liberationism really Embody's this idea that they're always the underdog even when they win social competition after social competition and they seem to to always Carry the field but they're still always they need they need that big man to fight against you need that group to push Against because that keeps all your people together and and there's very much some of that same dynamic going on there and that that makes me uncomfortable because I know And then you might say well as a pastor don't you trade in this and I'm sure sometimes I do But I don't think we should and and the reason is you can you can gain a lot of group cohesion by pushing that button, but That button is the same thing you push when you're polarizing because it's us versus them and And there are a number of times that Peterson Said things which I thought You know this is this is this is sort of the angry bitter side of him that comes out sometimes The destruction of because all all what these people are looking for is the destruction of competence and virtue They can't find anything else because they can't find any other reason for why they're doing what they're doing and well I'm sympathetic to the fact that Competence should be if you're hiring in a business you should hire for competence And you look for the competent plumber he told the plumber story again, which I think is a great illustration Or a masseuse you look for a competent masseuse that that in fact It is Peterson is dead on right that it is a mischaracterization of our culture when we say that it's all just power and Peterson hit that point really really hard I I think I I think How to say this I I think I think those on the left Are are often sincere in in that they think they're Trying to bring justice But i'm not sure how How well their system is formed another video I haven't done was the was a video on Peter Rowlands Where he's brought in by this organization that was that was an organization spurned because Jordan Peterson wouldn't debate this one guy And so they have a bunch of videos out there There's not a lot of people that have that have watched them But i've got all kinds of thoughts on these videos and and i've been watching czik more because you know Peterson might talk to him and I know nothing about him So i've been watching the pervert's guide to cinema. I think that's the name of the movie So i've been trying to i've been spending some time trying to get into some of that stuff and understand how these okay So so let's say Peterson was in 2018 the big You know conversation was with sam harris maybe in 2019 It will be with csec and and some people on the left and so I want to understand these folks on the left and I think it was jess in my conversation about I often find this this this posture of protesting to be What what tends to happen is okay, so you protest you protest you protest and then suddenly you're given the keys to the kingdom What do you do? It is far easier to complain and protest than it is to govern and and leave And so I often find the left It's always easier to point out someone else's flaws than to actually do it right yourself And that's just a fact about a fact about human life. So I don't know that the left is against competence. I don't know how I think people are reacting because of a fashionable Spirit of morality now I I had a very interesting conversation today with a A young man from québec and i'll post that Tomorrow or the next day or next week sometime But but we got into the question of spirit and and some of the jonathan peugeot stuff that i've been talking about So i've got all of the stuff rummaging around in my head So I listened to the peterson conversation with all of those things and hopefully that's what you're hearing I've got all the stuff in my head and I want to get it out and that's what I do on my channel But I don't necessarily want to shortchange the conversations too much. So He's pretending it's the first time he's ever thought about whether or not he believes in god So it looks like he's a tormented Like moral man in chaos it triggers emotions in you that you want to protect him and you want to serve under him That's what I think It triggers emotions in you that you want to protect him and you want to serve under him That's what I felt because I felt like he you know heavy is the head that wears the crown So when I heard jordan peterson talk I put in all these I mind read him and put in all these thoughts He didn't specifically said and that made me convince myself. I wanted to serve under him So now i'm protecting you from also believing things that people don't specifically say But getting manipulated by their words, but you have to be forced to believe the opposite Well, see this is what It is what jordan peterson doing Unethical because I think there is an argument to be made that what he is doing is unethical even though I don't I don't think what he's doing is unethical like I don't necessarily know how you do what he's trying like how do you battle political? polarization without Doing something similar to what jordan peterson is doing. I don't know if I agree with you that that I I view I think jonathan height Is trying to battle political polarization. I don't agree that that's what jordan peterson is trying to really really Yeah, I think jordan peterson is trying to do is he's concerned with with helping people through self-help programs and stopping the tide Of what he views is neo-marxism I think that's his primary concerns, but don't you think he sees the the radical left as a pathology? An ideological pathology and that plays that is part of the political like political polarization is a part of that Right, but what I what I mean is that like if you look at height, he's very careful to try to not Push people away like that's how you fight polarization. You have to be kind of like this nice Nice guy. I'm trying to tell you you're wrong about being like a fucking, you know without saying fuck you Okay So this is this is where we're going to talk strategy because I often see height as an ineffective peterson I well depends. Okay, it depends what you mean. It depends what the goals are as I think height is more effective at possibly getting People on the left to come to his side, but I think peterson is more effective at Martialing a force behind him that already agrees with him I think height I think height makes If height is trying to do is trying to battle political polarization As you say, I think he makes clumsy mistakes Well, he's only human Yeah, yeah, obviously but This you how can you attack height? He's like your savior. He's your number one boy. What are you doing? What are you doing? Well, I first of all, I i'm not in love with jonathan height Okay We know we all know everyone here in the chat knows that if you bought an aoc waifu pillow cover You'd have to take off the jonathan height one first replace it. Come on I jonathan height I am in love with jonathan height's Research like it's the it's the it is what jonathan height has brought to the world as far as Understanding that is that's what i'm in love with it's like height like Height is not as big bushy eyebrows, huh? No, no, you know, you want to stare so I I do agree with you that height is is fighting political polarization, but I mean, this is a question that I have about This is a question that I have about how the strategy to fight political polarization because if you don't have Any kind of cultural impact you can't fight anything, right? And the only way I don't know if I agree with that Okay, you know, how do you fight behind the scenes right that that change things and influence things? And that and height is definitely working in that direction. I think scott adams is working in that direction as well No scott adams is very not behind the scenes. What do you you don't think so? No, I mean he might be doing things behind the scenes, but I mean he's very He's very you know people really don't like like he's very out there Yeah, everyone knows where he stands Yes, but I think he is counseling people behind the scenes Yeah height height and and And scott adams share the same philosophy They're both social intuitionists, right you realize that you know what social intuition ism is Yes Just for the people who don't know what social intuition ism is. Yeah. I know the police are coming for me They're wizards They knew they knew you were spilling all of jonathan height's secrets. We got a wizard over here to protect you so social intuition ism is the idea that people are Largely driven by emotions and that they deploy their reasoning to just justify their emotional Intuitions as height would put it and scott adams believes the same thing he taught always talks about being a A hypnotist he realizes everyone is irrational. They think that they're rational, but they are completely irrational I I believe that as well But the if you believe that you become you tend to become more rational. Do you do you have? We'll see we'll see what I can get out there's a patreon update Um, you know, I i'm with jonathan pageau on when he said we'll have this thing out before christmas I thought I'd really doubt it now. They're talking months and part of me is afraid that you know ruben and when peterson have the have sufficient resources to kind of set up their own thing and and peterson put up this donation thing on his page And you know, I looked at that and thought well, I could maybe do something like that, but I don't know I'm i'm really thinking more about what it would take to build a platform that Talking about platform for me as it would be for peterson forces me to think about what's what's my goal with this? because a big part of my goal for making videos was just to To talk out loud and process things and get good feedback Which has happened and to find new interesting conversation partners and that has happened And to help people who Because of jordan peterson want to explore the christian faith that's happening in my videos. So Those are my goals. And so then I think well, what's sustainability look like? I wrestle with that. I'm you know, my day job is i'm a pastor and my church has been very supportive of this they've seen it as a as a ministry of sorts and So i'm i'm still sorting all of this stuff out So, I don't know I'm really interested to see what what jordan peterson comes out with in terms of a platform platforms are really hard He also said some interesting things about free speech because again, it's one thing to To carp at one group about free speech. It's another thing to manage it and he talked about You know, so he was talking to people who were running some large social media platforms and they talked about You know one organization figured out that they were being used by isis and terrorists and They didn't want to be used by them. So then they exclude them Well, so if you're not going to allow that speech What's the speech next to that speech and then speech next to that speech and so on and so forth? So so peterson is very much wrestling with His fame and wrestling with his commitments and wrestling with his ideas and doing things like this are is really really hard And so then he said well, maybe our platform won't be Absolute free speech maybe just what's legal speech in the u.s Or some standard like that. So so again it was it was peterson wrestling with The the realities that that building things is hard And and this came up esther sent me this a link to this Subreddit this in the jordan peterson subreddit Topher keen topher and i've had a couple of conversations and he apparently had applied to this actin mba fellowship And was accepted but then began asking pretty specific questions, which I think If I were him, this is what you do if you're a competent adult with responsibilities To to say, okay. Well So you say that jordan peterson is going to be involved in this mba program. Can you give me more details how? How much time will he be there because I completely understand topher's reluctance and questions and So here's a school that's offering an mba and they just know boy if they get jordan peterson's name on this thing then And and what exactly is that relationship and how does this work? Those are all really good questions And if someone's going to give years of their life and and tens of thousand dollars of money for the program and or debt You're right to ask hard programs. And so The that reddit kind of there's there's a lot of stuff in that reddit. I've I found it interesting. And of course, i've had a couple conversations with topher and and from everything i've seen of topher he's a he's a He's an upstanding guy who's who's trying to you know, do the right thing. And so I'll put a link to that conversation in in the notes, but my you know my posture With a lot of these kinds of things is kind of my tree beard posture. Don't be hasty Read it consider it think about it be patient Give time You know, let let peterson weigh in, you know Obviously if you're on the bubble there and you have to make a decision you have to act yes or no so then you make your choice and I think topher is right in terms of bringing this out and saying hey if if i'm going to dedicate dedicate a lot of my time i'm Kind of would like to know where this stacks up in jordan peterson's hierarchy of priorities Peterson his life changed dramatically over the last two years and to figure out Who to talk to how to talk where to go where to spend your time all the money coming in, I mean I You know, I struggle. I have a tiny little youtube 10 000 now, um, so it's not tiny little but it's little in my Terms and I have this little thing that i've been doing for a year and I struggle to figure out priorities and try not to shortchange the church and try to Do the right thing and you know, i'm still figuring out where this goes So I I try not to be hasty on any front and to and to speak and to listen and to consider and to try not to get too inflammatory and Try to debate issues and not people and so on and so forth. So so that's out there So welcome to 2019 and there'll be more meetups and I we talked to the fresno people and maybe We'll do one down in fresno because you know some coming in from san luis abispo and other places They can they can make it to fresno a little bit easier. And so we'll do more meetups. We'll do our sacramento meetups I'll there'll be more conversations Hopefully figure out a platform post patreon And I am heading to australia to do a conference in melbourne about jordan peterson in march 30 and there should be More I bought the plane tickets. I didn't want to announce it till I had the plane ticket So I bought the plane ticket so i'm going So more information on that as it comes out This has been something that's been in the works for a few months a lot of people have You know, i'd really love to do something with jonathan peugeot this year. Maybe a live thing with him here in sacramento. That's hopefully that's a possibility so Who knows what's coming in 2019? But We'll see So thanks for watching. Thanks for commenting. Thanks for supporting those of you who are supporting this financially. I Again that blows me away You're smart to do it I remember before I set up patreon. I didn't and I set up patreon in like may and I thought You know, why should I do this? But after I started getting supporting it's kind of like oh now I feel kind of an obligation to To continue to do this. I probably would have kept doing it anyway because it's just fun to do but It then it also provides more opportunities for thinking about you know Well, what does ministry look like ford if I wasn't quite so dependent financially on living stones could I free living stones up from you know some of their Obligations towards me and maybe bring in other staff and help the church in other ways or You know, I just always thinking about new things. So Yeah, leave a comment. Let me know what you think only 21 minutes. Sorry julian. Sometimes that's what I got
