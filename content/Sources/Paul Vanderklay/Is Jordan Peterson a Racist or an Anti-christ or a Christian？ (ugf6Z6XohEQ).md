 Hi, this is Paul. I spent yesterday out on the road and there are a couple articles that came at me this morning and Wanted to talk about them a little bit as many of you know There's a the next big Jordan Peterson fight and he seems to with each fight emerge unscathed or at least in a better shape, but this is a big one regarding this article in the New York Review of Books and the At Issue is his relationship with his friend who he's talked about in a number of the lectures and he talks about in his book 12 rules for meaning and there was a big well the The dust-up came with a New York Review of Books piece and then Jordan Peterson's pretty angry tweets in Response to it and then this this morning some a number of people Pointed my attention to the walrus piece and in that walrus piece Senator Murray Sinclair, First Nation Senator and former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Tweeted in reply Jordan Peterson is a racist. Are we really surprised now? It's it's It's helpful in moments like this to slow down and read and look at things and And look at things clearly because what we are What we are and Peterson talks about this a lot we are biologically Disposed to react and respond and and these reactions and responses are built into us usually because we have to We have to survive and so our systems react and boom off we go and I'm gonna defend them. I'm gonna hate them and on and on we go Well, let's let's back up a little bit and ask ourselves this question. What's the difference between these two statements? Canadian Senator Murray Sinclair calls Jordan Peterson a racist now It's it's really helpful and important if you want to understand our present cultural conversations Look at what the author found as relevant for the conversation here. He's a First Nation Senator I don't know exactly what he means by that in terms of is he ethnically that is he from a different? Ethnically that is he from a district in other words as you keep Heightening the resolution more and more things come out I don't know him personally Jordan He probably doesn't know Jordan Peterson personally the vast majority of people reading the articles don't know him personally But this this tags then into the far larger narrative and the far larger Ethical assumed ethical system of how this is supposed to work So in other words if a First Nations person, however, we want to define that term Makes a judgment about Jordan Peterson that judgment suddenly holds more weight for us than if Paul VanderClaim makes that judgment as given my Complex ethnic background my complex social background, but because I'm distant from this this person who was closer Speaks with more authority His now now again, I'm gonna talk about the monarchical vision in this video He speaks with more authority and that's not a bad thing that in fact He speaks with more authority because we assume by certain aspects of his person now It's also noted that he's a senator. So he's of high status And he tweets a very low resolution judgment Jordan Peterson is a racist and so Canadian senator First Nations person calls Jordan Peterson a racist to say that says this judgment belongs to him But to just pull it back to the the larger view Jordan Peterson is a racist now We are making a categorical statement and this is where both in the science conversation and in the ethical Conversation we get into what I call a monarchical view now remember monarchical isn't It's it's connected to a king but Monarchy means one authority and that's obviously what a king is. There's one authority, but a monarchical view is in a sense Roughly synonymous with the Objective view and so what this would say is that Jordan B Peterson is a racist since the foundations of the world now if I put the language that way a bunch of you Calvinists or anti-Calvinists or Would would have to say whoa whoa whoa whoa wait wait, but I've always been from the foundation of the world now pay attention to the transgender comment if we talk about Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner has always been a woman even though many of us who grew up in the 70s saw Bruce win the gold medal and so this then is the stuff of of the conversation, but when we cast it in this light and the reason that the Caitlyn Jenner is always Caitlyn even though Caitlyn's mom and you can go back to those articles and find that basically says I don't know exactly what she says in terms of pronouns. She'll always be Bruce to me. He'll always be Bruce to me I don't know do what what do they do with all the Father's Day cards you received for years I mean and this is part of the conversation because you begin to say now wait a minute But it but it's important to take a step back and appreciate the monarchical vision that is implied by By how we talk and how we make judgments and how in fact we work in the world And so if we just say Jordan B Peterson is a racist According to a monarchical view. It's it's then somehow Called up into eternity Jordan B Peterson has been a racist since the foundations of the world And again some of you who understand have an understanding about Calvinism and conversations about election and predestination This the reason I phrase it this way is I want to give us some vision in terms of how language works and and the frames of reference How with which we use these statements There was never a time that Jordan B Peterson wasn't a racist. There's never been an action that made him or Made him one or made him free of the charge It must always be the case in every possible world that Jordan B Peterson is a racist And and it's so in a sense when you just say Jordan B Peterson is a racist Well, that's in a sense what you're saying according to this Monarchical vision and now a lot of people would pull back and say now wait a minute I I'm not so sure that let's let's take a look at the hierarchical vision I'll call you a racist Unless and until you say or do what I think you should do According to my worldview now, of course, that's implicit But we all understand that it's there and and so part of the game that we're playing in terms of a hierarchy Is that I'll undercut your status by labeling you a racist And so when you have a high status person such as a First Nation senator and again, I'm not exactly sure what that means Tweeting so going out in public and making this statement Jordan Jordan Peterson is a racist are we and the we is very important in that statement, too Because very quickly it's like This is this is this is a trick that we do with each other It's a it's a trick that we try to convince each other. Are we surprised in other words our Monarchical vision has been clear on him that Jordan B Peterson has been a racist since the foundations Of the earth I'll elevate your status and this is where we begin to pull back from this monarchical vision I'll elevate your status by absolving you of the sin of racism By your submitting to my vision of the world in other words There was a there was a funny video that I saw a little while ago about You know, does Al Sharpton need to come and meet with Jordan Peterson? And meet with Jordan Peterson and if Al Sharpton comes and meets with Jordan Peterson and declares him not a racist Well now he's not a racist. Well, maybe he's only racist against First Nations people and he's not racist against African American peoples and you know And then you have you know transgender people coming forward and saying those activists don't speak for me They speak for another You know who are they to speak for me so on and so forth. And of course Peterson has been Thrust into the public spotlight because of these issues But but again, it's important to step back and say okay What what are we actually saying when we're using these land this language? What game are we actually playing as we as we work through this now? Peterson fired back. He wrote a wrote a blog post. He added a lot of pictures now Now this is kind of this is kind of if you if you look at the post you'll see it's it's pretty much It's pretty much classic Peterson. He's got He walks through things and anybody who's read Peterson or listened to his videos Well, we'll find a lot of this, you know, this is classic quintessential Peterson I thought I found it interesting from again my my conversation about media That he wrote this because one of the things that is true Is that you you when you write you are able to consider your words more carefully? Than if you're shooting from the hip here on YouTube and and so he he chose his words carefully and so on and so forth but part of you know part of why he's getting tagged with this now is In a sense because of some of the statements that he's made for himself about himself He he chooses his words carefully and and now there's question about exactly What words has he chosen with respect to his relationship with this with particular with this particular First Nations tribe And this has come up in his you know His rule of life that set your house in perfect order and again by using the word perfect A lot of people have kind of kibbutz on that because it's like well Can we ever set our house in perfect order? And so in a sense with with a lot of the things Peterson has said he's kind of opened himself up For some of these charges. Hey, you're you're claiming Perfection you're you're saying you choose your words carefully and that then More or less sets Peterson up to to have to whoops sets Peterson up to have to defend himself and so, you know, that's where the pictures come into play because here we want to see things and Then he goes into a description about the ways that he's this man's friend and so on and so forth now those of you Who have been familiar with? Conversations about race for a long time You know, it's it's become before there were memes. It's become a meme You know my best friend so on and so forth is is a First Nations woodcarver And he's included me and his family in his box and he's given me A name and he's given my wife a name. So how dare you call me a racist and This is this is something that we naturally do now I think it's helpful to to to go back and to say to take a look at what we're actually doing in a sense what? democracy does in the in the wake of the Spectacism and I've talked about this in my in my last CS Lewis video this turning away from texts as Authority and we're looking, you know Newton looks to test things in the objective world What is what is gravity? I don't want to drop my phone because I'll break it and you all know how that goes So here is the so this is what we do and so in a sense democracy divinizes a process and so for all of the Political stuff that's going on currently in the United States, which is how to remarkably stable political system Political, you know instability goes on around the world But in a sense we divinize a system and so, you know we're in a sense in the United States dealing with this now and and so part of part of what goes into this is well, if we've divinized the system and if votes are important suddenly the court of public opinion is important and and the amount of Influence Jordan Peterson has his persona who he is in the public imagination is determined by public opinion so he takes to Twitter and he writes a blog post and then the question is whoever can convince the most people and or whoever can vent convince the people with the most status because here's here's part of the Difficulty of democracy that Peterson has has shined a light on which is that democracy likes to say that well, we're all equal But hierarchies have been around longer than trees and some are more equal than others. So your your most ardent egalitarian will point to senator Point to the First Nation senator and say aha. He declares Jordan Peterson a racist therefore He is a racist therefore from the foundations of the earth Jordan Peterson has been a racist And so we look for the people with the most status. We look for the people with the most important status in your Hierarchy in other words, this won't be heard by everyone equally So we will look at the news source. Is this in the New York Review of Books? Oh, even once you put New York in it for certain elements of the society. That's big-city liberalism You know if this is on Fox News in the United States then it's heard in a different thing So so you can see that all of these hierarchies are enormously complex But but yet our brains then I go back to Jonathan Haidt and the elephant in the rider our brains are amazing at processing these things near Instantaneously and and coming down to judgments now another It Jordan Peterson has been in Australia and so the Australians are all into this and and Someone whose article I spoke about in a previous video For you know, we've friended each other on Facebook and see even even the way I said that I didn't I don't want to We're all listening about status and hierarchy and and we're Extremely our brains and our senses and our minds are extremely well tuned to status and hierarchy That's one of the ironies of the the current debate that Peterson has has gone right to the center of it's that your most Arden egalitarian can only object and be an activist in the most Enduring way if they're if they are so fine-tuned to Hierarchies and they care about hierarchies if if you really didn't believe in hierarchies You wouldn't be out there protesting inequality because you would say you just don't care So in other words to care about equality so fervently means you actually participate in a hierarchy and see those things as Determining life in other words, you can't promote you can't protest racism unless you say racism is consequential And now you're going to try to have to demonstrate in what world? Racism won't be consequential in other words. You can't really get rid of hierarchy without acknowledging it and playing that game so Now this article comes out is Jordan Peterson the Antichrist now I will plead guilty to to looking for click Beatty Click Beatty Titles looking for status looking for attention. I I got to acknowledge Acknowledge I got to acknowledge the The smarts of this guy who did it and Nathan Campbell, you know I it's again you now as a Christian you're used to dealing with other Christians within your hierarchies and you're used to dealing with a certain degree of low resolution dogmatism coming out from certain Christian groups about all kinds of things and So when you see an art a title like that it certainly gets your attention and Because of my disposition towards Jordan Peterson, which should be evident to all who are watching my videos Oh, I don't like that. I'm going to read that. This is the nature of clickbait This is how it works now now Nathan immediately says no okay, the the clickbait has been deployed and he hooked me and And And in fact the person who sent this to me said, you know Just read the article because he had to because I might not even read the article based on the the title even though it hooks Me and he says no, but it's possible. He's an Antichrist and it's also possible that you are so don't jump up and down at me for being too judgmental Yeah, and and what I the comment I made in the Facebook Conversation that I was asked to participate into it said, you know This is kind of like saying, you know, your mama is the Antichrist and where I grew up, you know Your mama jokes were were we're all over the place. So What's with this? Well, it's in a sense the same game as Peterson and his relationship with this First Nations tribe and and so on and so forth We're all dealing with the hierarchy heel here and we're dealing with in a sense the hierarchical vision versus the monarchical vision And so this is a framed conversation you only care about this in terms of Antichrist if you're embedded socially religiously communally Hierarchically within a Christian context that's that's mostly true But the term also has a degree of value in the broader context as a semi satanic figure and that's in a sense What gives the gives the clickbait its strength that an Antichrist? Oh, are you saying Jordan Peterson is evil? Are you saying he's the devil? well so you see the racist conversation over here and the Antichrist conversation over there and And you understand how it goes now the article is actually a very good article I thought it he walks through some of you know What's behind this Antichrist comment in John and he talks about the you know, those who deny the resurrection and now we're getting into This is a big debate in New Testament scholarship how early Gnosticism goes and so some people suggest that the writer of the of the Epistle of John is engaging in proto Gnosticism and again my Conversations and Gnosticism in previous videos talking about Historical Gnosticism which had some Greek dualism now what's happening in our culture with respect to questions of how to regard the historicity of the resurrection I Don't think has much of anything to do with this ancient Gnosticism, but it has to do with far more contemporary Questions of knowledge and history and certainty and this is a these are issues that I've been talking about at length in a number of my videos But but again, this is again part of the stuff that Jordan Peterson has has been able to help me with and and as to Many of you will say yeah, but this is not original to Peterson and I'd say absolutely I totally get that but I've I've come to appreciate it by listening to Peterson in other words The stuff that I learned in college and high school in grade school and seminary and by reading books is seldom original to the person who gives it to me but I'm indebted to the person who gives it to me because it's been valuable and and this Perspective that we see tools you see from the moment you notice Jordan Peterson you formed a bias and again Thanks to Jonathan Haidt You know that elephant has a really quick brain and you see someone in that first impression You like them or you don't like them and there's countless stories of people falling in love at first sight There's something deep within us that looks at this person. It says yes That's the person for me or no, I can't stand that person right now Sacramento is beginning a journey into a Into a the the a long conversation about you know a shooting that just happened in the neighborhood by my church some police officers shot and killed a Young man who was trying to get into his home and again the what we're going to be doing is it's going to be playing out in the court of public opinions with all of the biases and all of the hierarchies and all of this stuff going on over on one hand and on the other hand Hopefully we'll be heightening the resolution and all of the things that the city has done in terms of Selecting who the mayor is selecting who the police chief is selecting whether or not to do body cameras selecting, you know Deciding whether or not to put the film out into public I mean this is this the city's system that it's set up for just such a Contingency will be tested and probably at the end of it refined and at the same time all of the conversations that we've had about race in America and about police violence in America and about gun laws in America and all of these things are going to come rushing in to this one situation and again now if you look at how the Pay attention now. We're getting back into Neil Postman. I don't have his book I'm working at home today Now we get back into Neil Postman and amusing ourselves to death now pay attention to how the story is framed in tiny low resolution four or five word headlines to get us to click and pay attention to the frame of a market driven commercially driven news media You know the the irony is that while the city police and the The black community and and all of these things are taking place the real winners in this are in effect the commercial Media and Google because everyone's going to be flooding to it and while we're flooding to it will also be seeing commercials And so at that at some point you you have to ask who who literally Profits from these tragedies and you'd have to say Well, there's some there's some things to think about in that but again to get back to my point for the moment We see someone we form a bias. We cannot live without biases We need biases the elephant beneath the rider Works on biases and has to live out of biases and and all of this Elephantine machinery that we have is in there too, you know, I feel scared. Why do I feel scared? Well the watchers back there. So now we're getting into the other the more You know the more Petersonian Jungian Anal Analysis, you know the watchers back there one of the watchers is saying, you know Be careful. Be careful. Stay safe. Keep your body safe. I mean all of this is at play This is Enormously complicated and enormously large and so a low resolution plus or minus which is binary It's about the lowest resolution there is yes. No on off like dislike a low resolution is a view of of whatever you think of Jordan Peterson and his impact of good at bad on the world and all of these articles are playing on it because Depending on where Jordan Peterson emerged he emerged about pronouns. Oh, he's he's resisting the application of pronouns Therefore he's a bigot therefore. He's a racist or he's resisting the application of pronouns. Therefore He's a good guy and he's on my side. He's on my team. He's in my tribe And again, it's it's interesting that this latest racist thing comes out of a context where for a long long time We've literally used the word tribe now if you go back and look at my Sunday school class last Sunday I mean try basically bring the word back it basically has kinship And so whether you know in what group in what box is Jordan Peterson? We regard Jordan Peterson as in now as a Christian this gets into all kinds of conversations about adoption in Christ This gets into conversations about marriage because people have long noted that that what marriage does is marriage is a way of turning a stranger into family and So again all of this stuff is nested in in all of these layers But but we are biases form and and that bias colors all of the other information that we receive and and prompts us to express judgments about him and I see this all the time now with my other conversations with people about Jordan Peterson because Immediately we we have if once you heard Jordan Peterson's name somewhere in the back of your mind you logged you know you you put a you you basically tagged him and then you put you began putting Notations on him and the first note was plus or minus good or bad and and every other piece of information then comes through that filter and And You know this is how we work and this is how we all work and And there's probably no other way that we can work in terms of dealing with such a complex world and again I am I am deeply indebted to Jordan Peterson and his lectures for opening my eyes to To this reality and not just opening my eyes to it But in a sense giving me language giving me a framework through which I can address it Now We should I want us to take a look at this monarchical vision I've talked about this in a full philosophical context now. I'm talking about it more in terms of a social and religious context I mean we act as if this monarchical vision exists just by saying Jordan Peterson is a racist Are we surprised and I added the nuance and this is this is why Jordan Peterson puts in pictures This is probably why we're gonna hear Jordan Peterson talk about this event on video, but You know he he dedicated, you know, he addressed it in writing this This is also the reason for example when we got together with our Jordan Peterson Meetup group all of the interest is is so often so quickly on conflict Well, because that's where we look for it. We're biologically Predisposed to look to conflict first because conflict is dangerous And so we're just set up set up this way but we we act as if the monarchical vision exists and we and and because in a sense, we can't live without it and We want it to exist now this gets into the vision of science We want it to exist and and in fact, we believe that we can regularly create hydrogen and oxygen And we can demonstrate this and so Despite, you know, you might have heard me before in some of my other videos. I'm not a skeptic about the monarchical vision I'm skeptical about humanities grasp on the monarchical vision because actually the monarchical vision if it's If it's at its height is its highest truest degree is true at every levels because the monarch can see all of the layers The monarch can see the hierarchical the monarch can see the social the monarch can see the subjective the monarch can see all of these things Now we want it to exist. The reason we want it to exist is because we are dependent upon it to exist publicly one to another I've got my subjective view, but very quickly as I pointed out in CS Lewis's chapter three The subjective view of the monarchical vision is the subjective view of the monarchical vision And the subjective view leaves me isolated. And so I know that there's a broader world out there whether or not I want my cell phone to work It will work or won't work. It will defy my it will defy my will and so will gets into this into this conversation So we act as if it exists. We want it to exist Now that's that's important and I'm not going to spend too much time on that but you have to kind of think that through And this is something that Lewis will get into as we get deeper into miracles and a number of others other Lewis's writing If you're if you're pantheistic vision if if in a sense your God is the sum of all things If your God can't in a sense step outside the sum of all things you you also lose the monarchical vision And this might historically be one of the reasons that science developed in within the cultural context where there was a cultural theological Monarchical vision that was well established and assumed in the community and and then that vision enabled us in a sense In Tolkien's words to be sub creators to create sub monarchical visions that helped make sense of the world Now if there is a being that has this monarchical vision we are distrustful and afraid of him Why are we distrustful and afraid of him and in fact I think the Bible talks about this and talks about the fear of the Lord being the beginning of wisdom Now what on earth does that mean? Why is it the fear of the Lord? Well if you posit a being that not only has the monarchical vision The capacity to see at every level but also the capacity to act at every level and now we're getting into So you've got omniscience, omni-potence, omni-potent not only can see at every level not only can act at every level Well suddenly we have a problem and we have a huge problem and actually if you look at Thomas Nagel in his book that I referenced to in my last video Nagel says I don't want there to be such a God well why don't I want there to be such a God because that God in my will are going to be in conflict And this is in a sense part of the story that is expressed in Genesis 3 where the man and the woman begin to realize this and have to sort this out And the way that they do it well there's conflict because what if my little sub-monarchical vision is in conflict with the greater monarchical vision Well now we've got a hierarchy thing now we've got a status conflict and so in a sense you know and Judaism or the Old Testament Other religious systems have seen this too that at some point if you're thinking about it the proper thing for the human will to do is submit to well to what? To things that are larger than us things that impinge on our lives now you might say well I'm going to smoke and eat McDonald's hamburgers I don't care what the doctor says Okay good luck with that we kind of know enough now that smoking and eating McDonald's every day might not be such a good idea if you really want to live a long time Maybe you don't want to live a long time and maybe you hate your life and you hate the world and you just want to go away from it Well smoking and eating at McDonald's every day I ate at McDonald's yesterday by the way so I'm not casting stones this probably isn't a good idea But then we have to ask the other question what if no being has the monarchical vision and this I think we get into some of the observations that Peterson has made Tyranny is an element of this because again if you listen to Peterson's talk about you know the top of your the top of your historical contemporary hierarchy if there's no if the president is not below the law or if the emperor is not below the god There are real problems because and because you can say to the emperor you must bow and in a sense in the Christian tradition and in the Old Testament tradition the prophet comes and says to the emperor or to the king your you you cannot get above God You must submit to God and if you don't submit to God it's not only going to be problems for you it's going to be problems for the whole nation because you stand in our place you are in a sense our federal representative and those of you know something about reformed theology That word federal is a complicated one but but if no being has a monarchical view if no being is omniscient if no being is omnipotent then tyranny develops because someone amongst us will act as if I possess the monarchical vision and use what I have ever I have to impose my vision on the world And this is in fact why in a sense we are a nation of laws what we're saying when we're saying that is in a sense we've we've demonized the process and so one of the most remarkable things about the American political system has been that has been that president step down Well every time a president steps down let's give the pragmatist their do that the president acts out I am below the law and every time there's a constitutional crisis and there's a lot of talk about that right now I saw Jordan Peterson on Bill O'Reilly and Bill O'Reilly says there's going to be a civil war I sure hope not but but this is this is the question do the people submit to the laws and now we might say well are they really following the laws or are those in power manipulating the laws and that then is a question about corruption but so tyranny if no being has it we're subject to tyranny And if no being has it if no one if there's finally no one that can say whether or not Jordan Peterson is a racist or rather not Jordan Peterson is the Antichrist or a Antichrist if there's no finally if there's not finally a judge and Stalin and Hitler and Mao slip off you know slip out of this world never having been called to account for the crimes that they've done Well what does that say about our action and again this has been some of my experience in talking to those who are rethinking their religious perspectives as a result of listening to Jordan Peterson that that that I think their watchers are beginning to understand the relationship between tyranny and nihilism and the idea that there is no monarchical vision Now again is Jordan Peterson a Christian I am not the judge of all things my term of choice has been agnostic but I when I say agnostic I don't mean atheist light which is a common way of using the term agnostic so again now we're into the same problem of the Antichrist conversation So Jordan Peterson is Jordan Peterson and as a Christian I say finally Jordan Peterson like every other one of us will someday stand before his maker and and be called to give an account for what we have done with whatever we've been given and will be judged accordingly and that then gets into a whole longer theological conversation But the implication that if there is you know I think again Peterson within his epistemological Darwinian box wants to be very careful about speaking about divine ontology and again we'll have to these are going to continue to be the kind of topics that I wrestle with as I as I wrestle with Jordan Peterson and the implication What what a sense Peterson is saying is if you don't even have the idea the public idea of this of this sum of all hierarchies the public idea of this monarchical vision you start to lose social cohesion you start to lose right and wrong you start to lose even science This monarchical vision this this this imaginary or real vision that there is this is kind of where pragmatism and realism meet perhaps that there is this order out there and that it can in fact be within our own limited human frames seen to a degree and asserted and embraced publicly Without this all things break down and and that's where I get to the point of saying okay now if you believe that's true in theory if you're a good pragmatist you should probably act it out and this is where Jordan Peterson goes with his act as if okay well if you're going to act as if these things are true if you're going to act as if there is a being that possesses the monarchical system And if you're going to act as if whether or not a certain senator says Jordan Peterson is a racist that means nothing compared to what this audience of one the monarchical vision sees Jordan Peterson as that that the most important question is you know not what I think or what you think sir or how we pass judgment but what he is And that there is in fact an is this that that is real and and gripping amongst us well that's finally the most important question because now we're getting down into Pascal's wager to say what is real and to say if I can't say this if I can only say good enough is good enough ever really good enough Or must I be pressed to the wall and say I believe in a being that views the world and you might say well Paul you're you're you're talking people into theism well okay Christianity is a subgroup of theism CS Lewis first stopped at theism before he came to Christianity because once you once you once you go through the theist door then you have to ask yourself Well I have a burden to get to know this this God and and this is this is part of my process to understand the world and and I'll hazard I'll go through the epistomize epistemological hazard of being wrong because my judgments are always my own but but if no being has it and I think this is where Peterson says You're going to lot fall into tyranny or you're going to fall into nihilism and this is where I begin to get into my Calvinism because all of the evils of the world are in me and if someone comes to me and says Vander clay you're a bigot now I could you know haul out my you know I this is where I grew up and this is who my friends are and these are the people who go to my church and and you say I'm a bigot but here we've got these people of of different categories or different identities and identities that will that will vouch for me but none of that finally matters because deep in my heart I know I'm a bigot deep in my heart I know I have biases I I can't help but form biases and I can't live without biases that now do I want to judge people on the color of their skin instead of the content of their character well I should pull back from that and say I should be a little careful about my judgments entirely but at the same time I need to judge I need to make evaluations the elephant is going to make it and and I need to and that's a way that we live in this fallen broken world so as a Calvinist to say you're a bigot say of course I'm a bigot I'm a whole lot more all of the evils of the world are in me at least in potential and and so one of the things I was struck with and attracted to Peterson you know my little my little biases when when when I would hear those kinds of things coming out of his mouth I'd say well here's someone that I think could understand my Calvinism and could understand where I'm coming from because I I'm whereas I would love to it's instinctive to to defend myself and get defensive against charges and it may in fact be wise and practical to do so sometime those defenses finally don't really matter that much the evil I do is usually not as bad as it could be and so my evil is not is not archetypal I am not an archetype I am a human being and so I'm full of all the compromises of history and humanity and biology and existence and nowness and all of these things so all the evils are in me at least in potential but the evil I do is usually not as bad as it could be and and I could but I can also do nothing purely good I've always got motivations and and there are always ways in which I can't see the ends of it and this is in a sense why I kind of like Peterson's definition of his pragmatic truth because you know we we look back now at antebellum slavery and say how all those those slave owners were so evil and and the judgments of history will be on them there's another little proxy we use of God universe or the judgments of history these are proxies for the monarchical vision and for and for and proxies for God well guess what 200 years from now how are they going to judge me for burning up fossil fuels and putting CO2 in the atmosphere just to go to the store or watch a movie or just to cross the country because I want to look at some great hole in the ground called the Grand Canyon are they going to look at me and say you're just like all those people who killed the whale so you could have a little lamp that burned at night you're just like all those people that that supported Hitler or didn't say no to Stalin or went along with now or well here we are here we are we're we're we're all in this mess and so I can I can defend myself and maybe some people will will vindicate me and declare me to be righteous but all of my arguments of self-righteousness are you know won't finally convince others so what should I do finally I stand before a judge of one and and in terms of what I think I'm not going to have you know that the things I bring before him I'm he's not going to find convincing my good is an archetypal I can't defend myself against a holy God well here's my hope that that the only one with the true monarchical vision is also good and the truth is if that one is evil well then then there's no point to this entire game and and then there's also no escape from it if you want to read an interesting essay go back and find Kierkegaard's essay on despair where the you know the man in despair kills himself only to discover suicide didn't do it you just you just sped up the tape a little bit so so now not only do you have to answer for all the miserable things you've done in life now you also have to answer for throwing away the gift of life that was given to you and I'm not trying to make a statement about suicide at this point but I'm just trying to make a statement about suicide at this point in terms of that suicide people who commit suicide go to hell I'm not saying that in any way I'm saying that in Kierkegaard's essay you know despair is turtles all the way down and finally if God isn't good well there's there's no hope for anything and he is but I believe again as a Christian that he has shown his goodness towards me us in the work of Christ and first question and answer for the Heideberg Gattacism I am not my own but belong body and soul and life and death to my faithful saver Jesus Christ who has fully paid for all my sins with his precious blood that God out of complete generosity extends himself sacrificially for my welfare and grace is my well-being at his expense and he will finally resolve the injustices of the of history with true justice and that's the difficulty that none of us has a sufficiently monarchical vision to finally bring forth justice on the earth nor even even judge rightly between us and this again is why if you read in the Bible all the way back into the adjust judge you know vengeance is mine says the Lord I will repay and why he says that is because you're bad at it you're really bad at justice you're you're really bad at at at at setting the world right and this is part I think of of what we're seeing in terms of the conversation everybody well this is justice is it are you so sure you know one of the things I thought of recently was well okay let's everyone wants to use I for an eye tit for tat reciprocity this will be this will be our this will be how we will establish justice okay so baseball was segregated for how long let's re segregate baseball now nobody who is white can play baseball for the next however long you want to call it for however many years baseball was was segregated in the first place will this bring us justice well well right away what would happen well you know the the the the re segregated people of color baseball league would be one heck of a league because the Dominicans would be there ah but the Dominicans see see there's here's where as many of you know I was a missionary in the Dominican Republic I grew up in Patterson New Jersey the race conversation has been with him has been with me my whole life you go down into the Dominican Republic and you start talking about black and white and you realize the conversation is wholly different in the Dominican Republic a lot of you Dominican comes to the United States and you say you're black and that Dominican is offended says I'm not black I'm Indio or school I'm you know I'm I'm more Indian color I'm not black Haitians are black and now I worked with Haitians in the Dominican Republic and I saw how many Dominicans how would talk about Haitians and and you know on and on and on and on can we set the world to rights and and finally as a Christian part of what Christian theology says is no we need a God who will do so and you might say well okay theoretically I can fully understand your statement that we need a God to do so because there is no single human being that can finally establish justice or see justice or describe justice perfectly enough to satisfy the evils of this world so we need that monarchical vision and so we have that monarchical vision as an idea but finally we can't know or we can't believe that that monarchical idea will ever come into being talking eschatology or or be finally true at every layer and so we're again we're getting into Good Friday and Easter and one of the remarkable things about the biblical story is that the stories of Good Friday are are told with a lot of symbols of symbolism Jesus crucifixion that you know all of the Old Testament Day of the Lord stuff there's an earthquake tombs are open the sky goes dark the sun doesn't shine this is all day of the Lord imagery out of the Old Testament and and if you want to get into the debate about what happened on Good Friday if there's eclipse go have at it when you get to the accounts of the Resurrection they are remarkably unembellished and this is where if you read NT Wright's huge book again I'm I don't have the book at hand because it's in my office. He'd empty writes huge book about the resurrection. What the resurrection accounts seem to represent is the pure eyewitness phenomenological accounts from the people closest to it. They're not embellished with the symbolism of the Old Testament. They're not embellished with theology. They're strictly phenomenological and they don't quite agree, which is exactly what you would expect from, well, again, look into the Sacramento shooting that happened and you've got the police body camera and you've got the helicopter video and you're gonna have eyewitness accounts and you're gonna have views of this young man's life and right away people are going to be judging him. Was he a good person? Was he a bad person? All of this is going to come into play in search of a monarchical vision. So I saw, for example, the Washington Post piece and I tried to put the helicopter video and the police camera video together and the thing is once you see that, you begin to recognize we don't have enough cameras and in fact, then you'll see the pictures that are taken of the grief-sticking grandma at the window and so there's that view and there's the son's view and then the mother of his children's view and the children's view and the neighbor's view and the views of white people and the views of black people and the views of family members and the views of his close friends who were probably white or Hispanic or Asian because this is a very integrated city in the United States and all of us are in the midst of all of us. There's no dominant ethnic group in this neighborhood and so there's no monarchical vision and so there's no one who is capable of seeing it all and so you can say, okay, we just need the idea of this monarchical vision but we can't talk about its final culmination and that is where the resurrection of Jesus comes in because what the Christian vision says is the final culmination comes down to this one thing which is why in a sense, all Jordan Peterson conversations will roll downhill to the question of the resurrection and why this keeps happening in Christianity and why the entire Christian framework of belief keeps revolving around the resurrection because the truest monarchical vision has to be the vision at every level. It has to take into account the physical, the biological, the hierarchical, the subjective. Every layer that can be, if there isn't someone, I get excited and my throat can't finally take it. I get excited and my throat can't finally take it. If there isn't finally, if reality, even to the degree that we can see it and we have to believe there's far more than we can see, if reality, even to the degree that we can see it, doesn't finally hold together in terms of will, in terms of every layer possible, well, what are you left with? And this is again why I'm a Christian. It's, I think it's simply better to believe. Are there problems with that? Oh yeah, there's lots of problems with it. And we're really good at seeing the problems. Are there problems living it? Oh yeah, there's problems living it. It's hard to live, life is hard. But we already know life is hard. So again, this is why I'm a Christian. And this is why to me, the way it most makes sense is to have this fully integrated and to believe that finally this monarchical vision that our hearts instinctively long for is finally true. But then how to live? Well, be careful with judgment. Know that the judgments you express are your own. Senator so-and-so says Jordan Peterson's a racist. Yeah, he's subject, he's, you know, he's got a right to his opinion as we say. Well, even if you pull that statement apart, you'll see something. Jesus says we will be held to the same judgments that we hold others to. And I dealt with this in my last two Sunday school classes on the book of Ezekiel about how in the book of Ezekiel, God judges the surrounding nations around Judah after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom and the Southern Kingdom by the Assyrians and the Babylonians, not on the standard that he held Israel to, but even on kinship standards. Standards they would hold themselves to. And there's this neat little, I mean, imagine if you will, that God is like a sneaky ISP and put an app on your phone that every time you express a judgment about someone else, your phone would turn on and record it. And so then, you know, you die, you stand before God's throne and God says, all right, let's see how you did. And you say, hey, wait a minute, I didn't have enough. I didn't have, I didn't know there was gonna be this test and I didn't prepare for it. And God says, okay, no problem. You weren't sure, information was unclear, there's religious pluralism, you weren't quite sure what you wanted to do, no problem. I won't hold you to any other standard, but the standard you held other people to. How would you do? I think if you have any degree of self-awareness, that judgment day would give you pause. It certainly gives me pause because as a preacher, then the Bible says, you know, be careful those of you who teach because you will be held to a higher standard. Even if you assume this standard, you know, Jordan Peterson says lying preachers, yeah, this vocation causes us to lie and be hypocrites because we promote a standard that we ourselves can't keep. And so every time that you see a preacher stumble or fall, you know, have a little mercy because we are natural born hypocrites. So be careful with your judgments. If God is judge and Christ is savior, you are released from trying to be both. Yesterday, you know, I've got this, looking forward to this conversation with Peterson, see if it happens coming up in early April. And so I'm rushing through his book because I want to finish the book before I talk to him. But at the same time, I always read way too many books at the same time. I'm also going through How to Think by Alan Jacobs and I'm really enjoying it. And actually in a lot of ways, this is kind of a parallel book to Peterson's 12 rules for life. Jacobs and Peterson are talking about a lot of the same things. And then I heard this paragraph and this was, let's see, I just forgot which, one of the paragraphs I listened to yesterday was be precise in your speech. And I thought it was a good paragraph or a good chapter. And one of the things I really enjoyed about the chapter was, oops, what I enjoyed about the chapter was, boy, Peterson's really good at lists. And he's really good at seeing all of the different things that are impinging on us and the ways that we go wrong. And he's really good at not, he's really good at exposing the simplistic assumptions that we have. And I think that's part of the reason he's been so helpful to me. But that chapter I think was parallel in some ways to this chapter where Jacobs is dealing with the inner ring and dealing with why is it that we can get together and get along with each other across lines? And we've got all of these judgments going on at the same time. And he's talking about a scrutin, who's another book that I've started to read. To this I attitude scrutin contrast, the we attitude, not the most felicitous phrasing, I think, but the contrast is valuable. The genuine we recognizes limits and constraints, boundaries that we cannot transgress and that create the frame that gives meaning to our lives. Moreover, it stands back from the goals of the I, and this is where we resist tyranny and resist trying to be being tyrannical ourselves, is prepared to renounce its purposes, however precious for the sake of long-term benefits of love and friendship. It takes a negotiating posture towards the other and seeks to share not goals, but constraints. It is finite in ambitions and easily deflected, and it is prepared to trade increases in power and scope for the most rewarding goods of social affection. What I find especially fascinating about this passage is the way it links the preference for love and friendship with negotiating posture towards others. And again, if you read Peterson's speak with precision rule, it's all about negotiation. We need to negotiate with one another. And negotiation is something that we are left with because the monarchical vision is finally beyond us. And so we have our sub-monarchical visions, but this is what we're left with. And so what Alan Jacobs in his book is saying is that the negotiations in certain hierarchical systems have to stand along other ones. And so we have to moderate them and modulate them according to relationships. And we've seen these conversations in PIN. So let's say your father was a racist. Okay, daddy's a racist. Is he still your daddy? What are you gonna do with that relationship with him as a daddy? Well, maybe he's a racist, but maybe he was also a good father. Okay, so what do you do with him? Do you kill him? Do you put him with all the other bigots? Do you ostracize him? Do you never go over there for dinner? How are you gonna deal with dad or grandma or great-grandpa or great-great-grandpa owned slaves? And you inherited a family fortune based on the misery, the sweat, as Abraham Lincoln said, the bread derived from the sweat of other men's brows. What do you do with that? How do you separate that? Well, it's really hard. Scrutin believes that if we're less concerned with ruling the world than with having a secure place to enjoy the goods of social affection, then we'll be more likely to treat generously others who want to enjoy those same goods, even if those people are very different from us in both belief and practice. Now, if you read, Jacobs continues to flesh that out in that chapter with some good yeah-buts and so on and so forth. But both sides of the culture war have been playing this game. I'm old enough to remember 20, 30 years ago, don't judge me and I'm free to do what I want. And that was kind of a left-wing thing. And the right was like, no, there's gotta be order. Now the left with their moral supremacy and their ascending narrative has said, no, there's gotta be order. And we're going to establish the order. And so, Jordan Peterson is a racist and therefore don't listen to him, de-platform him. Okay, can you still be his friend? What if he's your father? What if he's your grandfather? What if he's your neighbor? I say, well, he's been befriended. He's got this friend who really believes in him and has in fact gone through a very expensive and intricate ceremony to embrace him as part of his family. Well, that's certainly a step up from saying, yeah, the guy lives next door and I eat over at his house. Well, they've had a ceremony. Well, now we're getting into the question of why is there ceremony? And for those of you wondering about church, why do churches have these ceremonies? Why do churches have these boundaries, these borders? So in a sense to give Jordan Peterson and his wife names from their people, well, that's a hugely significant exchange. Well, is he a racist? Well, as a Calvinist, I'd say, yeah. And so are all the rest of us. We're all racists. We're all bigots. We're all haters. To hate is to be human. And now we're not all as hateful as we could be and thank God for that. But we're not as loving as we could be either. And it's enormously complicated. So where does that leave us? Well, it leaves me believing and hoping that there is one who can finally sort all this out. And so what Jacobs here says is that, what you have to do in a sense is pull back from not only being, imagining you're the center of the world and acting that out, but trying to enforce that on others. And I think that's right. And if in fact, so let's say, well, there's this thought hierarchy. There's a thought person with a monarchical vision. And so we're going to instantiate that in the law and we're gonna hold the president or the prime minister to the law. And that's gonna keep us safe. Yeah, but politics is the game of, are you really obeying by the law? None of that finally holds us to. So you might say, wow, you Christians, it's wishful thinking. You believe in a monarchical vision. And so you project one up there and you say, okay. The pragmatist says, well, we kind of need to imagine there's one and to agree on one, at least in practice. Otherwise the system falls apart. Okay, but can we really convince ourselves of that game? And this is where we get into the question of naive belief and where you get into the question that the reality that these naive systems of people, the fundamentalists or ancient people who believe there really was a God, these naive systems worked better because they really believed it. Can you really work with this imagined monarchical vision if you say it's just an idea? I don't think you can trick yourself that way. You say, well, I'm not ready to believe it, but I think I should believe it. Well, then forgive my unbelief. Well, how should you talk to the psychologist? How should you then act if you think you should believe it, but don't quite believe it, act as if it's true. And the more you act that way, the more you will actually believe it. And you say, well, how do I, what do I need to do to begin to act that way? Well, you get around people who actually do believe it. Well, what do those people do? Well, those people act as if it's true. Well, if you act as if there's a monarchical vision and a being who holds it, well, what do you do on Sunday? You go to church and you pray and you give gifts and you worship and you fellowship. And then you have to say, well, why did the church develop? Because people believed it. And you can say, well, there's lots of churches and absolutely there is. And there's lots of little subcultures and you have to believe that the one who has the monarchical vision can finally sort that out. And here in our frame, we say probably nobody got everything right, which is okay. So what do you do? Well, you try to get it as right as you can. And so you do your research and so you look into it. And so you live as if, and so you practice it. And so you try it out. Hey, I thought I was gonna do a short video about this. Well, we're over an hour. I've got phone calls and stuff to do and I got a bunch of other things to do. So sorry, no short video. Is Jordan Peterson a racist? Yeah, so am I, so are you. Let's, as Jordan Peterson, an antichrist? Yeah, none of us fully believe the resurrection as much as we should. But the good news is, well, I just told you the good news.
