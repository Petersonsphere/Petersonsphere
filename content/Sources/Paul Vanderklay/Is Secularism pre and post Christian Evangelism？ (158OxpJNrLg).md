 Hi, this is Paul. I'm still working through my sound issues. Hopefully I won't be clipping in this one like I was in the last one. Some of you might have noticed I've been playing a lot of conversations, partly because I haven't been doing new content, partly because I had a trip out to the East Coast where I spent some time with my family, but also we did the retreat slash meetup thing in my sister's country inn and that went very very well. We had ten people who gathered and we did it in about 24 hours. Most of them flew in from different parts of the continent, mostly from the East. Some drove in and it was a great time. One of the things that I was thinking about as I was prepping for this video is on Rebel Wisdom you have all this talk about collective cognition and what I really sense is happening is a lot of collective cognition with the videos and the discord servers and the meetups and the other channels like the Rando's United and Mary's channel and Karen's channel and this little corner of the internet as John Vervecky and and Savilla King say. So there's a lot of collective cognition going on and so really the the number of hours that we spent sharing stories, talking about each other, talking about the ideas that we talked about on this channel were very much very worthwhile. I think everyone there left having a sense that this was a was a really special time and how much more powerful was it instead of sort of talking at each other via YouTube but to be able to talk with each other in a real space in real time. This is my sister's country inn and she's doing a decorating channel now. She was doing a fix-up channel for a while but they can't do a lot of fixing up in the cold weather so she's doing a decorating channel and so the place is very well decorated and very comfortable and we just spent a lot of time there around wood stoves and talking so it's it's way beyond any one of us. Oh yeah the collective cognition is way beyond any one of us and just as I was preparing this video I saw this new video from the Rando's United channel dropped on the Joker and I took a sneak peek at it and and it just for I just had the very much the sense that started up where what I've been thinking about and as many of you know I've spoken I've had one conversation with Sam I'm gonna have another one at some point I've had a few conversations with Luke and Julian and I know Luke is itching to have another conversation but they just picked up this channel really where I where I left off and let's let's look at it. He shoots Murray. He it's that that's the ascendant of the club. Well we introduce ourselves do we do that anymore? No we're all famous so everybody knows. We're all internet famous. Yes on the little corner of the little corner of the internet. Yes yeah so we're just talking about confessionalism and how do you define the word Christian and what does the word Christian mean and I was just saying that that is something that I've just been thinking a lot about and I'm gonna play again some Tom Holland from that Delling pod again and then thinking about Jordan Peterson telling Sam Harris and Matt Dillahunty that they act like they're Christians and of course Dillahunty and Sam Harris getting rather offended and so I'm gonna play some of Richard Harris Richard Dawkins yeah Richard Dawkins gonna play some Richard Dawkins on this too and his conversation with Joe Rogan. This is very much a question what does it mean to be Christian and and do these propositional boundary markers are these the best tools to to figure out who we are and what we're doing again we're back to identity and and again back to the the Charles Taylor's little book on the ethics of authenticity and the fact that now in this in this in this culture where we imagine we self construct that we create our own identities and so then then the question of well well what exactly is a Christian I noticed these guys jumped right into this on this conversation. One saying of Jesus I've started to think about recently is the whole thing about don't judge unless you be judged and I think part of what he's getting at there is it's you can't really draw these hard and fast lines and say you're in you're out you can't really say you know the spirit is moving you can't I think it's about you can't the spirit moves through people in strange ways and our trying to put people into orthodoxy boxes is just one way of you know stopping that process and say okay you need to be all the way here or you're not in you need to accept these things or you're not in and we sort of need to accept the fact that things are a lot more complicated than that and the lines are fuzzy. Now bear in mind that this is Julian talking and Julian is a Hutterite so he's he's very much lived his life with intentional community intentional Christian community propositional frameworks dominating the structures now again Verveki's four P's propositional perspectival participatory and perspectival participatory propositional I forgot one of the P's it'll bubble up but so you know we've been working on these things all along and so thinking well if if Tom Holland comes along and notes I think in a devastating critique of the of the new atheists that you know that our society is deeply Christian and the only reason we we can't see that is because kind of like a Foster Wallace you know what is water you know what is water we don't know we're so swimming in Christianity but of course being in the church business my my goal is to try and make people to be better Christians but what does that mean where are these where do these lines lie and now Sam's gonna jump in which is truly ironic because Sam is is is one of our heretics he's not he's not an atheist or you know what is a heretic well well Sam actually has a confessional heresy in that he's a biblical Unitarian so that's gonna come up here that's that's okay as a weird person to be defending lines and boxes I think one one purpose of them though is that I mean religious communities help foster trust and help facilitate interaction because there's a shared bundle of of rules and performances and all those sorts of things and if you share that with a bunch of people then you can assume that they share it and you can act accordingly right right this propositional way of knowing is is vitally important and it the propositional is given via the technology of writing and confession and subscription it in fact gives form and shape to community so that communities can extend horizontally so that communities can travel through time I've often made the point that part of the function of the Bible in Christianity is that it actually helps us transcend through time and again if you go back to Tom Holland's Delling pod conversation you know Christianity both has a progressive idea of revelation has a progressive notion that in fact we are moving towards an eschaton now that progressivism within Christianity obviously has a secular component in in progressive society it was mirrored by Marx you know many other philosophies but again this just shows that the deep deep influence of Christianity of Jesus of the Apostle Paul of the New Testament informing the Western world informing the Christian world that that we have these we have these these overtly confessional propositional Christian elements and alongside we have these these secular analogs that are continuing to develop and and actually they're usually feeding each other and going back and forth over the line so you have people who may not might not go to church and might not identify as Christian and might not participate but in fact there's communication going back and forth with these things so it enables the community to have higher levels of trust and cooperation than and so we so so so Sam is making the point that well if you and I both match up and agree in terms of our our propositional way of knowing and match the words up this encourages us to to trust within the community and allows communities to form and this is very much something that comes in the at the heels of the Protestant Reformation because you have this confessional movement where now Luther sort of breaks the thing open and and and now all these well we're you know we're they don't have labels for any of this stuff early on of course and and Luther and Calvin all imagine okay we're reforming Catholicism that's our that's our goal but the the reform doesn't go viral enough and it doesn't take so then you have this confessional movement in the in the Protestant churches where confessions are are are coming up in this and the community is saying this is who we are and so in the Christian Reformed Church as a Christian Reformed minister I'm it's a confessional church and so we have these confessions back and forth that that we subscribe to and it needs of which the Trinity is part of it quick and dirty ways in our way man my acting like you like you're an outsider my acting with you like you're an insider and it was so interesting that when when Sam came on the channel the first time it was the Christians that jumped him and this is a dynamic that later Dawkins and and Rogan will pick up on because it's always the you know the narcissism of small differences but are they small it's the it's those who it's those who betray the community that that that we get most angry with so Sam comes on the channel with his is what he calls his biblical Unitarianism and it's and it's a lot of the Christians who jump on him whereas atheists come on the channel and the Christians just you know leave them alone and it's very very interesting dynamics and and those sort of confessional boxes can serve that purpose to a degree and that does accomplish something I think I would I would push back on that though and of course Luke is gonna push back on this I would say that those confessional boxes don't they function completely different than the trust that you have in a family I don't know yes and no because it's the propositional things that you do at the at the marriage altar that actually create the family and if someone breaks some of those propositional things someone you know what what these propositional words in a family such as I don't love you anymore or I'm going to divorce you or I'm not gonna listen to you anymore I hate you these these propositional identity statements are very powerful but Luke has an important point here too and that's where all of this is really quite quite complex don't interact with my kids or my wife at all that way and I would say that's the predominant metaphor of the New Testament besides the body the family of God and and I and I think I actually think parents that function with their kids that way around confessional structures and if you're in and you're out I actually think those are the families that are highly dysfunctional and end up getting destroyed and I don't think it's any different yeah I understand that it's a quick shorthand but I guess I would propose that that's the whole problem with what I always try to talk about of the egoic intellect in the West can I jump in yeah well you were just saying I mean you want to use the model of family instead of body but this is something a friend of mine pointed out recently as the body is an organism right and various parts of the body are unhealthy various parts of the body are unhealthy and so it just this metaphor of a body is is just a way of thinking of this church as this living organic developing thing and it's not something that can be just sort of put in a box it's it's filled with people right and with with regards to what Sam just said I think I would sort of defend my approach by saying you sort of have to have two stances you have I think I see a value in you know the church community which does have its its boundaries and does have you know this is what we believe and this is what we hold each other accountable to but I think this this this this formation of community then also has to have this attitude of being open to the spirit and not judging people from other from other communities so there's sort of this this formation and what Julian is laying out here is basically confessionalism within this community but then this being open to what's outside which should have lead to this healthy dynamic of interaction with other communities while also sort of openness to other communities while also reinforcing your own community and what you stand for and and now what's interesting is that confessionalism here is is very much a product of you know our identity and our being isn't simply inherited or received but it it's achieved and now as communities we're going to to create it via these confessions and we're going to subscribe to these things but but that creates very much an inside outside and so already in a sense where the space of the secular is is implicit in the confessional move and of course this is this is something that that the Protestant Reformation just sort of blows open and and you might think you might think that in the in the Protestant Reformation it's this giant explosion where somehow they're beginning to engage the they're dynamics of the idea of the secular that I'm going to play the the Tom Holland video in a little bit so okay two things first are are we going to talk about Joker okay okay and then secondly because we're still on this topic and we get going and I get a thousand thoughts so my problem will keep will keep going but that's a it's a I haven't I haven't even watched the whole video but it's I'm excited about it so so so this question who is a Christian and we have this dynamic interplay between the the secular sphere and then the confessional sphere where we have community identity and that community identity you know one of the things that one of the things that we have to consider when we talk about this community identity that's the reason that there's so much propositional stuff going on is that those those are in a sense the only tools we've got you know I'm going to identify and I'm going to use a word those are the best tools because words words are these amazing things that they don't corrode when we speak them they we might they might get a bit threadbare when we don't use them properly but but so the the propositional confessional way of knowing is vital in a certain dynamic interchange with the secular and go back and forth but there's the the participatory and the and the and the perspectival and and and we're we're all in the middle of this as we go and this is where Jordan Peterson comes along and says to Sam Harrison Matt D'Alandi but you act as if you believe in God and and of course they're terribly at that and and now notice that's the he's challenging them they're saying no the propositional is dominating and Peterson saying yeah but you have to understand the propositional within the context of the of the other three peas and and that's that's how you have to work it together so you can't just play games with the propositional and and not understand the the performative and that's actually one of the peas but the the perspectival and the participatory you have to you have to you have to see those all within the context now Tom Holland and Rene Girard have been noting the deep moral assumptions inherited from Christianity and Rene Girard I've played that clip from his CBC interviews quite a few times and then more recently Tom Hollins where they keep using Christianity against Christianity and and if you listen to Richard Dawkins in his conversation with with with Joe Rogan you know they keep talking about these these immoral you know the the immorality of Christianity and this is the charge that Matt D'Alandi and and Sam Harris they keep bringing up too and it's like well where do you get your morality from oh we get our morality for reason and it's like that's exactly where Peterson keeps challenging them no no you don't and and the value of Peterson's biblical lectures has been understanding that the that the machinery that we use to construct this other layer this is this is where we get the scientific vision and the manis manif the scientific image and the manifest image I I didn't decide to play that clip but it certainly does belong here in terms of these these two images so now let's let's jump into you know let's jump into Tom Tom Holland a little bit on this and I played some of this before and what one of the one of the difficulties with recognizing that is again precisely the degree to which the Christian notion of there being something called a religion has become universal okay that's the Christian notion again these are all the assumptions that are so deep within us we fail to recognize them as Christian and again this this argument by Tom Holland is it's just simply devastating and that it comes from a historian of which neither Joe Rogan nor Richard Dawkins are in fact they they don't know anywhere near enough history this is just a devastating argument against the celebrity atheists wherever European languages spoken and often beyond that as well but the concept that there is something called a religion exists and people tend to assume that this is you know you might as well say you know there are trees or there are dogs as their religions it seems to be as natural as that but it isn't and again that's exactly how they speak but but how do you know it's as natural how do you know it isn't that just the way it is is because in history it hasn't been this way in other words that which is obvious to us has not been obvious to others which says well maybe it's not simply a function of this this naive realism that that the celebrity atheists like to promote that well we're just these creatures walking around and we're not deeply embedded in a way of seeing the world you know even if you go back to Brett Weinstein's comments with Alistair McGrath that you know the the story world in which we live is a human being born away from human beings is in a sense not human because all of this stuff that we bring up with us again this is this is Jordan Peterson's big project that he tried to engage Sam Sam Harris with but Sam Harris in the conversations he had with him but but Sam Harris simply continues to assert the naive realism. The concept of religion again is a highly culturally distinctive notion that is bred of the marrow of Christian assumptions and essentially it relates to what you were talking about about the concept of the secular which again is a wholly contingent culturally specific idea which no other civilization has has no concept of the secular in Islam. And there wasn't a concept of the secular in Christianity really until till the kind of early middle ages really. So the Abelards and the people like that. Yes around that period and it really goes back to the time of Augustine who is living when Rome in 410 is sacked and there are lots of Romans who haven't become Christian who say well this is because we've abandoned the old ways we've abandoned the old gods so we're being punished and Augustine says no not at all the divine cannot be manifest in in the earthly order only the radiant purity of heaven is eternal everything human everything mortal everything terrestrial is in a state of flux and he reaches for a Latin word cyclum. Now it's really helpful to understand C.S. Lewis's discarded image and and how that rolls into this because to to understand just the way this this image that the classic got classical into the Middle Ages of the you know the unmoved mover and the spheres on down and then here the earth at the center we often think well well the earth is the foundation now the earth was this this terribly dysfunctional place where there's decay unlike the unlike the the space up above the moon okay and I've been listening to Planet Hollywood Planet Narnia which is is now an audiobook and really enjoying that because I think his name is Michael Ward he lays this stuff out really well as he's as he's talking about why C.S. Lewis constructed the Chronicles of Narnia as he did. To define that and cyclum literally means the limit of the span of human memory so 80 years 100 years 120 years comes to be identified with a hundred so hence cyclum feeds into you know Ciecla French word century but and so the cyclum the world the dimension of the cyclum the city of man gets counter pointed to the city of God right and if you want to as a human who is trapped within the cyclum the flux of things if you want to get close to God before death then you need to bind yourself to him. Okay this is where I've spoken before Charles Taylor's one speed two speed so this is where before the Reformation you have the the the religious people okay and the religious people are the monks and the priests and these are people who are in a sense spatially working their way up to God by binding themselves to these practices devotion to the poor devotion to study you know all of all of this stuff and then the other speed of people are farming and doing this and of course this gets disrupted in the Protestant Reformation Luther has the priesthood of all believers John Calvin in a very much part of my tradition where you know being a pastor is no more spiritual than being a farmer and you know even 500 years after the Protestant Reformation I find in the Christian Reformed Church this idea doesn't take people don't really believe it no pastor you're more spiritual and but but all of these all of these things are getting are getting worked through and again in Latin that there is a word religio which in the classical period meant something that binds you to a gods it could be priesthood it could be a festival it could be a sacrifice in the Christian period a religio comes to mean those who really own a so those who particularly bind themselves to God so monks nuns hermits people like that so then you have the religious well what do you what do you what would there the non-religious well what do we call them well we call them the secular they're the people down here and then you have this interchange between the two speeds where well we offer the priests food and support and the priests pray for us and you have the merits and all of that system that gets gets deconstructed in the Protestant Reformation and over the course of the Middle Ages and then into the high Middle Ages you get this idea that there's the dimension of religio and there's the dimension of the cyclone and this becomes institutionalized in the 11th century when when kind of radicals and in fact you could almost say heretics take they seize control of the most prestigious bishop record in Rome and out of this kind of papal order they found Europe's first great revolutionary order which says that the dimension of of of the Church of the sacred of the holy of religio has to be permanently and fundamentally separated from the dimension of the cyclone so Kings who until that an emperor's who had had the perfect and you could see in a sense that this division that mirrors in some ways the the axial age type division but this this division here is going to strain and then in a sense break the the sacramental the the ancient sacramental assumptions and so with Luther's Reformation it very much becomes our relationship to God is is psychological and it's very much of the mind and so the stuff of whether we eat bread or don't eat bread whether we eat fish on on Friday and all of this stuff that was very deeply embedded in the in the sacramental perspective of the world gets gets broken apart and you can see the seeds of this are laid here on this division between the religious and the everyone has a really good it's not just monks anymore everyone has a really good and so and you can see you know that just in a sense that the deconstruction of the of the sacraments and well then we have the two-speed well in the Protestant Reformation then you go to the one speed and John Calvin and since wants to have a holy city and this of course will go all the way to the pilgrims and and the establishment of the of the Plymouth Bay colony and so this idea is very important and very much still with us you start to get a new sense of what becomes anglicized to become religion so religion has two shades of meaning on the one hand it's the personal relationship that you as a believer have with the divine deeply psychological post Luther and and what we would call spiritual in our terminology what do you believe what do you think what's your relationship and the propositional well that the propositional is sort of structures that and keeps order there and helps us find each other and and know who to trust I think as Sam said quite well to a god this is what religion means to to a Christian in the 17th 18th century and then against that it's something that can be defined against the secular so it's something that's kind of to one side so religion is something that is separate from society economy music and this is very much going to be the assumptions of Joe Rogan and and Richard Dawkins when they're talking here so whatever yeah so you have secular music you have religious music and everyone starts to know what that means and so the idea that religion is something that side by the time that the British start for instance to take over India this is something that they're absolutely taking for granted and when they go abroad they get asked well what what is the religion you know what is the religion of people in the Ottoman Empire oh it's something called Islam what's the religion of people in Hindustan where the Hindus live the Indians live and read the book they called it Mohammedanism it must be something called Hinduism and so Christians construct this idea of there being world religions but Christianity is of course the prototype so it's like the legend of Procrustes the one that the thief the robber that Theseus kills in the legend who supposedly takes travelers and makes them sleep in his magical bed and it always fits them and the way that he makes the bed always fit his visitors is if they're too short he racks them and if they're too long he chops bits off yeah and that's essentially what modern Western society you know imperialism has done with the belief systems and the structures of belief of other civilizations is that it's imposed this Procrustian model of religion you know across the entire world and so to that extent Hinduism Islam Judaism these are all concepts that have been Christianized and if there's an Indian scholar who said I think accurately and brilliantly that Christianization advances in two ways it advances through conversion obviously say with me but it also can proceeds in other words in in convincing societies that there is something called the secular and that there is something called religion that is separate from it and in that sense although the Raj did not convert India to Christianity on any mass scale it did convert it to secularism and when the when the Raj ended in the British left India was reestablished as a secular Republic and to this day it remains a secular I like that see and and you know not only did this happen in India with Ataturk after the First World War in in what was the the Ottoman Empire which was defeated in the First World War Ataturk creates a secular state in in what today we call Turkey and and so you see that this in fact goes all over the world and and conquers everything and and in fact this will hitch a ride on the great ideological movements that happen in the 20th century of of of Nazism and and more predominantly of of communism because this is this is of course all built into Marx and so when the communists conquered China and Vietnam and Asia when it when it conquers these places well it you know secularism secularism just keeps winning even if confessional Christianity they wouldn't call themselves Christians but but you can see how this movement is defining redefining the world at a very deep level in a way that nobody is noticing in fact not only is nobody noticing the Joe Rogan and Richard Dawkins are completely are completely unaware of it and and so now they come at it with their naive realism which you know now there's this naive realism but well that's our religion well that's the water you're swimming in and and in fact it's deeply embedded within Christianity that's the that's in a sense the the plan B of Christianity that that no one can seem to resist and so you have the colonial powers attempting as as he made the point the Raj overtly confessional evangelism which doesn't really necessarily work so well because partly because of I think that I was either going to record this or do some more commentary on Jordan's biblical series because the way that the biblical series is important is that what Peterson is doing is he's laying out the argument that that he very much that that that again I keep saying that the machine our machine code of culture is narrative and it's those narratives that we live in it live in it's the you know it's the participatory and the perspectival knowledge that that we're living in and of course then the propositional comes in later and we use that to put words on the walls but but it's deeply embedded in these in these stories that we're living in in fact we're so embedded in and we don't see them anymore and of course this was Peterson's point to Sam Harris that Sam Harris just simply could not or would refuse to see so so more effective was the suggestion that religion which is exactly what Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris and the celebrity atheists will be denouncing that that somehow this is something that you can live without well then what exactly are you living within if that's something you live without but this is the this isn't a fact the more the more viral this more viral idea beneath Christianity that only people outside of it can begin to recognize that that you know it's there is no outside of religion there is no outside of a worldview because you you have to find your way through that cornfield that that Peterson notes I mean we're gonna get to one side or the other you actually have to figure out how to navigate it there's nothing that you're not actually participating it now while I should be reading I should be quickly reading Tom Holland's Dominion my ADHD mind I have gotten distracted in another book that I've wanted to read for a long time that I finally started picking up and spent a lot of time with over the last couple of weeks when I wasn't making videos with Timothy Snyder's Black Earth I his book Bloodlands just really caught my imagination and you do not read a Timothy Snyder book if you're feeling a little depressed because his books are rough as he goes through the the history of the early of the early 20th the first half of the 20th century in terms of the Soviets and the Nazis and in this book he I've learned a ton about what Nazi is and in a sense that the Tom Holland deling pod interview sent me to it because this had been on my mind but I hadn't purchased it and I hadn't started it but when he drew the connection between Nazism and environmentalism I thought what's with that and and so the the introduction to the book is the the chapter before chapter one which is basically Hitler's worldview was just a revelation to me in that you know I had never perceived well Hitler was anti-semitic well what's what's what's behind anti-semitism well the stuff behind Hitler's anti-semitism was likely not the stuff behind Luther and Luther's anti-semitism or the anti-semitism of many people in Europe the stuff behind Hitler's anti-semitism is is Darwin and Spencer and and this view of the world which again sort of came out of the the secular view that says well well all of this all of this higher cognitive theoretical thinking this is all a distraction from what is more most truly real which is our animal selves and I immediately began to see the connections between between Hitler's way of thinking and ironically the way of thinking of the celebrity atheists in terms of this this ardent assertion and naturalism that well we're simply animals and we're having this we're having this manifest image delusion but we don't really have free will and these stories don't really govern us and it's it's really just the underlying things the the biology and the the bio the biological nature that is really just asserting itself and everything else is the rider on the elephant we're just making up stories and so Nazism is actually and I very much recommend this book I'm not done with it yet but each chapter I read it's just very high resolution and stark and just reshaping a lot of my assumptions about what happened at this particular time in this particular part of history where the Nazis basically say you know politics is all part of this this this this second level thinking and it's got to be done away with and so whereas the communists came in and everything has to be the state the Nazis come in and states just have to be destroyed because we have to get back to what's natural Nazi walking through Costco today saying natural and organic would say yeah we're winning because but we really have to get ardent applying this natural and and Nietzsche of course Nazi is Nazis very much come after Nietzsche because Nietzsche said well this whole slave morality that Christianity brought on us the slave morality that the celebrity atheists in fact continue to assert and use to critique and condemn Christians and even the Christian Bible this the slave morality is unnatural and the law of the jungle is natural and what we have to do is really get back to a natural world and this is behind the the hatred of the Jews because they look back and say well this all got started and oh we could probably blame Plato and Socrates and Aristotle too but it's really the Jews and their books and then what gave birth to Christianity that popularized it and so if we're gonna get rid of the politics and state and all of this all of this theoretical thinking all this idea of transcendence and get down to our true animal selves and get rid of this manifest image and this mythology well it's the Jews that are to blame for that so we've got to get rid of that so not only you know send them to Madagascar again I learned stuff in this book that I never had the complicated history of trying to to get the Jews out of Europe and the connection with Zionism and the idea that they're gonna send them all to Madagascar of all places and this then becomes a catchword and in Nazi you know it's just so much more complex than all of the the the propaganda the low-resolution propaganda that we tend to use to try to imagine that the Nazis are somehow these evil people and we're somehow good people and if we can just not be racist and like they are racist then we won't repeat these things and and Snyder just deconstructs all of that and shows how you know the processes the historical processes that led to all of these things that don't really seem to fit in but but by destruction of states the Nazis go and and and believe that now natural evolution can can continue and humanity within species against it's a very racialized racialized struggles communist Harari mentions this and in his book Homo Sapiens communists imagined that the story of the world is about is about class struggle so it's an economic theory well the Nazis see that the story of the world is about racial struggle and and these different ethnic tribes are different races and it's the struggle between them and so what what Hitler and the Nazi Party want to do is get rid of all of this theory and so get rid of you know the slave morality that Nietzsche calls out and get to the point where the truly powerful and strong can ascend to the top of the dominance hierarchy and dominate the rest but what's notable in the book that I in the last chapter that I was reading was how you know Christianity in Germany was a real problem for Hitler and in his first attempted coup for which he was in prison where when he read when he wrote Mein Kampf he really had to figure out how to lie and deceive the German people and and cover what his true intention was the polls understood quite a bit of it but but even they you know the polls understood a bit the Russians understood a bit but it's a read the book it's a phenomenal book so so the destruction of the state the natural evolution of humanity will be allowed to govern the future now Timothy Snyder basically says that that this is a warning to us because we're not he in a sense Tom Tom Holland notes that well we don't talk about the devil anymore because we have Nazis and we don't talk about evil anymore because we have Hitler or we don't talk about the devil anymore because we have Hitler and we don't talk about evil anymore because we have the Nazis and then Tom Holland notes that those just kind of slide into our low resolution perspectival idea of all that's the evil over there and so if I can if I'm nice to Jews instead of murdering them well then somehow I can avoid all of this but what Snyder's book shows is that this is way deeper and in fact you know that the the stuff that we're all swimming in is is is the same stuff that that all of Europe was swimming in and in all of this stuff so on the way on the plane back from Massachusetts a number of people had said oh you really got to listen to Joe Rogan talk to Richard Dawkins it's like man I don't know if I want to listen to that but I don't know what prompted me but you know I started listening to it and I don't know how much time I'll have to go through it maybe I'll have to go through it more in another video but started listening to their conversation and I know Bishop Aaron was doing some little snippets of it but thinking about the Tom Holland and these guys just being totally naive about well we don't have a religion well we don't have these propositional ideas we're free of that we're just oh really that's that's all it takes I'm deeply skeptical I deathbed was not as hard as you remember I didn't mean hard in in a negative sense I mean you push you're you're so enthusiastic about your I'm enthusiastic yes I'm also humorous I mean I like to think it's a funny book but a lot of people do think it's hard in the other sense and and sometimes when they read it again they realize actually no it's more humorous it's not so not so edgy not so hard-hitting as they think as they originally thought it was well I think that's probably because you've had some interviews in the past we have talked to some fiercely religious people and you've had some cantankerous interactions with them I think maybe so they they associate you with having this almost aggressively atheistic stance and Rogan here is a real point because these guys have been absolutely evangelical in the promotion of their ideas now in this next little part he's gonna talk about Ted Haggard and some some plays but but what's interesting is that through this whole conversation that they had one hand display the horror of all these Christians are indoctrinating the youth and this particular book that Dawkins is now this is a book tour for Dawkins okay this is a standard book tour not the Jordan Peterson faux book tour where he gives a new speech every night and with a veiled cover of a book tour no but but this new book is for younger and younger audience so as they keep talking about well we should leave those kids alone but we're trying to get at these kids and indoctrinate them yes well perhaps you're thinking a bit O'Reilly I'm not sure um Hill Hill houses where they right yeah they talk about that words that they said it was so preposterous that it actually without being deeply immoral thing to say but I think he was sincere yeah well I would agree with you is it's it's very disturbing that that was a there's a great documentary on it as well for someone who wants to see you like the thought process behind them creating this but one of the things that I really enjoyed about the God delusion is that you kind of outlined every single possible argument against atheism and then how to counter to it in advance like if you you know you you have a soft position look at chapter one if you look at this look at chapter two and you outline that in the preface before you got into it yes well I tried to as persuasive as possible the new book out going God is sort of aimed at a younger audience and I like to think that could be read at any age but so indoctrinating being able to younger audience is a bit shorter and perhaps a bit easier to follow much and if you pay attention to this throughout the entire conversation it just keeps coming up fascinating why is it that you think that there are so many religions and that basically every single civilization throughout human history has had some sort of deity some sort of higher power and and now this is exactly Joe Rogan in a sense for many people made Jordan Peterson's career and he asked this question I think well Joe Rogan didn't listen to the biblical lectures because this is the answer that Peterson gives in the biblical lectures and says that basically that we live deeply embedded to be human is to be deeply embedded in this story verse and and we have these stories and we live within these stories that the world is too complex and and the way that we manage this enormous complexity is is to live within these stories and and then he says well we're we're not living within a story and it's like really we're not living within a story we're very much living within a story it's just one narrative against the other but we're living in within the story of secularity well we can't see it because it's the story that we live within but we live within the stories and so so why would it be that everyone else in the world is living in a story without except us and you might ask okay you're gonna look at evidence maybe you're living in a story too which of course when you get to movies like the Matrix and many movies today this is this is the point of waking up and realizing I am living in a story well well I'm not living in a made-up story I'm living in a story I have evidence for I think every other society didn't believe they had evidence for their story that they didn't have rules for for figuring out what information was should govern and what information wasn't I mean the naivete of this conversation to me is just is it's just amazing it's amazing the way they split and diverge and diverge it's as though they somehow can't get along with each other and why wouldn't they and why would their stories not get along with each other could it be that they're seeing the world in different ways and it's actually within the it's within the conflict and the interchange within these stories that they're they're actually working out how to live together maybe new leaders arise you have a leadership complex or something and want to found their own set of time oh and so the stories are just things propaganda by leaders I mean he makes this enormously post-modern argument here that all these stories are just just so tales in order to oppress the people around him I mean and these two guys are sort of you know pushing back against woke religion but they just completely assume the entire premise of that argument time and time again you have breakaway religions breakaway faiths I don't know what the psychological reason for it is but they what I have maybe you should listen to biblical lectures notice is that they usually hate the religion which is the closest to their own more than they do more distant ones and that's right because the religion is actually again the machine code by which the individual in the community is negotiating their place in a world that is far too complex to just boil it down into a group of facts and so it's within the story within the conceptualization within the personification and and because that's how we deal with each other another person is a world of facts that is so complex personhood is the only way we can actually deal with the other person and and and we so easily do it we so effortlessly do it because of this machinery now we're just gonna talk about all this machinery as being delusional not realizing that we're using the machinery to try to denounce the machinery that has a certain biological ring to it too that just kind of makes sense to it to a biologist looking at oh now it's now it's all biology again really and so all of these stories all of this stuff is just delusion and and this is where now I'm not saying he's a Nazi because clearly he's not a Nazi now we're into the propositional labeling again is he a Christian is he not a Christian is he a Nazi it's not a Nazi but it's important to recognize the it's important to recognize the commonalities beneath this this assertion of the biological now now what I would say is that the biological is an aspect but my daughter was I picked up my daughter for Thanksgiving break and drove her back home and she was talking to me about this this MTV show called catfish and and talked about how and as she was talking I thought boy this is so pert germane to the conversations I'm having where people sort of are being lied to online and and someone through their social media platform creates a certain image of the whole point of this show is in a sense the revelation of the actual embodied person now it's important to again know the the dynamics here where a human being is both and and the you know what is matter for matter is for glory matters for communication matters to keep us on the same page but it isn't you know it isn't disconnected from from story I just maybe I'll put the link into a Bernardo Castro piece that came across my Twitter feed today that you know was talking about the end of materialism because in his assertion again he's located in this whole conversation someplace and a bunch of people have said oh you've got to read him but I haven't really read a much I've read a few articles but you know this oh the biological so in other words the talking we're doing right now and the the the the tussling we're doing right now because American Christians are close to the new atheists and we're going to be tussling over this of course it's a story tussling this is the only way we know how and again I I very much recommend the unbelievable podcast where where Richard Dawkins is talking with a Christian and a Jew and basically says well you're you're the nice Christians I don't really care if you do the Bible and stuff it's it's just over there in Texas and Oklahoma where they're trying to get it out of the books in other words it's just politics but politics is the story verse diverging species well it almost seems like if you were studying human beings if you were something that was completely alien to our civilization our culture and you were looking at this this strange tendency to believe in something that now notice how he shapes the story that well an alien coming down he wouldn't have any of this really how do you know how do they manage the enormous complexity that well a creature that could you know travel through space and all that would require they would have to they would if you know they would very much have to figure out how to manage the enormous complexity of this universe and what is the language what is the machine code what is how how do they actually manage to do that oh they would they would find our religion silly really it you're deeply embedded in the secular which of course is the product of Christianity there's no proof of and develop there's no proof of a massive amount of energy into defending that put it into your songs and put it into you know your Pledge of Allegiance and as if again this is something that we just put in that that we're all running around being pragmatic and we just put this stuff in as an adornment as an embroidery not understanding that this is why we do what we do and how we choose to walk through the cornfield and how we choose to relate to another human He's looking at the coding and says I see no code. Which of course was not until the 1950s but all the different things that people and why did it get put in the 1950s that's pretty darn late to be putting in God We Trust on the money there's a reason for it because it's the reason that launched Peterson's maps of meaning because in a sense he had so bought into the secular with his 12th grade deconstruction of God to say well why does the United States and the Soviet Union put the entire world at peril you know Joe Rogan who made Jordan Peterson in a way is like forgot everything you heard from him didn't you just looked at the woke stuff and thought well well that's bad that doesn't seem crazy well all the machinery you use to try and analyze those other human beings who are enormously complex it's all story verse machinery. People have done in so many different cultures with in regards to religion it almost seems like a natural aspect of being a human being. You're right that they... It almost seems we have all this evidence in fact all the evidence says it but we're not going to accept that because we're somehow above it really? They put an enormous amount of energy and effort and expense and time and cost in some of the extreme sex which whip themselves with horrible weapons actually bleed. And how would this why would they be doing this? Well let's talk about the horrible sex of the blue and the gray that stood shoulder to shoulder and and fired muskets into it fired mini balls into each other and took it. Why did they take it? They're running through the... They're working in the story verse. Why is Richard Dawkins on the Joe Rogan show? Why did he write a book? You know it's people it's the fish saying what is water and they're you know they're moving it around they're swimming in it and say there's no such thing as water. These words that I'm using they're not making stories there's no metaphor we're just talking facts and it's like you don't even every time the facts are presented to you you simply deny it. Scar their own backs. It's a it's very very surprising to a biologist you do you think we would think that they would be more interested in surviving and reproducing but no there's something about religion that makes them go to extremes of costliness. If there's nothing worth dying for or suffering for it's meaning it's meaning the fact that they're having this conversation at that table at this time after Jordan Peterson just basically says they haven't been paying attention. And I don't get it I must say. I've thought about this so many times do you think that it is in some way a counter to the sort of existential angst that comes from being a finite life form from being a finite a thinking conscious finite life form that's aware of its own demise it's aware it's coming so it has to formulate some purpose and some meaning. And hope of an afterlife. Yes that is the purpose and meaning right. Yes I suppose that's right. Now pay attention here afterlife comes fairly late in the process even in the Old Testament you have Sheol in this dark place a Hades like place of the soul you know somehow when they talk about religion all religion to them is Christianity and all of the aspects that's that's the only thing they know and it's like would you two read a little bit of history please. Yes I think that's that's right. I can understand why people might want to believe a priest who comes along and tells them you don't have to worry about death because you're going to survive it. And again we have another little just so story where all of this religion is just priestcraft and again listen to René Girard and what did how why did religion appear and what did it appear to try to do religion affords human community. Listen to Adam Frendit on this who's borrowing from Jonathan Haidt you have a totally secular approach to this that these two seem to know nothing about that religion some well well people want life after death so they made up a story well who made up a story did they make it up consciously did they make it to fool people did priests just make this story up in order to get money from people. Well that's a nice suspicious way of thinking but it doesn't hold to the facts and these people want to talk about facts well there this is a fact-free conversation. I'm less understanding of people who make up stories to comfort either themselves or other people. I mean a made up story should not be comforting I don't understand how a made up story can be comforting. Really? You don't understand why people are watching Netflix all the time and derive comfort from all of these made up stories. Yes there are made up stories yes the reason that we do suspect priestcraft at times is because well that does happen too but to simply dismiss everything according to those lines again doesn't hold to the evidence. Of course if you make it up and persuade somebody else then they could find it comforting. But would you die for a story that you overtly in a rationalist way made it up to comfort yourself to fool yourself we're usually not that gullible of our own machinations. On the other hand is an afterlife really all that comforting when you think about half of them believe they're going to go to hell so is anything but comforting and also even if you're not going to hell if you're going to heaven. And now this whole section about hell you know if you're going to make up just so stories then make up just so stories where your enemies go to hell and you and your tribe goes to heaven. And so again I listen to these guys and it's like making up just so stories well you should know something about that because you're not even paying attention to the data of religion. Eternity in heaven I mean sitting up sitting in heaven for not just. Have you ever listened to a lousy love story on the radio you know you completely I want to be with you forever do you not understand how language works. Trillions of years but trillions of years I mean these are these are timespans beyond our comprehension how unbelievably boring it would be. What is. Maybe to spend it with you. I mean I don't know I enjoyed life but if I had to live my life over and over again infinitely are we are well you just kind of laid out the premise of escaping the cycle of reincarnation. If I had an infinite number of this. Eternity is what's frightening about death and eternity is best spent. Nowhere and nothing isn't that it. Under a general anesthetic. Okay. Which is what's going to happen. Right. Gonzo. Alkoholites. Maybe. Yeah. Or maybe not. Have you had any experience with psychedelic. All right. So I don't know if I'll do a video on this whole thing but. Again the. They can't see their own religion and they can't see what's operating underneath. The extreme naturalism that asserts that this this this biological substrate is is the only thing that matters a complete blindness to the understanding that it's within the story verse that that we actually manage the most complex other things that we're in community with in fact you know seven billion of them which are other human beings and it it makes up our capacity to engage with the world just just watch history channels alone and look at how religious they get out there in the wild how I mean it's it's just simply how we navigate this world and the secularism that that they've all embodied well in a sense it's the it's both the second class and the preparatory move by which you can begin to understand Christianity it's it's Christianity light as as Glenn Scrivner made and which brings us back to the the definitions of OK how do we define how do we use this propositional way of knowing what's its role what's the role of the material verse how do we hold this thing together and how in a sense do we then come together and have collective cognition to to figure this stuff out and live together and work together and actually arrive at even the morality that has so deeply impacted the atheists that they use it to condemn and critique the church or the Bible or Christianity so I'm about out of time I don't want to take too much time on this tonight but I wanted to make a video for Monday and I hope I got the sound right and there'll be more
