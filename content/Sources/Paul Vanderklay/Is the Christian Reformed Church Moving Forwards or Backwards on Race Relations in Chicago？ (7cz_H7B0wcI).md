 Hi, this is Paul and I have a friend on today and this is a friend that I made since I started my channel. I didn't know Dan at all before that but very quickly he somehow found my channel probably through Jordan Peterson and we started email corresponding and I met once with he and his wife when they were out in this neck of the woods and had a lovely lunch with the both of them and I've you know I Dan and I have talked quite a bit and I sort of wanted him to share his story and so that's what today's video is about. So Dan welcome to the channel. Thank you Paul. It's great to be on. And I think the main goal of this video is to share your story because I think your story I think there are a lot of other people with similar stories every story is different but I think your story has insight for some of the contemporary conversations that we've been having so why don't you introduce yourself the way you want to and I'll sort of play midwife and try to help the story unfold. Sure, yes first of all thank you Paul for having me on and just want to thank all the folks in our corner of the internet, Verbeke, Perjou, all of the folks in this conversation you've helped me tremendously process through these times prepared me for these times so first of all thank you for all of that. Secondly want to note that I'm kind of breaking a pledge here that I got off of social media and have not been doing zoom calls because I've been finding that those interactions have in many instances strained relationships more than enhanced them that the in-person so anyway I feel like this time though is important for me to kind of break that and one thing about that it's this time with COVID and all of us retreating to our times has really made me appreciate the incarnation that much more the fact that Jesus was here in the flesh in our material world so anyway that's just a thought as we start that that that's really hit me. One of the catchphrases these days that's kind of reverberating around is the whole sense of white guilt white fragility and in our racial times and I think I just wanted to share my story because I've been processing through white guilt similar to you Paul in many ways and so may have had a head start on a lot of the folks who are younger than us and or are entering this conversation more recently than what we have. Why don't you start at the beginning growing home family of origin growing up religion all the usual stuff that I quiz people on when they come on my channel. Yeah. High relevance realization. Right so I was born and raised in Grand Rapids Michigan home of the Christian informed church went through very similar schooling etc. to what Paul has expressed on his channel. The neighborhood I grew up in was one that was post white flight so I grew up in a community where maybe at the time I was born it was 50-50 or some kind of mixture but by the time I moved out of that community my parents moved out of that community we were by far the minority and so my interactions with racial cultural differences and I think there is a key difference there between culture and race maybe we can get into that later. One of my best friends when I was six was the little black boy who lived around the corner another one of my best friends when I was six you know went to the school and I was at which is mostly these Dutch kids and there was a disconnect between those two and so early on from six I saw some of the complexities of different communities. Yeah so I grew up there I interacted with the community in different ways had a paper out so had you know customers who were of all different backgrounds and cultures and races started there and there's a term that's been kind of kicked around and I think this fits me as a third culture kid where people who are from one culture grow up in a predominantly different culture it's kind of like yellow and blue make green and I think that fit me so went through you know I guess one other thing is the church that we went to on Sunday mornings was it was a very mature church a lot of older Dutch folks not a lot of kids as Mary Cohen has said if your church isn't crying it's dying it was one of those so Sunday school classes didn't have a lot of kids in it but our cadets which is the Dutch version of Boy Scouts was probably 50-50 when I was there of neighborhood kids and you know kids from the church so again I this this planted seeds from a very early age for me what what racial things and cultural things were all kind of in the mixture those seeds really started to come to fruition went off to college studied architecture actually it's been good that architecture at that point and this was in the 80s late 80s really 90s was very much in the throw as a postmodernism so thank you Jonathan Peugeot for some insights why I was having serious issues with the architecture program at that time and then that was in the Detroit area and just seeing how foolish it was we were tearing down all this beautiful architecture in the city and building just the schlock out in the suburbs and losing community so there was a physical aspect to my you know another seed moved on from architecture school went to study city planning like okay why are we doing cities the way we're doing did that in Atlanta this was in the lead-up to the Olympics coming there I worked with one of the local neighborhoods that was processing the Olympics which is a primarily minority community got a view of cultural things from the south and just another layer of that and then newly minted with my graduate degrees and my sense of purpose moved to inner-city Chicago because I really was green I could not comfortably live in yellow and I could not comfortably be blue I am both so anyway moved to the inner-city Chicago with a desire to help rebuild community as also this is second wave racial reconciliation rebuild the community and I gotta say it's been a very difficult very rich very rewarding experience living here in Chicago we we are the only white folks on our block we're one of a handful of folks who have either purposefully moved here or remained here and those are two different pools but we've we've definitely formed a community here which is very rich and very deep so I've sensed a real change in the messaging the last five to ten years as critical theory has crept into the blue church and it's very disconcerting so that's I think that's why I'm telling my story so that's your you raised your kids there tell me about you don't have to talk about your children at all but some of the decisions that went into because often for people I mean again my parents you know very big value move into the city incarnate the integration message of second wave anti-racism you know raise your children in that milieu raise your children in the city those who are familiar with Tim Keller will recognize a lot of these things because a lot of people don't recognize that the the Philadelphia Westminster Seminary was in many ways sort of a a think tank for a lot of this what was called in the 70s and 80s urban ministry so Tim Keller Roger Greenway I mean that was the that was sort of the that was the thinking that was in the Christian Reformed Church synodical committee of race relations you know of course I grew up in that wave in Patterson Living Stones here was planted in that wave Earl Marlink left Chicago and the partly because of all I mean a lot of people well it's fairly well known in the Christian Reformed Church a lot of people outside the Christian Reformed Church of course don't know much about it but Chicago became a flashpoint for the racial reconciliation conversation in the Christian Reformed Church with Timothy Christian School that whole fight became the synodical committee on race relations which became score eventually became you know Christian Reformed Social Justice there's a there's a deep history to that that my father was a big part of Earl Marlink who was a pastor here it's one of the goals he had when he moved to Sacramento and establishing this church could black people and white people actually come together and do life and church together and that's how I grew up that's what that's how I don't know how much and how much intentionality was there in I mean you don't have to name names but how much intentionality was there in the church you grew up and I mean if it's cadets were 50-50 a lot of the Grand Rapids churches didn't flee they tried to stay and many of those churches have continued to do that and I can name those churches they were all off the tongue but yes that's that transition and that I think if we're gonna get into kind of the move from second wave anti-racism to third wave anti-racism in the Christian Reformed Church I think it's helpful especially for our audience to to get a good sense of just how robust and important at least to those of us who grew up in it second wave anti-racism was in the Christian Reformed Church I know so maybe you can flesh some of those a little bit more before we move on sure the church I grew up in was Burton Heights Christian Reformed Church we lived very close to the corner of Division and Burton that was the closest major intersection you know the Garfield Park area I have many memories of going to the pool there and being the you know one of a few white kids so we were yep all of that and right across the street from Burton Heights this is the granularity we have and now I think a lot of people listening to this conversation are going to be Christian Reformed and they're from Grand Rapids and so they know these places and so I think to the degree that it's appropriate getting into the details is helpful because of course Garfield Park was an RCA right at the other side of the street yes and Burton Heights is also interesting historically because that was where that was the end of the line for the streetcar so back in Oh I didn't know that. I didn't. Yeah so and like that I think it's probably the 20s and 30s the that was sort of the edge of the city and so Burton Heights is history with racial reconciliation is a little bit different from Bate Street or First or Newland Avenue and then you sort of have these second wave anti-racist CRC churches like Madison Square where I went to, Grace and and you had the whole dynamic I mean I should I should do a whole video just on the chapel movements because of course Madison Square was a chapel and my father's church Northside Chapel that word chapel in the Christian Reformed Church had a specific meaning but the Burton Heights was one of those churches that was as you said a mature congregation because it had been sort of the this is you know cities in North America tend to grow out as they age and so this had been you know an important neighborhood and if you get just south of Burton obviously my wife often if we look at houses just south of Burton there are these glorious houses that aren't Grand Rapids has gone up quite a bit actually in the last few years but there's these amazing houses just in that Garfield Park neighborhood which are which are just architecturally stunning and beautiful and gorgeous but of course the they're close to division which is another boundary line in Grand Rapids so there's there's tons of stuff going on there in that history. Yes and that was the soil that I grew up in so it planted all of those seeds so when I was graduating and starting my own life I couldn't just do the next suburban thing it just didn't fit who I was right there was no way I could survive in that so I had to I had to be part of that yeah and that's very similar to me so it's very much in grace that's where my dad that's where my dad attended until he passed away was grace that's where he ended up so yeah that's very much you mentioned Timothy so we're in North Lawndale the neighborhood North Lawndale which is where Timothy originally was and you know this history moved out to Cicero so Cicero is the one place that Martin Luther King would not march because Cicero was was very racial which as we've talked to the story brings us back to two weeks ago which is why I'm speaking out now Timothy it was a lawsuit between Timothy and they the members of the Christian Reformed churches in Lawndale and Garfield Chicago which is different than Garfield Grand Rapids because they weren't letting the black kids go to Timothy because there were death threats to board members and teachers so they there's in a group or Timothy will bust any kid from the west side of Chicago out to Timothy and in Elmhurst as part of that also they seeded a little school which was sad little school and so when we were looking around to where are we going to send our kids we looked around said there were not any qualified schools to send our kids here in our community and because there were no qualified schools for our kids there are no schools good enough for our kids that means there are no schools good enough for anybody's kids regardless of so we took that little Christian school and we made it good enough for our kids so the first seven years here we spent building that school that was one of the main efforts and the school is doing well there are other schools in my time here the Arch Diocese has closed some 20 some odd schools Chicago Public Schools has closed over 50 schools we could build another 70 school that we built and it's still there would be a drop in the bucket yeah just as a explanatory note for other people with the Christian Reformed Church the church doesn't own the school this gets into people have heard me talk about Abram Kuyper a little bit the schools are run by the parents this all Kiperian vision of sphere sovereignty you don't want preachers running schools you have parents running schools because that's more appropriate to their sphere and so in our little subculture of the world Calvin College very early on had two missions it was to train ministers for the churches and teachers for the schools so in the history of the Christian Reformed Church Christian schools are a very big deal which meant that this fight over Timothy Christian it wasn't the church sort of controlling the school it was you know and that's how this thing landed up in core and became this this was a flashpoint in in the Christian Reformed Church a defining moment in terms of racial reconciliation in the Christian Reformed Church so anyway just these comments so that a broader audience can have a little bit of better understanding of what we're talking about now we know many many of our friends our friends kids have sent their kids out to Timothy because that is still the high school there is there are a few Christian high schools in the city but fewer than there were and actually there's another one in our little network there's a school that's talking about adding the high school so there's still work there's still work to do I think actually that brings up one of the points that I want to make about maybe white guilt like I've dedicated my life to this this is how I live and it's a drop in the bucket it's crashing on the rocks if you think as a white person you can solve any black person's problem just put that aside right now and I think that's where a lot of the angst in all of this is coming from there's a big burden being put on messaging white people you have to solve the problem but then simultaneous with that message is like well you have to sit down and shut up you can't do anything about the problem and that's just a philosophical and psychological burden that is impossible to solve you just you can't do it and you shouldn't be expected to do it so anyway that's one of the messages to white guilt don't take on more than what's what's your career yeah well and the I mean there have been a number of you just recently obviously that that that black Berkeley professor who wrote that anonymous letter that's been handed about the internet implicit in and John McWhorter's made this point again and again implicit in that message is the assertion that there's a very racist assertion that black people are somehow unable to help themselves not that not that so you begin to differentiate and say okay so you have a challenge well we all have challenges maybe some of your challenges are because of and you know just last few videos I am not a doubter of systemic racism at all I grew up seeing it and just this morning I got into a little Twitter thing because of Scott Adams systemic racism thing oh I don't believe in systemic racism systemic racism but again as a Calvinist not just racism all of our sin gets into our systems and gets magnified and things out there but you're right that when you get two messages this is for you to solve so sit down and shut up it's like wait wait wait a minute you know white silence is violence sit down and shut up or we'll give you the words to say right but then am I saying them or then am I a non-player character megaphone and here's the thing because it continues to break down for I mean the thing that I think the way both of us grew up people are like well you have to listen to black folks and it's like okay implicit in that is oh you mean they're all saying the same thing right my goodness and I think that is one thing that I've benefited from is living here and knowing a plethora of people from different backgrounds and different colors and just seeing the rich there's there's nothing more fulfilling than being in a room where you're the only pale face and not realizing it until you're kind of leaving the room and you're like oh I was the only white person in there that's kind of interesting but when you're I think one so yeah one of the things that's problematic about the current conversation and I think you've used this example psychologically it's like don't eat the chocolate cake don't eat the chocolate cake don't eat the chocolate cake and what are you going to do you're going to think about the chocolate cake you're going to eat the chocolate cake and I think that's what we're doing with race you know what races this person what races this person instead of like oh this is my neighbor this is my friend this is my colleague this is the person who we've shared childcare with this is the person who's you know the pastor my friends my colleague and there's so many conversations out there that should be more that there's more than unites us than divides us yes there's differences in Dutch culture or Italian culture or Jewish culture or you know urban black culture there's differences in southern black culture than northern black culture there's differences in South Carolina black culture and Texas black culture yes and diaspora black culture and it's a it's a rich multifaceted culture with amazing diversity within it that all gets ghosted in this conversation right exactly exactly and maybe we should celebrate our differences in culture maybe we like celebrate our differences but there I think they're all subcultures like they're not like we're still American culture people celebrate Christmas here I guess to Tom Holland's point not only are we American culture but we're Christendom we still are you go into everybody's homes they have Christmas trees at Christmas time you open presents weddings yes okay maybe some of the musical selections are a little different the same basic culture so so we should stop dividing or emphasizing these things anyway we should we should stop when we get to celebrate like oh well Dutch people have some pretty good desserts we both had whatever but they have lousy main dishes I mean it's just meat and potatoes how boring right boiled vegetables oh my goodness right but fried chicken barbecue oh yeah right so let's celebrate the fact that we bring these different things and by the way one other aspect of this going back to the Cicero thing Cicero used to be while this whole area used to be Dutch it was the Dutch farmers originally the oldest Christian-formed church used to be just east of here and now it's just west of here and just so anyway the Dutch folks kept moving out when the Jewish folks moved in and then the Jewish folks in the 60s all moved up to Skokie mostly very quickly when the great migration African Americans coming up in the south and then so there were the Dutch folks and then the Jewish folks so it's complicated south of here were Eastern Europeans in the South Lawndale area little village because now they're more La Vita now they're mainly Mexican immigrants also Mexican immigrants in Cicero so this gets complicated it's not just two groups Chicago is a you know multiple layered so what I one of the things going on with that I found disconcerting about these last couple weeks as the burning and looting words going on was very indiscriminate black folks had been able to go to Cicero or to little village very safely up to a few weeks ago no big deal our main shopping strip is a little over a mile to the west of us because of the looting and the rioting the Mexican community has risen up against the African American community are now threatening African Americans from going into Cicero again we're back to 1960 whatever and it's because of critical race theory it's because of this intersectionality garbage we've talked you've talked about this on the channel like with intersectionality what do you do if you're a white woman does your white side oppress your female side what do you do if you're a black man right now what do you do if you're a black police officer one of my best friends has worked for the Chicago Police Department for over 20 years he's a black man like you you cannot just it's not a simple hierarchy it's not a pyramid we're talking about real people in real situations well I think your point you know the one of my theses is that the the civil rights movement led by dr. King but it's important to see that movement much higher resolution understand the differences when you talk that when you start looking at Malcolm X you're looking at layers of differences because it's is it the Malcolm of the nation of Islam is it the Malcolm of worldwide Islam you know there are those issues you look at dr. King and even dr. King has layers because he started this thing in his 20s sort of got you know roped into it with the Montgomery bus boycott and so it was an evolving thing for him you've course got the Black Panthers Stokely Carmichael I mean the movement itself was was itself a very broad and now what happens in history is that we forget and so sort of the high sort of the the dominant voice comes through and for and I again people look at me and why doesn't Paul agree that there's racist that it's like no I see racism all over the place I mean and so of course in many ways for a lot of white folks dr. King was if they had to select from Malcolm X or Black Panthers or dr. King yeah we'll take him you know right very reasonable reasons and but this this became for many Americans especially white Americans without much social without much lived experience with actual face-to-face 24-7 diversity that sort of became well this is morality okay so that's morality and so it's black white well as you noted very quickly and this happened with obviously higher levels of immigration at the latter part of the 20th century now there are and again I just on my last video I I try to correct people on this Mexican is not a race yes Mexico is a multi-ethnic nation yes with it with some people from indigenous heritage the Americas are all multi-ethnic nations right and you know people say well you're nitpicking no this isn't nitpicking real it's real and I worked in the Dominican Republic the Dominican Republic was a multi-ethnic nation and you'd better believe they were all tracking race but all of the racial equations there might be some similarities but they were unique to the context and so I learned this when I moved from Patterson to Grand Rapids race was different in Grand Rapids than Patterson and I could sense that right away because I knew Patterson and I have developed sensitivities with respect to race and it was different because the story of Patterson and the story of Grand Rapids was different and the places in the Great Migration from the south feeding those two places were also different folks came up from the Carolinas to the New York area Patterson sure that's right from other places here it's Mississippi that's right it's Mississippi Alabama to Chicago well you know where it is to California it's Texas and so that when I moved to Sacramento it's like well this again is another mixture but in Sacramento we had elements that I didn't have in Patterson which were the Asian communities Japanese communities Chinese communities both very long-standing in California and of course Hispanic communities so right away in California now I've always been this is good I'm gonna get into so much trouble with this video you and me both I know because I have friends that I think that's what's so hard long-term deep friends who are who are who are being infected with the virus of critical theory because the RNA strand of critical theory matches up with the DNA of the cells of folks who care about these issues yeah yeah yeah it's it feels like we're going backwards even like that you'd mentioned the Hispanic like the difference between the Mexican immigrants here and the Puerto Rican immigrants here significant cultural and angst between those two yeah and you can't just you can't lump people into groups like this and well and the difference the long-standing difference between descendants of you know antebellum American slavery and the immigrants from Jamaica the Dominican Republic you know Brazil other African ancestors who had the slavery in the Dominican Republic in Haiti in Brazil that experience was very different from the slavery in America and those differences and you know Thomas Sowell has has been one of the black scholars that has highlighted this um that difference has had systemic impact in the community systems right has impacted outcomes and now we're in a context where so there's no majority culture in my neighborhood okay there's white there's Hispanic there's Tongan there's Japanese there's Chinese there's African-Americans the church that rents my sanctuary are Nigerian immigrants they look at this with totally different eyes and then someone comes along with the phrase people of color and when I hear that phrase I am offended for other people because it's like most of the world are people of color in your bucket and you're going to lay over all of them okay I understand there's a conversation with respect to whiteness which is a very valid conversation because as a result of some history whiteness has importance and meaning but it has to be contextualized with all of these different variables which is why it makes such easy social media propaganda to have an Nigerian immigrant calling out Black Lives Matter as an organization because she's from Chicago and she says you all care if a white person kills a black person but the amount of blood that's being shed you turn a blind eye to that yes why and as someone who grew up caring deeply about the suffering not of people I see on TV but looking at the kinds of systemic racist bondage that people I know personally live and die from that kind of propagandist facile shallowness infuriates me but when I talk about my anger on this well now I'm a racist like all right and even with the whole whiteness thing it's my understanding that Chicago has the highest number of Polish immigrants outside of Warsaw it's like don't tell me they haven't been oppressed my goodness right so people oppress people we do this to each other it's multi-layered and multifaceted let's let's let's get and I think I yeah so I think a couple I think a couple of the errors that I'm seeing here and I think you've highlighted to them one is you talk about the whole Heideberg cataclysm misery deliverance gratitude right I learned it alliteration sin salvation service I think what we've done and this is an element that I've struggled with all of us struggle with you see something you want to address it you have this sense of guilt and you do sin I have guilt it's interesting that's been a hard thing for the church to sell lately that's a starting point you're sinful you're awful great what a great marketing strategy right why do you think why do you think all these big mega churches are kind of downplaying that because it's an awful but we know that so even though the church has been downplaying it this is it's coming back up around yes you are sinful that's the starting point but what we are doing is we're doing sin service to get salvation we're flipping the last two it doesn't work that way you cannot do enough service you cannot help enough black people you cannot build enough schools you cannot do whatever you think you're doing enough rallies or voting for the you cannot do enough to earn salvation it doesn't work that way it has to come after you have a sense of the gratitude the wonder of like wow I'm in a relationship with a transcendent creator of the universe that's where it comes from well I think I've struggled with that all of us have right yeah yeah so anyway that's well the reason I you know I grew up with sin salvation service too and the reason I abandoned that framing of it is because all three words are way too fudgy yes what what we're seeing with critical race theory is exactly what you described and the I use misery instead of sin is because it's it's it's often not our sin that drives us to Christ it's our misery because we're not in a place to see our sin yet and the height of eclecticism sets that up and the height of eclecticism uses the word misery and it and it's it's it's like the drunk who gets to the point of saying my life is unworkable well why is my life unworkable well it's everyone else's fault well that's the way to go first it's the and then again as you said racializing this is deeply problematic yes because I've you know I'm I gotta be careful with stories here because yes I too am thinking of names that I'm biting my but when you begin to tell I'll just use I haven't asked them yeah because when you get begin to say people well let's let's let's go to the let's go to Godwin's case if you begin to tell people all of your problems are attributed to this other racial group you are seeding you are seeding motivational racism and propositional racism into the next generation and that's exactly what happened that's how the plantation owners pitted the so-called white trash off of the African-American populations yes yes yep as they told the white the poor white folks I mean a tiny group of people owned slaves they were at the top of the Pareto distribution yeah well what are you gonna do with all the other white folks who are poor and scratching out a living there and we'll put them in direct competition with the black folks and you know you can continue to ride the gravy train I've just made a Marxist argument but um you know but this is this is the kind of things we do so so it's our misery that drives us finally to say I am a sinner because for the most part all of this you are a sinner stuff it doesn't yield good fruit I am a saint this is at the heart of our theology so then what about my sin well and see I I had to go my experience of learning of learning the limits of my capacity to save the world happened overseas where you know in North America you know if you're working in Chicago or Patterson or Sacramento or LA cost a lot of money and the system seemed real big because the populations are big you wade into the third world where you have a where you have a you know where where your US dollar and your white missionary skin seems way more potent and you wade in there and you think surely I can fix some of these things no learn you learn just what kind of enemies you are facing you learn what principalities and powers really are now suddenly deliverance oh it is Christ who saves right so but then what do I do what do I do with my life gratitude you know and you you nailed it exactly right you go sin service salvation and the point of the catechism is that this doesn't work and it's self-salvationism and it's anti-gospel but when I find implicitly my Calvinist denomination talking like this yeah I have a theological problem with that yeah I have a I have a problem with the low resolution of of the sales job being done and I have a I have a deeper problem with the implicit salvationism that's in the program I gotta shut up because it's supposed to be your conversation so no but you preach preach that's that's and not only that so in being here it's like obviously I've gotten beyond our denomination my denomination of origin because you know we have the little there's a little CRC here and the little school but there's a lot more of Christian community and broader community that's here doing things and they've kind of boiled it down to the great commandment love God love people right yeah and I think and maybe this is like the secularization taking over the organizations because you don't run into enough Christians doing it and let's be honest even those of us who have grown up in the church struggle with the the faith aspect of it so you forget the loving God part and you just talk about loving people and again it's an inversion I'm just gonna love people love everyone I'm just gonna do just gonna be nice and yes if if you lose step one step two goes sideways very fast and that's where you run into all these programs that people are doing out of good motivations great hearts that are doing as much or more harm than they're doing good that's right and that breaks my heart that breaks my heart so and if I didn't care I'd be like yeah whatever but I care and and you can't help but care so yeah coming back around to my story in terms of you know you kind of introduced how I connected with you it's through Jordan Peterson so I guess there were two waves of me trying to have a positive impact on this community two main waves one was when I first got here I was 25 naive we're going to do great things I think it was the right thing to come here and to to plant roots and to live our lives here in many ways I soon idealism crashed against the rocks of reality and so anyway my wife and I have traded positions in terms of who's been the one paying the bills and who's been the one doing more quote ministry I start out in the ministry she was paying the bills for several reasons we switched places I crashed on the rocks of reality so I went to work downtown Chicago made a living and she was doing ministry type things and doing kids it's not that clean cut but that was a big wave uh 2008-9 happened this area was getting gentrified that's another uh issue I'll come back around to prices were getting bit up whatever the bottom fell out I was like oh great here's the second opportunity for me to try and do the affordable housing thing came back in I had learned a bunch of lessons again crashed against the rocks of reality so I was sitting here like okay what what am I doing here what impact am I having what good I was going to like renovate all these properties buy up all these foreclosures just rebuild the whole community uh yeah in the end like you've talked about it I manage a few apartments at this point I clean toilets or fix leaky toilets and repaint beige apartments beige that's that's what I do for a living but it's not even really a living and so I am like what is this god thing what was I doing or whatever and then comes along Jordan Peterson and you and I have plenty of time while I'm painting or whatever to listen to you guys and um you know Jo Verveke you guys just a lot of the pieces started falling into places like what is this all about um and and so hey thank you thank you for this whole corner to everyone who's listening to this uh I was to paint a beige apartment's beige to try and keep them clean and keep the lights on and it's just a little bit it's just a little corner I'm not going to stop the writing I I can't uh it's beyond me I can speak out against the philosophy that seems to be driving this that's that's drawing us backwards but um anyway that's that's what I'm doing now um oh yeah that's a you know it's really interesting because when I reflect back on my father's ministry you know he I mean some of the big things that people recognized he did you know they ran every you know obviously north side chapel um which was turning this really kind of a soup and salvation ministry into a church in Patterson which the timing was exactly right because it's time for the church to be its own thing and not just uh but it always had connections to the broader CRC communities they have the day camp program that he would fund from outside the church every year they had the north side addicts rehabilitation center which which during the heroin epidemic was um you know was a big deal in Patterson later on very involved in Habitat for Humanity and the start of Don Treder Christian School because as the Dutch folks would leave Patterson um the churches were the stickiest but the schools and the homes tended to go first and and they had you know similar to Chicago they had the inner city schools but then finally when the Pasek school closed they started Don Treder and so those were the institutional things that same story yep yep same story yep those are the institutional things but in many ways the I mean my father was deeply loved in Patterson because he he cared for people and so often the way he cared for people was delivering them food when they had to move and I went on some of these forays with him because some of the stuff was too heavy or too awkward for him to move alone so moving someone he'd take the church van and we'd go to their house and you know we'd hump the furniture into the church van and move them from one place to the other it's I'm saying all of this to get to the point that painting beige walls beige fixing toilets yep um these are these are ways of loving and here is it's it's exactly here where you also begin to see that the inversion of salvation and service is is so critically wrong because someone might look at you and say what kind of world saving are you doing painting beige walls beige and fixing toilets and you say no I'm sorry I'm a Christian the world has a savior and it isn't me there you go I work out of gratitude because you know as with Chesterton what's wrong with the world I am and this is where is is there a is is there a degree of validity to white guilt absolutely but see the world's way of dealing with guilt is guilt is guilt um see they don't use you can't use gratitude again that's why I use gratitude it's it's guilt um it's guilt religious slow religious show salvation in the eyes of your community right and again if you look at the sermon on the mount which I'm starting to preach through now which is so it's on my mind Jesus says don't do your service to be seen by people because why not that it doesn't feel good not that it isn't validating not that you won't receive status for him you've already received your reward and this is the point about secularity the reason critical race theory fails against let's say the heideberg catechism is because critical race theory is fundamentally secular yeah and there is no god that can save therefore it's up to us which is that's why it's sin service salvation the salvation and this is why it gets into all these other utopian frameworks where it's up to us to bring in the kingdom here and now it's up to us to punish the guilty yeah and exalt the well exalt myself it winds up being because I hear of my own story it's pride pride it really comes down to pride I'm too good for this I need to you know I'm the salvation of the of the world that's right and when I look at my heroes black and white of the lives I've seen you know who they are they are the people that were scrubbing floors and painting beige walls beige and fixing toilets and helping poor people in Patterson schlep a lousy fridge from one place to another and getting his son involved um because because well why would you spend your time serving you know and I deal with this with the homeless people that I deal with why pour your life into a person that is going to die in all likelihood stumbling drunk into flooring road and getting hit by a car yeah because the frame of my deliverance is not cut off by secularism and people look at helping a homeless person and they say oh that's noble but my motivation is to save the world oh you go out and you try that for a while you just try it in a little corner of the world you just try that with your kids you just try that with your alcoholic spouse you know go ahead that's one of the critical race traps too right they say oh you're only being an ally to feel good about yourself for your own self-motivation that's one of their traps and there's a degree of truth to it exactly all of it's like the virus that's what I'm saying it like matches up with the dna just enough to get in there and reproduce and kill the cell that's right there's enough truth there yeah yeah um another one of the traps this is so frustrating it's let's sit down shut up we all got grief for white flight right my parents were one of the ones that stayed there were reasons for that when everyone else left oh all the white people are leaving then white people are moving in oh you're gentrifying you want me to be a neighbor or not right you there's no winning strategy there and with the riots we're probably gonna see more flight but here's the thing yeah there's plenty of black flight too yes many of the people that lived in my neighborhood when i got here my black friends moved out to the suburbs for better public schools and i stayed that was one of the downsides of redlining right redlining all the black folks kept together of all different and then redlining ended and the folks with resources left that's right that's right um no those were broad terms all that but yes those were trends yeah which is going back to my point the folks in this community there's two aspects there's folks like me who purposefully decided to move here there's another series of folks who purposely decided to stay um i found your conversation with tk fascinating uh last week the stress or the tension between hey you've made it go do your thing and other people like no you have a responsibility back to the community um you see this that strain are you supposed to go and make the best life are you supposed to come back to your community there's so many layers to those decisions that's right so many layers um brings up one other point that i want to wanted to make and that is um the whole we're all members one body with each each with a different role some of us are to be eyes some of us to be arms some of us going off with pauls and you can preach it much better than i can we all have different roles in the kingdom here all of us are different it's jordan peterson what a great don't compare yourself with who someone else is today compare yourself with who you were yesterday um you cannot look at someone else and say oh i should be doing more i should be doing as much as i should be doing less than we're all uniquely created uniquely gifted um and and just try and line up with with the lord's will for you for your family for your life so that's another thing i want to put out there for all the people who are now like processing their white guilt maybe freshly what resources who are you and and where do you fit into the kingdom don't don't take this cookie cutter you have to say these phrases you have to do these actions that's not that's not what we're called to do yeah yeah that's not what we're called to do i i reflect on and i this is something this is a conversation i wish i had had with my father while he was alive because there i had a lot of conversations with him and i don't actually have many of these that i think gosh i wish although he would have loved the video stuff that i'm doing this would have fascinated him but i when i think about my father's story he grew up in the crc diaspora in tiny little unimportant churches in the midwest you know Wisconsin Rapids Hancock Minnesota Leighton Iowa um you know i don't where would he have seen a black person you know maybe on a train okay because back then they took trains but i get the sense that they drove a lot anyway so he came to Patterson knowing very very little about the culture he was sent to engage with now over the course of his ministry he learned a tremendous amount they would have you know February's Black History Month and so they would have these black history competitions at church and he would always win because he read a lot of books um the new black history well but why did he why did he why was he able to be effective in that community and and again see now i listen to critical race theory and i hear okay you're white don't come in as the expert you know that's not bad advice that's good advice come and learn and see it's a Christian it's sort of a secularish version of be a servant and that's a good thing yes now it gets it gets it gets messed up because again and this is what happens in secularity because there's not enough headroom for the good idea to actually fully breathe come on in and be a servant why well because the meek will inherit the earth because you know those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be satisfied but if you're a secularist you say when will they be satisfied and if you've lived lives like you and i have oh by 2030 i'm skeptical yeah not gonna happen so what is your justification for being a servant what is your justification for coming in and saying and i saw so many of the Dutch white folks who they didn't know much about culture or racism or anything else but they came into the community and what did they do they'd say you know what i know how to cook a meal i know how to babysit a child i know how to tie the tiny little amount of money that i have i know how i i can give my time to love my neighbor and i'll even love the i'll even love the the disappointing the selfish the undeserving neighbor of whatever color because my Jesus loves me yeah so i'm not going to come in with some big theory and some big answer to solve all the problems of this world i am going to come in and i'm going to be a servant and i'm going to be teachable and i'm going to learn and i'm going to listen and so again i look at critical theory and they're like white people should listen to black people yeah okay should right but that doesn't mean to say that in time someone might have something to say that you know we're all learning from each other is a body and and so well this is another one of those intellectual disc connect privilege yes i've had white privilege in certain ways what were my white privileges the fact that my parents stuck together through some absolutely crazy stuff right we have been one of the white privileges is you've talked about this um you know that that the religious and the wealthy are the ones who still do marriage it's hard it's difficult i benefit i wouldn't say staying married is white privilege but that's but that there's more there's higher rate there have been historically higher percentage rate of marriages intact marriages first absolutely absolutely because there was concerted effort in slavery to destroy yes and and not allow black marriages absolutely so then you come to a community or you're interacting with folks and you say well wait maybe folks should stay married maybe you should wait till you're married to have children all of those things which are beneficial to the next generation and you say well you can't say that because that you're imposing your cultural your whiteness on your black on the black folks it's like well no i'm trying to share things that were beneficial to me that i think would be beneficial to you it's the whole loving god it's trying to love people without loving god right god set up these institutions god set up these ways that we interact with folks um that have generally been beneficial to our little dutch soul culture um and to and to say oh you can't tell someone of a different culture or a different race that this is a good thing that seems foolish to me it seems foolish to me that you can't say look if you you know get educated get married have kids in that order life will be better for you that comes from our culture um or it's common in our culture maybe it doesn't come from our culture but it's common in our culture i'd say it is a it's a well and the marriage question is complicated because these these things and and again i i i watch people talk about them today and i feel so old because in some ways when i got here i talked to earl marlick who of course was my father's generation and earl marlick is often like oh we talked about these things 20 years ago so i get to things now it's like oh crap we talked about these things 20 years ago i'm so old sure we did and and so then when i hear someone like glenn laury on a recent video basically saying you know in some ways not in always in some ways you know the black community has taken steps backwards even from what it had achieved under the injustice and strain of the obvious blatant legalized apartheid systemic racism of jim crow when you look at and this is this is again something that something that i see often there are not many what one of the benefits of pastoring a church like i pastor here is that i get to be pastor for some of my heroes some of the people that grew up in jim as black and jim crow south and endured that and it didn't embitter them and people are talking about you need to listen to the victims of systemic racism and say okay well there's a lot of systemic racism around i'm going to listen to the victims of of the some of the worst systemic racism north america has seen within the lifetime of any living person here so i am going to look at people like and i'm not going to name their names on the video people like these people in my congregation who grew up in the jim crow south and and through christianity learned to endure and whether or not they knew the heideberg catechism you know what they were living they were living misery deliverance gratitude because they knew they were not going to fix this system that was way too big and powerful for them but they knew how to be christian inside of it and they knew how to love people and and they are my heroes i will call out a few names because i missed them they've passed on there's a whole generation in the 25 years we've been in chicago that have passed on i missed the mr tailors and the miss washington's and the miss minis there was a depth and a richness and just a spirituality and just solid solid people and they passed on and we we have lost something in that generation yes we have and we have lost i'll name one in northside chapel doug harrison you know doug harrison was an intellectual and and i think part of why he and my father and his son his son you know dougie you know still lives in patterson and but but you know so you know what you know what my father so much of what my father learned he learned from doug harrison and earlier and it was that generation and and i look at i look at what's ha i i look at what's happening now and i think i i'm part of me is happy my father isn't here to see it because oh let's let's let's let's not kill each other let's not burn down our own neighborhoods yes there are issues with police i'm a calvinist there will always be issues with police yes we have issues with race we will always have them that's no excuse not to work on them we will work on them but let's not let's not kill each other in the process please it's heartbreaking to me to see developments that i've either been directly or indirectly involved in rebuild like food desert issues here on the west side of chicago and to see a gas station that sent sat empty for and five years ago or ten years ago whatever it was get renovated and now it's burned a little strip shopping center boarded up just indiscriminate they took out mary's bar b side of chicago it's it's the most west side of west side chicago i was talking with someone who rents an apartment and she she teaches the little girl of the niece i believe of the owner and it's just indiscriminate indiscriminate destruction and torture and if i were walmart we struggled so hard to get walgreens to come back to the neighborhood and the grocery stores and burned and looted burned and looted and when you have the latin kings aligning because the chicago police department in the politics of that the latin kings defending their neighborhood so now you're reigniting or blaming the gangster disciples versus latin kings i i live a half a block from their dividing line from their turf the railroad track they just like things had had been calming down what and yes there are outside agitators but it was also it was youth from this community they were looking for opportunity they were bored COVID had a piece of this oh COVID had a huge piece of this i have several friends who are doctors i'm gonna get in trouble what a mistake what a mistake the week before all this blew up our ultimately intersectional mayor she's a lesbian black woman who used to be on the police review board so it was like and tagged the organization that kept the police in check she is not woke enough for this crowd the week before all of this exploded here in my town she was setting police she was ticketing people who were trying to gather in socially distanced church services she was sending police to knock down or to open up the doors of southside black churches that were gathering with masks socially distanced because it was against her shutdown order she shut down the front still shut down it is a it is criminal she said she would put you in jail for walking along the lake we've been under this for several months now talk about packing a powder keg full it didn't matter whether it was george floyd or something else this was gonna pop this was gonna pop this is more deadly than the virus by several orders of magnitude i'm sorry to all my doctor friends um i'm sorry to all my doctor friends um i i think he i i think i this one in this judgment was made well well let's let's um we've been doing a little ranting and a little bit of preaching let's let's turn towards um hope what what sure do you have any hope oh boy not in this age i do not um i do not i lost that a while ago which is why i'm so grateful for the journey with you and jordan peterson and uh bringing back the perspective of the age to come um i'm very concerned where we are going as a community and as a country i think the voices that our little corner of the internet and these conversations are so important i feel like they are being drawn out by the mob right now by all these people who feel like they need to do something so we're going to tear down the statue of this person who said something racist or did something imperfect um i thought you're person who said something racist or did something imperfect um i thought you're or reprehensible um i thought your interaction with chloe uh i'm not valdory valdory was great where it's like you know coming up with all these flawed individuals mlk was a flawed individual melcomx was a flawed individual um you're not gonna find not gonna find many that are no paul van der klees have fallen you know so is dan wagen maker um so i do not i do not have that kind of hope i think we have to go through it um the lord works in mysterious ways one thing that's been interesting about the american church i was thinking this uh maybe a year or two ago as i was uh it's interesting how in eastern european the soviet union all of that the church was suppressed the eastern orthodox that whole uh and you know in the west we kind of flourished and we had our day in the sun and then as uh your your sense of decadence and decay and the the etymology of those two words you know we've been what's been revitalizing the church in america it's the eastern strand that was that was underground you know the death the death that's bringing glory yeah um that that sense of what peugeot has talked about the the fool bringing back the king yeah um so where is the you know where is that flip gonna happen i don't know so yeah i don't think resistance to the blm movement right now is gonna do it they have the narrative right the story governs stuff the statistics are in the you know black folks have it a lot better now than they did in the 60s those are the statistics police brutality is down killings were dropping um all of the statistics were moving in the right direction but the story is that it's not and the story is trumping the stuff the story is is controlling the data so i i don't know where the story is going to come i don't know um if i figure it out i'll let you know i i um karen i haven't i haven't listened to the whole thing yet but karen and um and michael karen released another conversation yesterday and karen's preacher john ortberg has been doing a series on hope and karen's been um sending me emails about hope um and you know hope hope is this hope is this funny thing and i i i only listened to it once so i haven't really been able to capture it and articulate it yet but um basically in john ortberg made the point and i'm gonna have to check this myself in the classic world hope was a word for basically something that you there's there's no hope for hope is like a false you know hope in the classic world was false hope you know basically the apostle paul comes along and and basically looking at the risen christ says no hope is hope is a real thing and um hope is is based on a promise and so i you know i i and and i think i think the the the skepticism that we that we use in addressing critical theory uh can be used to address our own little implicit narratives of what hopefulness now would look like because you know the the thing about these self-salvation schemes is is we they're awfully hard to not harbor in our hearts and we always get excited when we see a little something that seems to be along the way of our narrative and and oh that is good and fine but um you know in many ways america is repeatedly the victim of its own success and the triumphalism we see in critical theory is in many ways riding the back of the success of you know many of the heroes who trained in churches to actually accomplish the you know getting getting legal apartheid out of our systems that was an astounding victory and and when you when you hear people um catastrophizing about a situation that is certainly not perfect might even be bad but they're clearly catastrophizing um um well you know what it's going to be interesting to see when i look at when i look at a lot of when i look at a lot of the uh those who are making a lot of the noises not not all certainly but some they're young and and so i look at you know the chas district in seattle and i'm not panicked about that i'm thinking all right so you know it it's happening a lot of these young people are going to get a chance now to experiment with some things they're going to experiment with reality they like us have the ought to be given the liberty as young people to have idealistic notions about how i'm going to go out there i've got all my imagined i've got all these solutions that that i remember one conversation i had with my father about and i think about this now and i just think oh what a brat i was um i made a conversation about how you know if i ever pastor a church in north america it's going to grow big and i look at living stones and i just look at myself say what a brat i was my father just looked at me when i said that and you know i think he's just i think he's just laughing from glory at this point if he ever has a moment to think about that but you know the idealism that i went to the dominican republic with and the idealism that i come to so many things and just like you say that idealism has to die on the rocks of reality but along with that idealism dies so many of my idols and and so i take this thing which really is an idol and i don't know it and i think it's a tool and i whack whack whack and it crumbles in my hand and suddenly i begin to realize oh i had an idol yeah okay and and so now it's my savior coming to me and saying are you finished yet are you are you ready to let me be your savior and lord instead of you sure i die these deaths all the time we all do yeah we all do and i i think there's an element to like young idealism is there's a certain element that's good the peterson don't interrupt someone when they're skateboarding yep yep yeah right you gotta test the limits of where this is at yep so we're testing the limits yep it may have dire consequences but i'm not in charge of when the world ends or begins and so you ride the wave yeah yeah you ride the wave and so i'm i look at i look at this generation and can i critique their ideas sure do i think i know better than they do of course um i i really hope they don't you know because what i what i what i want for them is not too much blood on their hands unfortunately so often as human beings that's how we really learn and okay you decided you wanted to run a protest good for you there are things to protest and i think jonathan shows video on protest absolutely fine you go right ahead and you go out there and protest let's see if you can keep your protest non-violent these people learned that's not such an easy thing to do no it's not and they needed discipline and they needed organization and so but then when you had your protest and the only the only walgreens in walking distance for your grandmother who needs her prescription gets um gets looted and burned and walgreens doesn't want to take a chance on your neighborhood again for the same reason you're not finding a trader joe's in your neighborhood and you realize that now everyone has to buy their groceries in the corner store and all of us know what the corner store prices are like and the kinds of things they have that's right you can buy diet soda and packaged food all you want you're not going to have fresh fruits and vegetables and i've watched here in the city of sacramento them fighting those fights to get those grocery stores into the neighborhood you have one incident like this and these are private corporations they they're they're looking at their bottom line and saying i'm not going to put a grocery store in there do you know that fresh fruits and vegetables um they decay and quickly that's right and so it's a high the reason they cost money is because there's a ton of loss and so you know and and again it's like all of these things that we saw in the 60s and 60s and 70s and it's like are we going to do this again really right are we really going to do this again can you read a little bit about what happened then because it's extremely well documented and there's even people alive who have been there so can we talk and and many of these trips never came back around this area was burned in the 60s many of these commercial strips never came back some of them did many of them didn't and um it's interesting the overlays of the late 60s you know the rocket launch the i know this yeah history doesn't repeat but it sure does rhyme absolutely yeah well any anything else you wanted to get out there dan i sure appreciate the risk that you took and wanting to come on my channel and speak your piece this has been wonderful thank you for giving me the platform and hopefully some folks have can glean something from our rantings and ramblings a couple of you know old dutch white guys but i don't know i feel like you and i we we have things to say and hopefully someone will gain something from them so thank you well thank you dan just just stay on the line i'll just end the recording now okay
