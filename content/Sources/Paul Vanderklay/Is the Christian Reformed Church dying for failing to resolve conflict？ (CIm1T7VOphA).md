 One Hi, this is Paul and I'm doing another video on Overtures for the Christian Reformed Church Synod those of you who usually watch my channel and look for Jordan Peterson content There probably won't be any Jordan Peterson content in this video. So I'm warning you right away this will be mostly Christian Reformed Church content and the Senate of the Christian Reformed Church is the Largest assembly that we have it's a bi-national assembly of the United States and Canada made up of representatives from classes which are regional assemblies and and office bears from churches and so each year overtures come to this Senate for action and for conversation and discussion and I'm making these videos to basically prime the pump for For Senate deliberation about these overtures and also give some background about these overtures because all of these overtures have Background so today we're going to be discussing an overture written by David snapper. And so we have David in this group I also have Brad Smith and Rod Hugen I did want to make a comment some some people have written me asked me asking me about the selection of the people I've chosen for these videos Most of the people in these videos are from an old listserv a listserv is is kind of the predecessor to Facebook or Twitter It was a way that via email groups of people could have conversation and there's an old listserv called CRC voices But I that a number of us David and Rod have participated in for for over 20 years Brad is a lurker and he chimes in every now and then But this is part of the reason I choose people from voices often for these conversations is that I have a long history of conversation with these people and I know that they're good at it and so that's part of why I Make I select them for these videos. So I let's go around I'm gonna have I think I'll have David introduce himself last because because then after that he's gonna introduce the overture So Brad, why don't you go first and then Rodney? Alright, so my name is Brad Voss. I'm the pastor of Crossway Church in Battleground, Washington We are a CRC church plant that just ditched church plant status. Actually, we officially became organized This year we my wife and I were I started it with just the two of us So that's a pretty small way to start but God's been gracious Even though we've made pretty much every mistake in the book, I think I was a youth pastor before that at first year see in Mount Vernon and before that I was actually a mechanical engineer and I was a chief engineer at the time Mechanical engineer and grew up in Northwest, Iowa. So Another Iowa boy. How about that? Iowa boys there they're up and coming in the world Now Iowa boy number two. Yeah, I was born in Pella, Iowa the purist of the pure Hey, I can claim that too And also a church planter although we are we we remain unorganized so I always love that phrase the unorganized church and it actually reflects who we are Pastor of a church called the village in Tucson, Arizona for the last 17 years and We are We got a building of about eight years ago and we're just gonna be voting or not voting but talking about Moving to two services we kind of packed out our building. So that's really fun Then a Church that's really founded on some deep discipleship Problem are things that just ways of being deeply in each other's lives and I've loved every minute of it. I also spend some time trying to raise up and help the church plant other churches and so mentoring pastors and Pastoring pastors is something I love to do and The Classes also pays me to do that but also most any other thing that they think that they need done so it's been kind of fun to to do that and Really interested in this topic and interested in this overture Okay, David well, I Am David snapper and I'm from Silverdale, Washington north of Brad a hundred and a few miles we are on the peninsula opposite the Seattle area and we Are up against the Olympic Mountain Range I've been here for 30 some years about 30 or 34 years now and I planted anchor of hope church in Silverdale Washington and retired recently and So I'm finding myself doing other projects in in the meantime And I hope it's okay that I say this Paul, but my father was in the Marine Corps, but he was born So he lived many many places, but he was born in Iowa. I hope that's okay Lone New Jersey person In Iowa for a few years there you go So I'm not sure where he was born exactly but my my grandmother Took a stagecoach from Hall to the big corner and then she rode the train down to Sue Center and then a farmer would pick her up and take her home in a Buckford wagon on the weekends because she was teaching at the Hall and lived in Orange City So it's a long time ago So The overture Paul first I want to say thank you and I appreciate the effort you put into this I mean, it's a huge effort and it's a great benefit I think to the church that you you do this for the church we're going to be able to see sort of the heart and the soul of some of the overtures that are coming to Senate and I know when I saw the one of the first ones a few weeks ago I was so impressed with the the character behind overture 12 It really changed a lot of my mind and my thinking and so my hope today is is not merely the content of this But the heart of an overture when you write an overture you're aware how limited your words are little you have to to get this great idea across and It's as much content as it is the personality behind the overture. So yeah, this will be helpful So Actually for a number of us on voices This has been something you've been working on for quite a few years actually and even even before we get to the overture let's talk about your your fascination with yearbooks and numbers and and not just the Trust of the numbers but the the heart behind this Okay, so my my story started in 19 It's so long ago I give my decades mixed up here but 1978 I was in the In the thrift store in Grand Rapids, Michigan where we were students and I was we're poor and I picked up a yearbook This is the yearbook from I had a box of these and this was for three dollars I got the yearbooks from 1901 to 1976 So this is 1901 yearbook the covers ripped off what's a year in the front cover I Opened it up and there's my grandfather Or my great-grandfather Dominus Wylan DSJ start and I'm saying that's totally cool and I had to buy the whole box of them and Sure enough because I came from math and physics like Brad did I said I gotta start charting these things and So back up a little bit and explain a little bit what a yearbook is and why your great-grandfather's picture would be in one Oh, I'm sorry. You know what it you get so I Get so lost in my own story yearbook is is like a telephone directory of the Christian Reformed Church that records the names and the addresses and the Sort of the demographics of the churches their members The number of churches who's the pastor at which church and then it includes the families a Number of families the number of adult professing members and the number of non professing members that we call children or baptized members and it has some other sort of demographic information as well and I started charting that and even though I was in seminary. I still have this love for measuring and counting things and It I started charting them and to do a completely random started study I started with Alto, Wisconsin and Zilla, Washington and I just charted out first it was the first and last church's alphabetic like and I started them out and And you know if you put the two charts on top of each other you couldn't tell no part That's interesting and then I went and I charted. Oh, they'll say Granville Avenue in Grand Rapids, Michigan Whoa, what a different chart that was because it grew up to about 2200 members and it went up like Mount Everest and it came down like the Matterhorn. It was just up It was down. I thought that's fascinating and I was hooked and I Began so I began and so here we go. Here's the introduction of this in 1978 Harold Becker asked me if I would like to do a thm dissertation with him for a year as as his student He was a city alderman of Grand Rapids and he was a professor at seminary and I would work with him in this city as An alderman and I did thm research at the seminary and my study was the church and its relationship to the city in historical perspective and So I got out maps from the old city and I started putting churches on the maps and sizes of churches and I plotted them out I learned something immediately That if I knew where a church was located in the in the city, I could tell you how big it was And it wasn't even a question. I could do this 100% reliability because it's that sort of Predictable as a fun in geography and time of planting Well, that was the first Step the second one is 1994. I did a doctoral ministry study and I did the same sort of thing at a Nationwide scales that are just the city. I went to the nation what I discovered there were clusters and let's say Brad is from Northwest, Iowa and Sioux Center is one of those cities that defines Northwest If you have a church in Northwest, Iowa in the middle of the cluster like Sioux Center, it'll be a large church Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, we're all these are all Christian reform churches If you have a church in Sioux Center is going to be a large church the further you get away the farther You get away from the city The smaller the churches get until you get to the next cluster that might be in Minnesota or wherever it is It's like a geographic Model or an attraction model like car dealers Cardiolers work in clusters not in isolation the more cluster they are the better they are So out of that came some several several important observations One is that in this gravitational model the larger the cluster the bigger the churches So like Grand Rapids, Michigan Grand Rapids East which is the home of the Christian Reformed Church is a high concentration of people If you draw a 20 mile radius circle, you can put about 60,000 people who are Christian reformed inside that circle They're going to have large churches 400 600 is not at all in common a thousand It's not as common anymore, but it it it certainly was if you go farther away to a non-cluster area You're gonna have smaller churches churches are going to be 50 people And 60 people as a rule My interest was church planting If you plant a church in a cluster chances are five and eight that it will see 200 people in the lifetime of the pastor Five out of eight. That's pretty good that it will see 200 if you are in isolation That is not in a cluster your chances are one in eight of seeing 200 people Wow So it's five times Or however, you like to measure it more likely to see 200 people which is kind of the standard definition of successful church planting If you're in a cluster then out of a cluster So that was to me Really significant it was not only true in the city where I first did the study of Grand Rapids But it's also true it serves a nationwide rule and if you go to Palau Belinden or Sioux Center or Chicago and Indiana Those clusters of churches will be where the large ones are and it's a it's rare that an isolated church grows large Then that takes us to now that's all interesting for church planting but there's a lot more to that that underlies the the overture Larger churches are more viable. They have more margin for error. They're more resources that they have Just more connection in a cluster of 2,000 people if you have a bad pastor They can the members can migrate over to second Christian Reformed Church and hang out there So it's kind of safety in that that happens all the time Yeah Exactly, but it helps the community. That's a critical mask and move around a little bit But it's ultimately it's healthy. So but if you're in Silverdale, Washington, and you don't like Dave snapper What are you gonna do and hardly anybody doesn't like Dave snapper? Yeah Well, then they then they leave the CRC maybe or they who knows what happens well The the larger clusters tend to be much stronger. They don't lose members as fast They hold on to the members of critical mass for biological growth. They have attractive growth. They have more resources. They have more institutions There's just simply more going on that holds members Isolated churches are much more I'm gonna call vulnerable Because all it takes is one bad event and the whole church blows up Yeah, and it can't self recover because it doesn't have a critical mass to draw on to help itself Yeah, now we're getting towards the overture For years the Christian informed churches experienced conflict and the conflict is particularly hard on the isolated churches Because it is not attractive to join a Church which has a context of conflict and so even though The largest of the the what I'm calling clusters. Now again, I'm gonna redefine define a cluster again just for clarity If you can draw a circle of 20 miles radius and you can put 2,000 Christian informed church people in it. That's a cluster So clusters are strong enough to withstand a lot of external conflict Isolated churches don't have that and they're more vulnerable to To upset from from the outside our conflict this overtures trying to say This overtures trying to say has been a meaningful part in The church's denomination inability to attract and maintain new members and by Reducing the conflict through intentional effort of forgiveness and reconciliation The church can reduce this conflict and make it Ministry overall more attractive and more viable in the long run and this will particularly help the small churches But it will also change the sort of the culture of the larger community as well So how how significant is this in the year 1993? We were at? 316,000 members. Do you want me to pull up those charts? You know, would you please Paul let's just go ahead and do that we get done, you know the difficult part out of the way Can y'all see this is why you're glad you don't have an engineer in your house Let's let's look at the charts now we're looking at a pink chart left hand Image is going to be the total congregations in the Christian reform church starting in 1857 we start from 12 and we're going up to 1100 The second chart on the on the lower row is going to be the total members versus the Number of congregations. So the blue line is the same blue line. It's just on a different scale now You'll see that we grew and we grew and we grew and we grew until 1993 and then one year We decisively stopped growing we were growing at the rate of over 2,000 members a year for 130 years and One year we changed to losing 3,000 members a year. That's a Delta of 5,000 now. That's a dramatic Changed in the life of a church number three chart on the lower end there is A congregations versus children again the same thing is measuring the number of Buildings or pulpits that we have and the blue line on top is the number of children or baptized Children in the church and there we see Once again a dramatic drop in 1993 now the drop is so precipitous That you can't explain it by saying it was just a demographic shift That all the young women in the church stopped having babies in 1993 I don't think you could say that the upper right hand chart is Professing is families professing members children and total members And what I want you to see here is the lower two lines the yellow line and the kind of orange Line if you have good resolution Yellow line is a number of children and The orange ish line is a number of families What that's showing is that the yellow line crossed below the orange line and that means that we have less children than families We're no longer a self-sustaining church Unless all the children married maybe a non Christian or from church member and had three children or four children or five children That's not particularly likely so long term we have just crossed this threshold in our whole history of Being fewer children and families very significant for us and in our Covenant family based Theology history if you want to go down a little bit Paul on the beige part Can we do that Or maybe not yep Okay This is the chart. This is the same one is above only now It's expanded a little bit the one with the red If this were your business if you are a farmer and this were your production if you were a 7-eleven store and this were your sales you would say this is a problem this is a Huge transition in the life of the church we're picking up in 1963 here, so this is a different time frame than the than the earlier charge same data But starting in 63 We are smaller now that in 2018 than we were in 1963 by About 40,000 members 30 plus maybe a little more than 30,000 members. I didn't do that math We've lost again members each year. We lost 7,000 members last year though The people who do the counting suggests me that's partly a clerical Change in the way, they counted numbers not quite that much But the fact is we're at 227 as opposed to 316 and once again the blue line is is the children and That number is is likewise going south So we've lost a lot of members I'm The concern of the overture is that a big portion of this is due to conflict that came to a head and literally in 1993 a quarter of it our membership is due to the changing birth rates and maybe a quarter of our membership loss is Due to the conflict that stops us from attracting new people there's kind of a snowball effect because When people left in 1993 wasn't just a bunch of old people who left as young people who left as well as old people And they put their children their young children with them and now 25 years later We're reaping the kind of the rewards of of that time period Do we have enough charts or do you want to see more charts or save some art for later? Or save some art for later. Well, we can save more for later unless there's something you I mean you can know Okay, so there's more on the next page, but we'll come back to those later if Okay, if you have more you see there she was do yeah. Yeah, okay My my purpose in writing the overture was after these two experiences about church growth I did a workshop on how to forgive and we did a video about that Yeah, you and I did a video about that and it's I think it's a it's a big deal It's a big deal in the Bible that we have to forgive and get over things But in the Christian Reformed Church the year 1993 was was one of those Epical moments in which years and years of conflict came to a head There were 52 overtures descended in 1992 there were 77 overtures in 1996 many of Most of this was about the conflict and one day Senate came up with a solution and BAM it was over and In 1998 for example, there were 19 overtures So it was just boom. It was it was over and done the emotions the drama the bitter conflict Was locked in stone and there were just absolutely nothing more to be said in fact classes Lake Erie, I believe was a very strong proponent of the changes and as very much of the center of the conflict and the suit is decided after Years and years years of conflict over a decade of conflict. Their next overture was we can't have any more discussion about it so Now David in all fairness people within the CRC are going to know what the conflict is people outside the CRC are not now For this video you you said something about You're not trying to make us you're not trying to make a statement with respect to what the conflict was about Why don't you talk about that a little bit? Okay, very good conflict was about the ordination of women in office and Should the Christian Reformed Church ordained women as elders and therefore as ministers of the church I Want to be clear that there were people hurt on both sides of this debate there were mistakes made by everybody and whatever the decision was is Is that's over and done but the emotional drama of that moment was locked in and Then classes like Gary and just perfect form I Sure, I've got a right. I'm not looking at her in front of you But I think I got it right and if I got it wrong, I really apologize to the classes like Gary but the overture was we'll make a committee they'll receive all the approval and disapproval, but Senate did the right thing and therefore the conversation is over until 20 of the year 2000 and the decision Senate made was I Don't know yet. I didn't look it up. I just remember I so annoyed. I didn't bother to even look Because it didn't matter. It didn't matter what see if that was the mindset of the time was that we won you lost It's over Okay, that's the big thing to remember we won you lost it's over But it wasn't over because the emotions the hurt the feelings are still there All the times that the kids used to come over to grandma's house for Christmas dinner Didn't happen anymore for a lot of people and that hurt goes on Howard spawn from classes Columbia Wrote an overture and it's and he complains about the procedure But he says the debate about women in ecclesiastical offices raged in varying degrees of intensity for two decades And the actions have brought pain to the entire denomination many CRC were hurt by the Surprising action of Senate 1993 and and he just goes on now as a churchman. He he knows that That's the pain of this is is more important than the decision that was made I could I could go on but we we The Fract ministers and those who resigned voluntarily we had to go out of our way to treat them as if they were deposed We couldn't just let them resign in many cases. We just had to insult them on the way out the door. I Talked to one of them recently and I mean 25 years later. He still can't talk about it. He's so hurt Now that happened on both sides men women hurt left right got that But we as a denomination were responsible for a lot of this and we've done nothing To address it on either side Now I'm saying that conflict Lasts in the corporate memory of the church and it is still doing damage to this day And my best analogy for this is the breakup of the RCA and the CRC in 1857 when the CRC broke away from the RCA the hurt has lasted for a hundred years and Just now we're getting over it so hundred and forty years Just now resolved we shouldn't do that and now the RCA is Tearing themselves apart over same-sex marriage right, so we're gonna join with them and join forces again and and Go down together So I have This passion that I believe the only way to get us unstuck Is to purposefully and intentionally go back and address the hurts like Howard Spahn said from classes, Columbia in about 1996 Address those hurts and resolve them Yeah, well, so That's that's a lot of talk that's that that's that's that's your overture and there are obviously a lot of pieces to it There's when you look at a systemic decline like we're looking at there could be a lot of ways into that I think I want to give Brad and Rod a chance to comment on what they've heard so far And I don't know who wants to go first between the two of you Well, I mean, you know the interesting thing is I actually was in I'll date myself but I was in college in the middle of those turbulent years and high school and so I But I did have family members that we didn't talk about church for about five years because I had Family members in Pella that were part of that split and we we didn't stop engaging with each other But we did stop talking about church for a number of years because of that But I wasn't in ministry in the midst of all of that of all of it. So in some senses, um, You know while I'm aware that church has left I'm not aware of some of the baggage and so it's interesting that my take On the CRC and its decline is different but hearing your story actually probably has me come out this overture a little bit different because I'm not usually one to Think that symbolic acts by an institution is necessarily the way to go It just I don't read Senate lines so that but I think if we could create if it's a start to a a Heart of reconciliation you might have won me over just in your talk right here actually if I was if I was at Senate Because of that because I do think though That there there are wings. You're gonna have a wing no matter what when you have a group of people I mean if you talk to any denomination you talked about the RCA Paul You're gonna have a wing the PCA if you talk to those guys I've been talking to some of those guys lately just in some conversation They have wings the thing about it is do we know what brings us together and and That's hard to figure out sometimes the denomination I would say and for me that's kind of where we try and work out as a church because I have people who are split on politics The issue of Women leadership and all that stuff and really the only thing that we can do to bring us together is what is it that? You really does unite us what are the core things and then say hey this is our opinion and can we live in tension with each other and and so I You know, I think we got to learn to live with that tension and the tension is is a really a civil respect for each other And it sounds like that's kind of where you're you're trying to go with this overterm I write David in the sense of what you're saying is hey look We disrespected a lot of people on both sides on the way out the door and we need to start to say hey Look, like we need to own up to that and say hey We we didn't treat you with the respect that you deserve we kind of pigeon-holed you in either kind of a way and we kind of push you out the door and you want to start that process of Of respect as a lead-in to forgiveness and reconciliation. Is that right? That's certainly correct. Yes Okay So I mean it's I kind I kind of come from I mean my ministry experience is very much after the conflict So my take on the CRC is I see conflict but I don't have the baggage of it Um, and I think that that does color me quite a bit Um, you know when I was a youth pastor, I was a youth pastor at the church. It was very conservative I was that first year seeing Mount Vernon and I remember Mike Coy was the guy who kind of took me under his wing and Was a great. I mean, he's great. He's still a friend But it was interesting coming in post two splits they split to the Orthodox CRC and they split to a more contemporary CRC and I mean, I was I was a youth pastor in a conservative church so, of course, there's gonna be some conflict and just naturally in that and wrestled with hey I'm hoping to engage my people in the church my kids in the church and keep them in their faith But I also had this just point blank say to my elders. Hey look the reality is is that I'm training them Hopefully to engage their faith, but their faith is very different than what's displayed here in the church And so they may not come back to this church Which is the demographic of what you're talking about because there may not be a CRC that meets their needs And so they might many actually have left because of that which is an interesting dynamic there but I'm aware of it, but I don't have the institutional baggage of it. Does that make sense? so for me like I Sense it now I sense the conflict right now and the issues at hand and I would say Mike you're probably right There are some carryover in that but I've come into ministry since 1999 and so I Come with the fresher thing and and where I was going with the first year see thing is there were Conversations that they were having at first and there were hurts that I didn't actually even you know It wasn't my experience in some of that. I had my own fresh battles so to speak But sometimes the the the cumulative effect of it would make decisions So I mean in for an example, I would come in I'm the guy who's like well Let's try this well that and Mike would say well that kind of was a big battle 15 years ago well, we would try and it wouldn't be a battle because It had we'd we'd moved on and so sometimes those wounds do take you forward and they do create divisions or make you Think that there are divisions that are there that maybe not might not even be as pressing now I'm not arguing there aren't divisions in the CRC and that we need to work on it and reconcile it but I I'm well aware of my my not survive not doing ministry in the middle of those years that You actually brought me to a place where I kind of respect I Kind of come out I gotta say you kind of changed my mind on the overture Because and there's a point part of me that's kind of like well, what's the point? But I hear what you're saying is there's an accumulative baggage that we need to deal with and this is only one first step Alright, how about you Rodney? Yeah, it's interesting because I come from From classes, Arizona, which is barely existing any longer like There are very few churches and all so we lost a church in Scottsdale closed a church in in the Orangewood Church in Glendale closed there were So now there's just two Christian informed churches in the Phoenix metro area the Phoenix Church had planted those churches and And In that back in the growth days the early days and we founded classes, Arizona I was part of the group that helped to write the bylaws of the original founding of a classes and it was for the sake of growth, right we're gonna be the church planting classes and I also helped start a church in North Phoenix that existed for about ten years and then died Went away and got sent to Tucson to plant a church Found a similar thing here where we had two old line established Christian reform churches The second one was born out of conflict with the first I I think that's always true to be honest I think so many of the churches that I see were born out of conflict. They were born out of This group and this other group can't live together It impacted me in a big way the The the church that I was Basically, I was born in Iowa. So went to Pella to which I think I went to Pella to because Pella one was a little too liberal or something but But when but I was eight years old when we left so I have no no knowledge of that But I was part of the Phoenix CRC the finish Christian from church and grew up in that and that was my home church and And then it split over the women in office issue and pretty much split in half and I know for me personally there was a lot of anger about that. Even though I was no longer part of the church I was out planting a church so or Working in church in the church planting movement So it wasn't this huge deal for me in the sense that I didn't experience it the way but but it literally split families in half and and so the pain of that is real and the I don't know there's a lot of There's something in me that was really angry with the people who split who went away and I remember kind of just being I Don't know particularly mean about that. Like I was really angry Like why would you tear up a church like that? This church was great it was doing fine work and now over this single issue and you're going to not just split but split in an ugly way and say mean things about each other and But then I realized I was saying things about About them and but I harbored that I held on to that for a long time and I know when David and I were talking about forgiveness a long time ago It struck me that I hadn't I hadn't sought To be forgiven for those things that I said I can't control what others do but but I remember making an appointment to approach the pastor of the church that split and Away and just apologizing for the things that I had said and Regretting them because I do and I think there's so much Of that kind of thing in this age of polarization. We are so polarized and we worship polarization And we unfriend everybody on Facebook who disagrees with us and pretty soon we're in these little tiny echo chambers And we we aren't challenged in our faith and we aren't challenged in our beliefs and and we and and there's just this Conflict that just kills so I think well, I'm in Tucson, Arizona. I planted a church I'm the only Dutch Christian Reformed person who they've ever met you know, most these people have never even heard of the Christian Reformed Church and so For me out here there's a there's the tendency to just say oh, that's a that's a thing that that somebody else has to deal With it's not my thing But I deeply love the Christian Reformed Church and I was you know Raised in it. I was taught the catechism. I was taught the ways of faith. I had incredible role models elders leaders teachers who Taught me the faith in rich ways and you know, I I wasn't always I didn't go to seminary. I'm not a Pastor who went to seminary. I I had a midlife crisis. I was in business administration and and Running a big auto parts company and moving out Into doing some some other work with with consulting and so forth, but I But I really felt like I So in this midlife crisis I went through a time of depression came up on the other side saying, you know Go build the kingdom of God plant plant churches be part of this and so So it was a transition thing and so in some ways, I don't feel a part of it and I look at my church Gosh, we have They were just saying the other day that Are in our attendance. There's for every adult we have point seven children So in our church, so we were just 145 hundred fifty member church. We're just jam-packed with children. I got Children everywhere and we're popping them out daily. So it's it's like we've got more pregnant women than you can shake a stick at And somebody should shake It's crazy and and it's fun and it's exciting and there's a part of me I think to That says, you know, I don't want to I don't want to go deal with the past I want to I want to move forward come look at what we're doing here Here's a way forward But I also know that in Scripture it is clear that if you have something against your brother if you have something that you Have done whether it's huge whether whether it's bigger or smaller than what your brother did or your sister did You need to go to them before you even take the bread And the wine and take it in you need to go make it right and so One of my passions and and in our church We have what we call the sinners or we had for years what we called the sinners chair And it was a chair that I bought that was a wooden well-made chair and I painted a black and I Painted the names of the seven deadly sins on it and and I stuck it in the corner and and the reason was Because I had heard or read Probably apocryphal so it's probably not true at all But that Martin Luther had a chair in his house that he called the sinners chair and if you were Broken and hurt and wounded by the world and the things around you were you know awful You could go sit in that chair and the family the people would gather around you You could go sit in that chair and the family the people would gather around you and lift you up to God and Sing over you and that just struck me as something. I want that I want that for myself. I want that from my people But because there's brokenness of hurt it always involves a time of confession and acknowledgement of your sin and then Repentance turning from and then the joy of Being forgiven and walking and freedom that comes from that and so you learn that we now call it the healing chair We repainted it white And put a little red crosses on it because it's brought so much healing to so many people But it is always going back to dealing with the sin and I know our discipleship model is a highly relational Discipleship model so it's on an education driven model. We don't hand people books Matter of fact, I always laugh when I'm on the pastor's thing And so does anybody have a book that I could give my friend like it's never about buying a book it's always about relationship with the person and walking with them and talking with them and hanging out with them and and so yeah it but in our discipleship thing we we have small groups of men and women who and and we we put somebody on what we call the hot seat and we Examine their life and we go back and it's not about the other guys sin It's not about somebody, you know like I'm mad because My wife is evil towards me and did a horrible thing towards me And so it's you know, we want somebody to say yeah, your wife is really bad and commiserate with you But what really is true is I need to say how have I not loved my wife? How do I not pursue my wife? How am I, you know, why do I long for something for her, you know instead of? What am I offering her so I think those are the kinds of things that that make me excited about this But I think like bad that we're it's it's easy to shove it aside. So hey, we're moving forward Let's let's forget about the past. We got more important things to worry about well to me I mean that's the thing that I wrestle with with an overture to be honest with you rod because I feel like if this is an Individual thing that needs to happen. It's a movement that needs to start but I think part of it is just You know, like I would love to you know to know What was that conversation like when you went back and talked to the pastor like was he receptive, you know, how did they go? because I you know, I think they're That's the part of it about the overture that struck me of as I read it is I actually love the grounds We need to place a right relationship over having your your way and Church decline conflict will continue if you persist in prioritizing personal preference over reconciled relationships Reconciliation is the heart of the gospel you got you had me on the grounds The the three steps were the ones where I would say for me It was like what is this gonna accomplish and I had a I mean I have to wrestle with that a little bit in the sense of you know, um It feels like an individual thing and we're trying to address it institutionally Now the institution can set the tone and we can remind people of hey This is a hurt and we didn't move at it But really I don't know the people in my area that have been hurt because I moved here much later Um, you know, I know maybe the people back at my friends in college or that that but I don't know where to start with with that kind of personal side of things And I feel like that's if this is gonna have movements gonna have any Success it has to be a personal thing And so that that's the tension I feel in the overture What do you say david? Um, I think This is a difficult thing because especially now i'm very cognizant that we don't have any women in this group now And in this particular overture, I know a lot of women would say Yeah, but there was a lot of hurt before then and the decision of the christian reform church And the decision of the christian reform church was basically this that that individual congregations and then classes And then once a majority of classes seated women elders at classes Then synod could could seat women elders and that's that's where we're at right now. Many women would say you know i'm you know, i'm i i So i'm going to post this in the crc pastor's facebook group and I don't know how many women will post But I I know enough women in ministry that some of them are going to think in the back of their minds How dare you bring this up that decision in the church was Liberation for me and allowed me to exercise my gifts. Whereas before this we were We were barred from exercising our gifts So we left the crc to go to the rca and the pc usa and churches like that How dare you bring this up those people who left their their they don't have the gospel, right? They're um, you know good riddance i'm glad they're gone and i'm old enough to remember those that exodus And to remember those wars And a lot of people in the denomination felt good riddance. We're glad they're gone What do you say to that david? I say they need to read what jesus said about the subject He said if you've hurt somebody You better not go to communion Until you've come to terms with him Because if you do let me let me jump in but a lot of people say I didn't hurt anyone They hurt me Right. It was a it was a 20 year battle And it continues to this day And even though brad doesn't see it And brad isn't aware is so part of the culture that he doesn't even see it going on around him in the in the in the In the divisions that we see well now I gotta speak up there I I see it but I what i'm saying is I think it's I don't have the emotional baggage So, I mean I wrestle. I mean this is an issue that's in my church We actually are a little bit more on a traditional stance And so we we we do see it. So you're right. I don't see it I don't have the hurt for sure, but I I see the tension still in the crc. It does still exist So i'd agree with you 100 there We have three overtures this year dealing with conflict in the church and our inability to resolve it So we have this long history Now I agree with you paul that I I know that i'm going to be persona non grata for for writing this I got this and I really don't care. I live in washington And and I don't have to go back to michigan and i'm not going back to michigan. Thank you very much They could your conflict avoided right But but let me be clear this applies to both sides There are women who are profoundly hurt and disrespected by Really thoughtless people? And there are men who are hurt by really thoughtless people I'm not taking sides one way or the other. I'm a research scientist This is what i'm doing. I'm doing research and i'm saying here was a process the created hurt I can measure the hurt I can count the hurt I can see the results of the hurt And I know that in the last 25 years we've done nothing at the synodical level to undo the hurt Now I think it's biblical that at the level hurt was done. It has to be undone There's personal hurt. There's institutional hurt. There's classical hurt. There's church hurt It's a whole spectrum of things as brad said brad says I wasn't part of it. Okay But sin had made the decision and they knew exactly what they were doing When um, and i'm not going to say names here But was celebrating this in the overture. Let's stop the conversation There was no doubt about what was going on in that overture when they Deposed ministers and treated them as a person deposed after they'd resigned That was intentional Now that hurt lingers on and i've talked to these people and at least one of them says I can't talk to you about it Anymore because i'm so hurt Um, Matthew says if you've caused that hurt You better go fix it Because you've torn up the body of christ over your opinion on a on a subject Rad you didn't cause that I didn't cause that But listen listen to rod's story listen to hurt he feels Now I can't control I can't ask the urc to come back and say, you know, we were too aggressive That's their problem All I know is that all of us from the top to the bottom Have had a a paddle in the water Who are my age? And at the denominational level of the banner the institutions the publications we've done nothing to undo the hurt and it has continued on by what we call epigenesis Uh for the last 25 years, it just keeps getting worse And we just now have three overtures. We can't even talk about politics together you know so i'm saying Once upon a time we had a movement called we're going to have 400 000 members by 2000 Now we're going to be at two 220 000 by the year 2020 Now in case you didn't do the math, right? That means we're going to be stunningly behind What we attempted and we're losing members ever since this time So we we can push the thing aside we can pretend it didn't happen we pretend it's okay I talked to a person who's involved in inner church relations And said no, I don't want to get involved in fixing this. I'm in inner church relations I don't even go back to my home church because they left and just like ronnie said I don't want anything more to do them I don't think that's right. I think we need to do better than that I wonder um Even in your statement, hey, I can write this and and I am on I never have to go to grand grand rapids again That's that was funny, but that's also conflict avoidance. That's the that is the problem, right? That's one of the problems is we don't walk into the conflict We don't walk into the painful place and I find that all the time in the personal discipleship that we do Um is I don't want to go back. I don't want to have to face the one that that Hurt me right? Um because So that whole that whole idea um, I see that all the time and the last thing I wanted to do was to go talk to this urc pastor and say You know, I hoped that you would fail You know Um, that was my longing And that's a punishment thing that was I want to get even for you for destroying the church that my mother loved and ripping it Up and having half of her friends no longer be able to Talk with her in a rational reasonable way and and that was wrong I think that huge that exodus was huge, but I think the other More Vastly more unseen exodus was all the women who left the christian reformed church over that prior to that decision and we and so I I agree with you reconciliation is Is huge and I uh, and and it doesn't mean that you agree we One of the things that almost split up our church was vaccinations right Because we have we have women who think if you have your child vaccinated you're Sending them to hell and we have women who think that if you don't vaccinate you're sending them to hell And there's arguments in the parking lot I mean literally arguments in the parking lot about who's right who's wrong and i've got evidence all on the internet That I can prove my case either way and i'm sitting there in the middle of all that going this is just stupid Like it doesn't matter if you want to vaccinate your children do it if you don't don't But don't sit here and fight and go to war and then not have relationship not have not be In intimate not be able to even like almost to the point of not being able to take union Because you simply are so angry with the other person for what you perceive to be their stupid decision Either direction and of course, there's a right and a way We just don't you know, and we can there was there's something right about The role of women serving in whatever capacity But there's also this there's this opposite and we and we want to turn it into polarization We want to and I think the christian reform church's sin has always been We try to manage conflict by just playing nice instead of managing conflict By actually going to the one that we firmly disagree with and conversing So the one thing that yes, the one thing that I I wrestle with here and I think I think part of the vaccine thing hits it for me And where i've i've myself feel like i'm called to do in my church because we do have a wide variety of backgrounds in that Is that always frame it and where are we at and the seminary that I went to? Um the profess my theology professor had four d's it's Is this a die for thing? Is this a divide for thing? Is it a decide for thing? Is it a debate for thing? And I think part of the problem is is on the vaccine. I would say that's a debate for I don't have clear guidance on scripture Where that one's at that's a decision making thing But the problem is we yell at it like it's a die for thing When actually we should talk about it in a whisper of saying I really don't know what the bible says about about vaccines Pick it what's best for you And I think part of the conflict that we have is actually We shout about the things that are really in that decide for debate where honestly I gotta say there's not near as clear scripture as there is You could take it if you don't want to do in my i've seen for just split over christian education Um in the sense of are we home school or are we christian school or are we public school? Well, part of it is I said, I don't know I one of the things I love best is I had an elder who had all three of them In every single one one was homeschooled one was christians gold and one was public school because of the needs of the parent But where I know scripture is clear is parents job is to train them up in the way of the lord and then how that flies out and I think it's that's a little bit of of My job is to say where does this fit on kind of the criteria of scripture? Because if it's a if I know that it's a decide for then I can't speak with such uncertainty and I can say we can agree to disagree on this because it's but And we can we can find that common ground because I don't stand on quite as solid of a foundation as I think Does that make sense? I mean and to me that's kind of that's the framework in which I try and come at things Myself to say am I shouting over something? I really need to be whispering Where does it fit on that criteria? Because I I can find my own bully pulpit that I want to and it doesn't have to be women in office It can be something else and to be able to say well maybe I don't stand quite as firmly on scripture or maybe I have to admit that there are more viewpoints on scripture than this than what I would care to admit and and for me that that's where I'd like to talk about the crc moving forward in the sense of What are those die for things those things that that unite this? Um, and and where what are those things and then where are those areas where we have tension? I personally love the fact that I have people in my My elder groups and those that completely disagree on certain topics because there's a healthy tension there I I actually sometimes appreciate tension and conflict as long as it's done in a respectful manner because I actually have to Learn a lot. I it narrow it helps me to clarify My viewpoints on a lot of things When i'm hearing well articulated well thought out Um viewpoints that I had never considered and when I can't just push them aside as the crazy vaccination person or anti vaccination person or the crazy social justice guy or the crazy conservative republic It makes me really wrestle with that and and so But it starts with a mutual respect of saying and and a charity towards that person saying I want to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're trying to actually honor scripture and let's let's wrestle through it together And to me that's what actually energizes me about moving on in the future And what I thought you tried to get a little bit at this overture Um is to to kind of acknowledge that mutual respect. We didn't acknowledge the mutual respect in the past We need to do that. So let's move in that direction I think I've already I i've talked to women pastors who were so wounded And broken by what was done and said to them um and and I It just breaks my heart. I I Long for them to be healed I um And sometimes when you have People who just simply walked away From a conflict or walked away from the pain They didn't walk away from it They carry it to this day as as david says Um, and it's easy It's easy to overlook those voices Than the strident the more strident voice. This is what you know, and and we have that right and both sides Will will tell you and swear before jesus and show you all their scriptural evidence That their side is right and biblical and good Um So it's hard to sit between right? We're always sitting between and and when I or at least I Often find myself sitting between an accuser and a victim or between Two people with a huge disagreement and and you know, I have a kind of an amusing story. We had we have this We have this gal in our church who? Japanese and and so she keeps her house in the japanese style and so When you walk into her house, you take off your shoes and um, And of course she her job is to serve you and so she feels very Offended if you try to help her. We also have this wonderful german lady who who's a member of our church and um, and so um so she She comes from a place where when you walk into somebody's house The last thing you would do is take off your shoes and and and secondly you go help people that you go Help in the kitchen. That's what you do to be kind and nice And so we have this huge conflict right and I have to sit between them and say You know tamaki. I love you. You don't understand this german custom of helping out right and and um, And and it's okay. She's not trying to offend you. She's not trying to hurt you. She's not trying to cause pain she's simply trying to Um to serve you and and then To turn and say and and by the way, tamaki Is just doesn't understand your culture and doesn't understand that what your your heart is so good and you were so intentionally Trying to help so both hearts were good, but you have to sit between them and like translate and and I think there's so much of that that Um, I I go back to it's very individualized, but I think I think what I like about the overture is a the invitation to pray because All conflict is eventually resolved when we're up praying people, but I also think just that whole regular Reminders wherever we find them. I'm not sure um exactly how to do that, but but and whether the the overture Gives us clear ways to to resolve these things, but I but I think resolution Isn't going to come the way we imagine it like Um the Tamaki still going to keep her house In a jama in a japanese style and she's still going to expect people to take off their shoes And if you're not willing to do that or unwilling or and she's not going to want help in the kitchen She has some responsibility to inform people of that right? At at some point because you're living in a new place in a different custom uh, and and so you have to kind of explain yourself and that's sad because I would that I were so attentive to every detail that I would never cause Harm or conflict, but but that's not going to happen. I do and matter of fact just making those videos a step in potentially creating more conflict in my life and The and and not less So so david, you know as as when I started I there's there's kind of two aspects to this overture one is very much the conflict aspect and and I I think you know some of what we've heard in our discussion today will probably hear it sinned rod of Brad you're not going to send it. Are you so rod is the only one of us that that will be a synodical delegate Um the other the other issue here are the are the numbers and you you also were part of um, there's a there's an overture that came in 2017 specifically about the numbers now, do you intend to say with this overture that If if the crc addresses conflict and all of its numbers will go right Are you trying to say that this is the only the only issue with respect to these numbers that are going on Can you talk about kind of the two faces of this overture a little bit? Because you also mentioned the overture part of it was hey How can we deal with the conflict and with the hurt that lingers? The other thing is you know the answer to some of your numbers pushing in 2017 was Oh, we've got things that are you know, we we've got this numbers thing taken care of we have programs that are going And in a sense you come back and say well, uh, we still lost another 8 000 people last year But what's with these what's with these programs that are supposed to address this? So can you say something about that david? sure so ronnie had a Great observation when he said I don't have to go back to grand rapids and he was spoofing me a little bit and said You're just avoiding the conflict just the way you're accusing everybody else of And uh, and that's true, right? Uh, it there's a certain amount of truth in that. Um There are these two issues and they are they're loosely connected We're not sure exactly how they're connected as a as a research scientist. I'm not sure how they're connected But synod said You're right. Well, we've got a lot of momentum going and we've really got some really good stuff going. We've rearranged our boards and We're you know, we got some hopeful momentum going and we've you know, we've rearranged our boards And the churches and they said some other things you can read it in the overture and you can read their letter in their response but but essentially it says Will produce literature and the churches need to admit that they've got a problem and and that's kind of the way the way it landed and I i'm paraphrasing you see go read the exact words, but uh We've lost 88 000 members And there's there's no change in sight on on those numbers Conflict's been big part of the church No one knows what portion of our loss is directly attributable to conflict I mean no one can know that because that Lives in the hearts and the souls of people as rodney has said very well and brad looks at that and he said well That happened sort of before my time and so How do you measure? These things that occur in in in the hearts of people i'm saying If we address our hurts And we establish better relationships than forgiving relationships with all those people that have been hurt on the right and the left the women who left out of frustration and hurt the the others who were Pushed out or felt they had to leave If we could restore that I think jesus instruction to us is Make peace with the person that you've hurt And then the peace of god will come to you And I I just think that's true will that cause church growth? I don't think it will cause church growth But I tell you what I do believe is that the conflict is stopping church growth That people on the on the on the number side and the numbers that we haven't looked at yet We have the ability to attract attract people to the christian from church. We don't have the ability to keep them They're leaving And it's not just a demographics problem because right across the street from big christian reform churches that are losing members Are community churches which are gaining and they're picking up a lot of christian reform church members. Sometimes I hear by anecdote Now that's not to make a big case out of anything. It's just that people don't want to be in conflict And and the loss of membership is a measure Of the conflict Doesn't solve all the problems to to resolve all your conflict But to allow it to go means that we're not addressing the spiritual issue that we need to address spiritual and relational relational issue So that's my interest. That's my concern. Okay. Okay Um, we've been going at this. Oh, I don't know what rodin what time rodney joined us. I think we've been going at this for about an hour Arizona time Arizona time Uh The numbers game I don't I don't want to necessarily go in that conversation But I I do think it would be another video for you to do paul Is to look at the numbers game and look at at that because I do think um david's isolation um uh Idea Um, I think and not having other crc options may be part of it and also my own heart is and it's pretty much because it's a crossway story Sometimes in death of congregations. I think there's also hope for new life. Um, you know crossway started because a church died But they died with the vision and so, um, I think you know, that'd be a fun conversation to have later, but not necessarily today Because because I do think there are two there are two big issues in this overture one issue that that can in a sense standalone one issue is You know one of the things i've appreciated about david all these years that he's been working on this and again everyone here Brad's kind of a lurker, but the three of us are stalwart posters on voices and we've been talking about this numbers thing for years And so here you got this, uh, you got this pastor up in you know Beautiful washington all by himself who has this weird fascination with yearbooks and numbers And he's generating these numbers and he's working these numbers in a way that I think My goodness, why isn't why don't I see the denomination? Really digging into these numbers because there's a lot in this that could teach us a lot And we're just not paying any attention to it I think part of the reason we're not paying attention to it is because It's saying some things about us that we don't like to look at and one of the things that it's saying to us Is very much what david is saying we We turned we turned the church into a world war one battlefield and um, we have never Never we haven't figured out yet how to Heal what we've broken and so I think there are two things in this overture that I think are good and important But and I also I also think that the You know this this reconciliation that david points out As I think your vaccination Example Love it was a terrific illustration Is is that there's something? Beyond the right and wrong of a whole bunch of issues, okay and I'm not a relativist anybody who knows me knows i'm not a relativist But beyond the right and wrong of a whole lot of issues. There's a right about how to deal with people exactly and and This is something very central to the heart of the gospel and so if we Don't know how to practice this We're we're not in a sense Practicing the gospel or living it out and maybe sin it needs a sinner's chair um I could bring it along. Yeah that would be you know, and I said something to david before we started recording which is You know, I I am sometimes I know i'm I sometimes say critical things to the denomination I and and rodney has two both rodney and I have been deeply involved in the denomination in a variety of ways Without a doubt everyone that I have worked with in the denomination has been loving godly committed servants of the lord who who often you know in in the denomination You you don't make much money working in the denominational building You really don't and and many of those people actually probably left churches where they were making more money to make less But they are they are serving the lord with everything they have and so any any criticism I do of the denomination has nothing to do with the the members of the churches or the the people who work in the denominational building because What you know, I have always seen them to be Loving the lord genuine christian people doing their best and and I see that in terms of the women in office as you do because whereas I very much grew up in the egalitarian side of the debate I've never thought you should bar women from serving in office at the same time I understand the the argument for the other side and I am I am comfortable with the current christian foreign position of there being two views and I maintain that and every time I see one side try to you know, close the door on the other I say back off because I want us to live with these two views because Partly because I think exactly in this place that david's overture gets at Just like with vaccination people just like with same-sex marriage people just like with women in office people on and on If we can despite our differences practice Reconciliation and this process of the gospel of dealing with our sin. I often think about peter and peter and judas What's the difference between peter and judas judas left the game Peter you know, I just preached on on john 21 and And my read of john 21 was you know, so jesus brings back peter in well was peter's heart any different? Well right after jesus says feed my lambs Peter, you know looks at john and says why are you picking on me? What about him? And jesus says never mind him. You must follow me And and I think whether whatever side we're on with these issues We hear the call to christ to us individually and so However wrong someone might be however sinful they might be the church has to deal with this stuff I get that but this is this is something foundational about how christians behave and live and work And so I Go ahead bread the one thing i'd add to that is in our highly Polarized culture with the echo chambers I do think that our ability to live with tension And the world takes notice And I think that when we have republicans who are sitting next to democrats or we can have people in our denomination who disagree Over these issues and we can still treat them in in brother and sisterly love and respect That they are drawn to what is the thing? That they are drawn to what is the thing? I mean I hang out with all my people in my echo chamber or or certain interests like and you're hanging out with these different people What is it that unites us and I think that that is our platform in the reconciliation to show The thing that unites us is christ and he is that's the bigger identity that we have other than Our view on politics or vaccinations or this and and the more the church can live In respect and reconciliation in the midst of tension the more that we have the ability to actually Show the one thing that brings us together, which is christ and magnify that and I I think it's actually A powerful potential for witness and and that actually is what gives me hope actually in the crc in in all these things but I really appreciate that because I I I love the last chapter of romans Where paul's greeting everybody and then you start going down that list and you have greek slaves and you have the grandson of harrod and you have Like these people can't possibly be sitting in a room together and respecting each other and loving each other and caring for each other But they do and and it's the same when you actually analyze like you look at the disciples that follow jesus He doesn't have an echo chamber good grief. He's got you know a tax collector and then he's got these Guys that are going to overthrow the roman empire like it's nuts So there's something Powerful about those examples that jesus gives us in just the day-to-day life that was there about reconciliation somebody said to me, you know rod you're trying to reconcile the Unreconcilable right like and I said no that's a denial of the gospel like that you can't Everything can be recognized Reconciled like like the the woman who was driven out of the christian reformed church Because as a pastor can be reconciled to the to the person who drove her out Or the comments that drove her out or the decisions that drove her out It can be done because if it's not then the gospel is worthless to me And and it's meaningless and then why are we going through this charade? The gospel I think always always always leads us to reconciliation That can happen it may you know, I have seen I have seen unbelievable things in my 20 years in ministry and of people who could not possibly be reconciled and yet they sit together and they take the bread and they Take the wine and They take in the body of christ and they do it together. And so often when I see these major conflicts I I just go sit in the corner and pray that and I pray and I actually envision I pray and see the day when they stand before the communion table Take the bread take the wine and take it in together and be able to do that You know you still like I There's still disagreements and you still have to make decisions Are you going to have women elders or you're not going to have women elders? Are you what kind of worship are you going to do? We fought the worship wars all those kinds of crazy things that we fought over But reconciliation can happen and if it can't then we've got nothing The gospel to me is the one thing we have and so I absolutely agree with you We can if if whatever we do in prayer and relationship building We can we can drive us or lead us towards at least creating the space for reconciliation then Let's let's make it happen I'm gonna i'm gonna give david the last word here you go david My ipad says this recording limit is full and I don't know what's gonna happen So if I disappear then my ipad turned me off. Okay, you know, I appreciate this conversation Uh, if you write an overture you realize one day it's it's an impossible thing to do because no matter what you think It'll come out different than what you intend but my heart is that we can undo some of the hurt that was done and By undoing the hurt we can move past our ongoing And find the grace of god and the growth and the strength Of a reconciled and forgiven and renewed community that that we really should be all the time And no matter how much we fail and we will of course we can we need to constantly repent of our own failures and admit that we've hurt people And forgive the people who've hurt us and uh, it's it's just it's it's god's call to us in christ Thank you, david, I think that's a good note on which to wrap up I want to Thank each of you for participating in this I'm gonna stop the recording in a second. Don't hang up and uh, we can just do a little debriefing after I finish recording But I do appreciate I I sometimes think that youtube is the place where people people go who have not a lot to lose So, I don't know if you each feel like that But it's it does it is it is something It is it is something significant to put yourself out there that i've actually posted a few videos of rodney He is the poet laureate of a variety of sentence And those are videos very much worth watching And uh rodney also has a video from of his own in his church Which I also enjoyed but I I appreciate appreciate each of you taking the time to To talk about this and I it is my prayer that this conversation can get out to synodical delegates And and just begin to because again, I think david is right in that to hear from the author of the overture where their heart is In this process, I have learned so much by i'd read an overture that comes in the yearbook And then I listen to this video and I think huh? That wasn't what I thought it was and it just very much adds to our ability to to work through these processes, so Thank you all and i'm going to stop the recording
