 Hi, this is Paul and this is Friday morning bridges of meaning Q&A but before I do the Q&A I should cover the big news of the corner this morning, which is the revelation of Chris out of lurker dumb Apparently this video was made three days ago I'll probably cover it fully in a video because I think this is a I Think this is a significant on-ramp moment. I think Waves of obsession now with 18 subscribers that had 12 this morning before I tweeted it out I thought he rather nicely sort of put the corner into perspective And so if you haven't watched the video I'll let's see. I'll just drop the I'll just drop the link here in The chat and You can watch it now you can watch it later. Thanks to YouTube You know, we all time shift everything But it was a it was a good video Chad covered it on his channel this morning I watched Chad's coverage of it and I thought it was thought it was very helpful But I know you're not here for the bridges of meaning. I'm ready to be a bridge with meaning. There you go, Cassandra Elijah stonebreaker coming up a Randall's conversation with the ledger stonebreaker at some point soon. I just got a really cool name. So I just got to the office should put my phone in the charger. We're gonna be here a while Let's get into it now Gregory Witcher I couldn't I looked for that. I looked for that That idea app idea, but I couldn't find it. So sorry about that. Please pray for my foot Now some of you ask questions that involve a lot of homework you must be forgetting one of the great one of the great Administrators of the bridges of meaning discord server Joey who had the immortal words no homework so Yeah, no homework in these if you can't ask a question that I can't understand pretty quickly I'm probably gonna pass over it. So You get what you pay for I guess And what you've paid for is well and that's part of the beauty of the corner in terms of what we've been talking about and in terms of what Chris has and waves of obsession video is that It's a lot of this is sweat equity You put in the time you get the status I mean look at look at someone like Chad Chad has put in a ton of time and You know you get you get the status or sometimes it's your brilliance. Sometimes it's a confidence hierarchy sort of hard to know Haven't finished listening to the German rando with the balloons and I don't know what happened with zoom, but these balloons I don't know what happened. That was a fun conversation. I enjoyed it. Okay, please pray for my foot I'm gonna have to Let's get this down here because I know we're gonna need it. Let's close all Get back to the discord Does Jordan Peterson stating that he does not want to be put into onto anyone's team between? Christianity Islam and Judaism qualify him to be anti Christ by authority of first John 4 3 Wow Let's look up first John 4 3 Oh Let's read the whole passage because a You need to context dear friends Do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God because many false prophets have gone out into The world it's Jordan Peterson a false prophet dumb dumb dumb This is how you can recognize the spirit of God every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God But every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God This is the spirit of anti Christ which you have heard is He is is coming and even now is already in the world now. Does that make? Let's Talk about anti Christ and the epistle of first John first of all It's kind of hard to know exactly what first John is it's not really an epistle like we have with Paul There's a lot of theory about first John being sort of an addendum to the gospel of John because Some people theorize that perhaps the gospel of John by its structure Became a favorite book of Proto Gnostics a lot of people wonder at what point we can sort of label Gnostics I think there's a certain perennialism to Gnosticism and there's often a certain Gnosticism to some kinds of perennial isms but The first John definitely is a polemical document that very much wants to Want to address Gnostic sensibilities, I'll say it that way For people with these Gnostic sensibilities Their assertion was Jesus was a Jesus okay for most people today To say Jesus was a human being For most people today To say Jesus was a human being they don't have any problem with that Jesus was a human being Jesus was a human being he'd say that all day long and the first century among many different people People had a tougher time saying Jesus was a human being it was easier to say Jesus was a God Okay by virtue of the testimony by the miracles there wasn't there wasn't right widespread skepticism with respect to the miracles Alright alright What does one get booted or muted for it apparently last week grim gris Do you want to get muted is that what you say if Joey was here he would mute you See it's terrible when I interrupt my my thought because people want the content but here then I get distracted with the personalities Almond tree very much. You know I got to set this. I'll shoot Can't do that right now. Okay Back to first John In the context first John is a very Antithetical document black and white day and night good or bad in or out That's you understand if you don't understand that Sensibility that first John has you'll have difficulty understanding its starkness and its boldness now as I always tell you that the the binary and the analog are sort of in some ways sort of like the right and left brain the master and his emissary and You need that you need the antithetical you need the binary you need the antithesis and the first first John majors in that So technically when it's talking about antichrist here, and you don't want to just take verse 3 and not include verse 2 because Verse 2 is the context for verse 3 and a text without a Context is a pretext for filling it with whatever you want I've Jordan Peterson nor Sam Harris nor just about anybody around except for some fringe people who say well We don't even know if Jesus was a real human being now almost everybody today will acknowledge Jesus a real human being what they struggle with is the divinity of Christ and So that's sort of the that's sort of the area that after sort of this great inversion happened into materialism That's the area that people have questions with so if you want to just take this as some slap-it-on thing you're gonna have problems because Sam Harris then can't be antichrist. Well, what it one on earth is antichrist? Well, the spirit of antichrist is the spirit that resists Christ That's that's about exactly what it is now I'm hard-pressed to say Jordan period Peterson is a spirit that resists Christ Well, maybe he's a spirit that resists You always have done when you listen to Jordan You always have to understand that it's it's sort of going a lot of it's going through some something of a Jungian filter And so that complicates How Jordan sees Jesus Jordan has spoken about Jesus many many times and actually If you listen to what Jordan says about Jesus even going back before his status rocket ride Jordan Has pretty much always said the same thing. He's got a rather he's got a rather agnostic Sealing on Jesus and when you ask about the resurrection, he'll say things like it's hard to know just basically I'll rephrase it how real this thing can get and So I When Jordan would say that Jesus Jordan would say that Jesus is from God he wouldn't have any problem with that But what exactly does that mean? Well, that's when Jordan will talk for a good long time so I I don't see if I thought Jordan was Had a spirit against Christ. I probably would not be giving him all the attention that I do now with respect to his idea of teams notice that He's taking he's forefronting the Abrahamic religions And There's something important to that even though there's a Let's talk about conflict Up until about 40 50 years ago, at least in North America There was a great amount of tension between Protestants and Catholics that tension has receded tremendously Now the Orthodox come into come into view and they're coming in at a time when They're not gonna get a lot of pushback from Protestants Protestantism in America has basically Gone into stealth mode and But Protestant America has has always been a deeply Protestant nature nation and culture and that Protestant spirit within America continues to make orthodoxy and Catholicism increasingly Protestant I'll say it that way as much as some Catholics and Orthodox might cringe I'm sorry almond tree. I can't get you one for technical reasons right now, but I'll try and get you a wrench at some point Okay, so Islam right now, there's a ton of conflict between Islam and Judaism and Christianity a lot of it because of the politics of the state of Israel obviously a lot of that conflict is very old because obviously with the rise of Islam as a Civilizational religion it it It it It conflicted with Christianity and Judaism There are some there are some out there that argue and it's a very interesting thesis that part of the reason at least initially the The the Muslims that conquered reigned over vast groups of Christians and Jews And basically they were fairly tolerant of Christians and Jews for much of the history they just made them pay a tax and So some people argue that part of the growth of Islam was Basically, you could get out of your tax and so culturally Islam spread and there's a lot of discussion about just how deep Islamic devotion is now one of the most important things Now one of the videos that I have rolling around in my mind that might get made is Religion is a tremendously difficult thing to talk about because it's difficult to talk about because you want to know at what level so Peterson clearly is trying to What is what is Peterson's goal I Think Jordan Peterson's goal broadly speaking is I think we've seen some shift in this it has been to help the individual and That hasn't gone away. The other thing is Civilizational religion so a I've got a talk I've got a conversation with Jonathan Peugeot coming up this week and one of the things I want to talk with Jonathan about is Civilizational religion Because this is where the conversations between Protestant Catholic and Orthodox get very interesting because Catholic Orthodox Jews and Muslims Have a tremendous history with Civilizational religion Protestants have a degree of of Degree of pause about Civilizational religion and so the United States and the United States system in many ways has been the manner of Protestant civilization or religion and because the United States was so successful that manner of Protestant civilization or religion which includes things like freedom of speech Freedom of religious conscience, etc Etc all of this is deeply Protestant and all of this has sort of stealthily Conquered the world through this cloak that Protestants wrap themselves around in which might be called secular So, I don't know if Jordan has thought through all of this But Jordan is within him He's deeply Protestant While he continues to sort of flirt with orthodoxy and Catholicism while not wanting to exclude Jews and Muslims because remember Jordan's Jordan's point Jordan's focus of attention at least up until a couple of years ago extended beyond the individual and So when you that is a deeply Protestant move because if you focus on the individual you sort of turn away from Civilizational religion and you sort of take this cloak of liberalism and Wrap it around and then like at the ARC conference promote representative representational democracy open markets freedom of speech a lot of this stuff was at the ARC conference and so In that way Jordan's project is deeply deeply Protestant But it's Protestant in the sense of trying to maintain this Protestant mode of civilizational religion and What many in the liberal world want to do is Include the reintegrate the Muslims into civilizational religion now So I've also I'm also working on scheduling another talk with John Vervecki and what I want to talk to John Vervecki about is fundamentalism Because fundamentalism Are very interesting because there's a natural resistance to civiliz there's a natural resistance to modernity in fundamentalism but Fundamentalism tend to American Christians American Christian fundamentalism tended to unwittingly unwittingly absorb the assumptions of Their Gerardian rivals and So instead of reading the Bible basically saying well, it's all just stories fictions Which is sort of what the modernist said in the 19th century the fundamentalist said it's all physical. Oh Okay And that led to an entire new rabbit trail of biblical studies that imagined They sort of ran headlong into the synoptic problem. And so a whole lot of Time was spent trying to figure out how many Jericho's there were and how many blind men there were etc. Etc. Etc. Etc so We continue to we continue to sort of work through this question now The caliphate Sam Tiedemann, we're all trying to learn how to say Sam's name properly Sam are you taking any calls today? I don't know Sam Tiedemann See how many questions I get through at this rate Sam Tiedemann said, you know If you sort of read if you sort of took away the Jews and the Christians the the Muslims would probably just keep killing each other There's a lot of truth to that that's sort of a perennial truth as well Many have noted that when the Jews the Jews only stopped fighting each other when someone is trying to kill them And someone could say the same thing about the Christians. So equal opportunity there Like, you know, there was just recently a Significant bombing in Iran. It probably had nothing to do with Jews or Christians It probably had everything to do with intramural Iranian or Islamic conflict so Jordan in his attempt to enfold Muslims is In that sense really trying to bring them into the broad Protestant secular ish tent of Modernity and liberalism It's not that Islamic liberalism hasn't been tried and there have been some elements of Islamic culture that have showed Let's say signs of proto liberalism but they didn't finally win and I think part of that is because of Fundamentalism isn't a very new thing. I think it also is sort of a perennial dynamic and by virtue of the construction of Islam this this demand that The Quran cannot be translated Some of this now the demand that the Quran cannot be translated is a literalism. It's not a physicalism because what they are doing is Sort of elevating the literary the literal text to the highest point but there's only one Quran there's not many Quran and someone tells me that there's a small woman who is in the UK that go loves to go to speaker's corner and Bring all kinds of copies of the Quran and say no say there's all these different things was of course just pisses them off There's a certain There's a certain rigidity and fragility in that perennial fundamentalist approach which is I think why Liberalism probably never finally flourished in Islam It's it's helpful to remember the history of the caliphate in the Ottoman Empire which was into the modern period the expression of Islam in the modern world and of course the the Ottoman Empire died a death of a thousand small cuts and then was pushed over the edge in the First World War and then what today is Turkey became just sort of the rump of the Empire and For the last hundred years has not been a great player now that might change Erdogan seems to want to make it seems to want to rejuvenate his empire and so the Hagia Sophia goes from being a museum into a mosque again and when you look at these kinds of signals you can see that The the modernist dream of religion fading away John Lennon's dream and imagine boy This is this is that it will never be anything more than a dream because nothing is more durable or foundational in human beings than what we call religion, so It's helpful to note that this current the current versions of Islamism arise as a response to the the downfall of the caliphate with the Ottoman Empire after the First World War and So many Islamists whether they're saying it or not in a sense are expressing the idea that Secular Islam has been tried and failed and we need this more virulent strain and the more virulent strain is definitely fundamentalistic and Is definitely trying to promote a civilizational? Religion now that it's its fullest implementation is probably in Iran and It's not doing well Now you might say what do you mean? It's not doing well isn't Iran causing fits in the world sure it is but Iran you know, it's gonna we have yet to see what this group of Iranians under the age of 40 are gonna do to that country because Liberalism is powerful even though it's sort of being tested right now this whole Ukrainian Russian war in many ways is a battle of liberalism and It's gonna be very interesting to see What happens with Russia because they're sort of expelling their last ability to use To use human fodder on a battlefield as a strategy The the focus on the individual the assertion of the individual and the the relationship between technology and the assertion of the individual is Is really what is continuing to unseat a Lot of civilization a lot of ancient civilizational religions, which is why in many ways Transhumanism is sort of a You guys are still arguing about a wrench No, you create that mark. Okay mark mark mark mark who's not part of the corner It's like a fish not part of water The whole the whole point of the wars that Russia felt Ukraine increasingly in European orbit Maybe part of NATO Maybe part of the European Union and wanted to stop that because Russia in some ways has to needs to wants to Reestablish the old empire by bringing Poland I mean there are many many YouTube sites out there will show that in terms of Russia's strategic defense over You know the next hundred years They need to sort of Shrink the funnel by putting it back in Poland and you and Romania, so Russia's playing its hand But deep beneath this is liberalism's pole Thank you, Mountie. There we go. Thank you Deep beneath this is the point of the war There we go, thank you deep beneath this is The pull of liberalism around the world and and in many ways even though we have a little bit of this conversation in the West between ooh, and it's happening in I think that the recent ortho wave is a part of this Doug Wilson is a part of this And I think a lot of this is because There's an anxiety and I think quite well founded that the next iteration of liberals liberalism might be transhumanism and we're already seeing the the fruits of transhumanism and other trans movements and And I think that's the next iteration of liberalism And we're already seeing the the fruits of transhumanism and other trans movements and We don't like it so the world is a big place and all of these tensions are going on at the same time Back to the question Jordan Peterson is in this in trying to promote Christian Civilizational religion which in many ways in that in the 20th century was secularism And so Jordan as a secularist will try to embrace Christians Muslims and Jews and sir Buddhists and Hindus and Jordan is in Terms of his efforts trying to maintain the old system If you go all the way back to him in a t-shirt Kovacching about what somebody said about him. I'm a classical liberal and notice how that took on How that caught fire? But but the classical liberalism of the 19th century will not be the same classical liberalism of the 21st century for all of the reasons that Jordan makes with respect to combinatorial explosiveness and Cognitive science and all of those things you can't go back to the 19th century and we're not going back to the 19th century and so those who continue to want to embrace liberalism have to figure out how to contend with transhumanism and so just this morning the The Collins's had a I haven't listened to all of it yet, but I listened to the start of it They're talking to Mormon transhumanists, which if you have an understanding of Mormonism and where it comes from and an understanding of Mormon theology Transhumanism is a natural step now. What's interesting is they're also big fans of Mary Harrington Who is diametrically opposed to transhumanism and is screaming that while lighting her hair on fire all over unheard so Wow, there's there's a lot going on And but Jordan Peterson has within him sort of an internal contradiction Where on one hand he wants to maintain individualism classical liberalism science on the other hand he more than many others are pointing to the fact that some of the foundations of classical liberalism lockian epistemology some of these foundations have been obliterated by science itself and that's in many ways where Jordan and John Verveke are really tied at the hip because both want to maintain science while at the same time understanding that the Epistemic foundation that gave rise to science is being destroyed by the science itself So Jonathan Jordan Peterson is not an antichrist nor do I think he's participating in the spirit of Antichrist He is a deeply Protestant liberal who is trying to make his way through the fact that Science the fruit of much of this is destroying the foundations of historic liberalism and individualism Which means that either that stuff washes away or you found new foundations And I think at the heart of it Jordan is trying to work at multiple layers of the stack He's both trying to shore up foundations as is John Verveke hence all the language And he's trying to work up here with civilizational religion Which is why he wants a big tent with Protestant Catholic Orthodox Jewish and Muslim And so that's what he's doing That's a big question I need a drink So This is my big cop It is mostly filled with ice Thank You upcycle This little corner is real So the my drink my drink changes so lately I've been on ice It's mostly ice. It's like 80% ice. So it's mostly water plus some coconut water Plus some lemonade for a while. I was doing green tea, but the caffeine and green tea I didn't I didn't run it want to live with that caffeine and green tea and that particular green tea had some artificial sweetener I didn't really want that so now it's Costco lemonade plus Costco coconut water plus mostly ice and I'll have to refill it at some point during this during this live stream Because it's an insulated cup and the ice endures which I like Melt slowly so throughout the day I sort of Mix the titration All right I said the thermos brought to you by science True people are peasants. Ah, sometimes this stuff goes so fast. I have trouble bringing it down Taking bits for teeth see it's not donations. Yes bidding war Forget that is it Ben Spencer the guy who's always leaving the negative comments like Ben Spencer music from Los Angeles Always leaving negative comments about about my griff. There you go, Ben. The grift is going. Oh Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Look at that TLC is not real. It's gerrymandered group of particular Oh Chad thank you for strengthening us Pontiff I Don't know if Chad who is Pope declares mark to be Pope. What does that mean? Oh Oh, it's swimming. It's swimming 120 watching and Jacob has taken up the role of trying to displace Google Analytics Evangelical praxis All right, well, I don't know I don't I don't think anybody's gonna top Bruce See it's not oh You guys make me laugh yeah chats wild today. Oh It meets we have an anti-pope Jacob is the party whip. There you go. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's really that's that's that's a good that's a good insight Oh Not not real is it not real is ahead 100 to 42 so the grift continues Oh But but poor One poor guy in Korea just just just it tries his soul when I show no love to Sam Harris So anyway, all right, yes, you've all distracted me. Okay second question John from the deep dark seas a very small ACNA That's an American Anglican Anglican Church of North America Very small ACNA church plant. I've been oh gosh So we've got that's a hundred and sixty two dollars for TLC is real Oh Orange and covering Oh, yeah, oh Chad Oh Chad, that's right TLC debate money laundering scheme That's right, this is this is all a this is all a shill It's uh, you know, it's Putin's money we're laundering. How about that? That's Putin's money Where's it all going? Okay back to the question A very small ACNA church plant. I've been attending for 15 months is dispersing due to the departure of Bruce Oh No, oh no Oh no I don't know if Bruce is married. He's probably gonna have to explain this to his wife Oh All of this is seed money Uh, uh, uh, uh, okay. I gotta catch your breath Yeah, google takes 30 percent you're right Nico and what's paul gonna do with all that grift money it's a lot of cheddar The livestream for 15 minutes i'm incredibly confused that's right we've been distracted by money Some some saudi is gonna come in and drop 10 grand on us and just blow us away That's right, Eli just say name it claim it pastor the more the more The more you super chat i'm selling youtube indulgences, oh they're gonna clip that for grim gris Uh paul should end this livestream. Oh, chad another two dollars Let's favor indulgences you guys Oh, we got a new member Fully support the mission excellent wife you have bruce. She's a great woman. She must be great with pastor paul Oh, I need to get to the good father's question, okay, okay focus focus focus Okay John Has been attending an acna church for 15 months and it's dispersing Due to the departure of our rector and near zero chance of us being able to find and financially support a new one I chose the acna for the liturgical Eucharist, but now i'm realizing all the practical considerations of church See if churches had super chats actually churches have tithing and google doesn't get 30 percent That's that's why the best way to support Me doing this is by giving to living stones Um, which i'm i'm kind of wondering if 2024 is going to be the last year of living stones It's it's kind of i'm kind of wondering that except this week Every week estuary starts at 9 a.m on sunday morning at living stones this week And it could be that through the estuary Living stones has a new life. I don't know. We'll see. Well, we will see what happens. So very sad story is acna church can't continue because Boy Part of what happens in america is that So the crc Is is kind of half american and half european And that it demands that its clergy be well educated And once you demand a level of education and status and professionalism from your clergy you're going to assume and presume and probably Need to have souried clergy Many american churches get around that By not paying their pastor's fees By Not paying their pastor and have the church belong to the pastor, etc, etc. There's all these different models of churches and It's it's going to be interesting to see the way this thing shakes out. So anyway back to your question All the practical considerations church being faced with having to choose a new one There is no one my age or at my stage of life at this dispersing church, for example There's another acna church in town, but it's also quite small Meanwhile, there are several big evangelical churches I could attend I love the anglican liturgy but struggle with having few or no possible friends my age in a small church I don't think I can take a low church evangelical services seriously anymore But those churches will have far more friendly and eventually marriage prospects. That's true I'm feeling pretty torn between my theological liturgical convictions and the practicalities of finding real thick community in church How would you approach my situation? I don't know move to texas and look for chris green you know, I You know chad not chad. Um, nate very much. I should talk to chris green But I don't know if one conversation is going to do it with a guy like chris green So chris green is a super interesting guy he is Pentecostal anglican and You know for me I talk about what what would happen if living stones closed while I would probably If living stones closed we would probably be enfolded in one of our daughter churches, which is christchurch davis Which is quite liturgical and i'm not really a much more of a praise and worship kind of guy. Sorry I really am But we would probably be enfolded into christchurch davis And I would probably go on staff at christchurch davis and maybe this would continue and I would They would hold my credential and you know, who knows what would happen but um You know again, I love see I would love I I love a big box evangelical worship I love that. It's a psychotechnology that that I really enjoy. I prefer it to To formal liturgy. I'm not really a big fan of formal liturgy At least that that kind of particular kind of liturgy now a whole bunch of people just unsubscribed, but that's okay um As long as I have the bidding war on tlc is real i'll i'll be able to make it crazy people um But what I would suffer from in most big box churches is the preaching because when it comes to the preaching i'm I'm Obcycle hub cycle has joined the fray tlc is real vna is real to the lord. Jesus christ goes all the glory So I I hear you john i'm totally there, but my situation is opposite. I want I want um Great music and great and actually great music for me is sort of traditional hymns in a contemporary style In more of a pentecostal expressiveness and great preaching. That's kind of what I want Uh pvk's wife is gonna watch this. That's right. Because where'd all that money come from? Oh, no, how much should bruce give to shut down the live stream? No amount of money is gonna shut down this live stream I'm sorry. It's not gonna happen um So and Oh gosh, i'm gonna stop watching the comments so So I got some interesting feedback from the just go to church video and I live in a city like sacramento where there are hundreds of churches There's maybe not as much variety You know in terms of all the particular arity that I would like if I had to look for a church But again, I would just I would probably just go I would just go to christchurch davis because yeah, they got the liturgy and Yeah, they're very liturgical. So you would love it and but the preacher You know Eric is a friend of mine ali is a friend of mine. I would fit in very well at the church They they do have good music But but the liturgical elements just don't tend to jazz me I grew up in a black community I like something more african-american so We cannot be cooperating with youtube how dare we yeah well, that's a good question I wouldn't want that is a crc I would go to a crc. It's the only kind of church. I would go to but my point is in fact if there was I would I would go to the last crc in sacramento phlebas because I am crc. That is what I would do But if there were no crcs available, what would I do? I think my wife would have a fit if I said i'm planting an animal I think my wife would have a fit if I said i'm planting a new church She would have a fit What you're doing what at your age? But that in fact might happen with We'll see what happens at living stones because once the the current 60 year old iteration of living stones dies And if living stones continues it would functionally be a new church It would probably be planted out of the estuary and out of the randos and out of the people here and It would be kind of a crazy mismatch. I mean dog bark would probably be running the music. Um So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I and i john I wish I had an answer for you I think You have to figure out what what your what your your value hierarchy looks like Is it the fellowship is it the liturgy is it the preaching? Is it the music and you're gonna have to put those or is it the distance because distance is part of it some people make an argument to go to the You know people are gonna go to the go to the closest trinitarian church to your house i'll say it that way Yeah, I know I said trinitarian and I mean it but go to the low go to the closest trinitarian church to your house start there And love on that church and the truth is if you stay there 20 years, you'll probably deeply influence it So Otherwise, yeah. Yeah, otherwise people travel a long distance to find anselman actually left a very interesting comment a little cohort god sends you I love it when grim Uprades my theology Merely nice Mere nice Christiania, I love it anselman anselman left a really interesting comment which I actually screenshot it where he talked about his struggles with finding a church and um, so This is part of the legacy of individualism That we are all deeply shaped not primarily by our local church or our local church tradition But by all of the different religious inputs that are sneaking in under the radar beneath the cloak of secularism so All right Indy defense. Hello paul. What do you what do you think? What do you think ultimately happened to the garden of eden? It was said to be located between the tigers and ufretis guarded by angels But of course, it's no longer there at least to our eyes Could it be like wonder woman's movie like the wonder woman movie where eden is its own little dimension that we can't see or access from the outside That's kind of it But I think in the wonder woman movie when we again When we when we use this kind of language about talking about a dimension we we tend it tends to be a physicalist hack to Yeah, the memberships have been blowing up lately, um, which is really cool Enjoy worshiping alongside you Enjoy worshiping alongside yeah. Yeah, you don't know you you've never you've never been with hank crews I have I want to see anselman and hank crews together. I just want to see anselman I just I just want to shake anselman's hand anselman. I went all the way to scotland I went all the way to scotland talk about meeting you halfway halfway would be the watery atlantic I went all the way to scotland. I want to meet anselman someday. I do um Church of the open heart sounds Yeah, that's right dimension is it so So the video I made uh this week I it got posted thursday morning about um About poetry and seeing Again, it's a fascinating thing go back to you know, um, don't sleep there snakes Why couldn't the man why couldn't the westerner and his daughter see the god and why could everyone in the village see the god? now We say dimensions and again, we're sort of bowing in need of physicalism Reality is really strange and um You know, and then there's this dynamic that uh that ho math talks about where If you're a super low status guy the women Won't even see you It doesn't mean you're not in the room physically. They won't see you and many many women talk about I was invisible I hear that from women and I hear it from I hear from women as they age they say the older I get the more invisible I become You know there was a famous model who said that recently and it's like I mean she still dropped that gorgeous And I can't imagine when she walks in a room, you know Eyes male eyes the male gaze comes upon her but so this this business and again, this is part of the recession of modernity Is that we're beginning to understand better that seeing? Is much more complex than the sort of reductive physicalist Model that say john lock imagined and then suddenly when jesus says things like those who have eyes to see Suddenly, hmm. Well, that's interesting so Then goes ear. Hey paul in the gulag archipelago There's a part in the ascent chapter where a friend of solja nitsons tells him And on the whole i've come to realize that nothing in life comes to us undeserved Peterson pretty much says that This man was later bludgeoned that night How do we reconcile our upbringing life circumstances that wouldn't facilitate the ideal? We'd want for ourselves with our choices while we're so young and blind Are we ultimately the sum of our choices? No, we are not ultimately the sum of our choices. That is There is such a thing as grace Grace there's such a thing as grace and And now i'm gonna say this is why i'm calvinist and some of you will say well, that's not calvinism. That's just christianity Well, i'm sorry. I learned christianity through calvinism. So I blend them all together Grace means we don't get what we deserve It's the goodness of god we are not the sum of our choices And in fact, we are hardly the sum of our choices because We are also the product of the choices of past generations. I I would not be alive today if my great-great-grandfather hadn't somehow pissed off the jewish community and ran from the netherlands and replanted his family in western michigan and That would not be me obviously because patterson's part of my who I am and my parents and on and on and on but if My great-great-grandfather had stayed in the netherlands. They would have all been wiped out and my whatever version of me there's no version of me, but you know his descendants would have been on the wall of the of the The little memorial outside outside of oping and dumb That job and john vandalken I visited so I'm here because My great-great-grandfather broke the rules Of his jewish community and got exiled and probably shrugged and said might as well move to america and join the dutch reformed Here I am His grandson became a christian reform minister and his great-grandson became a christian reform minister and now me his great-great-grandson Is a christian reform minister? So I don't know how much our choices matter now. I sound really calvinist But it's the grace of god through multiple generations Are malcolm and simone crazy prophets or possibly both they're not crazy And they themselves wouldn't even consider themselves prophets They're too very smart Well when I when the um Probably monday or tuesday. I'll release the full video of the full conversation onto the main channel um Almost released it this morning a lot when and how I release videos has everything to do with my the priority that I give videos and Yeah, that's that's basically and how many videos I have in the stack And i've had a lot of videos in the stack lately so And and I can't really put two if I release Two to four hours of video in a single day. It sort of overwhelms the size of the channel So I try to parse it out and i'm trying to do some more shorts Because some people shorts help people so i'm i'm still playing with the channel, but um Of course eden is real Eden eden is is more real than sacramento You have to understand what real means Um Paul is really trying hard with the colons, but doesn't seem seem like tlc fans The colons are super interesting. They are super interesting. And so this morning their conversation with trans they They are in many ways transgender mormons who have no association with the lds church That's one way to think about them And They're super american And and some of you picked up on sort of their elite roots. They're super elite You know mormonism doesn't just spring out of the ground out of nowhere mormonism that's such as sort of a popularist New england transcendentalism You know in some ways sam teetamin and mormons have a lot in common With with with these american unitarians so and you might say well how How are mormons like unitarians when a better argument is that mormons are basically polytheists? Yes Because basically what trinitarians do is hold this tension There are three not four not two there are three And three is a special number And so unitarians say there's one but unitarians when they decompose when unitarianism sort of falls apart it becomes polytheism And when polytheism gets overwhelming it becomes unitarianism. And so those two sort of keep going back and forth The trinity is actually the stable place And that's why I think history has laid itself out the way it has Yeah Yeah, and then it got unstable So They're super interesting. I and so i'm gonna go on their i'm gonna have a conversation on their channel. That'll be super interesting, but they're I So again look at the video where I start out with the ross douthat and watch that whole ross douthat video It was out a few years ago with tara isabel burton because that's so and ross douthat Is watching this stuff very carefully and makes the comment in his decadence book about Well part of the reason we we know decadence is because new religions aren't being developed now That's a sounds like a strange thing for a roman catholic to say But he's saying it just understanding that starting new religions is a perennial thing and most of them don't go anywhere and just sort of wash up and when you look at the history of the history of Of british north america between the colonial period and let's say the 20th century and I think even into the 20th century There's all kinds of new religions being formed, but douthat's observation Is that The old pattern the old american patterns of religion, which is congregational is broken and it's broken by the internet And so what's super interesting about them is that they basically have a new religion And they have a youtube channel, but they're not necessarily propagating their new religion So the question is what exactly are they propagating? Okay, they're propagating pronatalism Are they also propagating sort of a mormon transhumanism and I think that's right There I don't agree with it, but I think that's what they're doing And that's super interesting and I don't think they're going to become a cult Where malcolm is going to start sleeping with all kinds of other women? Uh when when you watch the video, I think you get a palpable sense that Malcolm and simone. I think they have a really great relationship. They love working together I think they have a relationship that a lot of other people will look at and say I want to have a relationship like them So I don't think malcolm's about to you know, buy land in guiana and start sleeping with hundreds of women He he already he talked about the fact They already had that sleeping with a lot of women phase in his life and he he found it shallow and has moved on from there and so he's Yeah, that's true Mormonism is just islam 2.9. Yeah, there's a ton of Interesting connection between islam and mormonism a lot of similar similarities, but islam is far older and I don't think we'll see islam wandering into transhumanism because Of this fundamentalist nature within islam and mormonism is so much later that I think it's going to be susceptible Mormonism is basically post enlightenment and there's certain elements in the light and certain openness elements in the enlightenment That say human nature is ultimately completely malleable, which is probably what's at the heart of transhumanism so So so I I think you know I So I got a I have an interview coming up with a reformed podcast this month and And they've already sent me the questions and one of the questions is how do I pick my topics? My topics pick me and Once one of you I won't out you once one of you sent me their video on the decline of religion And I watched it. I knew I'm in i'm interested. These people are doing something important. Does that mean they're right? I mean, that's how I got going on jordan peterson plenty of disagreements with jordan peterson, but I knew right away He's doing something important. Keep an eye on him pay attention because What's happening with jordan peterson and what's happening with malcolm and simone collins is these people are? Instantiations and they're telltales. So if I had a I had a colleague who was into sailing and he used to have this The sailboat we would take it on the san francisco bay and we'd sail together And I learned a little bit about sailing with from my friend and telltales Well, what are telltales telltales are these little strips of cloth that hang from a that hang from a sail And these little strips of cloth, they're tiny the sail captures big wind But the little strips can like tell you what's going on with the other layers beneath that are probably going to tell you What's going to happen with the wind? So jordan peterson and the collins's are telltales There and you watch them and you figure out and once you figure out probably where the wind is going to go That's when you adjust your main sail To sail within the culture They're telltales. So you pay attention to them But it doesn't mean you follow them Because you still have a rudder and a sail and you've got to chart your ship But you got to keep an eye on the telltales because that's how you know where the wind is blowing Okay Yeah, true mark. That's true peterson is a wind too but Stuff gets so complicated every metaphor breaks down Such a such a literalist mark and I don't mean a physicalist. I mean a literalist All right Uh valerie. Hi valerie. I've got an update for you regarding the writers of meaning anthology project It's been a long-term project some of you Probably this is one of the sub groups of bridges of meaning that started and john vodonk had a great piece He allowed us to include the banner gave us permission to reprint their estuary article We're in the final edit and book formatting stage while the book cover is being designed We're aiming to publish mid-year june. Excellent. Once you have the book out. We'll promote it try and uh see if uh people will support the effort of the book by buying the book just like I think I was supposed to do something for peugeot with because i haven't gotten a copy of the uh of the snow white I I did like the uh, the kickstarter because I don't even really care if I get the book. I just wanted to support jonathan. So um Do you have any recommendations of folks who might be willing to do blurbs book reviews that you can put on the back corner? Well, I think you're going to want to think about that because do you want high status people? Or do you want corner people? Because depending on your i mean you could get verveky and peugeot But if you really want corner people then you need people like grizz and chad There's something to think about if anyone wants to volunteer or donate to be part of the bridges of meaning you can find it Going on here and I will copy this And put it right here Oops, no that that didn't that didn't come out the way I wanted it to Let's try again There that's much better Julian i'm so glad that julian's still around. Oh, father big mac is right after julian's question. Okay Paul curious to hear your reflections on how the conversations in your channel this space has evolved What were you we talking about thinking about early on and what's the conversation shifted since then funny? You should ask that julian because just two weeks ago. I started re-watching some of the first conversations I had And you can find them if you go all the way back So there's a there's a playlist on my channel called conversations and it's got over 500. It's got over 500 Videos in it and you go all the way to the beginning of it There's a few crc pastors see first. I thought when the channel like a thousand A thousand people I thought You know, i'm gonna have a bunch of crc pastors on this channel Um, that didn't work out quite the way I expected not that any of the conversations were bad, but it sort of got Avalanched by the randos very quickly after that And so there's some crc pastors that first then there's nathan nathan was really the first rando And then jove and a whole bunch of early ones and I thought of doing a video on Those early conversations because A lot of those early conversations were short of were sort of people that had been hit by the shockwave of jordan peterson in 2016 2017 And we're watching and then 2018 and then we're watching This it was a great wind mark. You're right a mighty wind Watching how this explosion that was jordan peterson So it kind of Energized people's imaginations about what a religious renaissance might mean now very quickly was the pushback By the blue church against jordan peterson which tended to isolate him and there's always there's always that sort of thing and I think the I think the framing of jordan as a right wing ideologue Uh jordan hasn't really overcome that and in some ways Joining daily wire sort of cemented it so So the early conversations julian tended to be The shockwave of jordan peterson and then the initial wave of randos that were telling their story about There were basically exorcism stories about how jordan peterson exercised them from spiritual possession By certain spirits that have been and that have been binding men So there's a lot of those conversations now After those after people had been sort of liberated for a while because it's one thing to sort of get liberated from a spirit Well now you have to figure out how to live And I think since then the conversations have been about how to live And that's why there's a lot of interest in finding a spouse Having a family figuring out career figuring out church so a lot of those A lot of the conversations are about the nuts and bolts of living now and and so now we're sort of in the wisdom sphere And that's sort of been the trajectory of the talks and every now and then there's sort of a bump in the wind And we ride that but then when things settle down, it's again sort of perennial wisdom topics How do you pick us? How do you pick a mate? How do you pick a vocation? How do you choose a church and that has tended to be sort of where the conversation has evolved now, there's still some thinky talky stuff going on but um In a lot of ways This channel I do some of my own thinky talky things But my thinky talky things are basically for my own sanity and my own sense making But a lot of it especially because again i'm a pastor and pastors tend to deal with very practical things A lot of the things surrounding this have been People working their stuff out, you know, like like watch grim gris grim gris has a half hour video. There's usually five minutes of salience in there of where gris is after you get through all the branding and all the all the savings throws and all the card picking and all the um the the Recognizing people in the hive mind and all of that stuff. There's about five minutes of grim gris sort of Bearing his soul and his process of trying to Trying to fully exercise set while he colonizes cell And so we're all just working our stuff out That's what we're doing grim's liturgy that's right, that's that's that's right that's grim's liturgy Okay Okay Uh father big mac In order for something to exist. It must have one telos two a head and three a structure. I think that's true Oh boy What is the telos head and structure of the tlc? I think you know chad really got at something in his video this morning on that It you the tlc has an origin story that most of us know I'd say the head is christ, but I'm a christian minister father big mac would probably agree And the telos is the kingdom of god the city on the hill up, you know the city on the top of the hill um the structure is is Is is the is an interesting and a new thing because what we are doing is colonizing these strange cyber spaces so is this transhumanist by Contamination are we trying to resist transhumanism by taking over its tools? I think christ is the head Yeah, yeah Neo christianity christianity is always neo. I mean chesterton has it right, you know the the church Keeps dying and rising and I I have a clip I put on the vander clips channel of francis buford Seen and unseen where he talks about this what we're doing here is what the church always needs to do Because in many ways we are wrestling with god and we are wrestling with the spirits of the age and we are taking every spirit captive And that's what we're doing A while ago I asked you for a recommendation on books of the bible for people coming out of the new age and you recommend the joanine epistles Which was a perfect fit For now for someone really involved in black and white absolutes and stern totalitarian Moralizing what would your recommendation be for that person? preferably from the new testament I About the book of romans book of romans is a tough book but What paul is trying to do in the book of romans is make sense of The fact that christianity Subsumed helenism in a way that The disparate jewish the dia the jewish diaspora could not Or maybe the book of or maybe the book of galatians, but that but it's a tougher This this this wrestling between Common grace and the antithesis That's how my tradition has framed it and if you want to understand the history of the christian-formed church for the last hundred years You have to understand the wrestling between the antithesis and common grace. What does that mean? so when when jonathan peugeot talks about the fact that Christianity completes paganism When you look at a roman catholic posture of nature and grace That's that's sort of a subsumption model where christ completes pagan dreams c.s. lewis Articulates that well, that's true The antithesis is also true That christ Is true in a way that paganism never is In a way that paganism never is that's also true and those truths are in many ways antithetical to each other But they're also working together and this is this is the dynamic between the antithesis And common grace and goes back and forth between them It's sort of it's it's in some ways parallel to the antithesis is very emissary brain And common grace is very master brain because it has to master all And but you need them both and they go back and forth That's where you know, we go christ is super and I always use embassy brain and master brain instead of right and left brain because i'm Dyslexic and get them confused and then I misspeak and then it's confusing so I don't get emissary brain and master brain mixed up That's why I use that Oh joseph follow up question for pvk from joseph or thinking about your video called video on naming By not naming these things can we relate to them more openly? Yes, not narrowing to a single in stress salience. Yes, because you're right joseph if I as I did say Christ is the head and the telos is the kingdom of god right away. The jews are like Don't don't play the jesus card on me See So See see see it's never that easy Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh he is the whip he is the whip Are You deliberately trading off the power granted by naming for a more quiet cultivating of the garden and just seeing what grows Yes When though should we name I would say the question of naming is when and where? See and and and what jose what jacob just demonstrated is You have to be Let's think about naming as a wizard Let's think about the wizards in lord of the rings So if you read the book there's some of it in the movie, but if you read the book You when when they finally confront sauraman and eisengard? And after the ends have basically taken away his kingdom and he's locked in the orthank Gandalf warns everyone watch out for his words Because naming is framing that's what I almost made a video this week called naming is framing because it came to me naming is framing That's exactly right naming is framing and so words are magical words are powerful So words are magical words are powerful but You know these very interesting parts of the gospels where jesus couldn't do a miracle in nazareth Why couldn't the son of god do a miracle in nazareth? What is the deal with faith? That has to do with context And so naming is framing But a big part of Delivering the magic word or the name Which delivers the which frames? Is the when and the where? So you have to figure that out So no your point it's a great point joseph It's a great point And this is this goes all the way back to the peterson question peterson knows this and so is So peterson goes to israel jerusalem and he's a jew Peterson goes to rome and he's a catholic until he says something against the pope and gets disinvited Who can control the tongue? Among the orthodox he's orthodox i'd say he's really protestant No, it's a good point My question for you paul jack bog Number one, who do you think you are? Good question And what gives you the right? I I I don't I don't On one hand i'm a child of the king In the eyes of this world I will be a blip who will be forgotten quickly. I'm like the grass of the field that Isiah 40 like the grass of the field Righteousness is like the flowers of the field. So all this this little bit of righteousness Is the flower what gives you the right? Oh gosh, what do you need to what? What do you need to start a youtube channel? You need a gmail address How can you qualify for a gmail address if you answer that question? You have the answer to your question my question is Ujjiro What are the essential elements in any worship service that keep people engaged and impart meaning to them? And not necessarily just christian worship either worship in general Worship is a particular kind of attention And I think so So I think for veki is right that for attention to last it has to be transjective and that's why as Lost in the cosmos notes Why is it when we meet eyes with someone it's powerful People And and there's gender and there's sex in there too your eyes lock with a woman it's like What's going on here your eyes lock with a man it's a different thing And and one of the amazing things about dogs So I I spend a lot of time with a dog lately and training a dog And so a dog's been a big part of my life this year um dogs So when i'm training my dog a lot of what I train my dog with is eye contact And in many ways my dog worships me because I feed it treats It's a dog But dogs don't make eye contact with other dogs You don't find dogs staring at each other in the eye, maybe if you do it's probably a showdown between males So, um So Christian worship and this is right from christian reformed liturgy To the degree that christian reformed is old enough to have liturgy Is dialogical it's back and forth so So The christian reformed church is like jonas plant sorry phlebas it's the truth um, it sprung out of dissent over Americanism with reformed church of america in a sense is transplanted The christian reformed church is is rather anti-state church right from its start And that way it's deeply protestant and it's and it flourished in america the way it didn't really flourish in the netherlands And so then when the christian reformed church had to sort of figure itself out 70 years into its existence It it came up with its own liturgy and it's a very sparse simple liturgy, but it's dialogical And so actually even if you look at the liturgy of living stones, it's deeply dialogical God speaks to us. We respond to god god speaks to us We respond to god god speaks to us. We respond to god back and forth and back and forth and back and forth That's what worship is it's a two-way conversation between us and god Now only worship god alone, right? Um, but we do pay attention to a lot of other things we have to So worship is is attention plus devotion And Now you have to attend to your spouse and be devoted to your spouse But it's a special devotion It's the it's the top of the hierarchy devotion that you devote yourself to god So That's what worship is Cw What is the best way for a man to gain a youtube channel, but not lose his soul? Well, I hope you know, that's what i'm doing I hope to not lose my soul You know, I jordan peterson is a cautionary tale not that i'm saying he's lost his soul, but Hierarchy is blind and blind And so You know, I almost shut down the channel at 2 000 subs I didn't i'm still here We're at like we're you know, we'll probably be hitting 30 000 subs in the next couple of months That's still pretty small for youtube channel. I keep telling myself that um Cw asks that I don't know if I should cw should I are you in the comments? Should I out this? um Cw has an interesting project that he wants to do and I hope he does it I don't know Jacob Jacob Jacob do it. All right cw gave me the green light Cw wants to start cw is going to jump in to the fray With a live stream show so he's following grim grizz and jacob in that I warned him. I said if you start a live stream and you don't have any subs on your channel No one will get notified that you'll watch it And so maybe you should partner with another channel and the first guest for his live stream Is the infamous and some of you are going to despair right away. Hang on to your seats His first guest will not be me, although I volunteered but I agreed with him He said no, you shouldn't be the first guest the digital gnosis nathan ormond And Hated exile of this little corner the anti this little corner cw is going to have him on Have I not had this on the whole time cw is going to have him on I love it. I love it. I love it I love it. No, no, no, no No Oh I'm, okay if people see pvk be unable to answer the question. I'm not sure what answer the question No, tell us no head no boundaries So mark thinks he's been kicked out of the corner he hasn't been kicked out of the corner anywhere near as hard as nathan Nathan was nathan was Um, yeah, yeah, so good good on ucw go for it. I can't wait I can't wait and not not that the video will be any good mind you Because nathan's gonna do what nathan does and we all know what nathan's gonna do But just doing it Oh Poor Jacob poor Jacob poor poor jacob jacob wishes we would have kicked him out if we could have A link to cw's channel. He doesn't have one yet. He doesn't have one yet. He's got to get going I love chad's point. Um That's right, what is cw's channel? Oh there it is christian diaspora christian diaspora There you go Everybody subscribe now. I told him I said once jay nathan's already agreed so so cw once you uh make that appointment make sure everybody knows because cw wants the live dynamic which grizz of course has sort of really developed on um on and grizz's channel, so Cw wants the live event. So that's going to be an event That's going to be an event why was nathan kicked out so hard Uh nathan was kicked out of um bridges of meaning discord not once but twice to be kicked out of bridges of meaning discord by joey not necessarily a big accomplishment because You could get kicked out of you get kicked out of bom by joey very easily But kicked out by jobe Ha ha ha ha ha Nathan got kicked out for behaving badly And and then he you know, then he used his own channel. So just just just nathan is nathan So he's just who he is. He's not a bad guy I mean when I met nathan when he came to an estuary meeting that tayo was doing up in um Up in manchester. He was great. We had fun and that's true. The internet brings out the worst in people it really does so um We'll see how it goes with cw and I and and and because it's with cw, of course cw is not going to sort of Um confront him the way. I mean cw and mark lefave are sort of two opposite things Mark is just all confrontation Confrontation Oh Cw Cw wants to interview scoundrels Um, this is really weird So so so mark is all confrontation Cw So mark is all boxer mark just pound pound pound pound Cw is all So He's not he's not going to directly confront he's just going to slip in little very subtle really nerdy little comments that You would really need a whole dozen footnotes to kind of understand and most of us won't but it'll make sense in cw's mind So Yeah, yeah. Yeah, nathan is the rick flair of this tlc, but I don't know who rick flair is so um Nathan is misanthrope. Oh, no Nathan is myth and misanthropic Oh, so it's gonna be fun see the internet should be fun That's what I keep trying to tell people you can do some serious stuff with it. Um Cw I look forward to you demonstrate how I told you cw you were right Will nathan be the prodigal son nathan's been the prodigal son a few times that he keeps Hey He keeps walking out again and he keeps coming back Ah see uninformed. No, I don't know enough All right, so that's what's coming that's what's coming all right Oh my gosh, I gotta end quite a michigan man Get it in there because I gotta end the questions because i'm going too long. Uh, okay um Why is your name paul if you're in fact so tall because paul means small I think um paul is a favorite name among good christian reformed people because the apostle paul i'm named after the apostle paul of course My question do you think whoops whoops whoops, okay, let's bring this in Do you think there's a role for liturgical art in the broader reform church on opc? Oh I Sam I've had artists in my church sally joe will tell you that one of the real problems with Protestantism is they they and it's telling It's telling and it's not a good tale That that we have issues with art visual arts It goes with the territory I Don't know if there ever will be sam People have tried i've seen it at calvin college, but the the churches in which they try then tend to go Mainline and then mainline just tends to go just wash out into the background noise of american culture so In that way the catholics and the orthodox, you know, they've got they've got it easier So it's a great question Okay, michigan, man, are you either either type this question or or not? All right end of questions january there I said it uh Is is paying to a bid to deny the existence of something valid and it's validating says mark for pope and Mark lefaber has a question mark lefaber of navigating patterns has a question I want nothing to do with any of your projects go away and stop trying to drag me into your name Antichristian heresies. I love it that mark is a defender of christianity But is he a member of an actual church there was a there was a There was a the the most important pastor Of the group of churches that I was working within the dominican republic All every they like to use him because he was a he was a dominican national But he was also corrupt as the day is long And every now and then he would do something the other pastors would want to attack him and the usual attack was always you Don't have a mother church. You're not really a You shouldn't really be a minister in good standing because you don't have a local church And I remember one meeting when they were attacking him. He stood up in that meeting and said yo soy la iglesia madre He said I am the mother church Stuck with me forever I just want mark lefaber to stand up and say yo soy la iglesia madre. There you go mark You can rename your thing. Yo soy la iglesia madre As a pastor when you preach how do you track whether or not you are landing your sermons in a way that is more than Propositional I track it by looking at the audience, but here's the problem with youtube I can't see you when i'm preaching I can't see and my rough draft is always my rough draft is is never as good as the final draft and If someone wants to send living stones two thousand dollars for a new mixer board so rick can integrate dante Send Send it send it via online giving to to living stones and um Because rick wants to so So those of you who are deep enough into this who have watched the sunday live stream know that the sound is terrible And the reason the sound is terrible is because we're using a little mic That's up on a stand and the reason we're using a little mic on the stand is we tried the other way of hooking up the mixer Into The feed for rick to take it out and it sounds even worse. So the best compromise was this mic What that means though is that my sermons sound like it doesn't sound as good as this and a lot of people have said Well, why don't you just put a mic on paul and we've worked on this rick and I have worked on this and we've spent a lot Of money on this and so then rick said um You know, here's this new board that has dante built in what's dante Dante built in that basically The board takes the signal and turns it into a digital signal and that can pass over The network and then rick can grab it and rick can do his magic and integrate it in and so but that's $2,000 and uh sound is really hard. No mark is mark is dead on right about that All those big spenders and wasted their dollars on youtube Uh sound is really hard few people can appreciate it. No, and if you start your own lighting is hard, too mark is see people Some people have dismissed and tried to exile mark But I never exiled mark because I listened carefully to mark and although his personality can be abrasive at times He is very smart and he speaks the truth He's got some other nonsense going on. But you know, that's why I like mark. That's why I won't Uh, oh dante is overrated. We'll send rick a note Um Oh, no mark you deserve it you're a good guy you're a good egg, um Pushing navigating patterns You got the endorsement of matthew pageau, what do you need from a little piker like me mark? Um, anyway I'm gonna go ahead and do a little bit of a Preach Oh Gosh, here we go Oh Uh I get distracted. Okay. Anyway, so that's that's what we're working on and anyway back to the preaching That's why preaching should be done in person Same thing well peterson has this thing about where he always looks at one person drills in on one person. I find that A little unsettling for the person that you're preaching at back in the day I used to get when when I first started at the church and um, You know when you go into a christian-formed church you get elected into it And so some people voted against you and didn't want you there I used to get these emails from one guy who was complaining that I was Um preaching directly to him, which I personally wasn't and I thought well If if you're feeling the conviction buddy, then uh, anyway um The different mark of tlc is that even the exiled will still watch the live streams if you can oh gosh david Uh, go yankees So yeah preaching is best on live And and the reason for that is Preaching is relational There there are There are churches that have there are mega churches that have a local music band and then the the preacher Comes in live. You might as well watch youtube A better local church has a real preacher who knows his congregation and can Address the congregation now. You can't even hit all of them in a even a small church sometimes but um, it's Real worship is dialogical and real preaching is dialogical And and every public every good public speaker knows that because When asked to speak somewhere the first thing that the public speaker has to think about is what is my audience? And preachers know that because they're in dialogue with the audience every day and that's why preachers are local and preaching is local Uh Michigan man out of curiosity. Have you been OPC me? No I enjoy the art when done in catholic churches, but often feel like i'm the only one who walks in the walks the stations of the cross so our Um, you guys are having conversations in the questions section Dennis you gotta crack down on these guys. Um God number no, there is no god number three grim. That's heresy god number one and two agent arena It's a it's a tension. You can't have three three is special two One two and three are very special numbers Did you get the four Four and any number larger are in a certain way all the same that's why three is important Grids I grew up in a medium large You guys are having a conversation in the comments. Thank you. Aaron. Aaron comes with a question Hey, got it. Got it. That should do it. Aaron you and I we should do a live stream. That would be fun. Aaron uh the i'm the the videos of the german conference are um Are seeping out slowly Aaron gave what for me was one of the most helpful presentations on nicha i've ever heard it was Outstanding Aaron's father was at the conference. He's a super cool guy Aaron's brother was I got to meet Aaron's brother when I was in the netherlands and this is such an awesome family Aaron's family They're really really wonderful people and and that's been If if someone asks me when i'm who who knows how old i'll be when i'm, you know, ready to depart this earth Someone asked me what what was the best thing about the tlc chapter of your life? I will definitely say the people The people the people because there's there's so many cool ideas in this world But a person is always more than an idea People are amazing they're in the image of god and so it's it's wonderful to meet wonderful people. Okay, Aaron's question I gotta keep my eye on the time after frequent peterson conversations and now a peugeot conversation How do we think of the relevance of russell bran to this little corner? Especially considering spiritual but not religious risks and conspirituality Good question I'm waiting for a An authorized brand peugeot conversation to come out before I give it a full treatment. There's tons of stuff in there That's worth it. I had no idea How that brand peugeot? conversation was going to go and It went well And it went well because brand in a sense has been broken And so he was ready to listen So I meant to make a video about it, but sometimes I have a thought and I just put it on twitter your Theory cannot save you And I think this is why Christ Is so foundational In that christ is not a theory. We have lots of theories about christ But christ is not a theory A human being is not a theory And to a degree I think New age New ageism is basically a a newer version of polytheism. That's basically what it is And and If you're a polytheist you are finally trying to broker deal with the deals with the gods to get what you want And what happens with christ is you finally bow your knee to christ And you say you are the masquerader You are the master i'm your servant and so I think I think russell's struggling. I think russell Russell is a very high status rando. That's how i'm going to say that arron Russell is a high status rando that gets to have speak because of his status hierarchy gets to have conversations with peterson and peugeot He's also very smart russell brand is no dummy He's he's mimetically brilliant otherwise he wouldn't have had the career he has he's also deeply flawed Which is why he's been subject to the addictions that he has in many ways russell brand is A possessed man and his exorcism is slow and painful And so russell is a brand russell is a rando. I think that's how he stands He's a rando that can get access that most of us can't Oh more conversation At least there's a question on the end. We are co-creators The right is given to us as co-creators that marks the difference between being a human Doing and a human being it also happens to be our telos That sounds good um corgus wag the dank We've got disenchantment. We've got estuary should the young bucks and tlc join a fight club Um Well, yeah the part of the problem of the youtube and and the internet is it's virtually and that's the whole point of estuary and um All of the in-person things, uh, I don't know that we necessarily need a fight club I don't know that we necessarily need to beat the crap out of each other in some Parking lot somewhere. I don't think that would help um, I'd much rather do an estuary and Um Yeah Uh eric question naming is framing I like that Do you think this is why the tree of knowledge and the tree of life have names in the bible? But no one knows what they're referenced to yeah Are we missing something essential about the framing of genesis without knowing what these names mean? I think we do know what these names mean, but I think like many names Name names Part of the emissary brain is we think that a name exhausts What the name is pointing to? But reality is such that even the naming and framing doesn't exhaust it because framing is part of apprehension and apprehension isn't exhaustion There's my answer Question to what extent do you think this little corner can be characterized as an attempt to reconcile athens in jerusalem? So The book of romans is an attempt to reconcile rome and jerusalem I think the church fathers Worked really hard to reconcile athens and jerusalem and in some ways You know perhaps the greek orthodox church is what Is what did that? Now athens is no longer what it once was rome in some way supplanted it but didn't completely supplant it athens remains I think this little corner is attempting to reconcile What is what is the heart of the enlightenment is it london? Maybe this little corner is attempting to reconcile london and jerusalem I Don't know what do you guys think? What what city what in jerusalem is this little corner trying to reconcile End of questions for january not a question sam continues this conversation. Okay. What is it 11 46? Look at that Look at that we've got time for You Washington dc obviously well, I thought about that one sam We've got time to come on in and play in the live stream Minneapolis and sacramento. Yeah, we're still trying to reconcile minneapolis and sacramento Uh london. Yeah, I thought london. I think that's right. Tio Because is there what would be the city of the enlightenment? Right Gotta let bruce in my goodness bruce. How are you? Hey, how are you? Is it okay to have a cigar on here? Is that gonna be a problem on your youtube? That's not a problem All right. I want to make sure A good reformed baptist has to have a cigar Uh, I I was just wondering you're trying to woo me with the sovereignty of god talk because I was all in It's it's always down there. I think i'm a calvinist and and we'll be judged for it Um, that's already been judged. Wait, we've already it's already happened. That's right. That's exactly. Yeah, okay Yeah, i'm trying to get there. All right Yeah, I wish I mean, I know you do your own thing on your channel paul, but uh, I'd like to see more of your uh, calvinism on display Because you're a confessional pastor I am you have a good a strong confession I do Oh my goodness never mind Paul doesn't want to lose all his listeners if he started confessing too much to his calvinism He'd gain you'd gain a few Bc opc Only yeah, and that's a regular that's a regular. Um, that's a regular request. Oh my goodness. Look at this We had dr. Chibby in the office I Don't know how i'm gonna handle all of these, uh, you know, we had a massive flood into the estuary here So, um, well bruce you're in first. Uh, yeah, I I hear that request. I I think that Those who want to see that I have my rough draft for sunday. I have my church work. Um I Yeah, I I I think I think to whatever degree well, first of all There is so much calvinism deep in american culture and I think that's another thing that the colons is actually notice Is that when when when the full video comes out and you look at what what um, malcolm colin says about his upbringing I'm calvinist. It's like yeah, that's an interesting kind of calvinist Not one that the crc would recognize but it's very much been here. It's much more southern presbyterian And so, um and part of what part of part of what we're wrestling with with the calvinism thing is press is the is the Is the the presbyterians versus the continental reform? Okay, don't forget the congregationalists Yeah, puritans and the reform baptist types which are even smaller Yeah, what is pvk trying to reconcile? That's a good question So, I don't know I don't know but but y'all rushed in here I don't know how we're all gonna get what what y'all came in here for so I mean any any last thing you want to say there bruce? Oh, no, I I just I wanted to I just wanted to uh Voice that you know, because that's how I that's how I came to you paul, you know I came to you that way. I came to paul. The calvin is talking about jp. I was like, let me get on board for a second You know, yeah, there's always doug wilson. I mean there's a yeah Yeah, doug is doug yeah, it's exactly right I love doug. I love doug for lots of things the culture battle. I call it not the culture war, but I don't love doug for anything else Doug is wilson is an exile from calvinism. It's tough. Well the confessional folks we you know, we have hard lines Yeah, you know so but he and I are friends probably All right, you know hank you you were you were next in here I think we got you in by order here so What do you have to say for yourself hank? I i'm still shocked and appalled that you don't know who rick flair is I have shocked and appalled to to be fair. He didn't know who nick cave was so, you know, yeah, I mean Look, this is what I sent out to sam This this is what I can't do when hank calls me Moreover bearing and you're gonna learn to love it All right, so I gotta I have to research nick flair on he is the most famous wrestler ever And he's the most obnoxious person and the most disliked person and that's when I confer Compared him to nathan. I can't compare him to nathan Oh, okay. Oh andre the giant is the most famous wrestler, isn't he or hulk hogan? Hulk hogan I think is the most famous wrestler. I think lucre has something to say No, hulk hogan is the most famous. I mean that's pretty simple. Oh, he just got you know, he got baptized a week ago Hulk hogan. Yeah, I did hear about that. Yeah, he got baptized a week ago Oh, yeah. Yeah, and by the way in three weeks, I will be down Father eric's right in his area going to his uh, he's got a bar down in clarewater florida Right, right hulk hogan is definitely more famous than nick flair and i'm the exam. I didn't know who nick flair was I could name Rick with an r a bunch of wrestlers Oh nick flair, I love nick flair nick flair. Yeah. Yeah nick is great All right, so you hank came on here to say nick flair. So there you go Oh, I I you know what i'm getting old so the words are slurring, you know, I mean paul you you understand about age, right? You're such a troll, you know, I mean, you know Things stop working, you know, you start hearing voices I started hearing a lot of voices back in the 70s when I followed the grateful dad, but that's a whole different story All right All right. All right enough from hank who's next one more thing paul, you know what my favorite grateful dad album was It it has something to do with your speaking today blues for alla really It's a great album Oh, I I I couldn't name a song from the grateful dad either There there were potheads at christian school who wore their t-shirts, but I never listened to their music You're you're not a you're you're neither a boomer nor the son of a boomer I forget that sometimes paul you're No, i'm neither. I'm right in the middle. I'm like I know tons of grateful dead songs you guys crazy But my dad's a boomer. So yeah, it makes sense. And your dad's a dead head. Isn't he sam? No, he he's a born again dead head like yourself Yeah my aunt uh used to Live very close to jerry garcia and hate ashberry and my cousin would um go to daycare with jerry's children What you learn on this channel my goodness And his aunt was married to jesus and sam you are you are just you are the american guy I'm as american as like i'm nothing if i'm not american that I agree Sam is a total unit unitarian universalist Yep Now luke's the universalist All right So who who who has dr jim you have limited time here. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, let me jump in I just wanted to say hi to everybody I mean there's so many so many friends erin who I met when I went to amsterdam and uh sam and i've talked I Was interested in sam's ai talk recently would like to talk to him about that luke Even though i've never actually talked to luke. I consider luke to be kind of uh, Sympathico And mark I got to know mark in arkansas. So I agree with you paul mark is Is a good guy And I just want to say hi to everybody. All right. No mark is a good guy He's he's much he's much better in person than he is online the internet brings out the worst in mark It really does I prefer mark online to be honest Really? No, i'm kidding He's mark online He was great yeah mark stayed here came to the lounge hung out with me and a priest and a bunch of cigars He's great mark is a catholic who doesn't go to catholic church. I keep father eric's working on him So I I pray for that work. So i'm trying to get mark to read the bible I made a I made an agreement with him. I don't know if we should publicly say it Well, that that would throw out that catholic stuff right away How's that sound? Happy new year If people if people would just read the bible they'd either be unitarian or reformed right guys Right if the lord decreed it for sure, I mean one of the two Yeah, exactly. Oh my gosh If you just read the bible you could be one of 60 000 protestant sex Catholics Then you could be one of 60 000 kinds of catholics Well, there's a You know what that's that's unity and multiplicity as john pageau talks about It's all in one church almond tree says read the bible harder Amen, dude, you should Paul paul, I would love for you to have a conversation with jason because he is a hardcore biblist Like hardcore. He thinks most people that are biblists aren't biblists enough And they pick and choose I would love for him to talk to youtubers Jason's like a bible. That's all he does is read the bible What else is what more profitable? That's great Oh, he's good. And if you guys want If you want to understand christian universalism the kind I would Advocate go to sovereign love wayne fair. He's a corner guy Watch his videos. You don't want to caricature it as the place to find christian universalism I'm not i'm not a rash i'm not a rationalist foundation Foundation I'm gonna approach the Apparently your internet's not rationalist either see it's dropping That's the man with the wind cassidy Who's next ladies first cassidy Oh Oh, uh, I just saw a lot of Friendly faces like dr. Jim. I want to say hi and I also just wanted to say the german bridges or breakwater Festival videos are coming out slowly trying to get out one a week. So erin's just got posted. It's great I have a panel coming out tomorrow um, as long as everything goes well, so Um, hopefully enjoy them and paul feel free to post whatever you want here Um, I have no ego about numbers. I just hope people can enjoy them and okay drop the link in the drop the link In the in the notes gassety here Okay All right, erin Let's say you Yeah, good to see everyone again Yeah, i've been really enjoying the talk up like you even selected two of my questions which was an honor Uh, so thank you for that. I usually get them all except if they uh, if something happens. Oh, yeah That's true, but you closed up the question. So I was like, oh no I was too presumptuous with asking a second one, but no it went all all good Uh, yeah, no, I I just I would like to talk about uh, chris video and about the content of it But we don't have to but that's just something that i'll be interested in discussing talk about whose video Yeah, so the video but it was again like the new lurker video by uh, chris Oh, oh waves of obsession waves of obsession. Yes. I just knew yes. Did you watch it? Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah, just just quickly before I Yeah, I know it's it's kind of surprising I don't know how it's how it's possible how one goes from this level to this level and just you know one day but Something worth discussing perhaps That's everybody's dream. Uh, let's see if I uh, Let's see if I I have it here somewhere. Oh, yeah, here it is I'll drop the link to it in the in the comments again um I thought one of the things that he did in that video was visualize the corner you're asking this question that is Difficult to answer in a question that i've asked myself. I'm you know fairly new I think I found paul's channel six months ago or something like that and you kind of go what is this thing? It's not It's not youtube it happens on youtube. It's sort of youtube is a tool of this corner and So when he started using like the visuals that that helped me all right Okay, he's onto something he can see it. I think in a way that I couldn't see it. It helped me I thought so too. I thought it was a some good mimetic so When chris williamson talks to peterson I should clip that Because chris made the point that there's sort of wisdom and then you have to Right now in the internet world you have to figure out how to meme it Because if you can meme it is like naming the meme it meming is framing too And if you can meme it now suddenly it can go um So he's I think he really did that well in that video and I mean he he he looked like a rando We hadn't seen his face before he's wearing a tie-dye t-shirt. He's got a quilt in the back, which is Probably done by his wife or his mother or his grandmother and he's got the door closed So, you know, he's trying not to give away too much person. I mean, it's just classic It's just classic youtube rando out of nowhere. I mean justin wells had better get busy. Otherwise, uh The waves of obsession is going to steal his documentary Right, it'll be kind of like in between justin wells and grim gris in terms of quality Yeah Yeah, no, but I was I was also thinking like, uh, I think what is what he's attempting to do right is he's Because sometimes we mention like, you know Get out there maybe start your own channel Maybe like just show your face if you're just watching not responding and he's kind of saying like i'm trying to do that But I really don't know how and now he's asking everyone to do that. I'm i'm curious if is that Just in terms of like hierarchy right like in terms of like what's the Let's say the natural model is that emerges in this little corner Is that something that we're after or is it something that we're trying to encourage and but are reasonable enough to see that it won't Happen because that's just not how things work like that. That's also was something i'm trying to understand I think like part of the hierarchy talk tends to Tends to retard the fuller imagination of something like a tree Yeah, you know you see trees in the book of daniel for example, and the beauty the beautiful thing about a tree is that a tree has niches So there are different branches in the tree And and there are different aspects of the tree and and the way this sort of I mean nobody grim gris is top brander of the corner. There's no question about that. You cannot watch his videos Without noticing the branding and the brilliance of the mimetic work and the branding but Like I said, you got a half hour of grim gris video and you got sort of usually five minutes of payload And so when I do a grim gris video, I just kind of skipped through and then I look for the payload where grim gris actually Reveals something about his heart because as a pastor, that's what i'm interested in. I'm always looking for the heart Looking for that moment that that person reveals something about themselves Because once that revelation happens, then you can have a meeting and hopefully you can have an elevation So there are and chad functions in a certain way sam has his role in the corner even though There are there is a hierarchy and there are hierarchies here. I mean sam referenced it in your conversation with verveky, too um you know and even you know, I you know where I stand with respect to john or jonathan or jordan or You know, but then there's these other around chris wayne. So there's a lot going on here So there's lots of different niches. And so one of the things that you can do actually Is and that's what grim does grim carved out a niche. He made a new ecosystem and that's that's really important right, yeah, yeah, and it's kind of funny because like one of the At least one of the developments within continental philosophy has kind of been to really at least like I think there's like deluge has been to like To go against the I think arborescent kind of way of thinking which is the tree way of thinking or actually But this like the hierarchical tree way of thinking and they go towards the rhizomatic way of thinking where it's like all you know Like that work's been spring up and that actually probably that kind of development within post-modern thinking has probably Left to people like jordan jordan peterson and jonathan peugeot then again saying no hierarchy is important So I find it kind of interesting, you know that we're maybe then counterbalancing that again or if we're doing something else entirely Yeah Who knows That's interesting too. Because you know fungal spores actually help support the tree, right? So that you have this You have you have the way the Great point pete. Yeah, interesting. It's hard for me to identify the corner in such a way because I don't I don't I don't see how you have a corner that doesn't have a centralized location for consuming that content person Uh, I don't really uh unless of course and in what I would submit is the corner Exists here with paul's location where everyone congregates That's the corner and everyone else is coming from the other places and then converging in the corner Uh, this is the corner at on paul's channel, maybe the discord Um, everything else is is is quite in the sphere if we're going to adopt the corner moniker And that that's for me that that that would be the only way I could I could do that and then in that sense There is a hierarchy because the p the edge of the corner or the the congregational place Paul at the head, but it depends right? Like you can also think of like i'm not sure if You can also think of a corner where you know, it's a corner because people might be able to hang out there Like they'll sit again one wall and then another person sits against another one It's not exactly like they're grounded like like uh, grounded one person there Not necessarily high level on that side It's just like it's kind of a cozy space because it's where people start facing each other if they start hanging out I'm not sure like that's just my conversation with it Yeah, they would have to hang out an interface for the corner to even be a thing, right? So in some sense where they hang on an interface That would be the manifestation. Yeah, fair. That's a good point what we're doing right now, perhaps, you know This could be considered that in some sense Rod you jumped in you don't jump in for nothing Actually, I jumped in for nothing No Because i'm Because i've never done this before and i'm like, well, how does this work? I was I was trying to get a little game of tic-tac-toe going with grim When there are only nine squares, um, no What since since dr jim and cassidy bull showed that you could just come on and say hi. I thought well I can I can do that You can do that. Thank you rod um, I I So there have been a number of people It's very interesting because there are I mean rod is sort of a semi shadow person rod has been on the marriage crisis videos and he and I have done some of some conversations but There are other people who I can't name or won't name who have followed the corner quietly from the side And they won't show up on these streams usually but one of these people has has often told me that he's one of one of the things he keeps toying with is doing trying to Aggregate stuff in the of the corner so that it can be found better and jacob has you know toyed with that idea too Jacob, you know when jacob was visited sacramento over a year ago and he took me out to lunch. He said Think about trinity broadcast network where it's a 24 hour I think am I gonna have to get a gold set and blue hair and um, yes, no, no, no, but uh 24 hour thing and and so there are moments when we sort of step on each other here, but Well just to establish my lurker bona fides I just looked this up the other day. I the first email I ever sent you paul was the 2nd of january in 2018 That's really early Yeah, so So i've been following and I you know, I had found you whatever a few weeks before that. Yeah All because I said whitensville. That's because you said whitensville where my dad grew up in whitensville. So, um So yeah, i've been i've I have definitely been following along for the entire journey the the discord thing always confused me so I never figured it out and I've always wondered whether someone who doesn't attend church regularly is exactly a fit for this group But i've always found your discussions fascinating. So I followed along the entire time Well, there's a lot of people in this corner that don't go to church every week Or or who have started their own church? So no and it's It's interesting That in some ways the corner has become self-aware I mean, that's one way to think about it and um So it's it is a thing but it's it's hard to know exactly what kind of a thing it is and you know sort of I i'm I I still have to iron out what i'm going to do about this the symbolic world conference. I don't think i'm going But what's super interesting to me about that will be how will the symbolic world conference be different from let's say the chino conference or the breakwater festival and I think it will be because I suspect that the symbolic world conference people who go to it like grim gris will feel this is a really orthodox space and whereas um, there's more There's more leeway, I think in some of the other corners of the corner We started It's sorry is pidgeot's following as community oriented as yours paul I don't think so I think they're more church oriented because it's closer connected to the orthodox church. I don't think he Feels the need to create something like that Well, i'm not even sure if like create something is Necessarily the thing i'm getting at I definitely think we're trying to create something but something that I always found interesting With what you did paul. I'm sorry. I have a screeching baby But it was the merando stories that connected us And then we made lots of friends and then things came from the friendships where pidgeot seems more like ideas And then he got a following from the ideas and then It's run more like a business not a family enterprise Well in I mean you have a ton of autodidacts in this group a ton, okay and For all the bs-ing that I do Sam puts up with me I put up with anselman anselman puts up with me You you've got to have a strong constitution Um Now I come from a sports background bullshitting is what we do Okay, and a lot of it I mean I kid in golf. I beat a great golfer one time And the father who I was golfering with said you just had him off his game because all you're doing was bullshitting the whole time I go. Yeah. Well, I wanted to win Okay The the point is um, and that guy would never play me in golf again ever um, but the point is is that Because there's so much free-floating stuff going on around Okay, and sense making is so doggone difficult I have to you know Sam is like iron sharpening iron for me and I hope I am the same for sam But there's a lot of people whether it's that's why a guy like jacob and mark just don't bother me. I don't care Okay I don't care Say what you want to say I've been married for 33 years. I've heard a lot worse Okay, a ton worse And so the the idea is i'm i'm i'm a learner. I'm 63 years old. I still want to learn And the life that I led 40 years ago is completely strange to me today in the sense that the world of 40 years ago Is completely gone It's it's completely blown up and gone Okay 40 years ago paul would have known this were a little bit the same age rodrick too the idea of transgenderism Our parents would have said shoot them Okay, my father never would have said that well trust me most of the guys I grew up with in a blue collar town would have said Shoot them. Okay, they're crazy Um because they would have been afraid of one thing are they rapists? Are they pedophiles? And and so things have changed where I wouldn't say shoot transgender people I I i i've sometimes i'm somewhat still like but I mean All the stuff's coming at you so fast and you have to filter it out That's the other thing the idea that everybody thinks they could just I have a hold on reality. We all filter stuff out We have to filter stuff out because if we don't we'll go nuts And So, I mean I I think what what? Paul is on the top of the hierarchy not because he asked to be on the top of the hierarchy Because that's just the way it fell And I think van donk helped you a lot paul on creating this community that you have And then then you know all of a sudden in chicago. I meet all these other autodidacts the tallest porto-week and pastor Okay um guys that that you know you meet that you would never In a city of you know a city of eight million people Like chicago eight million meeting in the whole area We've met some i've met some other kindred spirits and I think that that's good because honestly And this is not to poop by the protestant church when I was bored going to a process. Oh, yes it is I I i'm hit no Propositions all the way And I got tired of propositions. How does this how do I what what position did you have at willow creek? Remind me what does no i'm talking about the church that I went to before which was oh by the way a calvinist church Um, but what position did you have at willow creek? willow creek, um Well, I mean the the the the proposition for honestly Evangelism evangelism, okay Hank comes from an incredibly musical family, which he doesn't talk about very much and he was very involved with the music at willow creek So why are you criticizing him for being so propositional? Willow creek was not very propositional. Oh, sure. It was Absolutely. It was I mean for heaven's sakes. It was very propositional sam weiss, okay Let's land the plane. Let's land the plane sam's just bad at me because I still hit him hard on trinitarianism, but that's okay All right. All right. Here's the I have a thought um You were kind of playing with this a little bit paul, um earlier in this stream and it reminds me of something that i've You know brought up between us Privately and maybe came up once or twice in our in our conversation that we had on your channel I part of the reason why I keep watching I think Because I I think I admitted I wasn't quite sure why Um, you know, you're you're never quite sure why you find things interesting. Um But i'm i'm starting to have a theory at least about why I think i've been paying attention this whole time and I think I've been trying to figure out what you're up to And where you're going with this and you know, you're hinting at this a little bit in some of the some of the things you said earlier just uh today I think that's an extremely fruitful conversation. Um Even if there are no answers, even if you're not exactly sure what what what it is, I think I know that's one of the reasons why I keep watching is i'm like well Where's paul going to end up with all this and and then of course also is there a way that That I can be helpful. Is there some way I can be constructive in that? And where do you think i'm going to end up with this I I I don't think I would say uh, I it's it's your journey But we're all in it with you. We're all along this journey with you. Um, You got me thinking a little bit because chris and I both nashvillians were On one of your last chats and we were like well, maybe we maybe do something here in nashville But it probably would look very different than anything else you've done so far Well, and that's what I want to see actually what I what I you know Probably what I want is more of what i've been getting which is groups taking initiative participating in the network becoming a node And I think that's a lot of so when you look again at um At the video that landed today from I keep unsharing this screen. I gotta stop that i'm um The video that came today you know, it's it's just a celebration when another country is heard from because What what happens is that? Now suddenly there's going to be something new i'm not going to let you in andrew. Uh, there's something new I'll let you in there's something new that's coming in here and And so I i'd love to see what you would do in nashville I would love to see a nashville event because that nashville event will have something from the corner You guys would pick the speakers that might be a different mix from what we've seen so far And and you'd have to do something with music With music yeah, there'd probably be a lot less talking and a lot more music and more Yeah That would be an event i'd want to go to and my wife my wife owns an art gallery So we we have a whole kind of other community that's was grown around that so it's Yeah, you have a different experience when you're when you're connecting, you know, you're not just connecting intellectually You're sort of connecting by a shared some kind of shared experience You can almost get the passion of beauty community involved in something like that Because that's that's the different side of the corner that has grown and would work really well with event like that, I think Is anybody familiar with the rabbit room? This is for the nashville people and we can talk offline But just wanted to say that the rabbit room. I just went there Tuesday and it and it felt very much like it was This little corner kind of adjacent. They're kind of doing Some of the similar things kind of what paul's point. I was going to kind of jump back if that's okay Uh cassidy, I think you said you know the difference between a pageau And what pageau is doing maybe what paul's doing with his channel is paul is creating community and This was one of your tweets from a while ago, which is what fascinated me about this channel and what's going on is um paul is saying that his point is not in terms of content but in moving people from an audience to a community And the fact that you just post a link In your live stream to just let people show up and you know rods here going Hey, I just wanted to show up, you know, cassidy's here like hey, I don't usually pop in when you have a ton of people But I saw a bunch of people popping in and I thought you know what maybe today's the day I'll just pop in even though there's a bunch of people. I may not say anything But at least i'll pop in you know, because you because because that and that's creating community in a way I don't know. I think pete that I think you probably put your finger on what where my heart is at in this Turning an audience into a community. That's fundamentally what a pastor tries to do is turn an audience into a community and Because I think what people really need is community they need each other and that scales that's marriages That's families that's neighborhoods. That's Churches that's community and I know that you know for rod, I think that's really deep and rod's heart as well Yeah, since since we talked last i'm now in the music business like we started a music publishing business this last year and so You know now that i'm in nashville. I might as well join in right? So As I was talking to a friend of mine said i'm probably gonna lose all my money and he says no No, you won't lose all your money. You just lose the money you put into this But it's it's it's definitely fun to be kind of in the swim of it and you know being part of it but I think that's you know, one of the You know the ideas ideas are nice ideas are cool ideas are fun But community is way better because it's actually community that breeds ideas And so and you know part essential part of verveky's thing is this in between the transjective And so yeah, that's I I want to see flourishing and people don't flourish without community people without community die So we'll talk more about it. Well At least we're we're we're warming up to the idea might be fun to try something So we'll talk more see what see what kind of shape it might take good Now vendonk I was talking to vendonk yesterday and we're talking about we're probably going to do a video We we've got there's a bunch of people that are talking 2024, but nobody's sort of Planted a flag yet and said May 2024 these are the speakers because it actually takes a lot to do an event It is not a small undertaking. It is not without risk. There's financial risk There's there's ego risk that's that's what's you know, one of the things I liked about this video was he he names the fact that You know, there's there's ego risk in this because you make a video and maybe no one will watch it and then you're like But he made this video three days ago and it had like 12 views when grim gris sent it to me And so I I just want to encourage people, you know Do do something do something. Well, honestly Honestly paul I'd like to get you in the room with people that no one would ever think to put you in the room with too Like I think some of your and I know a lot of us who've been following you a long time probably all feel similarly like We really appreciate What you bring to a conversation. There's just so much depth there. It's you know, it's a bit niche, you know So it's not for everybody But you do have a way of of of grounding You know fairly abstract things into much more and I think that's the pastor in you, right? And there's a lot of people even watching you with with malcolm and simone the other day, right? Like you could see they were having as much fun as you were. Um, and I think it would be fun to sort of Get you into conversations with people who maybe have more of a cultural bent or more of a political bent or some other You know where it's you know, kind of pull it out of a little bit of the some of the more The theological stuff just just just for a change of pace if nothing else No, I think that I think that'd be great. Go ahead. Aaron at the same time like um, I think What really is the question like what or at least what was brought up in the video is how to not get Paul talking to more people but how to get more people talking like just in this space in general But I do I do see your point and I would say like by the way one thing that I was reminded of pete When you said like, you know, you weren't sure if you were gonna, you know jump in and then you did and by the way You did end up like bringing in a lot of useful stuff. So i'm happy you did. Um, but like at the the the breakwater festival we had Um one Let's say practice from thomas steininger. So his talk is also up on the channel. Definitely go watch it um, but I would say Like there was something really nice about his fishbowl practice and i'll just like briefly explain it because it's like very simple I think it's like if I remember correctly there was like seven chairs in the middle Of which six were filled with people sitting in the middle and then there was like a ring of chairs outside of that And then another ring and then another ring and those were also filled and the rules were very simple Like everyone in the middle can talk so like they'll have like maybe this type of conversation But there's always one empty chair and as soon as someone feels, you know from the outer ring like oh I want to participate in this conversation They'll go to the middle of the circle and then sort of organically someone in the middle of the circle will be like Oh, you know what? I kind of set my thing like i've kind of been listening in and now I can sort of go a bit So then an empty chair will show up again and sometimes two empty chairs will show up and it has this really It is like two benefits So one thing is that the conversation stays alive because there's constantly like a new influx of information But also that indeed people feel less afraid to partake because it's not like oh, you know Like I have to jump in for all of it and fortunately like andrew is currently showing what that means So thank you andrew for joining Now I and I I really I the german the breakwater event was great and part of what's been good Is all of the events are different and And everybody andrew you're making a lot of noise you should mute. Um, there you go All the events are different and and I really do encourage people to do different mixes Because the different mixes bring out different things and all of the events that i've had a part i've participated in Have been all the different mixes bring out different things different sort of spirits emerge from them and it's it's really cool Yeah, I guess what i'm what i'm also trying to like say is that It would be interesting if some of these practices like so for instance. I wasn't at many of the other festivals or meetings or conferences But for this one I thought was successful like on location and would there be a way to integrate that into like this type of You know online dialogue that we're having but i'm not sure how that could work that you know, that's uh, Something worth for like maybe talking about another time Okay, anything else before we land the plane sam you haven't said much or pete I don't know if pete you had another point You wanted to make Not off the top not yet I don't think islam and mormonism are very similar Really? No, not at all Very different well, yeah, they are different but you know some of their approach to to texts is the same and some of I don't know I see some resonance between them they're obviously separated by quite a bit but okay I remember ronnie stark saying I think of um, what was the kind of mormonism that it would be the fastest growing religion at Some point he predicted that but then it became islam. I think I mean having an active profit is very different from saying there will never ever be another profit Those that that I would say is probably the biggest difference. Oh, that's a good point. That's an excellent point You should follow the um what they're doing with the skinwalker ranch. That is some fascinating stuff See, that's an interesting show. I do watch skinwalker ranch. So those guys are lds Oh definitely, yeah, it's very very much an lds crowd. I just want to know what's under oak island. That's what I want to know No takers What's under the dallas airport no, it's not dallas, uh, what am I thinking denver Well, what's under the denver airport? lizard people apparently What's our people are under the denver airport? Well, like we are on the internet The one that was loose in miami, right? There was a lizard person nephilim thingy That everyone had to catch an arrest in downtown miami Check the internet check the internet It's like the top trending topic on twitter today is this alien creature nephilim thingy in miami I'm not joking the spirit of i well, I might be joking. I am joking and not joking I just love cassidy's reactions right now And andrew is in the bathroom getting ready for class Is this hair do any good I'm trying out new hair. Is it any good if I had hair honestly, it's just showing off You're just showing off with you that much exactly exactly All right, i'm gonna land the plane Thank you all for participating and remember embody and um I will I will end the transmission now.
