 Hi, this is Paul and starting the live stream today you might notice it looks a little different. It looks more like my thief in the night live streams because Rick is not here today. Rick so those of you who've been following the channel know that Rick is a motorcycle enthusiast and he after he started his day job he had a little bit more cash flow so he could be a little less miserly. He was never miserly. He was quite frugal with his financial decisions but now having an income source he decided to get a motorcycle. His last motorcycle was stolen from the garage that he lives in and so he had ordered a motorcycle and for weeks and weeks now he and I have been waiting with bated breath for the coming of the new motorcycle. He bought outfits that matched it. He was buying all the trinkets and toys to go along with it and this week he got the message that it wasn't going to arrive until April and that was completely that was completely dissatisfactory to him so he found a dealer that had one in stock in San Diego and I said well why don't you fly down to San Diego pick the thing up and drive it back from San Diego. It's a motorcycle after all and you can even take highway one for part of the stretch and so I'm a little envious of him because the and I made it makes me wish I had it made me makes me wish I had a motorcycle license and a motorcycle because riding highway one with Rick would be totally fun except Rick rides faster than I think I would ever want to and I'm not going to say more than that because I've already probably said enough about Rick who's who tends to be a fairly private person but so that's why Rick's not here today and so we will miss him and hopefully people in the comment section with their little wrenches can keep the the YouTube comment section in order and anybody with anybody with admin privileges if someone drops into the pvk q and a recorded voice room and has an open mic or something like that I'll try to do my best while I manage all of this so I don't have a lot of questions today which is nice because again what I don't see questions I've already started coming in because what I really like from this and from I haven't done a thief in the night a thief in the night podcast for a little while I've been busy this is a busy time of year for me because we have a thing called classes and so I have to do a little traveling next week for to meet to do my duties as a synodical deputy for the Christian Reformed Church for other classes and have my own classes to attend so I've been busy so yep and there might be a downturn in video production although every time I promise that there never is so but at some point there will be and anybody um let's see Christian Chris oh good Kristen's in the uh Christian's in the in the chat room and you know so the first question is his follow-up on last week's question on whether I'll just read the question here's a follow-up on my last question which was too vague if we say that the highest form of worship is to expend the greatest amount of energy to afford the greatest amount of attention to express the recognition of the highest possible worth in the object of our most profound love is it to is it reasonable to look at God's expression of his love for the world by the sacrifice of Christ as a perfect model of worship say again I I think I think worship really only goes up and across but uh not down and I think love so when we talk about this word love love in so one part of my upbringing and reformed dogmatics even before I went to seminary was the exploration of suzerain vassal covenants and all that sort of thing and if you read covenants outside the bible and including covenants in the bible you notice what is translated love is a particular kind of relationship that the inferior owes to the superior you the the subject subjects and citizens are not the same thing the subject owes love and loyalty to the sovereign this sovereign in these ancient covenants doesn't technically owe love to the subjects now the sovereign has responsibility towards the sovereign subjects but love usually flows one way now there's lots of definitions of love and part of the poverty of english is that we only have this one word that we use but there we have it so I'm I I I see where you're trying to go with this but I'm just uncomfortable um using worship in that word now I know Peterson is sort of chewing on the relationship between worship and attention after his conversation with Peugeot and you know even the Kurt Jemungal conversation that was released today this was this was recorded quite a while ago if you pay close attention to the recording dates of Peterson's conversations when he knew he was going to do this big book tour he banked a lot of conversations and those are sort of you know dribbling out now he doesn't try to keep them sequential and so I don't know what criteria he uses for when things should come out as quickly when things can wait I understand that dynamic because I very much have it myself so yeah but his relationship between worship and attention I think there's a relationship there that is worth exploring especially for secular people egalitarian people who have a high resistance to anything hierarchical and who have a limited imagination for for divine persons so I I get that but I don't know that it necessarily goes both ways so that's part of the reason that I'm sort of reluctant to to to really um see it to to create a sentence where God is worshiping us that violates another aspect of I think what the word worship points to so I think that's to so and but you get another question coming up so we'll we'll get on with that too then the one in the middle I don't know if I can answer have you done much reading into virtue ethics no if not what is your ethical framework that's an awfully broad question and as with many things we don't tend to I is my own ethical framework as such I've never really sat down and tried to locate it on other people's charts of other people's frameworks and mappings so I'm sort of at a loss to describe it I'm sure if you listen to enough of my videos you can probably plot me on somebody else's map but I I don't know enough of their mappings to plot so the the answer of no to the first question kind of means I can't really answer the second question very well for you uh Christian Christian Golden's second question do you think it would be possible for Jordan Peterson to express less contentment for and more of an knowledge branch to those postmodern neo-marxist types in a way that won't feel like a betrayal to his fan base I'm gonna take a drink of water for this one so Jordan Peterson has clearly been misrepresented seemingly intentionally so by many of the media powers that be that's I don't think a um controversial statement for those of us who have followed him quite carefully I think if you watch Jordan Peterson in his conversations as he deals with individuals now again individuals are a hugely important category for him I think in one-on-one interactions he does show respect curiosity and um I I think compassion for those postmodern neo-marxist types I think it's the type and the spirit that he comes out antagonistic towards part of the challenge of being Jordan Peterson is that he as an extended being has been has taken up he commented on this when he came back from his medical pause his avatars are out there and part of the difficulty of being Jordan Peterson is that his avatars are quite skewed if now all of our avatars are skewed those of you who only know me via my videos only know a slice of me and it's a two-dimensional slice in many respects those of you who know me a little bit better in person have a much much more three-dimensional view of me much more three-dimensional view of me my family knows me even to greater depths the people of my church know me at depth etc etc etc when we think of Jordan Peterson a lot of what we think of that depends on the representations of him that you have had available to you so this is a this is a problem with respect to all sorts of things and so if you mostly know Jordan Peterson from YouTube and if you watch a lot of other videos of a certain political certain political expression Jordan Peterson will look like all of these destroys take down I mean my YouTube feed this of course should surprise none of you my YouTube feed is simply full of little recut Jordan Peterson videos with enticing titles and attractive thumbnails I almost never click on these things because that's the nature of a clip the nature when when someone makes a clip it is the intersection between that which they are clipping and the relevance realization of the clipper and so I often look for videos that I prioritize the videos that come from Jordan himself obviously and part of the reason I so loved his conversation with Michaela and Tammy when they talked about personality types and personality types in terms of a couple is there is so much reality in that video where there's so much depth to the relationship between a husband and wife and between a parent's parents and an adult and a parent's daughter and a father daughter where the relationship is good and the relationship seems quite good and you know I think a few years ago I found Michaela's participation in her father's channel a little annoying I she has grown up a ton and having a child being married going through a divorce living in the public spotlight she has had to grow up and so lately watching her videos some I don't watch many of her videos but seeing some of her videos but especially watching her interact with her father and her mother it's just a delight it's just a delight I because what you see there is love and respect and honesty I mean Michaela can say things to her father that he'll take from no one else because that's his daughter and he loves her and you know on church councils I'm much more reticent a much more reluctant to have a father and a son on a church council council than a husband and wife depending on their relationship because in a healthy marriage husbands and wives can disagree with a lot and can challenge each other what you don't want in a church council is sort of like a romance on survivor where you know basically one person has two votes you don't want that in a church council so when I listen to Peterson carefully yeah he he can be he can be reactive he can be hyperbolic he can be short-tempered he can be angry and yes there's a certain amount of there's a certain amount of how shall I say it guilty pleasure in Jordan Peterson reactivity just like I know sometimes I get punchy or trollish and you know I think about Hank Hank loves it Hank loves me getting punchy and trollish and having some guilty pleasure when I get that and Peterson does that too and those things tend to get clipped and promoted and a big part of the this is so difficult I just started reading Hoffer's True Believer this morning and oh I can I really like it it's it's really good book's been around for quite a while I think was written in the 50s but on one hand the the limbic reactivity grabs our attention rightfully so and can be fun to ride you know Jesus Jesus can do it to his adversaries in the gospel and so I don't think in and of itself it's sin but if the only Jordan Peterson you know is the guy who's out there with his little screeds and his digs and his owning and all that angry owning the the libs or the Marxist or whomever that's that's not a full picture of Peterson and it never has been and so often when I talk to people who are just sort of sort of are sort of are the products of blue church media that's the only Peterson they know and it's a completely unfair picture because that's why I recommend that people go back and listen to his college lectures because there in the classroom he's he's being balanced he's you know you get some of his sharpness and his cleverness and his wittiness in those lectures too but he's not angry at Trudeau or what's happening in Canada etc etc and he's going to just lay out a screed and again a screed can be fun and a screed can be really important and helpful and sometimes necessary you need screeds but if a person is redeemed reduced to their screeding so you can very much find Peterson dealing well with his adversaries in fact the thing that initially drew me to him was the suspender video where on one hand he could be clear but he was dealing with students and you could tell that when he's dealing with students he was patient because he understood that these young people have not had much time to see some of these thin utopian visions bottom out and so when he was dealing with students on a college campus you could see that side of him more easily now in a sense when he's out there in the public sphere dealing with other adults who should know better then you can be more direct more angry because you're not punching down like you are if you're dealing with a group of students and what attracted to me initially were a couple of videos that I saw the suspender video then there was another video where he was giving a talk and people the students were just acting abhorrently air horns and shouting him down and not letting him talk and he kept his cool and he responded with civility and respect he returned good for evil and when I first saw that was that that was my first impression of him and first impressions are powerful part of the problem is that with all of the clippings of of Jordan Peterson's poning moments that becomes the first impression of him to the world and so on one hand I think I agree Christian with the what's behind your statement that I would love for the world to see have the same first impression of Jordan Peterson that I had where he's dealing with students that are behaving poorly now again if my wife is an elementary school teacher and my wife is a tremendously skilled elementary teacher she's a Waldorf teacher which means that she's with these kids for for for eight years and my wife does an amazing job of love and respect and authority with her students by her last class when they graduated eighth grade those those students would have laid down their life for my wife they loved her so much she was a mom to those kids and they still come back they're now in high school and they they some of them come back and they just love her because she was able to create in the classroom that that proper that proper context of love and authority that if done well creates sound human beings and so when I look at Jordan and his relationship with his daughter his son's not on which is absolutely fine but you you see someone that for all of his quirkiness I mean that that video with the three of them was just it was just so enjoyable because yeah Peterson's an odd duck so am I and in my opinion almost all of us are odd ducks once you get past a certain veneer of public sociality and we've seen a ton of Peterson but Peterson Peterson's his own guy and in talking about his relationship with his wife again another element in that video that came through that I thought was absolutely delightful and completely believable and is he tended to have more things that are often associated with women in terms of personality profile were higher in him than his wife and I think that's part of the reason Peterson was such a capable clinical psychologist as he could speak with women he could connect with women again you don't get that sense watching the avatars of Jordan Peterson on YouTube with all of the clips so I I think that sure if I was his handler and I think he's gotten this advice from other people you know find find venues where where you can show this side of you the difficulty is because of the food fight that has grown around him you can found a career on being a woman that attacks Jordan Peterson I mean the Kathy Newman interview was just there's a reason it has all those hits so yeah I I don't think I don't think yeah sure if yeah I I don't think I don't think yeah sure if see again I with as much Peterson that I've seen look at what happened with the Zizek interview now part of I think the first hour of that interview but the first hour of that event why Peterson didn't do so well as he he in a sense was debilitated by the way that most of the world is debilitated about Peterson is that his view of Zizek wasn't deep enough to understand that his planned approach to the talk was not going to was not going to work but once they got beyond that and began having a conversation there was a lot of good stuff in there and so I would love to see Peterson do more conversations with potential adversaries but part of the problem is that many potential adversaries just want to get on stage next to Jordan Peterson and own him like what happened at that monk debate which was which was a I mean I forget the name of the African American that that was um that was in there that was that was just horrible so yeah I I'd love to see I'd love to see a more balanced Peterson presented but given the zeitgeist of social media I don't think it's going to happen so I don't know what do you have to say Christian oh just really quick I just want to give like a tiny slice of context is that I have a very close friend of mine who's socialist slash communist and we've had like many productive conversations around politics and philosophy and religion and whatnot he's also an atheist and he one day asked me you know I see that you sometimes like stuff or share stuff by Jordan Peterson all I've heard is this bad stuff about him can you just send me something that you think accurately represents him so I quickly you know I just grabbed a few links to what I thought was more representative of Jordan Peterson in terms of his like a holistic view of his character and how he reacts to certain things and as soon as he you know caught wind of the even just like the phrase the way that Jordan Peterson would um the emotion that he would put behind his saying like those post-modern neo-marxist or whatever right it completely turned my friend off now I if I I like Jordan Peterson right and I've seen lots of stuff I went to see him in Rhode Island a few days ago it was fantastic um if part of his motivation for doing what he's doing is to reach people who are of those post-modern neo-marxist types I've I hope to see him and I've seen him like you said I've seen him articulate things differently but I hope to see him extend more of a maybe not necessarily an olive branch but he'll say very quickly in passing you know it's no wonder people think the way that post-modern neo-marxist types think but then it's just immediately into criticism after that right yeah so you know I am a bit tilted in this regard just because I have this very close friend who I would like to see extend an olive branch towards Jordan Peterson right like the moment that he did though he just he watched a couple videos that I sent him and then of course he found the little clips like he were talking about that take him sort of out of context or whatever so it's just um if Jordan Peterson is at least partially desiring to reach those people I feel like he could articulate things differently to be more rhetorically persuasive to them now if he's but if that's not exactly part of what he's trying to do then obviously whatever right but that was kind of just the uh the motivation behind my question but thank you so much for your answer yeah well I hope it was helpful that was too long I'm sure but I hope it was helpful so no I agree 100% and I think I think he intended this second book to be beyond order to to try to balance the first but there hasn't been a lot of discussion on his second book he lives mostly on YouTube because he's a much better speaker than he is a writer because he's a much better speaker than he is a writer and YouTube is just just in terms of how he is YouTube is his medium not print and so yeah yeah no no PK Josh what do you think of Jordan Peterson's wake-up song I listened about half of I thought it was very interesting um this morning Jonathan Peugeot tweeted that he just started listening to the rise and fall of Mars Hill and he'd been kind of holding off on that for a whole bunch of reasons and part of me feels the same way about Canadian politics you know I I certainly am my filters have been deeply shaped by most of you listening to Peugeot listening to Peterson but I also have other friends long-standing friends who are Canadian and so I sometimes send some of this stuff by them and see what their take in it on it is I was thinking this morning just how I was thinking this morning just how we cannot see the world objectively I mean I make that point again and again and again philosophically but just like with this last question Christian um once that once that first impression is set in it's very difficult to give someone a fair listen and without some sort of internal transformation persons are very powerful in us and these are you know what you're hearing now are little bits and pieces of lots of videos that I've been thinking about making that haven't made because things haven't gotten formed well enough you know and you know we've done a lot of talking about Sam Harris in the last few weeks and can I give Sam Harris a fair listen that's a very that's a very fair question because persons so so now four years into this what what are how can we describe what this little corner of the internet is about you know I've been struggling a lot with getting the the question okay the Canadian truckers protest is there an essence to that yeah I think so can we talk about its essence yeah can we can we sort of take that Canadian truckers protest as a manipulable what do I mean by a manipulable so when you know my wife and I homeschooled our children and my wife was trained as a teacher and so she you know she very much set up that whole program and I sort of followed her and so when she was teaching our children to count and math she she said well we need manipulables well what are manipulables well in order to teach like counting you get little blocks so when you put those blocks together and and and once you kind of have those little blocks and you can move them around it's all that exaptation because once you learn as a child how to move things around pretty quickly you start moving things around in your head and you no longer need the little blocks we've got the reverse issue when you ask something like the Canadian truckers protest because if I talk to people in this little corner of the internet well they have a particular this is who they are I talk to others who let's say are listen most of what they know from this they get it from Canadian media sources and that's a whole other conversation that I've learned a lot about and talking to Canadians just how much just how just how involved the government is in Canadian media sources either directly by government ownership or by government sponsorship it's like yeah independent news but what is independent is none of us are independent so figuring out what all of this is and we need these handles in order to talk about things because we we have to sort of manipulate them in our mind and on our mappings but to do so especially over a border you know I think one ought to have a little bit of humility now I've got a fair amount I know the Christian Reformed Church is a bi-national denomination what that means is that about oh I think it's about two-fifths or one-fifth to two-fifths of Christian Reformed Churches and members of the Christian Reformed Church live north of the border and this has to do with Dutch immigration patterns after the Second World War so you know I went to Calvin College and there are a lot of Canadians at Calvin College there are a lot of Canadians at Calvin Seminary there are a lot of Canadians who take churches down here in North America Derek Zile who was a seminary intern of mine here when he was at Living Stones hung a Canadian flag on his office door here at the church which a lot of the people at our church were like you know what's that about I remember once the deacons called me into the office because someone had put a Canadian quarter in the offering plate and the deacons didn't know what to do with it I said just pass it along but then I discovered here and in banks down here in California if you you know you find it if you pass a Canadian nickel or Canadian quarter to a bank teller they'll they'll give it back to you in Michigan there was no big deal because Michigan was closer to the border they just would kind of doesn't matter you know yeah so what if that Canadian quarter is worth less and just pass it through it's only 25 cents so on and on and on and on and on and on so I continue to watch the Canadian political thing I'm I'm astounded at Trudeau at the statements that he's giving and and when I hear you know and so I've developed some really good friendships with some Canadians and so when I talk to Canadians but but that's on both sides of the political divides in Canada I listen carefully because they're my friends and I know they're being honest and I know they're being sincere they also have their own point of views so that's that's the way it goes in terms of knowing the world but some of the the Canadian government during COVID it's just been absolutely insane and yeah yeah so it's it's been a fascinating experiment to watch but I'll I'll not wade in this exactly what Peugeot said about the rise and fall of Mars Hill he says you know I I'm really hesitant to wade into these things that are a little bit of ways for a little bit away from me and I feel the same way about Canadian politics I'm not a Canadian citizen I don't I don't live in Canada I don't have a stake in your politics and so I'll frankly not meddle with it or or express a lot of opinions about it I certainly can form opinions but I hold them loosely because I just don't know that much but when um when one of my daughters showed said the whole thing about Trudeau and Fidel Castro first I laughed at it and then she said my daughter is by no means a conservative by any stripe she said no really look it up and now I can't see Justin Trudeau and not think of old pictures of Fidel Castro so these these things get into our heads so I thought this and and then the whole other thing about Peterson talking about music and wanting to get into music and like really dark poetry and the the the illustrator that he works I I find that all fascinating so I was I thought the song was incredibly interesting but I didn't didn't really choose to comment on it so what do you think is more likely after all that is going on in Canada that Jordan Peterson runs for prime minister or that he renounces his Canadian citizenship and relocate to the U.S. neither both most Canadians that I know who live in the United States don't give up their Canadian passports I had a conversation with a friend of mine about this a friend of mine who was lives in Canada who was seriously thinking about moving to the United States he said whole varieties of job offers from the U.S. and so could easily do it and he said yeah I'm a little hesitant about you know giving up my passport you don't have to give up your passport just keep your passport that's two passports it's not a big deal I know lots of people do it when I met the bishop of the Anglican the bishop over the Anglican church that meets here he says I've got a British passport a Canadian passport a Nigerian passport and an American passport he's got four now countries don't like you having all those passports but so I think Jordan well what Jordan Peterson's gonna do I don't know I don't know you know he he seems to like touring that much is obvious he's doing it again I look at that schedule he keeps and I think oh living on the road like that but he and Tammy take it up on his sort of an adventure and enjoy doing it and so he might just keep doing that Michaela's relocated to Nashville and you know maybe you know who knows if she'll get American citizenship or not it's many Canadians I know have either because they married Americans or they've lived down here and worked the immigration process so I I don't think Peterson would give up his Canadian citizenship he's he's deeply Canadian he very much is so I don't think he'll give it up would he live in you know I I could I could understand Peterson definitely has an eye for the stars now I think some of that is he's a social scientist and so you'll always he pays attention to what the crowd pays attention to so even the the the 12 rules for life book was based on Quora so he's a social scientist so he he puts things out there and he looks at the data coming back and if things get upvoted that's that's an indication to him that he should pay attention to it and so he very much does work on hierarchies and structures but he also does seem to have an interest and perhaps even a degree of infatuation for for for the heights of society and so you know might he might he join his daughter in Nashville or might he where you know Ben Shapiro is as well or might he be lured to the you know the new hotness of Austin I mean in some ways Texas and Alberta are have interesting have an interesting correspondence so I don't know I don't know what he'll do I mean right now he can if he if he lives on tour as he has been doing I mean he he he crafted his home and in Toronto and he remodeled the the top floor to be like you know to be like the the his you know he talks he has his friend from that from that Canadian he's a mixture of all these things and so I don't think he'll leave too much of it behind I don't think he'll run for office partly because well I think we saw boy am I gonna get into trouble with this with some of you I think we saw some of what in the Trump administration you get when you have someone who really isn't a politician but sort of finds their way to become the chief politician of their chief politician of their country it's tremendously attractive to become president of the United States but does that mean you want to do the job of the president of the United States so career politicians tend to work their way up the hierarchy but the job of running a country is that really what Jordan Peterson wants to do I don't think so I think he likes doing what he does now now you know I think about this in terms of my own career like I said I'm getting ready for classes and I just don't have the kind of enthusiasm for classes meetings that I used to have and part of that is because I'm having so much fun with all of you and there's a certain amount of shop keeping that goes with all sorts of responsible positions including prime minister of a party I mean because that's that's also different from president of the United States I mean we've seen we've seen hard-working presidents of the United States and presidents of the United States that spend most of their time on the golf course I don't think he's particularly interested in running Canada and I don't blame him because now I live in a political town Sacramento's the capital of California and I've two of my children's two of my children's two of my children either do or have worked in state politics and I have members of my congregation who work in state politics and so politics is a thing and just like just like ministry there when I retire there will be aspects of my current job that I will be happy to leave behind and there'll be other aspects that I miss so I don't think he's going to get into politics he'll dabble in it he'll talk about it he'll push in some ways he might even lobby and promote and get involved in that way but professionally it's I don't know that he wants to be a professional politician I when I listen to him talk about how he lost his his clinical practice I hear lament when I hear how he lost his you know ability to lecture at University of Toronto and work with graduate students I hear lament he genuinely loved those jobs and by virtue of everything that has happened to him those things were taken away from him and that's sad working politics he had interest in it in his youth I don't know that he would have interest in it now but we'll see I think we're going to continue to he's he's an eclectic guy who has many different interests he's done a lot of different things over his life when you listen to him talk about his consulting work he's obviously an entrepreneur who likes to get things started and so he's obviously a very high energy person who doesn't like to sit around and do nothing he works hard hard hard hard hard all the time I think actually as you know he's he's obviously got serious health concerns and that style of living which is workaholism is very demanding he might have to you know if if I were his pastor I would recommend that he find ways of achieving and experiencing meaning that don't require quite so much of his body that might be more writing but yeah it's a free world he's a free man he knows himself way better than I know him I don't really know him at all personally I just watch him closely so I think we're going to continue to see him do all kinds of things you know that even that video with Michaela and Tammy that was really all about his personality instrument more than his family life and so he wants to keep he wants to keep working on stuff like that that interests him he's going to keep doing it and he's got way more avenues open than he's had before so I'm just I want to see him get back to doing some biblical lectures we've we've been hoping for that since 2019 and it's 2022 so it'll come it'll come any thoughts on the bible verse issued by the Chinese government I read that and I thought I hadn't heard that at all I hadn't heard that at all there was there's a ever since the the invasion of Ukraine there's a lot of question about Putin's relationship with orthodoxy that's a very interesting conversation and some people have sent me different articles uh Giles Frazier wrote a very interesting piece in unheard and then someone from this community sent me an article on um basically with uh with with some fairly high up orthodox um individuals basically saying you know Putin's not our guy so if evangelicals had Trump trouble orthodox have Putin trouble um and I wouldn't trade evangelical problems for orthodox problems in this case and those the I mean because is the relationship between Trump and evangelicalism analogous to the relationship between Putin and orthodoxy I don't know I I really don't know so but the questions are interesting and this gets to to this ongoing conversation between the likes of let's say uh Nate Heil and Julian so you've got a Christian anarchist and you've got an anabaptist that look at orthodoxy and say I'm a little uncomfortable with the millennial realizations that orthodoxy tends to lean into and I think they have a point and these tensions in Christianity go all the way back to the beginning in terms of Jesus relationship with the culture war in Judea I mean those of you who listen to my rough drafts you know that I have made this a big piece of my gospel teaching partly because of the way that that Christianity relates to American culture America is a deeply Protestant nation less so every year and so when the stuff is the stuff the stuff goes so deep so in some ways the kingdom came with Constantine but did it so how do you tease out all that eschatology so now with Putin and the Russian government pouring money into church buildings in Russia and then almost immediately someone sent me a link that said yeah the Russians are building church buildings but they're they're quite empty and another person saying yeah that's a fairly Protestant way of thinking about it and everyone along the way in that discussion was right because a church building a cathedral for orthodoxy is very different from a meeting house for Protestants the theological valence of those two things are very very different and so it's going to be very interesting watching this you know because Putin's always Putin's a dictator a functional dictator at least and yeah and you know the Chinese David Brooks wrote an article not too long ago about you know also the Chinese government and creating some Confucianism religion communist thing along with their social credit score I mean there's tons of stuff going on right now and you know again it's part of the reason I picked up Hoffer's true believer because right in the first chapter he starts talking about nationalism and he basically makes the claim now he's writing in the 1950s that that nationalism sort of has become the world religion and we see that on full display in the Russian invasion of Ukraine you know and and when you have a conservative evangelical Christian like David French who's sort of been on the never Trumper Jesus and John Wayne side of evangelicalism complaining about Christian nationalism to say well we're all Ukrainians now it's like all right so maybe it's not American Christian nationalism but it's sort of it's still nationalism to say we're all Ukrainians now because you've just made a national identity your foundational identity so there's a ton in this right now and so have the Chinese government quoting from the Bible I think the Chinese government fears the rise of Christianity in its country and has everything to fear from it but Christianity's relationship with political systems I mean one of the one of the choicest moments of my conversations with Jonathan Peugeot was when he admitted he's a monarchist and I thought of course you're a monarchist you're oracle course you're a monarchist you're orthodox to be a Protestant is is is is to be to be democratic and then we got Nate Heil who's a Christian anarchist I mean anarchists were the bomb throwers that started the first world war now he'd say not my kind of anarchist well of course not so I don't know it's this is this is oh gosh look at the questions just came right in um I don't know I kind of want to hear from the uh the chat room on this I would imagine I've motivated some of you to break your your internet-induced silence Tolkien was an anarchist that's all I'd like I'd like to claim him that's not quite accurate though he did he had sympathies for kind of like wavered in between Christian and monarch and obviously had distributist leanings too um I don't know if people have been paying attention to the break between um the Ukrainian Orthodox Church being given given autocephaly by the ecumenical patriarch and everything that's gone on there um I just I see a lot of Protestants not even realizing you know that that that break means nothing to them whereas I think for people who are genuinely Orthodox um you know having the patriarch of Moscow and the patriarch the ecumenical patriarch feuding over a patriarch in Kiev is is not light matter yeah I know nothing of this side of the world so uh but what I do know is that religion is not unimportant that I do know and I also know that nationalism in the modern period has rivaled the great world religions and the relationships between them wow this is important stuff so yeah and and and part of the poverty of our secular news in the states is that this has been brought up time and time again in the American political system the vast majority of news reporters in the mainstream news are complete secularists and they look at they've got tinted glasses that basically filters out religion as unimportant or or basically ornaments on the conflict and how how to how to talk about this boy it's I have no idea so that's why it's it's very interesting to me to hear um to try and get some reasonable treatment of it from people who are far closer to it than myself you know it's part of the reason why the um the quiet revolution of Quebec to switch from being deeply catholic to deeply secular it just fascinates me all right in light of political events I can't help but think that it would what it would be like if internet and twitter existed at times like during the second world war and earlier even with infinite photo and video of what's going on right now decades later people will argue about what really happened yep makes me think about your frequent question did caesar really cross the rubicon could you please unpack that for the uninformed I'm uninformed thinking about also the modernist lens of viewing history especially the bible and the peace and and your piece this morning on literal that's everything that I talk about all the time we don't see the world as such that that that is now some via science we just can't hold that we to to see is to interpret and so and so Christian golden's friend who sees Jordan Peterson can't unsee what he has seen before unless a degree of transformation happens in him or her you you you you love in order to know anyone who is a parent knows this on one hand if you have a child that child is different from every other person in the world that is not your child how you can spend a lifetime delineating the difference world war two would not have been the same with twitter or the internet the world history history is a long string of completely unique things patterns emerge but you can't divorce events from what make up the events yeah the caesar cross the rubicon you can listen to uh tom holland's podcast on that basically what we know is that caesar decided to take his army into italy and that ended the roman republic and in a way that before i forget was it sulla who did it i don't remember um so yeah yeah it's it's all my videos it's all my videos this is this is what i this is what i wrestle with this is what i this is what i wrestle with and you know so that's why when to listen to jordan peterson basically say out loud something that i've been trying to say a lot which is the modernist fundamentalist fight that sort of is over this word literal that that word does not serve either side well because then i had i got i really avoid too many back and forths on twitter that deal with substantive issues because literal basically means of the letter and in the transition from the reformation to modernity which goes from something which is text-based these are a lot of my earlier videos if in the 16th century you were to learn physics that meant you would study aristotle by the 19th century if you learned physics you go out and do tests and measurements of the physical world there's the transition so that word literal does not serve as we want it to now there are abundant questions about the relationships between text and physical measurements in the world one jericho or two one blind man or two they mean the synoptic problem as as it came to be known in the modern period is it's all over the place part of the problem is i think c.s lewis nicely lays this out in his book miracles a fork happened and we we're we're simply not cognizant of that fork jesus sits at the right hand of the father is that a physical description you can see where neither yes nor no get at what a lot of modernists want to know but a lot of what modernists want to know isn't exactly what they think they want to know when the apostle's creed says jesus sits at the right hand of the father it's talking about a relationship over heaven and earth that jesus is lord it's basically what it's saying but when you oh okay well why didn't you say plain jesus is lord well because when we're using those words we're basically using the words of the roman empire that said caesar was lord and so in some strange way heaven is related to rome and a throne in rome is related to a throne in heaven and all of the ways in which caesar ruled over rome sort of get mapped on to jesus ruling over all of the cosmos he said well none of that cosmos and said well none of that quite works no it doesn't and and hence we have the limitations of language the limitations of our imagination and the limits of our knowledge and so asking whether jesus is literally sitting at the right hand of the father doesn't prove to be terribly helpful and so much of my channel talks about that and uh and it was nice to see peterson basically come out and notice it because this has been a tree that he's been barking at but he's not been embedded in issues like this like like i have so i'm i i pastor in a moderate church whose tradition goes you know so dutch reformed or sort of magisterial reform that go back to calvin in the you know in the 16th century and second generation reformer those issues are at play but at least enough of our reformational documents are pre-modern enough to preserve a lot of the pre-modern language and and the and protestant devotion to the bible itself brings a lot of that in and so whereas for a lot of americans during the modernist fundamentalist fights a lot of the arguments went back and forth over science versus the bible but what i discovered when i was learning the bible and seminary is that oh you don't really have to go looking to science to have these questions there's plenty of those questions just reading the bible and robert alter gets into some of these issues i mean how many times did david meet saul once or twice uh how many how many blind men were there outside of jericho and i remember my seminary professor trying to figure out the concordism of that story for us and going down the one jericho or two argument that was my systematics prof my new testament prof at the beginning of the class basically tried to cover himself and say look this synoptic issue is challenging but i am not going to go down the road of trying to based on the scriptures delineate a geographical mapping of exactly what happened here and there and when and where and how those relate to what's argued about from the text i don't think that serves ministers because ministers are there to serve congregations and to help the text be useful in their lives and all the ways that the test text was written to be useful in their lives so this issue this is part of the reason i found jordan peterson interesting because i had an intuitive sense i couldn't articulate it right away and i've been working to articulate it ever since i i had a sense that what he was working on might be helpful with this problem just like i found that c.s lewis was helpful with this problem and then john and jonathan peugeot comes along and what on earth is happening there and then john vervecky comes along and and here we are so and and and you might think well all these are problems of religion if you don't have religion you don't have these problems well that's sort of no no i'm not at all it's in our politics you know to have john vervecky i i used that little clip from his conversation with with peugeot and barron and peterson to have john vervecky basically point out that science can't justify itself oh that's a problem so it yeah so all my videos are about this or at least a good number of them the questions just keep coming all right dave 77 hi paul i still struggle conceptually with the ideas of god and for god number two i guess i never should have said anything i can't exactly hold a concept of god that unifies these ideas well there are tensions between them that's why you there's why there's two but i also have to say that it's this it's this agent arena relationship dilemma i also have been struggling to come up with a precise question to put with regard to this so i'm going to ask generalized question how do you unify these ideas in your imagination do you actually sometimes imagine god in different ways depending on the circumstance in which you wish to address him is it possible that verizon lisa shouldn't be criticized for doing this verizon lisa has a point no you're exactly right how do you not fall into the trap of always conceptualizing god mostly as god number two okay back to pascals spirit of finesse and spirit of geometry in a sense if you're looking up use the spirit of finesse the fear of the spirit of finesse is the proper mode with which to relate and i think this is why as you naturally say i i relate to god number two because that's the proper mode for relating to god we have to relate to god as person and in the case of trinity persons but it's a weird the trinity is is a is a it's a big deal but i don't want to get distracted by the trip i try to keep the trinity separate from god number one and god number two because then everybody always brings in a number three and then you've broken apart what i'm trying to do because i'm trying to deal with these dualisms so yes i i in many ways can't relate to god number one because that would in some way be relating to god as arena even though there's an our god is a renek and paul talks about that in quoting the pagan poet in him we live and move and have our being and the whole world is full of his glory but the mode that persons relate to god will be personal because that's what we're doing Peterson notes this too it's offensive to relate to people with the spirit of geometry and we do it all the time that's all the dismissiveness with the the current bulvarisms of wokeism well you just believe that because you're you know then fill in the bulvarism you're because you're a man or you're a woman or you're gay or you're straight or you're republican or you're democratic or you're an american or you're a bolshevist or you're neomarxist or all of that all of that depersonalizes the person makes them flat and basically puts you in the mode of the spirit of geometry the spirit of finesse means when you go and you relate to a human being you treat them as a person and so when you relate to god you treat god as a person always and the reason you use masculine all right this is some people aren't gonna like this the reason you use masculine is because that's the proper mode in terms of the agentic versus the arenic so yeah use the spirit of finesse use the personal relationship that is the proper mode now i was oh esther sent me down a rabbit hole this morning with um joseph's joseph ski um ski hum bra something like that joseph's joseph ski um ski hum bra something like that esther had a bethel had a conversation with him and he's he's someone that had been abused by a boy as a boy as a pedophile priest um and he has long history with this now he's gone orthodox so i was reading his blog this morning finding it very interesting and where's it going with this oh shoot where was it going with this because it connects with this shoot i can't remember anyway um oh yeah arenic dealing with something in an arenic way oh yeah so if you read the old testament and it's in the new as well there's sort of the divine passive what is the divine passive with respect to this it's it's similar to karma it's basically the the the logic of job's friends when job was wealthy and full of children and had good fortune that meant that god was smiling on him that's a karmic approach to the world now very quickly with the story of israel with the story of job with the story of jesus that runs into trouble if in fact israel is god's chosen people and if god is in heaven god is in heaven ruling over the world then israel should be on top of the world jerusalem should be ruling the world instead of rome or washington and god's chosen people should have preeminence everywhere and always that is logical that is the logic of karma that that which is true in heaven is expressed on earth now why does israel suffer job was a perfect man fabulously wealthy best numbers of children seven sons three daughters herds and wealth morally upright just in all his ways and raiders come and steal his flocks whirlwind comes in the house collapse and his children die well surely this must be yeah needs to do a longer monologue to go into the theory dividing masculine and feminine the theory dividing masculine and feminine the i fear that anselman it's like the minds of moria what happened why the calamitous fall well the story of job is in some ways parallel to the story of israel why the endless life in exile for god's chosen people you know they had their day in the sun briefly with david and solomon and had a few other periods after that where they have a degree of instantiation and autonomy but um no what how can you say you're god's chosen people when you have hundreds of years of anti-semitism thousands of years bring it back before even christianity everybody hating the jews you've got mordecai and esther you've got you've got um claudius emperor claudius chasing the jews out of out of rome you've got you know how can you say your god's chosen people chosen to suffer that makes no sense it's karma and this is all so so in some ways the book of job is in microcosm the story of israel and this is of course also the story of jesus because the question is and this is all through the gospels if jesus is god's own son then he should be enthroned in jerusalem and jerusalem should be preeminent over the world in some ways it's the story of dune you know mwadib this is this is the way messianic stories go and christianity plays on this and of course you have the book of revelation which says that it's only a matter of time and the true king of earth will be recognized and every knee shall bow and every tongue shall declare that jesus is lord of all so christianity tries to deal with this question islam has the same question and so when american troops were stationed in saudi arabia which for osama bin laden was the holy land this was an offense and and many many islamist muslims had exactly the same question as to why if islam is right and as muslims are god's most faithful people why aren't they ruling the world and why are these corrupt hedonistic americans and the and their western allies ruling over the holy lands so that's in some ways a question about god number one because god number one is the god of outcomes this is going to come in my sermon this week a little bit it's the god of outcomes if something happened it was god's will that sets up a lot of uncomfortable questions in christianity you can find them in nathan jacobs documentary on becoming human because it sets up the problem of evil well my beloved uncle who was a wonderful man and a godly saint fell asleep with smoking a cigarette and the mattress lit on fire and he died and other christians will jump in and say how godly would he have been for smoking a cigarette see um kind of being like job's friends but in some ways if if the christian god is agentic and arenic and lord and god of all and all powerful and he doesn't have to contend with a meta divine realm why are there outcomes that clearly seem evil so these are the questions and the dramas inherent in the world view but if you're going to and see this is this is the this is again back to the proper mode when you think about the united states as a reenac it's not hard to think of the united states as arenic because i live in the united states we move in the united states yeah there's a um i live in the united states we move in the united states the united states is very arenic we agentify it all the time russia is very arenic but we agentify it in our sentences when we say russia invaded the ukraine so super chat there um christ appears first to mary magdalene is that because of all the people he healed she had suffered the most you can't measure suffering like we measure flower she certainly had suffered and i don't think it's impossible for us to say she suffered more than others but suffered the most that's hard to say and i think that's why only god can judge so we must we relate to god number two but we understand that the governor of the universe is arenic as well as agentic and when that is lost you tend to be open to the kinds of sophistry let's say that the new atheists made a lot of hay with at the towards the end of modernity here so let's see if dave 77 is in the room i hope that hope that answer was helpful i really should learn french la force i would imagine i'd like to ask if you have ever noticed you have ever noticed church leaders and members act like neutered cats what do you mean licking licking them slicking their private parts on the couch in the afternoon sun i've never seen that most church leaders i know aren't that flexible well let's read on so for the last x years we had and continued to have these models of men to be molded after them god bless you when wellman said he's depressed about the church services he attended or the mediocre sermons and so on well i thought about this particular thing along with other ones which is not rightly exclusive in the evangelical realm but that is not highlighted enough or at all have you ever succeeded in making neutered cats yourself or lions you said i love the imagery of your question why is it that the church can turn wine to water yeah wellman's my conversation with wellman boy what a conversation that was really good we're going to do it again wellman wellman enjoyed it trip enjoyed it i thought it went well but he's now he was very transparent and honest about his disappointment with church and so much of what we deal with as trip was right so much of what we deal with here is disappointment with church and you know the the the former catholic now orthodox who was sexually abused by a priest you know he finally i mean he's got some absolute screeds about the roman catholic church he's just he's just angry and furious with what's happened in the church and you know there's plenty of trad catholics out there and and i have a heart i have a heart for people who have been let down by the church and you know in my in my conversation with clay and john vendonk you know i thought john vendonk's reflections on the reasons why he went on to the ministry i thought that was i thought that was so honest and i respect him for for being transparent like that and i think that's the reason why he i thought that was i thought that was so honest and i respect him for for being transparent like that there is a liability in professional christian ministry as there is i think in be careful with that that we don't sufficiently familiarity breeds a lack of holy fear i'll say it that way you find this with electricians electricians that are get very comfortable with always dealing with electricity sometimes get killed from it why because at some point they lost a healthy respect for the terms by which they served churches get cynical churches get corrupt jesus parables that deal with this deal with this deal with servants when the master is gone for a long time and we humans if something is away from us for a long time it gets unreal to us and so jesus admonishes his followers you know when the master is gone you'd still better be faithful because it's his house and he's coming back the doctrine of the second coming of christ is almost always one of the first things to go so in corrupt modernity i don't believe jesus is coming back okay sounds like just you know when when kurt um gemongol says well something sort of in the middle well yeah well maybe but how is that going to impact your faithful service very quickly the eschatological point begins to move you know it's been interesting that the belief in the surprise second coming has fueled in the church right from its start kind of an anxious anticipation of let's say you look at dr seuss's cat in the hat and you wonder what all were you thinking about when mother gets home in the cat in the hat because jesus very much with his parable sets his church up to say uh we'd better be ready when jesus comes back because we want to be those servants who have been faithful in doing his will let's say that all sort of slips away because the bible and the story gets very mythological it becomes very perennial psychologically certain things start to slip and whereas i know it's a it's a subject of mockery oh you christians are always thinking jesus is coming back yeah and those who keep watch over the flood control measures in sacramento do so because one of these years the heavens are going to open over the sierra and sacramento's are going to open and the sierra is going to fill up like a bowl you know the germans i was reading articles this morning about germany and the state of the german military you know germany who in this 20th century built the most impressive military machines now you know when when ukraine asked for help they 3000 helmets and ukraine was like are you serious and the germans are like you know can't when they when they had to mobilize troops and material to send to what may be the front in poland and romania germany's scrambling around for working parts and it's like yeah and then suddenly a whole bunch of things appear on twitter with trump basically excoriating the germans saying you haven't done your part well that's because you know to keep pouring money into the army because the russians are coming all that stuff it's so behind us yes hey ain't thinking that now oh they're gonna stop with ukraine yeah you hope oh the u.s will be there well you know trump wasn't elected by that much wasn't defeated by that much but how much longer will americans be willing to send their children to europe to die defending your country trump voiced that he wasn't voicing nothing so there's a lot that goes into these neutered cats i think that's part of it we're very responsive to threat whether it's threats of damnation or threats of shame if our lord returns and he finds that we just haven't been taken the whole thing seriously i didn't think you were coming back i didn't think i'd ever have to meet you accountability is a very real thing in terms of human psychology no the church in the west is is weak in ways that churches in the developing world are not churches in the developing world have some of their own problems don't get me wrong but we don't take it very seriously we don't take it very seriously and that's a problem and that's what you're pointing to this is what tom holland was pointing to at the beginning of the pandemic he said we don't need the national institute we don't need churches just mimicking the talking points of the national institute of health we have them if you're not going to do anything why are you taking up space and why should i pay attention to you and so when james wellman says that they kind of they just kind of echo the progressive talking points but none of the progressives imagine that the church you know it they're much more eager to elect their politicians than worried about who's going to be in their little who's going to be in their little meeting when my when my daughters were young they used to have the panda club and they they do these little fundraisers because they were worried about you know the uh the extinction of the pandas and so they raised i don't know when when they finally quit doing it they might have 75 80 dollars that they had raised all their little things they still have the panda club money they have to figure out who to send it to but um a lot of people look at the church like the panda club it was it was just adorable to watch my daughters sell lemonade and worry about the pandas and you know that they're little girls they're you know they they're expressing care for the pandas and for the world and good on them and you know when they'd have a little fundraiser i'd make my little contribution because you know you should care about the world the pandas and the and the other animals that's what little girls should do but when the church becomes sort of panda club for grownups people are like yeah it's not serious so mandy oh gosh no more questions now no question and answer next week because again i gotta travel for my work so um no more questions february 25 no q and a march 4 all right sorry about that that's okay chad mandy hi paul a few years ago my daughter was born several heart oh my goodness several heart defects and has survived three heart surgeries the first at five days old shortly after she was born i learned that over 80 percent of babies like her are aborted and in a survey the top three reasons given were the suffering of the child the suffering of the parents and the suffering of the other siblings i saw glenn scrivener video shortly after that argued that epicureanism was the west's current philosophy a perennial philosophy in some ways as it taught to avoid suffering as the highest ideal but avoiding suffering one necessarily avoids love peter craft lays a lot of this out i came up again when i saw colman hughes on rogan i just finished the i just finished the the noe's rogan episode and it was like colman hughes well that would be interesting to listen to too yeah he said in philosophy 101 classes students are presented with the question should you eat a baby and the point of the exercise is for them to strip down to their core values and then build a framework up from there he offhandedly said that of course the core principle they would reach is that eating a baby is wrong because human suffering is wrong oh so if you anesthetize the little soul then it's okay yeah of course christians are called to help remove suffering in the world but is but is this a matter of twisting christian morality it feels like avoiding suffering is one of the roots root evils of modern culture wondering your thoughts i wouldn't go as far as to say your last sentence because you know every tear is wiped away in the eschaton there'll be no suffering no crying and so it's not hard to look at that and let's say project a worldview but you're exactly right in that christianity is not the same as suffering avoidance and again when i listen to sam harris or many others many others it's all about avoiding suffering and then i will say to them well if you're going to maximize mental emotional self-actualization or happiness and minimize suffering why not the big hit of cocaine and a bullet chaser and then people don't like when i say that but hey isn't that you you mean and back to brave new world and soma why is it let's say let's say your son or daughter let's say usually a son let's say your son sits in front of computer games all the time gaining weight eating poorly not maturing not able to have human relationships but let's imagine that computer games are maximally happy and give feelings of meaning the parents would still look at that son and say this is not how he's supposed to be oh but don't you understand that avoiding suffering and enhancing feelings of meaning and wonder are the summa bonum the ultimate good well that's where the question lies and yeah when you make avoiding suffering and we see symptoms of it all over the place in schools no child is going to reach their potential if they don't suffer and part of the reason that my wife is such a good teacher is she is she does not kneel to the cult of avoiding suffering she doesn't with the children in her classroom but she she she you need to suffer a certain amount not too much but enough in order to produce the potentiality that a school teacher is there to produce and so you know i remember homeschooling my kids and some you know in process of homeschooling it's always this zone of proximal development okay so now you've mastered long you've mastered addition and subtraction now we're going to work on multiplication and and if you if you watch young children learn you realize that learning is work it's hard mastering thing learning how to read is hard learning to play an instrument is meaningful but it's hard and it takes practice and life is full of that that's the way this world is you know if you're going to banish suffering you'd better prohibit the olympics because the olympics is just years of suffering for one moment of glory if you're trying to add up all the suffering it's a bad equation because same with the nfl same with almost anything we do so no you're right you're right it's a but yet when you listen to when you listen to celebrity atheists this is what they always point to oh it's suffering this is what they always point to oh it's suffering but you'll also notice that see then i would come back and say well but you pointing out that doesn't making the videos against christian cause their suffering why is it permissible that christians suffer because you're kicking out their axioms and christians should suffer loss of their worldview for the sake of other privileged classes you're not really banishing suffering you're continuing to participate in the economy but you just say it's legitimate for people with the wrong worldview to suffer so that people who have been alienated or oppressed in some way in the past won't suffer now you're just moving around the suffering just like they are and beneath it is in fact a moral system that says some of these things are right and some of these things are wrong and people who are wrong deserve to suffer their suffer is karmic okay so give up on this quest of suffering but you can't you can't just telling someone their worldview doesn't help them see it it's just that people don't work that way so let's see how we do it on time pretty good they're doing pretty good i haven't rambled too badly paul can i can i defend epicureanism and possibly buddhism quickly go right ahead yeah epicureanism isn't talking about suffering it's talking about pain and it's saying you should prefer pleasure but any pain is bearable and that's a different message and i think all of the western buddhists and there's a big difference between western and eastern buddhism are mistranslating pain and suffering and that suffering is inevitable and you know i'm i'm not i'm not claiming to be an expert but i would say from the from the catholics i've met certainly that the job is not to avoid suffering because you can't the job for a christian at least in in the catholicism that i understand is to help people to bear suffering which is a totally different thing so to bear suffering yourself willingly and to help others to do the same and because it's not a choice that is available to you and when you to your point when you try to make it happen when you try to get rid of it that doesn't work right you just move it around it's a good point all right fair enough i think i think you're right that a lot of what we see promoted out there is just sort of it's just sort of sloppy it doesn't doesn't relate well it isn't thought through very well but again maybe i'll do some i've got 10 times more videos in my head than i ever get to produce it just the way time works so but again i'm really enjoying i'm hoffer's true believer he's got a lot of real wisdom in that little book all right simon nelson hi paul i recently had a discussion with a friend on the end times in revelation i never really ventured much into this would you equate the current happenings in the world with the description in reservation reserve revelation well the book is revelation the book of revelation the apocalypse not revelations a little pet peeve of mine and if yes how would you go about it do you think that it would be a fruitful undertaking to continue to discuss with my friend for example how would you consider this happening in ukraine and try to understand it in terms of the book of revelation i'm trying to see if it is fruitful to actually discuss this with this friend and in what terms so at i have a men's group a little online men's group with just some people at living stones and then a couple of people from my internet world i let in and we were in what is sometimes called in the gospel of matthew the little apocalypse in matthew 24 and it's you don't have to go all the way to the book of revelation in fact the book of revelation is sort of a lot harder to sort of to work through it's a the book of revelation is an astoundingly complex book because the book basically is built on lots of other books but the little apocalypse in the gospel of matthew is much easier and throughout so so there are various takes on let's say the little apocalypse in matthew 24 one is the preterist view what does that mean you know when you read matthew 24 you can sort of see descriptions of jerusalem under you know during the time of the destruction of the temple in 70 ad and you can read about those events in josephus and so the preterist view and this is often applied to the book of revelation because when you read the book of revelation have babalon rome you know it's it's obvious that the story is told about rome on one level that's the preterist view and the preterist level that you can find much written in the book of revelation pertaining to the the early church and rome you get same issues with the book of daniel the preterist views of the book of daniel sort of line up some of these kingdoms and images with historical groups and this goes into the question of whether the the book was written what century the book was written yada yada yada and so you have all those discussions so one is the preterist perspective that says these books are describing events that we can sort of correlate to from the past and that's very valid because you can but that doesn't really answer your question another is the perennialist view which says that these books illuminate patterns that come around and around and around and around and around and one of the when i was going through this with my men's group i was thinking about the fact that in some ways jonathan peugeot is an arch perennialist in that these patterns are enduring and history lays itself out that way and so you can very much read matthew 24 the book of revelation or the book of daniel with a perennialist perspective that these are the patterns of what happens and that's helpful to read now what you're asking about is what people have been doing all along which is in some ways the combination of a preterist a perennialist and let's say an anticipatory reading of the text because why would this be taught if it didn't have at least a degree of future telling in the story the the intent of the story in revelation and in the gospel of matthew clearly seems to prepare the church for what is coming in the future part of the weakness of the preterist perspective is that if it happened then we no longer need it and that's what sort of the perennialist has in favor of themselves so is there an aspect is can christians today read this with benefit in terms of interpreting the times now again the preterist will say this is always of benefit in terms of interpreting the times and what faithfulness should look like and as you know we noted last in our men's group when you get to the end of chapter 24 jesus very much ends it with applications that are perennial in nature now for the life of the christian church christians have been struggling to figure out how events on the ground relate to the perennial patterns that are in the text because again back to the second coming of which i am a believer there seems to be some benefit for future telling and jesus christians future telling and jesus continual admonitions to read the signs of the times if you go back and read christians writing and talking you will find applications of this again and again and again perennially for example when i was growing up in the 1970s i remember visiting my cousin also a nice christian reformed lad whose parents i think my aunt and uncle were a little less um filtery of dispensational and evangelical literature because i think if i had come home with the book 1980 countdown to armageddon my father probably would have lovingly sat me down and had a discussion about the book that um how lindsey you might not want to take this book the way that a lot of people are so how lindsey in the 80s we had all in the 70s during the cold war they had these elaborate interpretations of daniel and revelation how the russians played into this and the symbolism this is part of the reason people christians who have been around a long time have a little bit of sobriety about symbolism and maybe don't get quite as excited about jonathan peugeot as some of you who are younger and again that doesn't take anything away from my friend it's just that we've seen the symbolic game played badly and you can rummage around and find those books 1980 countdown to armageddon and then during the first the first gulf war you know people well saddam is clearly babalon and you just on and on and on and on and on and so now here we are and the russians have invaded ukraine i'll tell you when you read in the book of matthew that the stars fall from the sky and during the cold war we have all these visions of icbms and the sun refusing to sign nuclear winter on and on and on and on i lived through all of those discussions in the 70s and during the cold war as a kid and so then as a kid when i'm young i mean jordan peterson and i are only a year apart and he's a year older by the way even though he looks so much younger just like i mentioned you know i had a dream after i watched the news that russia had commenced the attack and well those of us who grew up during and during the cold war that was part of our formation you know i live just outside of new york city if i was a kid i would have been a if you know the war had happened yeah new york would definitely be nuked and i was close enough that paterson would go with it i knew that and you know there are all these fallout shelters in old buildings they stopped that in the 60s but even in the junior high and the basement there was this room next to the gym and had this fallout shelter sign on it so as a kid you look at that and it's like what's that about and then you learn about things and it's like oh and then you look into the room and it's like gosh if things get bad i don't want to go in there and then at one point in that fallout shelter you know food had been stored like these biscuits and you know these boxes had probably been in there for years and years and years and at some point i think the janitorial staff at the christian school figured out that the roaches were multiplying feeding these biscuits and so one day we came down for gym in junior high and the entire gym floor was covered with dead roaches because the exterminator had gone in there and they threw away the biscuits and killed the roaches and it was absolutely apocalyptic on the gym floor all these big roaches belly up might this war get out of hand yeah might it lead to a confrontation between nato and russia yeah could it lead to a nuclear exchange yeah people like oh that would never happen people would never use the bomb um we did we won't know it's over until it's over so all of those admonitions of our lord still hold true to still hold true whether christ's evaluation of how i spent the life he gave me comes at the end of my physical life or at the second coming i don't know you know but judgment day will come and i will be judged and i have to think about that so i have a fair amount of skepticism that you can just sort of lay out the book and say what's going to happen in detail you know jonathan peugeot says we're in for a rough ride that doesn't seem hard to imagine we're always in for a rough ride some rides are rougher than others that's i when we sort of switch frames on the bible see this is where it gets tricky because christians are like well if the bible is my guide for seeing into the future then i can use it to have an easier time of it okay that's not unfair but the bible is there to encourage us to faithfulness not to escapism this is a common thing that pastors have to talk about so is there a model pattern example in the bible for proper human governance moses law king tiffit how dare you ask me that with jacob in the room jonathan peugeot is a monarchist it's good he lives in canada he's got a queen so um paul the reason that i asked this question i probably should have put another follow-up is like so in your gut or maybe when you're talking to your kids or somebody like that and they're government is so messed up like how do you explain like proper function of human like cooperation like how do you say well yeah you're right it's totally jacked up if people did it like such and such maybe we wouldn't have such a tough go of it like your previous statement says well there's no way to avoid the tough go of it but what can you somebody who's looking for some guidance well it's probably not up to you to choose the government that you're under and and if you believe it's up to you to choose the government that you're under you're obviously a um you believe in democracy so right well but we all i shouldn't say we all i have a family and so i govern within my family right so there's there's a little bit of a model there yep but not that much of one even even because and this is at heart some of the the fighting over male headship that's gone on in my denomination over the last 50 years i mean do you i i think i think that the the guiding principle is love and given who you are who your wife is who your children are you're probably going to and given all that you absorb from your culture you're probably going to work on a model that optimizes love for your wife and love for your children and love for all of you between each other that's that's the government that's the proper governing principle is love and figuring out the details of that in any particular context yeah it's work but that's yeah that's the way i'm just imagining somebody saying what does that look like at scale like is the church a model of that oh no not a church i've been in well it it should be churches should model that at scale to a degree and you know i i can i can imagine i can imagine monarchies that do it well and i can imagine democracies that do it well democracies are sort of middling things you know they just sort of allow ongoing every four to eight years we have a revolution of sorts and the idea is that if we keep having small revolutions we're not going to have these big ones that seem so calamitous so yeah i and and you know part of it is the scale as well i mean the scale of israel during david's reign pretty small you know we you grow up with these school book images of jericho with these towering walls and you you know maybe you do a little reading and you look at archaeology and say yeah jericho might have had a couple hundred people in it and you have this vision of israel leaving egypt with you know a million people and well but what exactly are they doing with those texts was israel that big or were they smaller or were they were that was it written that way so that the um israel when they were fully inhabiting the land um generations later imagine you know saw that they too were leaving egypt at the time i mean this is scale is important and part of what we're dealing now in with nation states of over a billion people what's the best way to run those things you know india's trying democracy china's you know got their single-party system we in the west have these little democratic states and a big part of what seems to be behind putin versus ukraine is that the the the lures the you know the the enticements of the west continue to get closer and closer to putin's russia and um he likes to stay in power so yeah it's a good question all right jonathan w to clarify the previous question about virtue ethics i think it's the view on the individual community is helpful for the agent arena conversation socrates and plato's republic says that we should balance our soul to become a good person from this um first that good person from this he said that in the same way a good community should be balanced yeah that's an it's an interesting plato's republic is interesting because of this this main idea that well if we want to know what justice is justice in a person let's explode the person to be a community a city and then we're going to have our gold our silver you know our bronze yada yada yada aristotle who also talks about this says that the state is natural as it comes from our innate need for community and and again there when aristotle says state is it this the polis is it well now you've got philip of massedonia have is that sort of an empire and then of course with alexander that empire will grow but it won't be terribly stable and it'll collapse after his death yada yada so even you know for for example in the bible modern biblical translations will have the word nation in it all over the place you know the nations oh boy when you say nation to see this is the kind of stuff that pastors wrestle with because when you say nation to an audience of americans they think america ukraine russia germany england that's a nation when you hear king when you say kingdom people think oh um um kingdom that's like in fairy tales princess bride that's a kingdom empire oh well that's like star wars these mental pictures are in my audience's mind and so when i read the bible i have to keep all of this in mind both what the both what the ancient author why they used that word as best as i can figure out and how my people here use the word and that's that's the difficult job of preaching so i don't want to lose your question here though jonathan if you have um aristotle who also talks about this says that the state is natural as to as it comes from our innate need for community if you have more if you have no more thoughts that is fine but just wanted to say that i thought it was relevant yeah so individual community how do individual and communal ethics work well this is this is difficult too and it actually gets into the the modern and pattern of the family because again we have the same problem with the word family when we say family in our culture we think me my wife my kids maybe my parents if they're alive maybe if my children ever produce grandchildren etc etc family in an ancient realm could have cousins and i mean it's it's almost the village the village is the family or the village is three families so yeah yeah and back to ethics yeah it isn't it is interesting how socrates makes that move and that move itself says a lot about his conceptualization of justice i gotta read more dc shindler you know karen and verveke have been lauding dc shindler up and down i really have to i really have to i need to see the thing is i can do audiobooks when i'm doing errands and dishes i can get audiobooks and then but to actually read i need to i need time to sit down and i'm not a particularly fast reader and and i find that i often have to anyway so why i shouldn't complain to you chad the alcoholic last question for this week when jesus returns will he use twitter to um and podcast to cancel less wicked sinners oh chad there's a lot of question about what jesus does when he comes again you know pre-millennial post-millennial yada yada yada my new testament prof said yada yada yada my new testament prof said when jesus returns just go with what he says that was good advice all right any final words of wisdom anybody in the voice chat here in the bridges of meaning discord has for today okay y'all are quiet like church mice thank you thank you you're welcome anselman thanks for being the wrench in the youtube chat um i appreciate it rick isn't here rick usually sort of tries to preside about all of that um thank you those of you on youtube land for watching this and letting me know
