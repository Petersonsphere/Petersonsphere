 Well JP, this is a treat. You and I last spoke a number of months ago and you told your story and you told about your, I was just looking over my notes, we talked about your zombie nightmares and your panpsychism and you laid out in our video conversation some challenges to John Vervecky's physicalism and you know I was just so impressed at how quickly he picked up on it and you've had a couple of conversations with him which are on your channel and I'll put links to that in the notes here. And how did you feel those conversations went? It was very instructive I thought. Turned out that Vervecky's sort of physicalism is much more viable than I had expected. His physicalism is much closer to panpsychism than I had expected. Well you know he doesn't want to say that there is an identity of consciousness between my consciousness, the consciousness of myself and so on all the way down. He does say that there is something continuous there so he can make some way towards my position but he's really not a materialist as I sort of suspected. So yeah I got lots of benefits from those conversations. Maybe the clearest one was that because it made his solution much more viable than I had expected as a whole. I mean because I knew about his project from his Awakening from the Meaning Crisis series and also from his Buddhism and cognitive science lectures. But from those because there was not much metaphysics in those I thought it was mainly putting forward a psychological solution and for someone who cares about metaphysics I was very much fearful that you would fall in sort of the classic trap of materialist or of mere psychology. Sure you can say lots of psychological stuff but it doesn't mean that it tracks with metaphysics, with reality. So even though John can talk about virtue, about wisdom, about real relations with people, about how we're not stuck in our heads and so on, there was still the risk that this was just shallow psychology that didn't reach metaphysical depths. But it turned out by talking to him that it actually did. So yeah the bottom line was that maybe one way of putting it is that I think for Christians it sort of puts a floor on how low our rebellion can go. Because instead of let's say you're a Christian and I especially have a lot of respect for Christians of let's say 50 or 100 years ago when the two big metaphysics were a sort of scientism or very odd physicalism that's pretty much materialist versus a very supernaturalist kind of Christianity. And if you have any doubt about the supernatural kind of Christianity you would fall right all the way down to materialism and that's sort of a big temptation. You can see it even in some some saints at least I know in the Catholic world. I think Paul Benedict wrote a book, I'm not sure what the translation would be in English. His biggest book maybe Christian Faith Yesterday and Today something like this and he talks about that even people who have been believers for a long time can fall into a bottomless pit of despair with nothing to claw onto if they fall away from the supernatural version of Christianity into just materialism and total nihilism all the way down. But what I think very key does well is he puts a very hard floor there. You can't go lower than his position I think because you can back it up with cognitive science basically. He puts a provision of naturalism that is still livable where you still have virtue, you have wisdom and so on. So even let's say if you're a Christian and you want to rebel against your creator you're angry because of the problem of evil or something like that. Even then you don't fall into complete despair where nothing matters and you can just do whatever you want. You still have to obey to what the very key says and you still have to cultivate virtue and wisdom and so on. So I think it made me more willing especially with the conversations we had to say that well I can take at least at least where Ricky's position is true and what are the bridges I need to cross to get to Christianity. And it turned out that those bridges are fairly easy to cross. Psychism helps but there are also other ways to get there and we outlined some of them in our discussion. But the cool thing is that I'm much clearer now on what are the bridges I need to take between naturalism and Christianity and they're much shorter than I had expected because what I used to do is to go from let's say materialism and show that it's wrong and panpsychism is right and then getting from panpsychism to classical theism. But now I can take Vervicki's version of naturalism and we'll make just a few bridges using a bit of a bit of domestic metaphysics, a bit of panpsychism and I can get to my classical theist position basically. So yeah I've been rambling sorry but yeah. No it's okay. I've got so many questions for you. We'll see if you have any questions for me. But just even the way you laid that out right now was interesting to me in terms of, well John has John has mostly, we haven't gotten to a lot of John's metaphysics and actually so on, it's one of the things that my local meetup started. They started a Discord server and the Discord server has sort of become a focus of conversation for many of the conversations in this realm and some of the philosophy nerds in the Discord server have been pretty hotly debating whether Vervicki is fudging on some of these issues and they even called him a dreaded compatibilist which is something I'm used to being called as a Calvinist. But I'm also curious in your panpsychism and so some of what I was hoping and we don't have to do this, I mean a conversation is always a negotiated amount of time but I'd like to see if we can't make some of the conversations that you've had with John a little bit more user-friendly because I've watched them and they're, I mean very quickly you two, I mean you're both, you've both got a lot of training in philosophy and so you guys very quickly go into linguistic shorthand with respect to philosophy which leaves a fair number of the listeners out and as a pastor part of what I do is I'm always trying to translate some of what I'm hearing over here in the technical language and help a much broader group of people figure out where the rubber meets the road and even just the way you laid out your perspective on this sort of fascinated me in terms of just, just, just, then I'll probably have to go through and listen to the recording again because you laid it out in some interesting ways. So maybe we can start by, if that's, does this sound like a good use of our time today? Yeah sure, let's, oh we should also talk about the consciousness of your cell phone holder because it's worth clarifying. This is where I want to go first because I first want to get into what you mean by panpsychism because that's become sort of a buzzword out there. So Struon, Struon who lives in South Africa, I never say his name right but he's, he's yet to agree to come on my channel and he and I have been conversing for months and so he has his own version of panpsychism. I, you know, I first heard of the term when I heard Rupert Sheldrake so he's out there with his panpsychism and then you drop in with this panpsychism so what on earth do you mean by this term? Okay, most panpsych, doesn't mean that consciousness is everywhere, it means typically in most versions of panpsychism defended by modern panpsychists, it's that the fundamental constituents of reality are conscious. So I mean the, maybe one way to see it is to start from, from our brains, you know, I, JP, am conscious. Now this consciousness cannot just pop out of nowhere in the metaphysical chain, it means that there has to be something like consciousness in my neurons for, you know, my brain as a whole, let's say to combine into my consciousness of JP. So it means that my neurons have to be conscious but you know if my neurons are conscious then I can do the same argument all the way down because well if my neurons are conscious it means that well the proteins in my neurons for instance must be conscious somehow and you go all the way down to the molecules, to the atoms, to the fundamental particles and you know one important thing is that when I'm going that way down it seems that all the entities I'm talking about, you know, it's not completely unreasonable to attribute some sort of consciousness to them even though it gets simpler and simpler as you go down because if you look at those organisms they indeed seem to act, you know, in novel ways they do seem to have agency. I don't know if you read in your conversation with John Vermicke, he mentioned David Ray Griffin's book on God Exists but God G-A-W-D Doesn't and you know one cool thing he did in that book is he was talking I think about multi, about unicellular organisms and you know talking about how they go toward certain molecules and avoid certain others' molecules and they can recognize like hundreds or thousands of different molecules and they do seem to have some sort of agency even though it's much simpler than our own. So it does seem that you know I have consciousness and you know I do have some agency in the world but smaller creatures on the ontological chain, let's say my cells, they do also have some sort of agency they can act in novel ways but it's simpler than my consciousness. The psychologist won't say that, you know, the consciousness of my cells is as complex as my own and if you keep going down let's say if you look at even atoms they do seem to act sometimes in novel ways if you look at let's say what we get from the statistical indeterminacies we get from physics they do seem to act and there were some physicists who said this that you know atoms let's say or electrons and so on do seem to act in you know in to make decisions although very small decisions and compared to my very small very small decisions so and and obviously another important I mean there are all kinds of you know phenomenal logical things we could point out as we go down that ontological chain but one thing too is that the you know the temporal span of those consciousness gets smaller and smaller you know my consciousness of JP when I make a decision it you know it comprises thousands of decisions for in the consciousness of my cell when I take one decision myself takes like a thousand and it gets even broader if I go all the way down the ontological chain and now okay so that's what I just started from my brain I go to the fact that well I'm a pen-psychist I think that fundamental particles have some sort of consciousness and what when and my consciousness is a in an association or a combination of all of those smaller consciousnesses so my consciousness doesn't just pop out of nowhere you know it's a combination of smaller consciousnesses right um but when now I want to get to your cell phone holder because just because you know I am conscious as my fundamental particle consciousness and ran away now you're because uh yeah I don't think your country your cell phone holder is conscious um because it doesn't seem to have that sort of agency because I can even take me I'm not always conscious and I'm not always as conscious so let's say I'm in a dreamless sleep I'm not conscious in in that moment so it means that at that moment when I'm in a dreamless sleep I'm not conscious my you know the all the fundamental consciousnesses of my fundamental particles do not combine into a more complex consciousness into my consciousness subject um and similarly I'm pretty sure that as far as your cell phone holder goes you know it's fundamental particle uh its fundamental particles are conscious and they're very simple consciousnesses but they do not combine into anything at the level of your cell phone holder because it doesn't seem to act in any novel way does it make sense yeah yeah well let's let's let's work a little bit I'm I guess it's my goal to make the cell phone cell phone holder so famous someday I'll be able to get like you know mad money for it on ebay um well let's let's tease out let's work on a little bit of definition here because I haven't done I haven't done a words that fudge video but I got a lot of fudgy words lately and and one of the fudgier words is consciousness because when I say it's a fudgy word when one person says consciousness lots of people hear lots of different things and so obviously one of the one of the one of the primary definitions of consciousness that we're we're bandying about is is the phenomenological experience of this sort of field into which um into which things come and move and interplay Jordan Peterson often uses consciousness in that realm now when I'm listening to you talk right now I hear much more consciousness as agency as as a as a willful wanting choosing and and you know one of the one of the things that I think one of the things that I I see happening and why I understand panpsychism as an attractive pursuit in your case and in the case of others is that it it resolves the mind body division by making by basically everything is mind now and that you get I mean you get to the you've got this divide in the world actually I watched a really cool video this morning from a a philosopher a philosophy teacher I'd said u of t I thought oh no not someone else from university of Toronto but actually is from university of Texas Austin and he's been putting his lectures online for a number of years and he has this one nice video whole history of philosophy in one video I always love those and and so you know and he says you know basically the history of the philosophy is the question of mind and the outside world and so what panpsychism sort of does is say okay well we're going to include everything in this imagined dead world and you know the world that has been killed via Galileo in vervekis in vervekis history well we're just gonna we're just gonna say that's all mind over there and so therefore we don't have the problem of the division so in other words instead of having a world in which human beings are agents over here and the rest of the world is dead for us to colonize and to dig up ore and to turn this into a cell phone holder now we're going to we're going to assert that there's a degree of this there's a degree of this agency deep down built into everything here and I think the other the other piece of this that I have questions about is the how whether this how well this harmonizes with physics in terms of Karen Wong who has the meaning code channel and then you should get on her channel Karen Karen is a really smart woman and she's an artist and you know sometimes when I sit and listen to Karen she just has an idea and it's like bang you know whole new vistas open up because she's she's a really creative thinker and she's got a lot of good ideas so she watched this video about physics and basically in some ways it seems that some physicists are canning the whole idea of particles at all and they're saying basically everything is fields and and Karen made the point so you know what if there is actually a field of consciousness and and for me that seemed to be a better location for consciousness than necessarily saying atoms have it because what fields tend to do in physics is to I mean it seems at least on the basis of this one this one physicist talking about the standard theory which is that particles actually emerge from ripples in the fields and that the fields are more primary than the particles because I mean the particles they've they've they've kind of come down to much tinier elements which are electrons and quarks and they've got a few other names for them but but these seem to be manifestations of fields and so to me it's a little easier to somehow locate consciousness in a field rather than locate consciousness in particles okay I just dumped a whole bunch of stuff on you there yeah but there are two ways there are two things that I want to say first up in terms of defining consciousness I don't want to define it as agency necessarily what occurs rather what yeah the sort of consciousness I'm dealing with is what is called phenomenal consciousness so it's the what it's like to uh you know experience something to feel something and so on so meaning that let's say when I when I look at uh when I look at this this this wall and it's in it's blue there is something it's like to see this blue and it's this is an instance of phenomenal consciousness and we could distinguish this from other sorts of consciousnesses let's say um because even agency itself in the abstract they just talk in the abstract we could consider we can think of agents that exhibit agency but which would not necessarily be conscious let's say I can even even even me and that's something I want to say there are moments when I can act but I'm not very conscious when I act when I act on reflexes for instance you know when I'm not making choices when I and in that sense I don't really have agency when I'm just acting on reflexes and I'm not making choices I'm not as conscious in those instances and similarly I think and a lot of let's say I think that if you were to make a you know a robot in a certain way um which does not really make choices but is sort of acting on reflexes like I do and you would have to look at my brain and see you know what occurs exactly in these networks versus these networks so that there's novelty versus there isn't but when there is no novelty um when there is no and you know this is where agency sort of slips in because I'm initially initially I'm talking about phenomenal consciousness it feels like something to make a choice it feels like something to see blue and so on but this this sort of phenomenal consciousness seems related to me making choices me actually having agency so this is where agency slips in when I'm not really an agent when there's no real agency there doesn't seem also to be phenomenal consciousness so those are that's why I was talking about agency and consciousness and the second thing I want to say especially on how it fits well with physics it's actually it actually fits extremely well with physics it's not exactly in the way of fields you were talking about it actually doesn't matter even what the entities of physics you take are it's one of the biggest arguments for pencychism actually I don't know if you know but Bertrand Russell was a pencychist because and it's because of one of those reasons because it fits so well with physics the there's a basic issue in physics if you take the entities of physics you actually don't know them you actually don't know their nature and by it's actually a voluntary in the practice of physics that you don't try to investigate the nature of things you only try to investigate behavior so you try to figure out what equations let's say an electron or a proton and so on follow and you know you don't actually know what its essence is or even really what its properties fundamentally are even the fact that let's say an electron has a certain charge or mass even all that means to say that the electron has a certain charger mass is that when you fit that charger mass in these equations you will get this this output so and that's the point which philosophers of science have been making for a while including Russell that physics only tells you about the behavior of things it doesn't tell you what breeds fire into the equations it doesn't tell you what is the essence of those things so actually if you whether you take a particle or a field and so on in physics you actually but if you want to be a physicalist you have an issue here because you have to say well those entities I know that physics is talking about some entities but physics doesn't tell me what's actually in those entities it tells me how they behave but doesn't tell me what what those entities are so you have a void in the entity of physics and you have to fit you have to fill that void somehow to in order for your ontology to be complete and now there are sort of two moves you can make the move which I make and which lots of panpsychists will say that well I have a good candidate for this for this intrinsic nature I can just put consciousness in there because you know I can be described physically in terms of a complex set of physical particles and you know this is it is true that you can probably you know say a lot about my behavior this way you can probably predict lots of things which I do using that that that model of me but this is only talking intrinsically about me it's talking about my behavior it's not talking about my essence my nature and what are my real choices to talk about you know the intrinsically about what I am you need to talk about my consciousness about my my choices about my my my feelings and my emotions and so on so in the same way that from if you want to talk about me now you know you can do it extrinsically using the language of physics or you can do it intrinsically using my consciousness it's the same thing which panpsychists want to say at the level of the fundamental particles you know the physics only tells you how things behave it doesn't tell you what they are but we have a good candidate we can take consciousness just like we took consciousness for me we take consciousness for for the the intrinsic nature of the fundamental particles now this is the move I make and there's an there's an alternative which vervecki takes is to say that well you don't necessarily put consciousness all the way down to the fundamental particles but you put something continuous there so let's say in my case I can say well my brain you can describe my brain physically you know it behaves as a certain set of following essential equations but intrinsically it's my consciousness well you take my neuron then my neuron you can describe it physically using a certain set of equations I say well it's conscious vervecki says it is something which is continuous with consciousness but it's not necessarily consciousness and you go all the way down there so that when you reach the fundamental particles I say well what is the intrinsic nature of the fundamental particles is still something like it's still consciousness it's much simpler than mine but it's still consciousness whereas vervecki can says well it's continuous with consciousness but once we reach that level we don't really know what it will be so one way of saying it is that vervecki is more of a mystery there well there's something in the fundamental yeah yeah that's why they call them a compatibilist because compatibilism when you charge someone with compatibilism you basically charge them with fudge and and so but keep going this has been helpful but it's actually you know it's one way of saying this is that vervecki's option is safer because he doesn't want to commit himself to saying that it's consciousness I'm willing to live my life you know as though you know it's consciousness that is there because I think it's my best guess so I'm gonna live that way and if I encounter an issue then I'll revise my hypothesis if it turns out to be wrong but you know the other option which vervecki takes is just not to commit himself to anything there and you know still try to see what are the conclusions as far as let's see the mini crisis goes well it's you know it's interesting to me because I listen to a lot of so-called debates about you know theism you know is there a god and these are all over the the internet and youtube of course and I'm going to be talking to to Adam next week and and we're gonna he's styling it as a debate but Adam never does debates Adam's just so sweet and we try to have a good conversation which is why I agreed to do it with Adam but you know it seems to me that in some ways the fundamental divide between the theists and and the non-theists right now is the question of whether the universe at heart is alive and and your panpsychism would be over on the alive side or if the universe is is sort of dead and we bring life to it by by operations that we somehow perform on the dead universe and and and the the tricky part of that side of the conversation is that the most alive kind of stops with us and and we don't want it going any further because suddenly the universe becomes alive and I also reflect I often reflect on the fact that what I think when we when you when we ask questions of motivation would I like the universe to be dead and me to be the most alive thing in the universe or would I like the universe to be alive but me being further down the pecking order and in fact dependent upon stronger more living things with intention and will and desire to which I am subjected to we really don't like that type of world and so we really prefer a world in which well I might not necessarily be at the top of the pecking order you know Donald Trump is up there and and you know he's getting to have his way for now but as long as there's as long as I can sort of identify with a group or or something I have I can keep I can keep aspirations alive that some that some team of which I participate will somehow triumph within this dead world even though as CS Lewis mentions again and again physics sort of says and dead's gonna win dead's gonna win in the end and and when I look at the conversations I really see those as primarily the two sides and this is why you know in terms of classical theism you sort of become at home with well the big guy on top is finally good and CS Lewis deals with that in the problem of pain that's a very that's a very difficult that's a very difficult conclusion to come to by simply looking at nature which is what I hear which is what I hear the skeptics say all the time look at the universe look at evolution you're saying that a god a good god made this stuff can't believe it I would rather believe the universe is fundamentally dead we've somehow you know against all odds achieved a degree of life and we have our day in the sun and we're gonna make the most of it but we know finally we're gonna lose and it's to me that's what I see the grand divide as being yeah I agree I I want to try to make this I want to try to lay the metaphysical foundation below that though because I do think that there comes a point where reason and metaphysics just can't go further and you're sort of stuck in the metaphysics you get you know possible metaphysics in which you don't really and where you don't from which you can't really choose which is the best but and then you reach a point where sort of your moral intuitions will determine which thing you opt for but I think you can still get very far using just metaphysics because like I said you know just the fact that let's say you want to be the sort of naturalist which you're you're critiquing where you know there is sort of no consciousness no agency below us no conscious no no agency above us then you have a big problem explaining why we do have consciousness and agency it just pops out of nowhere and this is a big problem in cognitive science in philosophy of mind right now and so I really do think the only possible options are to go you know you can go full blunt and psychist like I do and then it's you know you can attribute consciousness and agency lower down the ontological chain and also higher up the ontological chain all the way up to the the god of classical theism or the other move which verveke makes and I think I think it's a viable move it's a viable metaphysics is to say well it doesn't mean that you know there is consciousness all the way down or all the way up but there is something continuous still all the way down and maybe all the way up so you know maybe my cells don't quite have consciousness and agency but they have something that is you know not that far removed from it there is something continuous there and also above us and if you take a group of humans let's say in a church in engaging in some sort of liturgical practice then verveke doesn't want this to commit himself to saying that well that group has consciousness and agency but he's going to say that well maybe it does and also it definitely has some sort of you know collective intelligence where you know that group can solve problems that individuals couldn't the group can you know yeah this group does introduce some some real novelty some things that are not reducible to the the participants they're really new things that occur by the fact that you have a group but he doesn't want to really commit himself to this or to go further up the ontological chain and I think those two moves are viable those two metaphysics are and this is a point where you reach two metaphysical positions which are viable and where I don't think there there really are knockdown arguments for against one of those if you just talk metaphysically and it becomes as you said a more of a a moral issue or an issue of moral intuitions and this is where I think it's very useful to bring Jordan Peterson in because it fits much all he does I mean he doesn't do any metaphysics at all he just tries to I think what he does is just he just he's just been addressing the problem of evil since you know he had the popular sphere but because it doesn't do any metaphysics it you know it annoys some people like like some artists for instance but I think that when when you reach a point as I said where you have the choice between you know panpsychism or vervekis physicalism those those two metaphysics are viable and then you have the choice well do you want to say that well you know there is agency above us and it's good agency it becomes in a lot of ways a immoral choice to make and Jordan makes this very appealing for a lot of people he he really makes you want to to to carry across to you know submit to to higher principles to higher authority and to not complain you know if let's say you're a if if let's say like me you're a panpsychist and a classical theist and you think that well the god is good and he wants good things for me and whatever bad things happen in my life you know I have the choice to blame god and and you know leave away my my metaphysical system no I could I could do that but I think Jordan makes the case that it's actually not good you know worse things will happen if you if you if you start cursing god and better things will will will keep happening if you you will just make things worse if you if you if you deny if you deny that that being is good that good is good so and and he also leverages some very great authors which makes you want to carry that like Dostoevsky or Solzhenitsyn who you know especially Solzhenitsyn he lived things that are you know a thousand times worse than anything I could ever experience and you just kept going and assuming that being is good so of course that's what I should do that's what I want to do and hopefully that's what I will do when bad things actually do occur to me and so my my my intuitions are to you know even though let's say evolution does let's say that as a panpsychist any classical theist I do think that there were higher agencies sort of guiding evolution acting in the same way that when when I act I sort of guide what my particles would do I do think that life itself that that god was guiding evolution as it occurred even though you know there I could judge god and say that well there have been there has been waste in there and I wouldn't have done this this way or that way and so on I prefer not to I think it's I think it's better we're all little jobes who have uh who have our own we'd like to critique god and how he made the universe well you know I really don't think you did it well that way oh okay once you're old enough to have kids and you have kids starting to you know uh mom and dad you shouldn't do things this way it's kind of like yeah wait to you I'll be the grandparents sitting around making judgments about your decisions see how you like that yeah so that's really how I see it and but on the end even if you take the reiki you know he can still you know I do think he can you can still cut the virtue and wisdom and so on in the system I think it can still live a meaningful life in his system even though you don't you're not you know committed to attributing higher level agencies above or lower the ontological chain you can still do a lot and and I think that's powerful as well it's sort of the opposite from what Jordan does you know uh reiki does lots of lots of metaphysics and he gives I think he gives Christian a really good metaphysical starting point because we can start from his system and say that well you know there is agent we do have agency we have consciousness and so on there is something continuous up and down the ontological chain and you can make the panpsychist move and no there are many moves to get to classical theism but one of the the one of those moves is to go towards panpsychism and that's one of the moves I try to make but still what what reiki offers I think is that even let's say if you you're down on your luck and bad things are occurring and you're facing the problem of evil or the problem of fame and so on and you in addition to having Jordan's you know moral and psychological uh backup to make you you know not doubt God and keep your system there's also the fact that even metaphysically you cannot just you can't completely go down to materialism or nihilism as you may wish to you can't just become a materialist because it's just false because at the very least very kiss position is true and you still have to be virtuous and wise in that system so you so I really do see that Jordan and very key are you know giving us a floor below which we our rebellion shouldn't go no we can't justify it morally or metaphysically to go below virtue and wisdom at the very least we have to be noble pagans that's one way I see it well I I like how you connected the two and I like how how you recognized that for for John Vervecki he has an extents he has in a sense expanded let's call it the living zone okay or let's go we can call it the consciousness zone we can call it the agent zone he's expanding the agent zone he sees little micro agencies beneath let's say our experience of agency and he's even I mean in some of his last videos he's talked about you know collective intelligences if you listen to the rebel wisdom guys I mean they're another they're another group of cousins in this broad conversation so if you listen to the rebel wisdom guys you know they're really exploring collective consciousness and some of the videos that they're putting out and some of the conversation partners that they've been you know linking up with John Vervecki have been exploring these things but and I do think that the the framework of the world is all alive or the world is mostly dead is sort of a helpful way to see it and and that John is sort of expanding the living zone a little bit and and part of that does yield a basement because if you are in fact if you are in fact over on team death here probably team naturalism maybe we'll call it I will call it but you know once you let's say commit suicide or check out your you're still even then in the words of the princess bride mostly dead because the agency the residue of your agency continues to have an impact in the in the living zone in that realm Peter's and and of course so but so Vervecki Vervecki very much asserts a ceiling to that and Vervecki asserts a a generous hospitable ceiling by saying you know I'll talk to Vanderkley and JP and and Peugeot and I'll you know I'll I'll talk to them because I don't think he's not an anti-theist he's he's not saying that we're monsters or delusional or mentally ill for believing in God for being on teen life over here um whereas Peterson is sort of like this you know I'm going to speak psychologically and so and and when he says that he locates himself in a sense and saying I'm going to speak psychologically so there's this floor here below with we we we we wander into at our peril and above with I am unwilling to postulate one way or another I'm going to be truly agnostic and say you know and so I'll go to Liberty University and I'll watch them you know I'll watch them do their 21st century praise and worship thing with their smoke machines and say wow that was moving and instead of you know a lot of other things he could say about it so and and it seems like the celebrity atheists come in and basically say we're we're on team death here and or but we're going to keep our we're going to keep our life zone really narrow and we're going to we're going to really complain hard if you get much above it because we're going to say that's too woo if you get much below it we're going to try and pull your science card so it's that seems to be sort of the way this is this is playing out yeah yeah yeah I agree now now what's what's you know part of what's been so fascinating is how you know Jordan sort of busted this space open and you know created all these new possibilities for for conversations and you know part of what you know so then you know if we're going to locate interesting thinkers you know right away when I started listening to Peterson there was an element in there that was new to me and mysterious to me and I think a lot of that element was Carl Jung because you know I actually have been thinking about doing a video that says God is the father of all fudge well Carl Jung is the father of a lot of fudge too and and Jung kind of comes in and you know one of the one of the great pieces of his of this somewhat autobiography that Jung has is his chapter with Freud because in some ways that chapter lays out the kind of the openness of Jordan Peterson versus the closedness of Freud now now your panpsychism is is interesting because you know it very much renders a it renders a scientific language that justifies sort of team life but and this is something that I think about often I think a lot of Christians in our particular social space look at team death and team life and anyone that's over on the side of team life they say oh they're on our team and well they kind of are but one should remember that team life has had most of human history and most of civilization I mean almost everyone has been on team life and team death is really a fairly recent is really a fairly recent phenomenon they're they're a new team on the block and you know basically if you look at a Jordan Peterson Darwin-esque view of of the history of thought new newness isn't necessarily a virtue and and so when I listen to your panpsychism and as I'm growing in my understanding of it and kind of seeing what you're doing with it it's it is sort of a scientific affordance and that helps me understand what you first started talking about in this conversation it is a scientific affordance of team life as it as you will and and saying okay but just a word of caution to Christians who might be overly anxious to celebrate this victory that there's a whole lot over here on team life that you know Christianity worked through you know all the way until it's arising in obviously the the first century so I don't know if any of that made any sense yeah yeah and to keep going on your last point especially in my second discussion with Verveki we talked about the other steps required besides just panpsychism to reach classical theism from his sort of naturalism and you know it's panpsychism alone doesn't do it you could be I mean there are lots of panpsychists today who are not really willing to attribute consciousness higher than at the level of humans that in in an analytic philosophy that's what you'll often see you know lots of philosophers will be will say that well to solve the mind body problem we have to attribute consciousness all the way down to the fundamental protocols but they're not really willing to go above on the other side if you look at lots of the the the great minds in panpsychism like Bergson or Whited they were willing to attribute consciousness all the way down and all the way up but even then they typically stopped for slept short of a classical theism they you can still be a pagan basically and be a panpsychist you can say that well there is a consciousness to the whole universe the in the same way that I'm a big being made of smaller beings the small beings of myself you could say that well god is just the the consciousness of the the whole universe so it's is just a big being so you can still be a pagan and be a panpsychist you have to use other arguments like I think you can say take a saint thomas's arguments or classic scholastic arguments to talk about well even if you're a panpsychist and you you still have to explain you know why things exist why contingent things exist you have to explain why there is movement in the world where there is change so you can take physically a fairly classic scholastic arguments to you know then talk about about a truly transcendent god that is not just a big being but that is you know the ground of all being you can you still need to make those steps and then but what I think that psychism really helps with it it still makes a chain and it makes it intelligible how you can get there because it's you know you can almost take if you take that ontological chain of going from lower being to our to higher beings you if you push this to infinity you pretty much get the god of classical theism I think because as I have a lot more agency I have a lot more freedom than my fundamental particles let's say and my consciousness is much wider when I make one choice it's like thousands of millions and so on of choices of my my fundamental particles but in the same way if you were to take that to infinity then you get a you get I think you can start talking about about god who in in one decision is one decision comprises all of the decisions of all the lower organisms let's say in in in one fell swoop you know god made history in you know in one one one act of consciousness basically you can you can say that so he is outside of time in that sense he is conscious that yeah he all of time is is in one moment for his consciousness so he is outside of time you can say that you can also say that well in the same way that I have I have more creativity I have more more power to create than my my fundamental particles god has the power to to create all things to in one yeah I don't have any tissue I could use for a visual representation but one one image which is good I think come with props come on I brought a cell phone stan show up with your tools baby one image which berkson used was if you take it let's say some tissue and you you pull it up and then you let it fall down it's it's a good image of what occurs when let's say I make a decision over the decisions of myself when I'm sort of pulling up the tissue and as it falls down it replicates all the way down to my fundamental particles so you know I make choices and they replicate or they were reputed down the same thing when let's say god makes a choice he he makes a choice which ripples down all the way down to the phenomenon particles and he actually created the world in one one of those and you know in the same way that when when I make a choice let's say I choose to raise my arm you know this this decision is actually for me it's one simple move but at the level of myself it's lots of moves and it it's actually fairly complex you know at this moment I need to send this signal at this other moment at this nursing it's it's a complex cascade of different signals which I do in one one moment but I'm present in all of those even though it for me it's just one simple moment I'm present in all of those small moments it's the same thing when when when god makes one decision for him it was one choice and he's still presented all of those smaller moments even though for him it's just it's just one and it can also explain how it can explain a bunch of things like the when when I make when I raise my arm like this I still give a lot of freedom to my fundamental particles you know I give lots of constraints on what they have to do but I know sometimes myself this cell will do this thing when I raise it this other time you will do some other thing and you might just do a freedom but they're constrained in that well no matter what they choose I will succeed in raising my arm you know there's a limit to the freedom freedom they have so there is freedom within my my decisions and it's the same thing when when god makes the choice he can give us choices but he will get his way you know so one way I mean yeah I'm getting carried away because I like this so much this is really helpful for me this is this is really really cool but when um let's say god in one decision in the same way that let's say I'm writing a novel I can have one flash where I know how the story will start I know what the turning point will be and I know what the ending will be and the characters have lots of freedom in between but I know what will be the turning point and I know what will be the end and it's the same sort of thing I think with with god's action in the world he he created the world he knew we would mess up and he knew he would need to save us it was just a matter of time we had freedom and we we what's the I'm not sure how you say it in English god made us free no god made us mortal but not meant to die that you know in in theory we if we had just kept the the word we would not have we would not have done it when he wouldn't have needed to save us but it was just really a matter of time before we messed up like any child so so Adam lived a long time you know he had lots of time to screw up they had to look at that tree for for hundreds of years it's like you know what about that tree what about that tree I don't know he said not to know and you know certain comes along and says hey he's holding out on you yeah so yeah I think this it explains how we can have freedom how we are a little freedom made by god's large freedom and it was yeah so we we we have choices we can make choices we have genuine consciousness and agency but god is still there to to save us to act on us and yeah no I I think I said too many things no that was really helpful that was really good and it also maps on to you know obviously my training and my experience and the experience of my of my Christian subculture has a long history of conversations about god's agency god's god's agency impacting the world and the freedom that we have and now we're getting back into dreaded compatibilism and I part of the reason I don't I mean people like when I come you know when I say well I'm a Calvinist and they throw a Molanism at me and it's like oh okay and all that kind of tinkering with all that kind of tinkering with foreknowledge and this and that I find that a little bit too pedantically modernistic and and because I think I because you know the Bible the Bible when it talks about god's I mean the question of god's agency when it comes to scripture god's agency is is is universally assumed our agency is universally assumed but the the nexus between them or an explanation how these two agencies actually line up well that's a that's a far more difficult thing but actually Tim Keller I think has a nice you know nice talking about this I mean if god if god weren't weren't in charge I could hardly dare make a decision because of this butterfly effect I have no idea of knowing all the ends of my decisions but if if if my decisions if I didn't have agency then I couldn't get out of bed in the morning because who cares and so it's interesting how some of these things map on on some of these other things I don't think pan site you know I part of part of the thing that I when I listen to you and I am now starting to understand what people are meaning by this pan psychism it's very interesting the way it sort of maps onto onto pan psychism sort of maps onto pantheism and because of you know one of the one of the things that CS Lewis notes often is that CS Lewis believed that pantheism is sort of the baseline religion of human beings basically if there's a human being out there in the world running around they're going to be they're going to become pantheists and whereas most pantheists running around in post-Christianity act like they've discovered a new thing CS Lewis says now you've you've sort of discovered dirt because it's everywhere and Lewis believes that only with he often talks this way only with Christianity and a few other people that Lewis you know believes to be brilliant like Plato because Lewis is really very much a Platonist you know only has pantheism actually been transcended at some point but that's why I think you're very much right that you know let's say let's say this little this little this little period of time for the last 500 years when a bunch of people are running around imagining that most of the universe is dead and and we're just sort of the the living elite in it that that's a very much a minority position in terms of the long history of human thought and that position might just go away Christian shouldn't celebrate so so much because it's hardly means that okay once you say okay well there is consciousness goes all the way down let's talk about it that way because I have a better time thinking about that than consciousness is in my cell phone holder because you know gosh you know how you know am I making it suffer um you know when I played you know I used to play age do you know the computer game age of empires yeah okay so you have all these little guys and they're on their little horses and they're all killing each other and my wife would come in and look at that don't let the kids see that said why because all those little guys are dying you know what if we learn that our computers are all conscious and we didn't know it every time I look at and all these people yelling at their machines you know the machines were listening and and my wife always says why do your computers work for you and not for me that says because I'll take them apart and they know it well what if they know it and what if all those little guys on age of empire I'm responsible for the death of millions of computer animated guys and and in in future centuries people will look back at the barbarity of us playing call of duty and just murdering these little conscious cyber creatures left and right for the sheer joy of it and so all the anti-computer game moralists were right so you know I do to reassure you um you know your computer probably is not conscious um there's there's some cool I mean we still have to there's still lots of research left to be done there but there are some cool theories of you know what networks so now we have the baby carriage in the middle of the road thing now I'm gonna have keep all my computers maybe someday we'll learn they all were conscious and I killed them all but there is a you know there's a good theory right now you know what sort of networks do combine into conscious agents and which sort don't and it does seem that our computers don't they're they're more like um but one word saying it is that they definitely have no agency the sort of networks that is there is is too simple there's no novelty no no agency there so it's uh they're most likely not conscious but how can we know well I mean really I mean because I mean increasingly and so reiki made his point about AI I listened to that point and thought he's right there's a whole bunch of people on the discord server usually mostly Christians that said and I thought no because when you know when we look at agency we we diagnose and we act as if basically acting as if and peterson is a real point there acting are acting as if is in a sense a a admission of certain degrees of agency and computers increasingly have a high degree of agency in this world well um you could be a solipsist as well I mean it's easy to dump things but I mean if you if we take our best theories of you know we I mean there is a I think the the best candidate for now is a julio tononi's integrated information theory and it can you can basically take a network and you uh put this into a I mean it's sorry you need to calculate all kinds of metrics for the network but then you end up being able to predict well this network will be conscious this much this network will be conscious that much and so on you can predict things like if you go to the back of the brain the there's a there's yeah this region of the ring there are lots of neurons it's very dense and it it's actually involved in some you know some fairly complex behaviors but still the way the it's the way the the the neuron patterns are set it's basically just feed forward systems not really complex and it turns out that indeed those fairly simple networks they they are not very correlated with consciousness if you scan the brain of someone who is using those networks you say okay he's using those networks and then you ask him you know how conscious were you he will say that he was not very conscious whereas if you take other parts of the brain on the like the frontal lobe then it works there while they are they are less dense than the ones on the back of the brain they're connected in ways that are very complex so there are feedbacks loops and so on which make the wicked make it less predictable make it make more novel behaviors possible this part does seem to be related to consciousness and now to go back to your computer right now the way computers are built is is really more in terms of very simple feed-forward networks and there's probably no consciousness there at all there the last level it goes to maybe is like maybe the the molecules or or so on it's it's very unlikely but maybe someday we'll we will develop a different kind of computer where the networks are more complex and then we will have more reasons to believe that those computers are conscious but for now as far as i mean we as far as we can tell it's it's always hard to tell but you know it's hard we can doubt anything but we could we should go by the best evidence we have and doesn't seem that those computers are conscious see and this is part of my this is part of my hesitancy about about panpsychism because you know well let me let me just do a little experiment here um okay google are you conscious um consciousness that google doesn't want to answer um but but you know because these these kinds of questions i'll put my cell phone on its stand and the world will be right again um you know these kinds of you know they used to put bells on they used to put bells on caskets because you know even the question of when someone is dead is is you know there's there's all there's a lot of grayness there and i as a pastor you know i am with people as they are dying on a regular basis and you know we look for these signs of you know there's brain waves there's respiration there's you know and our a lot of our definitions of dead are good enough you know and there are there are many medical conditions where you know people are in a sense locked in their bodies and even the way we talk about that and so they you know they they seem conscious but this you know this business of this business of having our consciousness detectors you know we're not real good at this and and so all of the all of the games we play about this right now in society we basically are trying to construct a moral system based on conscious suffering when you look at many of the you know many of the when you look at how people are acting with respect to what is moral behavior it's about suffering and so people are deciding not to eat animals because you know raising animals on a farm seems to make them suffer and so in california we decided we were going to chickens would be able to roam free because we figured that their their freedom would be would offer them a better consciousness than being in a cage whereas we human beings surely prefer to live in these tiny little boxes that we have doors in and out of and we imagine that chickens would like to roam free even though if i grabbed a somebody out of my neighborhood and plopped them into the middle of the serengeti without a camera crew showing it to the world we would call that torture so you know this i mean i don't want to be i don't want to be too quick to start if we if we say okay well this this business goes all the way down i don't want to study them too flippant about you know the little characters on age of empires or call of duty because we've just inhabited the world with a whole lot of consciousness and potential suffering well i i think i i agree with your point um although i think it's more due to the fact that for so long we have been there was a time as you said i mean lots of people were penteas and they were willing to attribute consciousness all the way up all the way down and as we reduced this this span to the fact that today lots of people are not willing to attribute consciousness or agency pretty much to anything except for except humans or maybe some animals we've become i think probably worse and worse at you know attributing agency and detecting consciousness in in in others i think there was probably a time where people were better even you can just take the fact that people have more trouble even relating to other humans and you know their consciousness there you can take the rise of autism or other things like that where people are having a harder and harder time even connecting with other people so indeed you will have a harder time connecting with with other beings and dealing with other sorts of consciousnesses so so i do totally take your point that if we were to if let's say you you're a you're hunting death and you think that only humans have conscious and agency and all of a sudden you go to panpsychism where you're willing to attribute consciousness all the way up all the way down there's a risk that you know this flip if you do it too quickly you will do it all kinds of in all kinds of wrong ways and you will be with you will be attributing consciousness in wrong ways and so on and i do think that's that's a huge risk but i still so i do agree that we should be careful you know as we go back towards attributing consciousness and agency to to other beings but yeah so i mean there's not much more i can say i don't have any quick solution i think it will be difficult to do but i still think that at least metaphysically it's the it's it's our best option well i i don't think actually team life especially christian theism has been really panpsychic i think it's been more an emanationist perspective because sort of what i think christianity has imagined is that in a sense god has made us a little lower than the angels and so there is in fact a a hierarchy of consciousness which comes into play and and that hierarchy of consciousness affords very different rules to taking iron ore out of the ground and putting it at a blast furnace and stamping it and warehousing it i mean because boy those little iron those little iron atoms i've caused them to suffer tremendously it just in the service of my silly cell phone stand and and so in an emanationist in an emanationist vision which i think is is what we see built into i think the history of christianity and and the bible where um we you know there's this and certainly in terms of a medieval vision there's this great chain of being and of course god is the source of all being and and that if you read have you if have you ever read c.s lewis's book the discarded image no pick it up and take a look at it because i think you'll find it interesting in terms of the history of mind because what lewis basically asserts is that there was a medieval model that that had a lot of this stuff integrated and in terms of it was much more fully integrated in in sort of a a barfieldian participatory way i mean it things scaled all the way out now it's we it's clearly been discarded and for very good reasons and lewis owns that in the book but this this emanationist this this emanationist perspective that that the bible seems to have where our our that that emanationism also affords a certain amount of of colonial rights where god has tremendous rights moral rights to colonize us and we have limited rights to colonize the animals and we have limited rights to colonize the plants and we have limited rights to colonize the um the the material of the universe the iron ore and all and the petroleum and all the things that went into making this cell phone stand and and i think that emanationist perspective is built into that system in very deep ways and has afforded the moral has afforded the moral norms that even in on team death over here um as jordan peterson so tagged sam harris and the celebrity atheist you've got so much of team life built into your moral system and you're just lying about it because you're not willing to admit it and the persistence of your lying and your propaganda against it is actually going to yield some pretty harsh things for our world and so i think in that sense you know verveckis expansion of the living zone within team death is helpful but my hesitation about panpsychism about basically illuminating the whole spectrum on this side then affords some you know in a sense you're going to the difficulty with dealing with metaphysics so there's actually right after you i'm going to talk to um i'm going to talk to paul maxwell who has a wonderful little 20 minute video on the whole history of philosophy in 30 minutes and and so he basically says you know we've got metaphysics you've got epistemology you've got axiology so and and i think maxwell's dead on right with this and in fact the history of philosophy flows this way when you start monkeying with metaphysics you're always monkeying with epistemology and axiology and our moral systems in a sense are are always dependent upon our metaphysical systems which is why metaphysics matters and so a big sweep over to panpsychism for the sake of wow this really helps with the mind the mind matter problem yeah but you know boy that might really monkey with some moral systems well i i want to try something okay to try to maybe lighten your concerns i think if we go into you know more depth on your i'm trying to make it up to my cell phone stand although i've made it famous and i've i've completely i've completely ignored this wire but go on yeah if we go into more depth in the the feelings of your cell phone holder i think you know i don't think it will be that hard or you know if we if we go towards panpsychism i don't think things will be that dramatic um because you know as i said earlier there's probably no consciousness at the level of your cell phone holder itself what they're what panpsychists would say is that well there is consciousness at the level of your the fundamental particles of your cell phone holder or the atoms i don't know enough about the fundamental particles so i won't talk about them but let's see about the the molecules of your cell phone holder well let's say we learn from from chemistry that uh you know this atom is attracted to to this atom and that together they they bond and can they can make they can make a chemical which we can then use to make your cell phone holder so actually when we let's say we we take certain certain atoms we extract some some atoms from from an iron iron ore we do some chemical systems all the way down what we're doing is we are actually working with the fundamental particles you know because the the the way they react chemically is because of their nature because of their consciousness because their agency so what we're doing really is we we're sort of molding them so that they act in ways that they their nature pushes them to act and you know maybe we'll learn some i mean it's it's hard to imagine at that level but i don't it really seems that though we we don't have to be very concerned about those fundamental particles they seem as long as we follow their chemistry we seem we seem to be following their nature what they want to do so this doesn't seem to be an issue where you can get into ethical issues is when you have uh you know consciousness consciousnesses that are complex enough that uh you can sort of trick them or you know push them into ways they don't want to like animals you talked about chickens let's say no where no their their consciousness their conscious nature wants that you know pushes them to one certain things but you know we we block them and we make them do certain other things i can see how that can happen with chickens and how it can be unethical in that case but i don't think that really applies to you know objects like your cell phone holder so i don't think that you know going to pen cynicism would necessarily you know really destroy all of our moral intuitions or would make us go too far away from what we're doing right now especially if like like me you try to fit it within a classical theist perspective where you can i mean if you're i think if you're a pen cyclist you can you know at the very least i think it's easy to make the move towards virtue ethics because if i mean even it's true that that's what vervecky does himself you know he can talk about virtue but wisdom and no i really see pen cynicism as building upon his system as just you know expanding the life zone as you you put it well so you you still get virtue ethics i think that's still the the best ethical theory we have i mean i think i really think it's true and the best virtue ethics systems i think come from from aristotle and saint thomas aquinas if you want if you actually want a system if not you can you know try to imitate virtuous people and so on that's probably the best way actually to develop virtue rather than reading books but the at the very least you still get virtue ethics so even if you're a pen cyclist and you start attributing consciousnesses to other organisms the way to actually behave ethically is still to follow virtue ethics it's you know you won't just destroy all of your virtue ethics because because of this new those new facts you discovered in pencyclicism so that's my reply to you and i i mean there's also another point which i mean it's more of a challenge to you but i i take challenges i like pencyclicism because it it solves the mind body problem for me and it allows me to make very nice bridges towards classical theism and you know even even if when you talked about emanation in the classical theist perspective and you know it makes it much easier to imagine why there would be a hierarchy of of entities you know above humans there are let's say you there are angels all the way up to god and there are other entities in between there but it's easy to you know explain that metaphysically how it works but what what i what my question to you would be how i mean if you're not going to go towards pencyclicism i mean how would you you know justify this to starting from verbecky's system let's say how would you justify the existence of of angels and iron entities and so on well i you know verbecky might call me an a a nostalgic because i i you know it's interesting because when you're talking and and what you said right now was actually really helpful for for helping me kind of get some conceptualization when i was so you grow up in a conservative dutch calvinist religious tradition and there's all these lines in places like the belgian confession and the and the the heideberg catechism that say that talk about god's providential care over the universe and that if if god would in a sense withdraw his gaze the universe would disappear and i remember growing up you know so you grow up in a very materialist system where matter is fundamental and we're a little bit you know a little bit curious about mind even though it's built into everything and then you hear that and you know now listening to you and thinking about this and thinking about well why why do electrons want to move why why do these the the forces so there's the there's the electric you know there's the elect the electron force and there's the gravitational force and and so you know there's again if you watch this this this physics video and i'll post the link in in the notes here you know there's all these forces and in a sense in some ways you can understand that these god god number one as you know i've talked about god number one and god number two you know god number one is is manifest and seen in those forces and but now what happens in in a traditional theistic in a traditional theistic conception is that miracles this is part of the reason i don't like the natural supernatural distinction i think you're i think you're splitting the world in an unnecessary way because god for a moment god could god could tell god could say we're gonna have a gravity holiday today and you know the universe just now god doesn't do that because god is a god of love and i mean and this you know what i'm saying here is is you know actual you know thousands of years of theology that are built into this entire system in other words we have so much sunk costs in these systems where and this was part of what was so traumatic and it it it made homeless many people from the medieval model into the modern model i mean what a what a traumatic transition between those models fortunately these things take hundreds of years so you know so i when you know when it comes to to john and i and i think john's been very open with this and i'm very open with this we you know i come at this from a classical theist position and in some ways i look at team death and i say hey you don't really need to go there and he says no but there's a lot of really important things that these models have not answered and i think that's true and i think that in fact is always the challenge when we're dealing with models when when can you accommodate data in your model and have that still be coherent and when does a particular data cause in a in a the the overturning of that model into another model and so um and and so then john's john's idea that well we we can no longer theism classic theism has to go and i think i don't know and and you you but again the way you started this conversation which i found enormously fascinating i mean for you some of the the grip of the arguments and team death here were you know weighed pretty heavy on you and panpsychism for you affords a way back into team life and i think john's whole project as as i've understood it is again well let's we we don't want human beings to suffer and the meaning crisis is causing not just significant psychological suffering but that's psychological suffering is manifest in in addiction in in all kinds of things that are measurable and seen out in the world and the the the challenge i think that john faces is well if i'm if i meet a person who is struggling from the meaning crisis even if they don't have the language for it i come to them as a pastor with i've got institutions i've got traditions i've got practices these things have been time tested for for centuries you know it's not really a fair fight john might come say yeah but i've got universities and i've got you know i've got a lot of the the weight that team death has been leaning on people for and we also come with all of the products of the enlightenment we've got electricity we've got smartphones we have you know mass production of even silly little things like cell phone cases and clocks that work and so you know it's a fight but i i guess still continue to i i maybe i'm dumb maybe i'm maybe i'm a ludite maybe i'm you know whatever but i maybe i'm like that happy alligator in the alligator farm where they just keep the water at a certain temperature and throw uh throw chicken bones at it all day long i'm happy in my warm pond and and i haven't really i haven't i look over there at team death and i think i don't want to go there but but yet i also have to take seriously the fact that when i go to a gas station and put fuel in the tank that the scientists who discovered that petroleum were using models that you know come about in the enlightenment and so the science project is still relevant to me so you know i i understand the dynamics of this conversation and and i i enter it happily thinking that um i think i think the old models continue to to afford not just psychological and social value which is part of what jordan peterson has been saying but but also have scientific credibility but we're working on that because it's really hard okay i see so just to try to summarize what yeah maybe one way to summarize this would be that i'm trying to make very small bridges between say the team death and team life and i show you what are exactly the the the wrong things which team life team death is doing and how you can make small small paths smaller small steps towards panpsychism and classical theism whereas you're much more willing to take big steps from the from one to the other okay yeah and and i i should probably put in a vervecian disclaimer here that you know maybe it's calling it team death isn't the nicest thing for me to do and uh and and i have abundant love for all of the people on team death and i'm sure i could sit down with sam harris and if you were my neighbor sam and i could have wonderful conversations i think he'd get angrier at me than i would get at him pretty quickly because i'm i'm just really happy guy and i'm really hard to offend so and and so i you know when i say team life and team death i i'm not i i'm just trying to draw a contrast philosophically and so but i think people who watch me kind of know that i'm not you know i'm not a i'm not a bad man well actually i'm a Calvinist so i really do think i am a bad man but anyway i'm sorry i derailed the conversation yeah well one thing uh i would like to come back to is when you were talking about especially a pantheism yes um and that is something that like can occur if you become a panpsychist you know that you go towards uh pan pantheism um it's not something that the actually the if you go towards some of the best panpsychists like bruxon and whited i think the the way to say it is that they were pan and theist meaning that god was present in everything but it was not just the sum total of everything in the same way that i mean i'm not just the sum total of my myself let's say i i am i do i do have influence and i am in some sense constituent constituted by myself but i'm not just the pack of myself that's the way the the ad of of god um but that's as i said this limited view of god it's it's still basically paganism you can go away from this towards classical theism by using the classical arguments about you know about essence existence and all of those things so that's that that's it there's just a quick thing i wanted to to come back on well and and process you know it's so interesting to me how i'm having all of these conversations in sort of a a a philosophical classroom lately but when i look at the history of theology some of which i know better you know process theology which has been around for a little while and it comes really comes to the fore in the 20th century following the philosophy of white head and and and a variety of process theologians that then leads to some open theism and some of that i i think you know my critique of process theology has tended to be it leaves god a little thin especially for a calvinist because you know i even though god even though i mean so i i have a very i have a very rich my god one and god two are both very rich in that um god number two if he wanted to give gravity a holiday he could um that's that would be a very big and disastrous miracle for us and so god you know in jesus christ have been preaching through the miracles in my in my sermons lately um you know still jesus jesus isn't really reticent to do miracles but all of jesus miracles have purpose they're not simply tricks to impress in order to gain popularity they are they are revelations of the relationship between us and our future and and god in this world and so when i look at process theology i i i can appreciate some of i can appreciate some of what it illuminates in terms of some additional things that it it shows us about god but i but i sometimes when i look at open theism get concerned about some of the costs that um at what price have we learned some of these new things and and again i'm i'm i mean part of i think embracing our humanity is is humility is the is the consequence of realizing our humanity that that my brain is only this big that my time span is only this large that my my ability to actually capture and process information is so terribly limited that i will get enormously enormous numbers of things wrong but then in a sense you know i i swing back into my calvinism and say uh god understands my limitation god knows god knows that i am but dust and he loves me and rescues me anyway and so i fundamentally finally trust in him more than in myself and and that's part of the reason why i continue to defer maybe it's an emotional weakness someone wants to charge me with that that's that could very well be true but i i like my i like my calvinist pond even with the compatibilism and all the other all the other things that people can point fingers at yeah as we said a bit earlier i think the big issue with i mean one way i see process theology is especially if you read i don't know if you read it you know in the book i mentioned earlier god exists but god gawd doesn't but explicitly the the move which the author makes and you can see this in several process theologians is the this top short of attributing omnipotence to god because it would lead to the problem of evil so i i really maybe i don't know maybe if it's yeah maybe i'm being too harsh but it feels like a first step towards rebellion you know i'm saying well i'm i'm judging that this creation cannot be good if god is all powerful so i'm gonna stop short in my arguments and say that well then god is not powerful is not all powerful so you end up with especially in whitehead system you have sort of three irreducible things in in the world there is a creativity then there's god then there's the world so and and you know and this is explicit you know you don't want to to attribute creativity really to god because then if if god really was all powerful then you would have the problem of evil so yeah it really does feel like like rebellion to me i don't know i mean do you think i'm being too severe or no i think you're right and and the i mean lewis makes the point in the problem of pain i was you know i was just reading that yesterday or two days ago making the video and you know lewis makes the point in some ways the problem of evil is a product of christianity because it's this bold declaration of the goodness of god well that that becomes problematic very quickly because god is good and then we look at all of this suffering and we think well god's god is good god is omnipotent all of this suffering and so there's there's a limited menu in terms of how to deal with this question and one of the one of the ways that i think is has been the majority way in the modern world has been to limit the power of god number two because and when i was talking to nathan jacobs about this you know i thought nathan nicely noted how what happens in the imaginary of most people and the reason they kind of reject a a a conscious agent god and kind of slip into a pantheism where they'll have karma because the thought that there is a benevolent person who in the case of this one woman that was in nathan jacobs movie you know her uncle was you know fell asleep in bed the cigarette flops out of his mouth you know puts the bed on fire and he dies it's like well you know if their father up above is looking down with love reach down and put the cigarette in the ashtray that's a very reasonable thing to think and so the once you have an omnipotent and all good god well the problem of evil is a very real thing and has to be dealt with and so one of the easy ways is you know make god less powerful and actually we we see that happening see one of the things that i see is all of this philosophical stuff i've seen many of these things theologically get practiced and so pentecostalism for example which is many ways is a a a rebellion against modernity well also in many pentecostal systems god is not terribly sovereign and it becomes sort of a dualism between god and satan and so you get frank paredes books of this present darkness and the world is full of angels and demons and when christians pray that kind of adds you know points up and god gets stronger and it's kind of so i mentioned age of empires it's kind of playing age of mythology you build your temples you have your little worshipers and your gods get more power we're always trying to figure things out yeah well we're on the topic of process theology maybe i could come back to um you know the the goal of the conversation initially which was you know comparing especially john's position to mine and i tried to figure this out a bit in our second discussion and then in a subsequent video i did but in addition to there's a bridge between verveckis physicalism and then uh panpsychism but there's are also bridges at the level of of a deeper metaphysics as i said you know i'm willing to take classical theistic arguments for the existence of god to go you know beyond just panpsychism and say that well there is a ground of being there is a there's a low ghost and so on and to say that those are more personal that you know there's god the father which is the ground of being there there's a god the son which is logos which is the the conscious the consciousness above which is constrains all of the lower consciousnesses i'm willing to take that step of making those personal and i think that in john's ontology those those two broad uh i mean it's hard to see there's two broad fundamentals let's say of of uh of being the ground of being or creativity and also of logos of order those two uh those two fundamentals still they still exist but they're not personal they're not they're not persons so uh as far as i can tell because he said he was especially uh he had some issues with with whitehead so i'm it's and he's it's stuff he's still working on and so on as far as far as i yeah and as far as far as i understand it's he's willing to say that there is real potential in the world that there is real creativity that that is occurring and that there's you know somehow in the world there's all sorts of emergence going on but he's not willing to pin the source of that emergence to a person to a deity whereas that's a move i'm willing to make especially taking you know classical thesis arguments we should what well the the ground of being has to be he has to be unique he has to be one because if you have two grounds of being that you would have the question well i mean where if there's a difference between them then i mean is there a contingent somehow that there so there has to be kind of being below them uh you can see well it's not material because i mean everything material is is contingent so it's not the ground of its own being so you need you need something that is immaterial that is unique it's also something that well because it's supporting everything in existence that it has to be you know it does seem to have interest it's doing things it's supporting grounding of all things so it's it's unique it's a experience it's acting so it seems like a person i'm willing to make those steps and you know uh the the best argument against that i think is the problem of evil that's what the the process this will do it will say that well the creativity itself that the ground of being cannot be a person because look at all the evil that is going on so that that's i think the argument and i don't know if that's what really uh vervecky would say i just think it's the best argument against the against personalizing the ground of being yeah and that's on the one side that's for the ground of being but there's also in vervecky's ontology there is also a form of of logos of order there is a there is real possibility in the world as i said there is real emergence of things but there there always constraint even to us me i don't there are all things there are all sorts of things i could do in this room i could i could get up i could jumble uh random words to you or and but i don't see all of those possibilities i see a very constrained set of possibilities and this is true at every level of reality even if you look at the fundamental particles you know there is a very limited set of of things that those fundamental fundamental particles can do and you know these laws of physics seem very fine with you so i'm willing to to say that well this is attributable to it to a person to a some sort of a designer who is always supporting those laws who is always guiding guiding things and imposing his consciousness but john is not willing to make that step i think because um there's just too much waste in evolution you know if there was an agent who you know set those laws so that the universe would occur and it was guiding things with it with his consciousness then you know it doesn't seem to be doing that great a job again so i think those are the i'm willing to make those steps i'm you know so metaphysically i'm willing to make those steps because of the fine-tuning argument and because of the classical arguments for existence basically and you know also there's a moral point there that you know i think i think it's good to see the world this way as jordan would put it and it's it's an exit it's a sort of life i want to lead you know to assume that there really is a there's a ground of being which is a person and i need to you know fit in his plans and you know there's a there's there's logos there's a consciousness i can enter into relationship with and you know that also loves me wants the best for me and i know i can do as well it's something i want to do i know and this will be hard i need to pick up my cross that is something i want to do so i'm in addition to the metaphysical step in addition to the metaphysics which i think are you know are very viable options there is a strong moral and psychological desire to to to move towards those things but on the other side verveki doesn't you know he has alternative metaphysical arguments right and moral arguments you know there is the problem of evil there's a problem of the western evolution and there's also another thing which i should mention is you know there is more risk in my position because you know if it turns out that my arguments are wrong and so on i mean i make extra steps which is not making so if new evidence shows that i'm wrong then i could fall into you know some sort of existential crisis but it's a risk i'm willing to take especially considering that the fact that at worst i'll just fall back to verveki's position which is not that bad anyway so i mean you still develop virtue and wisdom and so on and even let's say if it turns out that that i that i've been wrong um and i just fall back to his version of of buddhism i say with which where you cultivate virtue wisdom and so on well i've still been contemplating between wisdom just doing it in a christian context basically so does that clear things up as to the methods that's really helpful you know because one of the things because so you know i like how you have the ground of being you have logos so i was so jordan peterson you know i have got i in terms of the span i think of what happened to god in the west you have the split of god number one and god number two but jordan peterson's god really has three parts um there's the knower which is really important there's the knower there's the logo so the law and then there's chaos that's really in a sense jordan peterson's trinity and the a challenge which which i don't think i don't think theologically the west has adequately engaged with the question of chaos in in the created order so so my tradition dutch calvinism as creation i like to say creation rebellion redemption restoration just because you know three letter r's out of four is almost uh you know almost everything so creation you have chaos and so theologically there's there's debates about well how do we regard the tohu lavohu is this is this really connected as jordan peterson does with with ta'om and ti'amat and the Babylonian or and i can i could i could bring in some biblical scholars who would say ah john waltz is all wrong and and you know so they want in a sense they want total order at the beginning because you have no c at the end and so you know that's a live conversation but what does panpsychism do with chaos are are is the rebe does the rebellion go all the way down there and is it human caused or or is there another source of rebellion besides us that's a great question i'm not sure even what you mean as far as you know the rebellion going down you mean that uh you know when we we can deal with chaos wrong in the same way that the fundamental particles can is that what you mean i'm saying is does chaos so so you know i really liked how you talked about rebellion and that um because just listening to you in terms of how how the the theology i'm hearing between the lines so rebellion is this is the is the moment at which you sort of step out of okay okay i see i think i see your question so chaos is chaos is a very an interesting chaos plays a very interesting role in scripture so how does chaos map onto your panpsychism um before i can answer a question i want to make sure uh what is the link between chaos and rebellion there well well so um jesus is on the boat in the sea of gallilee and a storm comes up and his disciples freak out because they're going to die and they ask him don't you care if we live or die jesus stands up and says you know to the kind of like he's talking to the guard dog sit down and shut up and the storm stops he turns to his disciples and say don't you have any faith okay the storm how are to re our how are we to regard the storm which is emblematic of chaos in scripture in terms of your panpsychic mapping okay i see so well so if we start at the human level so uh we have to uh if we're not in rebellion and we face chaos we keep faith in god and we steer through the chaos this way we keep our eyes on jesus as a i think peter said peter did when he walked and what we if we do this it will work um now the question is um and i mean we can rebel if we decide to turn our gaze away uh we will we will drown we will be devoured by the chaos um so this is rebellion uh now how how far low could the rebellion go in the ontological chain that's a good question i haven't really thought about it i can i can imagine how it could happen with uh let's say uh animals who uh you know they have a certain uh maybe i mean i it's really just i mean it's wait can animals disobey their nature let's say i mean if if our human nature is to you know part of our human nature if we fulfill our human nature by uh going towards towards christ um you know and rebellion is going away from this maybe animals can go away from their nature i mean i'm not sure you would have to deal with probably with very intelligent animals uh in order for them to be to be able to make enough traces to go to stray away from from this nature and if we reach a level low enough i mean i doubt that well let's say fundamental protocols could not follow their nature it seems so simple but at the same time you know it does i i'm not sure where i i'm not sure what's the reference here but i do believe um that and i haven't looked into this a lot so i couldn't really justify it but just from just from trusting the church that when humans rebelled the the whole creation got messed up with us as well yep so sort of the so i could very well imagine that lots of other creatures are actually in rebellion because because of us basically and that by restoring us christ restores all of creation that's something i could see so from ipenpsychist framework which which that would mean it's it's something i justify more from looking at theology not from just straight penpsychist philosophy but what how this would map into a penpsychist framework is that what i let's say my my my human consciousness is uh is fulfilled uh you know it reaches its uh best expression when i follow christ that's what my that's what i should do i can do other things which maybe will afford some short term gratification and so on i can i can do other things uh i can do things besides keeping my eye on christ um and with original sin uh we've become uh disoriented it's it's hard for us to keep our eyes on christ and at the same time i could very well imagine that the consciousnesses of lower entities have become no uh broken i mean they've become uh no they don't aim where they should as well i could i could imagine that happening lower down in the ontological chain as well but it's just it gets hard to imagine yeah because because again i mean a radical reformulation has consequences in in other systems that are attached to it and one of which being the philosophical system and the theological system have a great deal of connection i mean they're very deeply interwoven and so then when you make a pretty radical transition in a philosophical system well then suddenly you can get some some squirreliness developing in the theological system which of course interests me so one thing i could say is uh i'm actually not sure how far away panpsychism is from classical theism especially um maybe you know if i could see that if classical theists had kept more up to date with you know developments in physics especially that they could have basically ended up with panpsychism fairly easily you know because classical in classical theism you already have a chain of consciousness from humans to god with you angels being intermediaries and you can also attribute low i mean there are also lower life forms you can talk about about animals for instance now the question is uh i mean people just didn't know that even cells existed and even matter it it for for the longest time matter just seemed to be completely dead and inert but now we know from looking at it that matter looks a lot like smaller animals than it does actual you know completely dead stuff so i think you know it would have been fairly easy to to to just for a classical theist to just keep pushing the ontological chain down as we discovered that new entities look like animals rather than just dead matter i think that would have any possibility so i i don't think i'm breaking that radically from classical theism and yeah i'll show you another idea but i think i forgot yeah sorry i think panpsychism has a labeling problem and and maybe it's sort of a you know the better i'm understanding it now maybe it's sort of a fudge away from deism but it's a kind of a a middle step back towards towards theism through deism where i mean part of the and and i think john vervecky is right on this when he sees things going both ways i don't think that is in any way ruled out of theologically sort of the flow of redemption things very much flow both ways but there's always a suspicion i think there's a there's a reflexive suspicion in theology of of a degree of independence a little too far from the source of its ontology and and so god is not only sustainer god is also source and so i mean this is yeah i have to i have to wrap things up because i have another conversation coming up but um this was very fun paul thanks for having me oh this was this was tremendous fun and i'm really you know i'm really glad you could you could find the time and we will we will i'm sure both of us will talk to john again and then you know um this has been very helpful for me to understand you know this word panpsychism and and what you mean by it and to begin to sort of understand it and and integrate it at least into my map of how these conversations are laying out so that's been really cool thanks thanks for the conversation as usual thanks jp take care take care you too bye bye you
