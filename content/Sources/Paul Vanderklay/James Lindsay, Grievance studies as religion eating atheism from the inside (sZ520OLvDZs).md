 Hi this is Paul and I have a very special guest today that I asked to have a conversation with. Often people reach out to me but I reached out to James after I saw his conversation with with Jordan Peterson on the hoax papers that he did. So James you probably don't need a lot of introduction but tell us a little bit about yourself. Okay so I have a background in physics and mathematics. I did a bachelor's degree in physics and masters and PhD in math that was concluded in 2010 and I stepped away from academia for various commitments I had in my personal life more than I wish I could say I was prescient and saw the writing on the wall but no I just had other obligations in my life come up and you know responsibility is as responsibility does. So I left academia and in the to keep from getting academically bored I started studying mostly kind of philosophy philosophy of science and philosophy of religion early on and then I got into that led me into studying psychology particularly of religion and moral psychology and trying to figure out as you wanted to invite me on to talk about how I kind of took this winding path I talked to Dr. Peterson about it about how I meandered my way into trying to answer the question when religious people because I'm surrounded by them I live in the southeastern US when they talked to me about God I firmly believe that they're talking about something I don't think that they're crazy like a lot of atheist types do I just wanted to try to understand it without the religious side of it and so I started digging into the religious psychology particularly and moral psychology to try to understand where they're coming from be able to build bridges reach across you know hear people and they can say it in their words and I can hear it in terms of what I think I understand and we can still have great conversations and things and so that through whatever varying reasons led me to get involved in culture war type conversations online a lot that led me to see lots of stuff happening with people getting accused of racism and sexism where it just didn't seem to fit started to see weird sociological definitions applied and that's how they were getting accused so I got really curious along with my collaborators Peter Bogotian and Helen Pluckrose and even Mike Naina our filmmaker was kind of collaborated with us he didn't write any papers with us but he did help with ideas and putting together and understanding what we were facing and so he's really you know more involved than we we've let on but at any rate we started looking into the scholarship that's coming out of what we called grievance studies which would be like gender studies race studies even some sociology post-colonial studies queer studies fat studies you know something something something studies and so we started looking at this pretty closely how they try to produce and legitimize their claims to knowledge what their ethics are how this came to be and then ultimately we wanted to verify that we knew what we were doing by reproducing it in rather hysterical exaggerated ways slightly satirical ways by sending in these intentionally broken academic papers to their peer-reviewed journals not predatory journals not low bar journals but significant journals within the niche disciplines and see if they would accept and or publish them and see what their peer reviewers would say about these intentionally flawed papers so over the course of ten months we wrote 20 papers and over the course of about almost 15 months we dealt with the submitting the revising the resubmitting and so on and ended up with seven of our papers getting accepted four of those actually were published with one getting accolades from its journal we had seven more that we thought we could still work in to the so they were still viable they hadn't been shot down completely my guess is had we been able to see it all through before the Wall Street Journal cottoned on to what we were doing and took us public ahead of schedule I think we probably would have got it around dozen papers in and how did the Wall Street Journal figure it out so one of one of the issues is of course when you're doing a secret project that involves things getting eventually published in the public is that you can't hide the thing that's going public and so there's a Twitter account called real peer review that a lot of people follow that shows kind of some of the crazier papers or that come out of various sectors of academia in real peer-reviewed journals sometimes they do people's thesis or dissertation also but something that's been vetted academically at the highest levels that just seems prep no not seems is preposterous and so they as we expected would happen the moment our paper about I'm not joking dog humping got accepted we realized they were gonna publish it at some point in real peer review was going to be all over that especially since they kind of watched that particular journal and so kind of like clockwork the paper came out luckily there was a huge delay the journal got bogged down for administrative reasons or whatever and it took them three months or more to go from final acceptance to publication usually that only takes a couple of weeks online but this it took three months really good luck for us and so it came out real peer review had a heyday with it and so a lot of these kind of like little campus watchdog journalist outlets picked up on it and they started looking into it and one thing that always comes up is who wrote this let's verify that it's really academia and we made the mistake because we wrote that paper really early on and didn't know what we were working on yet we made the mistake of saying that the author was a PhD in feminist studies is supposed to say gender studies or something that's more common and there are only four I believe is what they told me degree granting institutions that give PhDs in feminist studies so the journalists just one of the journalists just called all of them and said that there is no record of such a person and so journalism lives apparently not to not to be rude to anybody but yes even at the lowest levels and so they ended up contacting the journal that published her paper and asking questions which got the journal suspicious but as journalism is lives as journalism does when a small journalist is trying to drum up support for in this case her story she contacts bigger journalists to try to you know get a little brouhaha going around it so she contacted a no another journalist at the Wall Street Journal who she knows and told her enough to get her curious and so then when the Wall Street Journal started asking questions both of us and of the journal everything got serious fast and so we realized the wheels are shot off the bus where we are sliding to where we're gonna slide and it's time to go public we can't we can't keep the ruse going like if we wanted to keep the ruse going with the journal at that point it and we weren't about to do that and it wasn't ever supposed to be like that level of deception and to keep the ruse going against you know to hope the Wall Street Journal could run a story and it wouldn't just keep snowballing it is just naive so we decided to call the Wall Street Journal and tell them what was going on and begin the process of turning that into a story which eventually came out it took a couple of months for them to be able to pour through I mean almost 400,000 words of documents and data that we had and finally take it public so that's that's the story of what happened and why we ended up going public without having finished our inquiry maybe six months ahead of schedule okay how did the three of you find each other because you're all in different places and I mean there's there's not you know if you were all let's say on one campus that would make sense but right how do you how do the three of you know each other and find each other and then at some point say we're gonna cook up a conspiracy Twitter Twitter okay um a long time ago I mean I don't know if your listeners would know but you certainly would know that I was active actually all three of us were active in various ways in the so-called atheist movement and we're all so there's the common thread and so a long time ago Sam Harris had gotten attacked for something and I wrote a defense of him and Peter Bogotian noticed it and asked me if I wanted to write with him so we started a writing collaboration maybe 2013 at that point before his his book a manual for creating atheists came out yeah and so then I don't know exactly the timing on this but it was similar timing that I was actually talking to Helen on Twitter and she and I were arguing pretty intensely she finally agreed with me which is the most important point of course we had a pretty serious not like hostile but you know substantive philosophical disagreement about some point or another and so we ended up taking it out of public Twitter and discussing it in private okay and started to be understand each other better and became kind of friends I do remember at that point when I was arguing whether those sending Peter a message and saying something about I can't get rid of this insufferable Helen Pluckro and so that's how we that's how we started so we formed kind of a V with me at the middle Helen and Peter didn't work directly together but I worked with both of them and I wrote essays with Helen and we mostly tried to write op-eds and maybe even Peter and I collaborated recently on a book that's just on its way to press now okay so it should have come out this fall about how to have conversations with people you don't agree with okay so that's what you were that's what you were working on that's not I mean I know Peter has his manual for creating atheists and you know I've just I just bought your book yesterday so I haven't had a chance to look at it yeah but but you were you were looking at so you were you're part of the atheist movement but you're also looking at having good conversations sure exactly all along and as far as being part of the atheist movement goes you know getting interested in the social justice stuff I feel like the atheist movement served as kind of a social test bed because it was bent very liberal or very left really and progressive it also being that it was kind of standing up to or trying to fight against or however you want to phrase it religion it has that sort of postmodern deconstruction built right into it yeah and I always felt like there were two atheist movements kind of running in parallel you had the rationalists Sam Harris for example being kind of its avatar and then you add the the social justice people who were mad at the church for having the wrong attitude about gays and women and I always felt like they were running in parallel and I feel like the social justice crowd ultimately ate the atheist movement from within and more or less undermined it and destroyed it and did so trying to achieve their moral mission but also you know for their own fun and profit and so like they wanted the speaking gigs they wanted the recognition etc and so the book that I wrote which was called everybody's wrong about God and I wrote that in 2014 and 15 and it came out December 2015 was really the inspiration was I was trying to answer my question why do people what do people mean when they say God when they believe and you know from a position that assumes none of the religious architecture no theology what does this word word mean from a purely materialist standpoint and then I was trying to answer that question and I was also trying to figure out how the atheist movement had becomes I thought the religious people saying it was like its own little religion were right I was like how did this happen how did it become how did something that's by definition supposed to be non-religious become blatantly religious and I started looking into you know how how organizations form and groups take on ideologies and so on and then I got really invested in that and Peter called me one day on the phone and he says I'm going crazy I think I've lost my mind I think the the the canon of knowledge and gender studies and feminism etc I think it works like the Bible for these regressive leftists and I think it's like revealed wisdom and I can't convince anybody what do you think and I was like well as you know I'm working on this book and I think it fits I mean you've just like plugged a big puzzle piece in but at the same time we're watching Sam Harris Richard Dawkins and all these guys that were kind of like the pinnacle of our our movement if you will just getting railroaded by these social justice people and you're getting accused of sexism they're being accused of misogyny they're being accused of you know hidden racist things and with Sam working so much with Islam openly being accused of being a racist and Islamophobic and everything else and none of it made sense so that's what turned our attention to looking at the scholarly canon in in feminism and gender studies women's studies race studies and so on and saying you know something's going on there these people don't talk like normal people anymore they aren't using the words the same way and it's kind of you know for us looking at it from the perspective where we'd studied religion for so long there were deep parallels there you know religious people use certain words in ways that are that makes sense with it like grace makes sense within the cons the construct of religion in a way that parallels but isn't identical to its common parlance usage that's right and so there's very specialized usages of these terms and then there's a lot of communication breakdown that happens when people don't understand that there's that that broken link like you say X and I hear you say it and I know what that word means but you meant something a little different than what I'm hearing so I come back and I say this and we just start cross-talking instead of direct talking and so we saw this was happening but it was being very successfully used to railroad kind of thoughtful people whatever you think of their metaphysics or their ideas about the universe these are certainly not bigots these are certainly not people trying to cause harm and damage and they're just and railroading is the only way to describe it getting pushed off of stages having conferences shut down I mean Richard Dawkins got accused to some kind of sexist thing for tweeting some video in the upper or was they canceled his sent his attendance to some conference and the upper got so vicious the stress caused him to have a stroke and he almost died I mean this is like serious serious like levels of accusation and and bullying so we're like okay what do we do well we were looking at new peer review or real peer review I should say and then we were looking at the feminist glacier paper that came out in early 2016 and made headlines that people just couldn't believe it and Peter suggested to me one day is like they're ready for Alan Sokol style hoaxing let's do it and so we started trying and it didn't work real well and so we very quickly decided we needed to understand the theory to do it better so we called in Helen who has her background is in studying literature in the late medieval and early modern period and she actually was studying how women in those periods used religious narratives to fight for their own autonomy and if you're gonna talk about women and you're gonna work in the humanities guess what they're gonna make you do and so she had to learn a ton of this postmodern theory and she had to learn a ton of this feminist theory so that gave she became kind of our Oracle or Rosetta Stone and so that's how we all kind of glommed together and early on we also just not to leave him out Mike Naina like I mentioned is doing a documentary about us and he's tracking stuff on his YouTube channel which is YouTube slash Mike Naina and a YNA and he pretty early on through a kind of weird friend of a friend and it just we kind of bumbled into the idea of maybe we could have a documentary about this we end up talking to this guy turns out he's looking at he was working pretty on the left he was interested you know what's going on I go to these protests as a journalist with a camera you know he was the camera guy he goes these protests and they used to be like policy protests or event protests and now it's like they're protesting patriarchy they're protesting the existence of conservatives they're they're they're protesting like ambiguous big ideas and he said these things are prayer rallies but not in the form you'd usually see them they're they're they're not protests or rallies and they have this there's chanting there's you know this whole set of things you're supposed to say and how to say it he's like this has a very prayer vibe to it so he was looking at campus a mutual friend of ours said you know to him you guys are you're looking at campus and want to figure out what's going on well I know these guys that write about it and they're doing I'm not supposed to tell anybody but they're doing a thing you might want to document so we end up getting in touch with him and then he starts telling us like all his observations and working all that in so that's sort of how the four of us really Helen Peter and I were the ones who wrote papers but you know Mike was was integrally involved all along that's how we kind of ended up you know becoming this rag tag motley crew teenage ninja turtle something that doesn't I don't know how it's it's very bizarre and we hatched a little conspiracy yeah that's fascinating you know when you when you talked about I hadn't you know I I'm a pastor I've never spent a lot of time so there's this you know in the in the church there's kind of this tiny little group over there that does apologetics and really gets into debating atheists I mean I'm a pastor I don't they always kind of know what's going on but you don't spend a lot of time yeah and I it was in the it was in the mid you know it was is 2014 2015 I'm looking around and I was from kind of the the the left side of the Christian Reformed Church which is a conservative Dutch Reformed denomination and this this eat and and I grew up my father was a pastor in what's probably best described as a racial reconciliation church I grew up in the 60s and 70s in Patterson New Jersey Martin Luther King jr. was my hero you know roots was the show that you know that I mean that was actually last night I was watching this doc the CNN documentary on the 70s about television in the 70s and I was looking at Arch you know they had clips from Archie bunker and they had clips from the Jefferson I mean this was what I grew up in yeah and and then we got into 2014 I began listening to some of these things and I'm thinking there's a there's a divergent happen divergence happening here within the church we're used to I mean a lot of people don't recognize it but churches are are used to managing change because theological conversations are essentially trying to figure out how can you change your system without breaking canon because technology changes new things come and and so you have to you have to figure out okay how can we manage change and so we've the Christian Reformed Church at the end of the 20th century fought a long bloody war about whether or not women should be allowed into church offices and then you know about this time it's on the horizon that you know the LGBT issues were coming on the horizon white privilege begins to get bandied about right white privilege turns into white supremacy and I remember in the 80s one of my seminary professor saying you know if you if you start calling if you start calling everyone a Nazi pretty soon you don't you don't have that word to distinguish real Nazis from you know other kinds of folks and so his admonition at that point was you know care for the language because it's an important tool that you can use for nuance and distinguishing subtleties that are really very important even if in the heat of a political moment everything gets trampled and I had no idea of these kind of two streams within atheism and when you said you know eating for eating it from within this has been in some ways happening in Christian denominations all across the board and and often you know often to the death to the death of the church because denominations I mean when it when a church basically becomes you know for a long time in a lot of places mostly where you live I've never lived in the southeast I grew up in the New York area now I'm living on you know the I've always lived in blue states and I've always been comfortable in them because I've always vote Democratic and I'll give you lots of comments on that now but I said that again but I mean that's who I was and and so then I'm watching this happening and I'm thinking something is new here and the more I'd listen to them talk you know owning my privilege and again so this is a Dutch Calvinist denomination and I'm thinking you know this isn't a lot different from being a Calvinist and embracing total depravity as a pastor I noticed you know it's a funny dynamic that happens mentally once you say well I'm totally depraved just kind of verbally owning it gives you a pass on on actually figuring out what that means in the details of your life because and it's well I'm gonna own my privilege therefore anything else I say certainly must be true and right and above criticism and so I'm watching these dynamics and I'm thinking I know this stuff this is this is religion I've I'm a third-generation minister so we've always worked religious conversations and I'm listening to this thing develop and I'm thinking this is really interesting and then when your hoax papers came out I thought I'm not surprised at all by this and then I watched you and you and your partners all four of you did this did this forum I think it was probably at Peter's school yeah it was a fairly long video and I watched that whole thing a few times because I was actually gonna make a video on it but then my sister died and I that whole thing got derailed but and I heard you talk about this is kind of like Calvinism and I thought yeah it is I'm glad you brought up the total depravity I mean it's very very uncanny how similar it is to that to the idea that so so the idea is actually that and I don't I don't want to mislead anybody like I'm this expert in Calvinist theology because I'm certainly not but the idea that you know if I understand total depravity correctly it's that we can't be called to God because we are inherently invested in our own sin and so you have the same idea that you can't you the way that the privilege narrative operates in this stuff that we've kind of called either grievance studies or applied postmodernism is that privilege is always whether explicitly or subconsciously trying to legitimize and it is trying to reestablish itself and maintain its dominance so if you can take on the the bite that within this kind of new faith that seems to be growing that privilege is you know a type of congenital or original sin that dominant or powerful individuals are stuck with then the total depravity metaphor given that the the assumption about power in postmodernism is that power always works to maintain itself and so you can see the same thing it's you know getting rid of your you know absolving yourself of your privilege would be the ideal goal and you can't because you're invested in it from a fundamental level that's just impossible to overcome and so what is there to do hair shirts hair shirts and ashes and you know it's not pretty it's not pretty I had a really interesting conversation with a pastor of a not Calvinist church not that long ago and he actually you know I'll even use his phrasing he said that he's his feeling is that this kind of intersectional he doesn't really know what's going on closely with the social justice stuff but he said you know he's actually positioned somewhat to the left of his own church and he's quite progressive and everything as well and his feeling is that the social justice thing whatever is going on he called it Satanic and I would you know I said okay elaborate on that because I've got my ideas of what he means when he says Satanic and he says well what you have is you have a they're pursuing justice without mercy justice must come with mercy and they're pursuing knowledge in a way that enables and encourages as our papers showed self-deception and so if Satan is the great deceiver they have self-deception and an utter lack of mercy at the heart of their of their their program and so it's not coming from a place of love and it's not coming from a place where justice is tempered by mercy and balanced by it so it's not just justice in the sense of being you know the kind of justice that would be just and so he said that that's the mark from his theology of something being Satanic whatever you want to take Satanic to mean and so we had a really fascinating conversation about that and I don't know if it's that this is just a severe view or if that there's no avenue because you know within theology you have grace so you have this you know supremely powerful thing if you will force that can come in and counteract something that I know in the Calvinist theology it doesn't work that way but they can counteract something that's even depravity where you are invested in If you don't go to total depravity it works out okay grace can serve as the thing that intervenes upon that and can remind you of mercy and love and the other components but when you try to come at this purely from a material perspective and you see privilege and you see injustice social injustice and you see structural inequality what is there if you don't believe that there's something like grace that can come in and intercede and say okay this person is shown contrition this person really is you know woke or an ally or whatever the phrasing is so you know we don't have to bandy on about his privilege any longer if you don't have that what what have you got and so this guy was it was saying that you know it's deception you have somebody not somebody would be with Satan so you have this idea that you can you can confuse yourself with the false path to knowledge that's not motivated through love it comes from this position of claiming to want to help people but it's not it's not willing to be humble and it doesn't doesn't integrate mercy love and these kinds of things I found this to be a profound conversation and I don't have to I'm glad I wrote my book because I don't have to like argue with his mythology or whatever I want to call it about satanic or whatever it's like I can immediately appreciate what he's trying to say and I think it's I think he taps into something I don't know if it'll humans are humans right so I don't know if this social justice thing if allowed to run longer would start to develop you know a pathway to grace or salvation of some kind probably not metaphysical but at least worldly you know acceptance but so far it's pretty grim and it looks like the result is that it destroys itself from within because everybody becomes problematic eventually yeah yeah there was a I'll share the screen David Brooks brought this piece up in in one of his one of his articles by Wilfred McKay McClay the strange persistence of guilt in the hedgehog review I'll put it in the notes of this show you might want to take a look at it oh yeah it's because it gets into this because the difficulty that you have is that so here's so okay I'm gonna nuance so some of theologians so we play with this stuff I'm gonna nuance your idea about total depravity a little bit so please total there's two aspects of total depravity one is total not in the sense is that I'm as bad as I could be but more that every area of my life is tainted with sin now of course when you do theological conversations you always recognize I'm speaking from the Dutch Calvinist tradition which is different from the English Calvinist you know this gets hopelessly complex as you move through time so so total depravity means that I'm not as bad as I could be but every area of my life is tainted by is tainted by sin and limitation and so so that's one aspect the other aspect is that we are and this comes out of Augustine we are dead in our sins and so we in fact need regeneration we need a power from outside of us to come in now now here's here's this little trick that happens and which I noticed because I heard you know I heard white privilege and I grew up so again we were in Patterson New Jersey and we had some Dutch Calvinists who were part of our tradition our church but most of the folks were black folks and you grow up in a situation like that I mean it's patently obvious that yes the the playing field is terribly uneven it's terribly uneven by virtue of history and again I'm growing up in the 60s and 70s outside of New York folks who are worshiping in in the black ghetto want to visit some of their friends who drive into the black ghetto every Sunday for church but they drive out to go to their house and they get pulled over by the cops in a place like North Hale to New Jersey which is a mile and a half from where they're living because you know New Jersey's this patchwork of little ghettos when I was growing up and so you know that no it is there is there is a thing called white privilege however and this is where it gets to be like total depravity I just because I can recognize that there are advantages that I have by virtue of the color of my skin in certain contextual situations doesn't mean that this affords me secret knowledge yes yes and and that's kind of the trick and so what what happens and see see it so I grew up in Patterson and I lived in Grand Rapids Michigan kind of the hub of our denomination and then I was a missionary overseas now suddenly tables are reversed and I see what racism looks like in the Dominican Republic Dominicans and Haitians and Americans and so I was very used to looking at racism you go into another context you begin to realize racism is racism is a given but the manifestations of racism are particular to every different context okay so so then I'm listening to people say things like well you can't speak because you're white but they're talking to me and they're white and I'm thinking now how exactly does this work because if if you actually believed you couldn't have knowledge because you're white then you Oh but I'm allying okay so and and so you begin to track this thing down well what about the black conservatives well well they've just you know I forget the language that they have you know it better than I do they've they basically absorb the white supremacy and they are now vocalizing it's like no wait a minute we're not really pretty quickly when you start playing this race game you realize that it becomes in religious terms a confessional game and so we really are back really to thought tribes and not honestly racial tribes but one of the things that McClay brought up in his piece here which David Brooks had brought up in the piece that referenced it in in the Times was that at some point within this new religion I have a variety of names for this religion one of my names is progressive liberationism because the goal is liberation and it's a again it's a progressivistic religion so in this progressive liberationism there is no redemption that there there is no way to finally be to have your sin your original sin see in Christianity you have powerful you know you have powerful strikes against you especially in Calvinism you're there's there's original sin there's even in some tribes original guilt which is a little bit different from original sin and these are these are big big deals and big big strikes against you but there is the the the god of creation is also the god of redemption and so within this narrative though you are born white there is salvation and and what McClay goes into is that well let's let's imagine that you're a person born of white privilege here in the white supremacist United States and you've made use of all of the benefits of modernity that are destroying the world through co2 and all of your avaricious consumption the point that this guy makes is how will you atone for this the only in a sense the only way to if you really want to stop your carbon footprint I guess it's suicide there's really no way to get out of this plus and this is one of the things that I've been dealing with as I've been working through all the Jordan Peterson stuff there's a there's a utopianism that comes into this yep but but as but as you noted no one is pure enough for this utopianism is and the more I look at so I was also I also have my degree in history and and you look at some let's say the utopian movements of the 19th century they're fascinating because there's some similarities here to one degree or another and this is of course one of things that Jordan Peterson brings in in the 20th century with both both Nazism and then communism in a sense if you want to bring if you want to bring heaven on earth you must also bring hell on earth because and this is what let's say happened Timothy Snyder wrote a terrific book that you don't want to read if you're given to depression called bloodlands about basically the land between Hitler and Stalin in the 30s and 40s I mean first first Stalin comes and then Hitler comes and then Stalin comes back I mean these poor people just had it was just a disaster but you know everyone's trying to build a utopia well how are you going to build a retopia when people are beyond redemption there's no purity sufficient to warrant their continued existence it's going to get ugly and at least in Jordan Peterson's words you know this this stuff can flip fast and yeah you know I so then listening to you guys because I knew Peter Boghossian in some of his work because of the book that he had written right I'm listening to you guys and I'm thinking now this is really interesting because here from a religious point of view I'm watching this and saying this is not a good thing and at least on the Christian side of the line it is it is taking on the mantle of Christianity it is saying this is what true Christianity is and I'm thinking Christianity has been around for a long time and I really don't think you're making your case so then I gave it a new name because I wanted to distinguish it from Christianity then I watch you guys the atheists and I'm thinking well that's really interesting and so so what has well how has this affected your life I mean you're not making I mean unlike Peter who is now in hot water and of course Jordan Peterson has been in hot water and you know Brett Weinstein I just saw a video released today I haven't seen a chance to a chance to watch it yet by Mike probably made that yeah I mean so he's in hot water and so in a sense and what was also interesting to me is that and to a certain degree I forget one guy was you know in a sense the of course the universities grew out of the church in the late Middle Ages and so there's been a deep tie George Marsden a historian from my tradition has written a fair amount about you know then in the 19th and 20th centuries you know the church and the universities kind of went like this yeah there's a there's a churchy aspect that remains in universities there the teachers are called professors and I sometimes remind people that and say did you ever ask yourself what they're supposed to be professing because they're basically it's a confessional language so so now you see these you see this happening in the university and of course Jonathan Jonathan Haidt is out there and Jonathan Haidt's focus seems to be we're gonna lose science and that obviously is something that Jordan Peterson was looking into but now Peter Boghossian his I didn't know what his degree was in he teaches philosophy right and now he's in trouble he probably never had to do a this style social science research paper in his life and and it's the review board that takes him up yeah it's it's got technicality written all over it I mean my feeling is of course these boards exist for a reason they should probably do an investigation and when they're gonna decide things and what they decide should be very telling whether for good or for bad and it should probably initiate more conversations than anything but it does have technicality written all over it it has it has this this feeling like the hot water is being poured on him on purpose kind of feeling to it so yeah it's a it's not a pretty sight so early on you said you know you talked about you know to produce and legitimize knowledge and so for me now my tradition isn't really anti science I come out of Calvin College which has always tried to keep the two hold the two books together to right right right deny evolution you know to not go that way to try and continue in our system to look at the two books the book of Rev the book of the book of the Bible which is read special revelation and general revelation and has how has this made you think about or maybe has this made you think about the ways in which even scientific knowledge requires presuppositions so less than you probably think like I said I spent a bit of time studying philosophy of science before I got into all of this stuff and so I'm pretty comfortable with the idea that there are some some presuppositions that underlie science that are necessary I generally would say that and I could deploy you know complicated arguments or whatever that they do justify science as being a worthy method of producing provisional knowledge and that's one of the points that gets lost in all of this is all scientific knowledge is provisional by definition and that's why it works is because when we come up with better knowledge a better idea then it supplants the worst idea we can update our theories we can update our models but what I see here is much more troubling what I see here is that for various reasons that I don't claim to fully understand we have thing we have something that's distinctly not science that is getting to pass as though it is science in Sweden some of the stuff that we call gender studies or much of it it's called gender sociology when you look at work like what Robin de Angelo does who's in the video you mentioned that you haven't had a chance to watch yet that Mike just put out Robin de Angelo is the one responsible for the idea of white fragility these are sociological concepts now sociology of course is a messy difficult science because the parameter space is gigantic and it's very very complicated to understand what's going on with something as complex as societies filled with individual agents which are themselves enormously complex at the psychological level and then you can just rattle it all the way down to atoms if you want to and it just gets worse so it's difficult but there is a such a thing as sociological rigor and when you can draw when you start allowing people working within the humanities to draw sociological conclusions without demanding that they apply sociological rigor now you've got a problem and as our papers aimed to show certainly presuppositions are exactly what you know we were putting forth presuppositions as the conclusion and then working massaging the literature that exists to to conclude what we initially just wanted to say and so that's really I'm you know I'm friends with a number of scientists the harder the science the less likely you are to be able to pull that off I talked with a physicist for example who told me that if we tried to do something similar in their field our review would have we would have had the reviewers come back to us and give us nearly incomprehensible things like you used this statistical method but you didn't use these other ones and these are more robust in this situation because and they tell you that because and and I didn't even understand what he said and so the idea there is that there's a lot of rigor going into being able to draw those conclusions and then when we came public and we said the sociology has a problem which a recent paper by somebody Horowitz has showed that there is there is a problem in sociology along these lines but we said sociology has a problem and the sociologists went berserk you didn't show sociology has a problem with your paper sociology rejected your papers so that indicates that there is a level of rigor there that is missing from these humanities journals which are neither doing humanities because what they're doing is not serving the study of the humanities or even humans it's just the promulgation of their own ideology in new and more varied and often kind of a one-upmanship paradigm kind of way and then they're also not doing sociology because they aren't using any rigor when we had one of our papers that the peer reviewers indicated to us that what we should do is take out the quantitative data in the statistical analysis a because it was difficult for them to comprehend the statistics which were freshman introductory course level any social scientists would know those statistics every social scientist has to know those statistics it wasn't complicated stuff I don't remember statistics that well I had to make up what I know and so secondly they said that they preferred the qualitative narrative side for drawing their conclusions they preferred the special revelation of you know the under privileged voice or whatever it is who's believed to be giving the insightful knowledge who has special access to knowledge at that point you're not doing humanities you're not doing social science you're just doing something impoverished in between but through some process that Brett Weinstein actually called ideal laundering this goes through their peer review system and it comes out the other side not only legitimately treated as though it's knowledge and applied in various contexts especially in education this stuff carries the imprimatur of being sociology almost everybody I've talked to you know in an interview format at some point slips and calls these stuff sociology it's just a natural slip why because we consider it to be sociology you're talking about sociological concepts the drawing conclusions that's so in this case I see presuppositions being overwhelmingly the problem but I don't see what these people are doing as science so that's there's a two separate conversations and we can have either or both at various points but I don't see this stuff as reflective of what's going on in science at all because this is people being allowed to pretend to do science is it is it in some sense the the sociological version of creation science in that well here's the here's the outcome we're looking to get at so let's let's fill I don't mean to be disparaging no I'm sure scientists but I needed that I needed that that's exactly what it is I probably shouldn't give that to you but you know in terms of our other fights we'll cite you we'll cite you or we won't if you don't want us to we have this whole world now where nobody wants that they tell us stuff and they don't want to be associated with it just in case they get burned or something no no you so we place for people with little to lose and I'm of an age and in a place where it's and the way see one of the things that interests me too is that you know I look at say Peter Boghossian and I've been watching the videos where now suddenly he's in hot water and of course a couple of years ago Jordan Peterson you know was in hot water and I'm thinking this you know I'm so used to this in the religious context because again what what you tend to have then are these confessional camps so if there's a guy in Toronto named John Sook who was a very high status Christian Reformed pastor who basically came to doubt and want you know was flipping on some progressive boundary markers and so left the Christian Reformed Church and then joined the United Church of Canada and and so at least within religion you have a whole diversity of camps that if at some point you decide I knew a guy was in a conservative Presbyterian denomination where they didn't believe in miracles or signs of wonders and he's praying one one day and he finds himself speaking in tongues and I was like oh I'm in trouble with my tribe so then he had to switch to a conservative reform denomination that didn't have a problem with that and so you know with within religious communities there's been a way of managing these things but but in a sense within kind of the Rupert Sheldrake made a comment about yeah we've got a separation between church and state but we don't have a separation between science and state and in a sense when science is kind of a monolithic religious structure well right now science is having a civil war and this one faction is you know if you listen to Jordan Peterson or Jonathan Haidt this one faction is threatening the the temple because it's a coup from within it is a coup from from sort of at the bottom on one wing and it's seeming to like knock a some pretty important supports out so yeah it's it's a it's a real issue and you know you we talk I like I'm just stuck on that creationist thing because we talk about like the blank slate ideology that underlies a lot of this as being kind of like the psychological version of creationism right but to think of the idea that society is organized in continually self legitimizing and perpetuating power dynamics is sociological creationism and that particular concept I mean you've just you hooked me I'm like whoa that's a big one so I'm really really excited I've not thought that before I'm really really excited about that I do see though that that what you have here is a is there's blatant attempt an open attempt to remake science to insist that science is sexist whether it's sexist in terms of how it's done sexist was in terms of what kind of conclusions it draws I mean you can look back to the feminists in the 90s and before saying things like Sandra Harding said that and then sort of in the 80s actually I'm sorry Sandra Harding saying that Newton's Principia Mathematica is a rape manual and he was raping nature feminine nature you have loose Irigaray saying stuff like you know we privilege rectilinear motion which is masculine and we downplay fluid dynamics which is feminism or feminist feminine feminine I'm having a hard time here and because I'm trying to remember she also said something about equals MC squared being a sexed equation because it privileges the speed of light above all other speed by giving us much status and you see this shit and it's just it's just unbelievable but to this very day you still see I just shared on Twitter yesterday an article talking about some kind of like diversity initiative at Fermilab and there's this constant thing so there's is it the science itself is sexist is it that science bakes in sexist assumptions these are like the same kinds of as an atheist who you know fought on the behalf of science against creationists in particular living in the southeast it's very similar to what we saw there where you know all well science is just you know exclusionary of our revelation and the cooks the books in its own favor and it doesn't it doesn't admit certain kinds of knowledge and all this same kind of stuffs going on here but then you also have this idea like that science doesn't and hasn't and still can't employ enough women therefore there's some idea that you know female science isn't being done to a sufficient level and there's sexist exclusion and blah blah blah but when you think about the principle of universality in science whether you accept this or not but you just let's let's go into it and take it as a granted element of science anybody who does the experiment if it's finding out something true about the world will get the same result anybody it could be a robot it could be a dog it could be you it could be a woman it could be anybody gets the same should get the same result that's universality in science then it shouldn't matter if there any women scientists it shouldn't matter if there any men scientists it shouldn't matter if every dog every scientist is a dog the results you know are so baked in is this assumption that there's some kind of inherent power dynamic by excluding too many women or making women uncomfortable and it's that it's somehow unfair and you see these this initiative to polarize our science around matters of identity being very very effectively put forward and if it's happening at Fermilab which is a physics lab it's happening in every you can't get a hard enough science to say it's not happening here one of our papers was about saying that we needed a feminist astronomy that was built out of queer astrology yeah and so one of the peer reviewers wrote back to us that they're very sympathetic to our aims they thought our paper needed a lot of tightening up on the research level in the writing but they like our aims and they said that said something very close to to paraphrase it we've had great inroads into the social science soft sciences like social science and biology and we have not made good inroads into the hard sciences so we're looking forward to driving forward into those this is an agenda and missionary zeal it is missionary zeal it is as you phrased it is an attempted coup from within and we saw what happened with the atheist movement it was like a perfect test bed then you can look at like the documentary the mini doc that Mike put out yesterday you can look at what happened at evergreen you can see how they can take over a particular institution I would say that they've gone a long way to taking over institution academic institutions overall because they have used their missionary zeal like most people would do right where are you gonna reach to make effects in the world where you can reach you're gonna reach and grab the thing right in front of you if you work in the university you're gonna do stuff at the university so they they're very in very interested in changing how we teach very interested in the curriculum and they're extraordinarily motivated to become administrators and so you have this entire administrative class that's it's heavily influenced by or filled with diversity officers inclusion I'm not saying that diversity and inclusion etc in principle are necessarily bad things here I'm saying that you have these as you would rightly call them missionaries who are working to push a moral agenda through them who are ideological agenda through them that have worked very diligently to make sure that those offices exist and push exactly what they want them to push without a whole lot of debate about it I was at a community meeting the other night and I I am in the same neighborhood as the Stefan Clark incident that happened a number of months ago and so Public Radio was doing a community meeting they wanted to get stories out of the neighborhood blah blah blah I've done a lot of work there's a lot of group homes in this neighborhood a lot of homelessness a lot of people with mental illness issues I've got a lot of that in my church I've got a lot of experience with it one of the individuals who's the one of the individuals was saying how you know well the you know we've got we've got difficulties in the in the black and Hispanic it's also an incredibly diverse neighborhood black Hispanic Asians about every population is there we've got incredible difficulty in getting these minority communities to to to deal with mental health stigma and then somebody else from the community who's African-American he was saying yeah you know when it comes to like issues of mental health stigma and issues of let's say you know LGBT stuff these the black community the Hispanic community the Asian communities they're all much more resistant to these efforts and I was listening to them and I was thinking yeah but Freud, Jung, Carl Rogers isn't this entire mental health construct white supremacist I mean if you really want to apply that you can't on one hand say oh you know there's that there's the white there's the white supremacy that's taking over and on the other hand say yeah but this whole idea of reducing stigma of of of mental illness and and the black community isn't getting with on that so in other words you need to be colonized by the the white psychologists to this and then it comes back around and I also look at people sometimes and say well I you know I just I just don't want to be downstream from the white supremacy and I think well doesn't that make the Wright brothers white supremacy every time you get on an airplane you are bearing the fruits of your supposed white supremacy and and so you begin to once you begin to actually start say okay so here's this wave that you seeing the world what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try it on and try and put your glasses on my eyes and see how much white supremacy and patriarchy I can see so therefore if you get on to an airplane well it's just white supremacist patriarchy that's you know sending you from coast to coast in four hours instead of you know using your little feet to walk so yeah this this system just doesn't work and you know so then part of me so then when I look at the at some of the other physical you know philosophical things I don't know if you listen to the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversations they were they were quite interesting because they were prickly yeah well but but also I mean part of the thing that fascinated me about Peterson right away was the question of okay so so we've got the hard sciences over here but but and and we've certainly benefited from the results of the marriage of technology and hard sciences for airplanes and sewer systems and roads and medical technology but but when you get to something like the question of mental health boy that's a complicated space what it's much more complicated so oh it's so complicated and so so what is a healthy person and so we were talking about you know California laws with respect to mental illness and California a couple of decades ago took a fairly libertarian approach where you know you're pretty much free to be crazy here and and so and then that leads to you know a variety of homelessness and a whole bunch of other things that we see so so you've got someone who's schizophrenic and and they might say well you know what you call schizophrenia I call liberation it's like okay and how then well schizophrenia is obviously a an edge case but there's there's a spectrum all along the way there and so these questions get enormously complex and part of the difficulty is that again because of the if if I would go to the the City Council and say well I think this and this and this shouldn't be true because the Bible says so well everyone in our culture would say that's illegitimate we we have a separation of religion but this this one of the people in my Jordan Peterson called it woozling how you continue to get all of these papers to agree and you know and one paper builds on the next and before you know it you bring it to the courthouse and say well this is science and therefore from science law is downstream from science in our system yep yep yep that's exactly the the problem actually that we're we're seeing you know really manifest at this point is that these I don't want to say it this way I'm going to these people have been these people but the people that have been working in these these disciplines cultural studies disciplines grievance studies really for this has been five six decades now and what you're talking about is having built up an entire canon of literature and that is very I mean we we cited one of our own papers in a later paper so you're doing your own woozling your own ourselves I think we wrote a paper about woozling ourselves but so we we see how that works and this it's like the ability to legitimize what amounts to prejudices and opinions or if you will special revelation of particular individuals or specially sanctioned groups in this case oppressed groups become specially sanctioned to generate certain knowledge then if you're going to take that as though it's something that it's general revelation as opposed to special revelation then you've got a serious problem and the that's exactly what we're seeing and it is it's a form of of legitimizing special revelation and because it comes from a place that appears to be secular rather than sectarian there's absolutely no way for us to say hey we need to apply the principles we're a secular state we see the benefits of a secular state we want to be a secular liberal state fine so we can apply that so the second you come to the courthouse and say the Bible's you know told me so they're like listen Paul go find another argument I like your idea but go find another way to justify it and so I wrote that long long essay on ario recently to say it was a postmodern religion and the faith of social justice or something was the title and the last section of it other than maybe a short conclusion I don't recall is about construing secularism more broadly but the problem is I've left open a wide wide gaping loophole that these kind of you know religious type architectures that are nevertheless secular because they haven't taken on what I call in the article of pre-modern mythology which is what we usually identify religions with the whole you know before the modern period we saw deities and so that's the pre-modern structure to it well this postmodern mythology God's dead you know there is no God in postmodern mythology so we don't have that ready ability to say oh I know what this is this is religion and religion has no place here you need a better argument and so there's this gaping hole there I know what to do about it as a on the social level right I know exactly what to do I want to convince as many people as I can that when they hear somebody say hey if you checked your privilege or this is that your privilege talking they have that same gut reaction as when they hear a Christian rock song on that they didn't think was Christian rock and like wait a minute I know what this is I didn't want to listen to this or whatever it happens to be you know I they see the street preacher proselytizing they know what this is I want that feeling to come along with this same like really rabid social justice activism but I don't know what happens when you get to the legal level because if you walk into the courthouse you are at a disadvantage if you will because you can't and this is a thing that personally you're at a disadvantage because you can't use your religious argument to justify what you want so you have to find some other argument where societally we say okay this does generate an advantage because that way whatever groups are dominant they don't get to just make the rules for everybody else so here we have these so-called secular religion things that have this kind of bogus exemption to that because and it is it's a technicality because they're using a different way to they're using a fundamentally different mythological structure underneath instead of deities and you know whatever Buddhism doesn't really have deities directly some Buddhism doesn't some doesn't it gets icky but you know we know what religions look like when we we've called them religions we know what to do with that but then when you have this mythology that society is made out of structural power dynamics that are always trying to justify themselves and there's your creationist thing there and the humans are blank slates who are entirely written upon by their socialization there's another creation when you have this mythology over here that that that plays out entirely in a material way we don't know what to do with it and secularism is is the answer but we don't know how to figure out how to win and how and when to apply it so I think that that's a that's a big point and a huge thing that we're going to have to figure out a tackle in the next maybe 20 years well and behind all of this is the question of how do we know what is good because again if you I find not enough historians in this conversation because part of the difficulty that people have well part of also what this has done is harrow history as well because it's a real easy way to delegitimize anything that can we can learn about humanity yes we can't accept that because they were slaveholders yes exactly that because they believed in the sky daddy so exactly exactly you you know again it gets it gets 1984 ish awfully quickly but I can yeah but again be beneath this and this again is where I think the the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversations if you if you get if you kind of get beyond the whole tribal blood sport aspect of it which is in my opinion really rather dull yeah that's just two tribes disagreeing okay well tribes always disagree and via sociology we know that tribes have good reasons to disagree completely apart from whatever it is they're actually talking about those are those are human psychological sociological dynamics we know that yes but if you get onto the question of it you have the question of how do we know the good yes which is not different from how do we know what is healthy and so in a sense what has you know in a sense what happened in terms of our history as we began to say okay we're not we're gonna avoid religious we're gonna avoid sectarian war by in a sense saying religions are things that that trade-off ancient mythologies we're gonna set to all them over there and so we're gonna use science instead and now you have the question which is a very difficult one can science say what is good now if we say well we would really like to get from New York to San Francisco and in just a few hours instead of a few weeks that's good well but there are always other things that are connected to everything that's built into that and so which of course we found with no DDT is good look you can there's a great youtuber a guy sprinkles isn't on his porch and eats it in front of the the African natives and they look at him and they're like this guy don't have it all you know so you know there are deep deep questions beneath this conversation that have been stalking a lot of the other conversations that we've been having and so for me this is again another good time to say all right well we're gonna have to and I'm really happy to hear you know where we started this conversation we're gonna have to have important conversations between people of different tribes oh yeah I think those those skills we need yes we're at a moment where I think what's definitely both becoming a growing interest in people but a growing necessity is Mike and I talk about it a lot we phrase it as uniting tribes to start reaching across we have all these bubbles and the internet creates such an ability to do kind of like ideological feudalism and it's very difficult to reach across these and to speak to one another and I think that that's exactly you know what we need to do I do like for example from Jordan Peterson's approach to things the way that he likes to draw upon whatever his his religious or metaphysical commitments may or may not be he likes to draw upon wisdom right so I used to play when I was a teenager I don't know if I should tell you this as a pastor I used to play Dungeons and Dragons so did I oh no but there's a reason that the intelligence and the wisdom categories you know I thought about this way too deeply as a teenager but there's a serious difference between intelligence and wisdom and there are there's a reason why those are two different categories with two different scores with two different sets of consequences depending on how you what happens in the game when you play so I feel like we're at this weird place and if you look at kind of what they call the intellectual dark web for example I feel like so much the conversation boils down to that same argument I had with myself when I was 15 about the differences between until intelligence and wisdom you know knowledge and then I don't wisdom I don't know another word for it I always think at this time of like Daniel Kahneman's thinking fast and slow or Joshua Green's moral tribes and you start talking about the automatic mode which is very intuitive and it's very quick and it's the way we have to interact with human beings because otherwise everything's too slow and clunky and then you have the manual mode that's very very you know precise and you get exactly right and but it takes a long time and it doesn't serve us in 90% of our situations and so wisdom seems to fall in mostly into that automatic mode and then intelligence falls into that manual mode and the slow thinking is intelligence and then the fast thinking is wisdom and you really do need to and draw across from both to inform one another and in particular to know when to use which yeah and so I feel like there's we're at a crossroads right now where that conversation if you want to like whittle it all down to its barest like what's going on here philosophically abstract parts it's that it's the the intelligence versus wisdom intuition versus you know methodological careful thought etc that that's where it's kind of the conceptual battleground of the moment is and we have a real problem still with people not doing a good job of listening to one another across those those lines or being able to articulate that that discussion well I so I think that that's where we're headed is to have that that conversation and if you and if you can't talk with the heretics well what you've you've taken most of the good options off the table well what are you going to do with the heretics are you going to put them in camps are you going to shut up your ears are you going to I mean that's again that's where when we try to bring heaven down we usually bring hell up yeah yeah yeah because now suddenly you have to purify and kind of the way people work finally the only pure one is me and never goes well yeah funny how well I'm gonna I'm gonna end the recording and because I know you've got a hard quit time I do yeah I've got 40 minutes so I've got an appointment and when that person will show up is unclear so okay but but before before I turn off the recording I do want to just thank you for oh thank you you'll have this conversation and you can talk to a religious guy I like religious guys if I didn't like religious guys I wouldn't have any friends southeast what are you talking about now all my friends it's really funny because you know I'm a liberal atheist here in the south and so like all of my friends are not just conservatives but mostly like super conservative and then all my almost all of my friends are Christian just don't know that many other people there aren't that many to know around here and it's fine that it's like a good way to practice for both parts in the relationship the old wisdom of Thomas Jefferson you know don't let matters of religion or politics or philosophy come between friends there are other things in life and relationship is one of them and communication is one of them and sharing and wisdom is one of them and you lose a lot like you were just saying if you decide to you know well you think differently than I do or your metaphysical commitments are different or your politics are different or you think we should like I know there are a lot of emotions that run with it but I mean for most people on a day-to-day basis something like the issue of immigration which is very hot right now plays very little role in their day-to-day lives they don't have like I don't have to go over to my neighbor and hate him because he thinks something I think is stupid about immigration and vice versa so it's good to kind of recalibrate to spend time with and converse with people that think differently than you are not just because of finding things that not just because of that because of being able to find what matters right which is maybe the biggest thing that we're humans were together we get a little while on this planet you know whatever comes next fine but we get a little while here we should probably try to optimize that with each other but there's also the aspect of like you know getting new ideas but as we I think it's a good high note to end on is just sharing one another's wisdom which is you know you and I have that wisdom comes from our commonalities but also from the unique perspective comes that comes with having you know a lens to the world so even this stuff like the privilege that's a lens the oppression that's a lens they say you know you hear listen and believe I don't want to listen and believe but I do want to listen and I do want to consider you know I want to I want to hear if I run into let's say it's you know because I'm white so we'll just go right there if I want to if I want to figure out what's going on in an urban neighborhood it's filled with black people that are having a bad time like you're describing with getting pulled over every time they leave the neighborhood you know how am I gonna figure that out if I'm not willing to hear that out right so the mistake is you got listen and believe is still incorrect because people misinterpret their stuff all the time but listen and consider you know if you're talking to me about God I don't have any reason to think you're crazy I have a reason to think that you're really tapping into something that I want to understand if someone's telling me about a burning in their bosom from their Mormon perspective I want to know what's going on what got them there what's happening you know I want to connect with that too if somebody's telling me that every time they drive down the street they get pulled over six times because they're driving while black you know that's something that needs to be understood so that it can be addressed in the best ways that we have to address it but just for them to say you know all this happens to me because racism for example maybe it does maybe I don't know but it's difficult to draw that conclusions you know it's it's it's listen consider don't think the person's lying on an interpersonal level it's not like to discount somebody's experience but it's it it can be seen as an information gathering and wisdom gathering and and humanity expanding effort to listen rather than you know well you don't know what it's like so shut up yeah yeah yeah no I agree I agree 100% well I'm gonna I'm gonna pause the recording now and then just get a chance to say goodbye and so I really appreciate it yeah
