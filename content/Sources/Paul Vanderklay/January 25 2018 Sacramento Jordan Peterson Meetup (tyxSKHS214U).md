 Hi, this is Paul and I wanted to make a quick announcement that on January 25, I'm going to be hosting a meetup, meetup.com, and basically if you live in Sacramento or in the area, bring your favorite Jordan Peterson clip to share and discuss. We'll just have it at my church and I've got a big screen in the sanctuary and I've got a computer hooked up to it, and so if you email me or put in the meetup comments, your favorite Jordan Peterson clip, we're in some ways going to do what I do on my videos is just throw it up on the screen, watch a few minutes of them, and if you bring a clip, just stand up and say, this is what this clip means to me, this is why I like it, or this has changed my life, and then we'll hear from each other. And right now we've got a few of us signed up, I just posted it last night, and I've met a number of you who live in Sacramento who have dropped by my church, and I've got a standing invitation to any visitors in my church, if you visit my church, I'll take you out to lunch, and that's the deal. And we can talk Jordan Peterson, we can talk whatever you want to talk because my interest is in just getting to know people. So if you're available and if you live in the Sacramento area, January 25, you can find it on meetup.com, we'll go from seven to nine, and just send in your Jordan Peterson clip and share, and if you're shy and you don't want to share or send in anything, you can just come and shake my hand, and like I said, if you, well again, I guess I should probably limit it, if you show up on a Sunday morning and say hi, I'll take you to lunch sometime. So that's my deal, and leave a comment, let me know if you can come, because I'd love to meet you.
