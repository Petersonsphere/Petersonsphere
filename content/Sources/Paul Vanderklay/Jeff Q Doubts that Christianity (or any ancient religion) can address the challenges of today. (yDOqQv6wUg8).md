 Okay, so we're recording and you and I have we've been we've been swapping emails for you got back to me pretty quickly after I got started making videos and so yeah I got I got interested in Jordan Peterson it back and well I think I ran into him back in the team through inner with the interview he did with Mel paglia okay and then I you know I noticed as he started to get more attention I was I got kind of interested in the the attention that was being paid to him yeah yeah which I think is actually part of the most one of the most interesting things is why this guy's been talking this way for 20 years suddenly it explodes yeah well I think there's something in the culture you know that that wanted to hear some some of the things that he was saying so well why don't we do I mean just because if we do share this we'll need a little bit of introduction so why don't you say a few things about yourself yeah so my name is Jeffrey Quackenbush I'm from Grand Rapids which is another point of contact between us although I'm not I'm not part of the Dutch Reformed Church although my name is Dutch but I come from from the early Dutch that came over during the 1600s really yeah yeah I think the first Quackenbush landed in something like 1680 and lived in Albany in America the old the old Amsterdamers yeah yeah so so yeah so I'm from Grand Rapids I studied linguistics at the University of Michigan and then ended up working in construction I got interested in I just I moved down to DC when I was 23 or something like that and ended up working as a carpenter for a couple years and then I got interested in the solar industry this is back when you know PV module prices were like four bucks a watt I went out to New Mexico for about a year where I learned there's a community college that had a program to teach you about solar systems so I did that and then ever since then I've been working in the solar industry so I've been I moved around I lived in California Colorado and then more recently in Boston and now I live up in New Hampshire okay well you you you're very interesting you're very interesting to me because on one hand you are one of these people that why you work you worked as a carpenter you worked in solar but you've got a lot of ideas and you have a lot of thoughts and you've learned a lot so it's always this kind of person who both works with their hands and thinks a lot it's always sort of fascinates me well yeah so I you know I considered doing the academic thing after college and I was dissuaded I just felt like there was no room for creativity in the Academy when I was an undergraduate I mean I was very interested in ideas and was you know thinking like mad through college but I just didn't see myself being able to make a career of it yeah and so I figured I had to find something else I kind of wandered around for a couple years and didn't really want to work in this just a stupid office job although I mean that's kind of what I'm doing now. There's more money there's more money if you're not the asshole that's you know doing the pumping the modules or whatever that's right you know find that out over time but I think it's a good place to start if you're gonna work in construction to actually do do the physical work and not just be you know be an engineer in the back office the whole time so so how do you get your outlet for the for the thought stuff that you like to do? Outlet in what sense? Well you write you write articles sometimes while you're talking to me I guess you listen to YouTube and mostly I just mostly I just do it in my in my on my spare time in my head. I have one friend who shares my interest I have a one of my professors from college I've become friends with who is well has been working along similar in similar areas as I have for no longer than me because he's you know 30 years older than I am so we talk a lot but beyond that that's our social circles pretty much the two of us when it comes to the kind of intellectual work that we're doing. Okay so why do you think Jordan Peterson caught fire? Well it's complex you know there's this culture war thing been going on since you know the baby boomers came of age in the 60s you know so that's been an ongoing kind of you know back and forth the economy thing for 40 50 years now. I think you know more recently I think there's been I think with the Bush election there was a sort of a sentence of a kind of a kind of hollow conservativism in the culture that failed to deliver real policy you know the policies that were being pushed during that era did were disastrous you know and at the same time you know granted you know it was very evangelicals were very influential in that movement but you know what did they produce as far as like a social coherence in the country or a sense of a new spirituality or something that you know that could bring us together on an emotional level they have nothing to offer you know outside of their narrow Balkanized communities and you know you added that that a lot of their focus is on these sort of you know narrow political things like abortion. Now whatever you think about abortion I mean is this what all of our spiritual energy should be spent on is changing one small set of laws you know when the culture clearly at least half the culture isn't on board with it. It just doesn't seem it doesn't seem like it's headed in a productive you know direction and so I think while that was going on I think the the left the people that are a little bit more liberal and dispossession felt stifled and then you know Obama was elected but what did Obama get done he had like a year to get health care some some kind of health you know very modest actually very conservative health care thing passed and some other things that while the country was in severe economic crisis and then everything he tried to do that Stonewall. So I think a lot of the sort of of the sort of leftist stuff that's been bubbling up you know kind of in the Academy for well since the 70s it has come to the forefront because I think a lot of the aspirations of people who are liberal have been stifled for you know 20 years now. That's a that that's a fascinating statement to me because in some ways in some ways liberals socially liberals have done pretty well. Well they have but they haven't done well politically and they haven't done I mean they've done well in areas that are about you know in the sort of the images that they produce in society but they haven't done well in terms of how society you know organized in politically. There's been a real disjunct there. In some ways it's like that's been the sort of the end phase of the culture war is that you know the representational side of the culture ends up as very liberal and the the actual you know where the money and and political organization is just become well it's not really conservative it's reactionary. Well some of the money. Yeah well it's nominally conservative but deeply reactionary. Yeah well and also I mean I really I'm really fascinated and I agree with what you said about this the hollow conservatism of the the W Bush administration and but also the the failure because a lot of evangelicals and you come from Grand Rapids and so I knew you know I knew a fair amount of Baptists in Grand Rapids and my mother-in-law's or my mother-in-law's family I mean they were so oh George W Bush is in the White House or a man of prayers in the White House but the evangelical church that Karl Rove really mobilized to get Bush into office what did they offer the country in terms of much of anything and I think in some ways the Frank Schaeffer a Frank Schaeffer is an interesting critter you know he was a darling of the religious right in the 80s kind of following his father's wave sort of but then completely reacted against it and so I'm really fascinated by the image that you brought up of here the evangelicals had their time in this in the on the stage and what did they do with it they fought about abortion and abortion is this you know they tried to privatize Social Security there was all you know there was a whole laundry list of you know post Reagan talking points some of which got passed but what did it what did it give us it didn't give us anything well there was all the bullshit about the war which for me I remember a week after 9-11 what was his name Rumsfeld I heard him mention Iraq and I just knew we were gonna invade Iraq and sure enough a year later and and then another ten years later and trillions of what did we accomplish nothing accomplished nothing you know I mean I guess it's a slightly better place to live there if you know now but at what cost was that really you know where all the well and you know partisan I mean Obama didn't get us out of out of Afghanistan Trump's been trying to get out of Afghanistan and just over the weekend this thing this whole thing blew up where he's gonna have the Taliban at Camp David I heard that I thought what you're gonna have a Taliban at Camp David right for 9-11 like holy cow so it's just it's just kind of crazy but and I don't yeah but but it's interesting to me it's interesting how you know so the US has sort of been in this you know it's sort of been at loggerheads culturally in this culture war and in some ways the progressives they've won some impressive victories including you know same-sex marriage abortion is a is a I don't I can't hear either side talking with any realism about abortion legislation it all gets you know right to choose versus baby murder and it's like it should be a legal issue at this point it should be legal and then you know if conservatives really want people to avoid abortion they need to fight it out as a messaging campaign morally you know have people opt in morally and then don't the last thing we want is the government dictating morals the laws are the lowest common denominator of a moral system all laws what laws are meant to accomplish is they're meant to keep the society from going completely off the rails they're not meant to be our highest aspirations they're meant to keep things from just getting completely out of control but they do have moral aspects well but you can't ask the legal system to dictate a whole system of morality and all the social structures that are supposed to support it this is one place I think that liberals get up you know that that they kind of fail and so back to Jordan Peterson I think why he's took off is he's kind of a backlash to this you know extreme liberalism thing that has kind of colonized the Academy and is you know he wants to be a counterweight to it which is good I mean I think this is the thing that liberals don't understand a lot of times that let me see if I can get my thought back here is that you can't just you know say everything's legal therefore everything's permissible therefore there's no structures in society or the only structures are you know these sort of identity these sort of identity issues that are very very simplistically defined in everybody's mind at the end of the day well in a society where I mean I think you're right in that when people look to legality as their moral compass that's already a sign that things have broken down yeah it's the lowest common denominator so we need that but it keeps the lowest common denominator from just getting too chaotic right so so if that's nice and orderly and then other things other things are supposed to kind of give us a higher order and and a sort of a better healthier outlook on life it can't all just be laws well morality morality generally speaking and I think again Peterson illustrated this morality generally speaking a vision of morality usually flows from an underlying narrative at least a shared story a shared sense of identity that a culture has and it's out of this then morality is an expression of that and part of the crisis that Western society has been in since the culture war is well what is that shared story and and where does that shared story come from and of course Jordan Peterson comes along it says well the shared story comes out of this this Judeo-Christian this Judeo- Christian tradition which this language generally speaking was sort of brought in by the by the Cold War faction and but and I think what we're seeing is that without that underlying identity or story then suddenly we're fighting about laws because laws become laws are laws have to play a role that and I think you're right here that's too much for laws to play yeah I mean the last thing I want to do is have rules to tell me every little thing I want to do I'm gonna do in my life man I hate that I hate I hate it when I'm like walking down the street and whatever I'm not supposed to do this very specific thing or you know I could use my judgment or risk my myself you know to avoid it like it you know you shouldn't be everything should be policed so so so where where should the underlying story come from or maybe you think something else that gives us that oh yeah so this is this is where we get into a real a real tangle in terms of the historical moment that we're in so I do not agree with Jordan Peterson that we that we have this Judeo-Christian heritage that underlies everything that we do up to this moment I mean I think I think if he had read more broadly he'd realize that that's a factually suspect claim so first of all you know what is the Judeo-Christian heritage I mean are we talking about you know the reference everything that's happened since the Reformation that because it you know it goes way further back than that just in terms of the Christian heritage and even further back if we talked about the Jewish heritage so that's kind of weird you know fuzzy second thing is like okay so if we say you know there's clearly this sort of cultural narrative at least since the World War two you know with Western Europe and America and Australia and New Zealand Canada you know kind of in this bundle of of you know political alliances and a lot of shared cultural back and forth right and especially with Britain and all of those but you know what do we do about like Latin America they have exactly the same history as you know America Canada Australia and do are they Western because a lot of the supposed Judeo-Christian values that he talks about a little dicier when you get south of the border you know like you know individual rights I mean yes but no you know they have all this history of political dictatorships and don't get me wrong these are I mean these cultures are older in terms of being here in America and with this colonial thing actually then the British colonies right they have a richer longer history and and you know all of these their own cultural forms and all this that share a lot but also differ a lot so are they because they're clear in fact they're in some ways I would say you know Latin America is more Christian than America's become you know in terms of adherence to going to church and having large families all these things so what about that what about Rastafarianism you know Christian iconography but Haley Solasi is you know the second coming of Christ what does that mean and then they smoke a lot of ganja and and listen to reggae music there's nothing there's there's nothing Christ like about about what culture is actually you know like it's not it's not what St. Paul imagined when he was advocating for a universal church. No you're exactly right and I love your questions. What about Russia? You know Russia is is the nexus of corruption right now in our political scene largely and and they've got another kind of weird association with with European culture but they're not quite in but they're not quite out so what do we do but so there's a there's a boundary issue first of all second of all there's there's there's strong evidence that we have an underlying Indo-European heritage in Western Europe that has nothing to do with the Semitic religions that originated in the Levant and that runs from India and China gone by now they left a long time ago but there's Tocharian is is a Indo-European language that was found in Western China like 2000 years BC or something right all the way to you know the British Isles that whole area is is you know all Indo-European peoples and if you go back and look at the Vedas and you look at Beowulf and you look at the Homeric epics they share a lot of features and then you go fast forward to the Victorian area and we have Wagner and you know the renewed interest in in fairy tales some of which probably have some Indo-European themes and the Norse religions you know all of that stuff I mean I mean even now like I read somewhere that like more than 50% of Icelanders still believe in fairies you know that's still there even the even it's not even just Indo-European too there's also a finnal you great thing in Finland and Estonia and Hungary so you know the Calaballa the the national epic of Finland was collected from folk songs folk tales that were collected in the middle of the 19th century and if you read that is nothing to do with Christianity right so there's this this this substrate of cultural feeling cultural sensibility you know stories ideas that that has been in Europe for much longer than we've seen Christianity and it continues to pop out I would claim that the Lord of the Rings is popular not because of the overriding Christian message that Tolkien quotes parts and elves and and orcs you know if it was just you know a recitation of the biblical story I don't think it would be as massively popular so these these kind of pagan elements specifically in you know European populations have a kind of a real staying power so how do you account for that you know and and and I would I would say also that it you know it's a more individualistic tradition than say like now is or Confucianism so some of the things that he wants to draw out of what he's called the Judeo-Christian tradition probably had nothing to do with the Semitic you know inheritance that's been kind of carried over on the top of of European culture so that's another problem the last problem is like I don't as an American I don't feel like I'm a European I feel like I belong to a completely separate culture I mean granted we've inherited all these things from Europe but you know I feel like the revolution was about saying great well you know we'll take what's good out of that but you know we're gonna do something else now and we're not you we're something different so so there's a question of of you know how much of all of that history is actually relevant to the lives that we're living now and it's an open question I think we're fighting a cultural war because we don't know the answer collectively well and you know there's it you know how to conceptualize it's always very interesting because people you know like claiming this Judeo-Christian identity exactly right there's there's all of my identity what there's all of this stuff there's all of this stuff that has contributed to it I mean people have these fights you know Steven Pinker was on talking to Jordan Peterson and you know well the the Enlightenment doesn't have anything to do with Christianity it's like what it grows right out of it but there are many many things that have grown into it and so in many ways history is this river and lots of stuff is coming down and you also have diversity at the other end where you know it's sort of like a tree the roots go all over the place you know they're pulling stuff from all over the place kind of comes through and then also gets people we say oh we're American what does American mean to you well then you're you're then you do a survey and you find all these different answers and then you try to conceptualize it and hone it and that's just the that's just the process of organizing thought and part of what you know America is is wrestling with is is again identity there was there was in the 20th century various there were there were various conflicts that in a sense forced the United States at least as a group to accomplish certain actions and those actions brought focus to identity you know before the US joined the First World War huge number of Americans had German ancestry and and as you know Europe was going through that war and of course Wilson was sort of sitting on the sidelines thinking about what he should do many many the Germans snuck a sub over to New York City to get supplies and was hailed as this is a wonderful thing you know so the US potentially could have been on the German side of it and history is a different thing to the other frost poem the the gift outright this is the one you recited at Kennedy's inauguration no oh let me read it yes so I think that this in some ways this sums up I think what's what's underlying the American spirit if you will so this is a frost Robert Frost poem the land was ours before we were the lands she was our land more than a hundred years before we were her people she was ours in Massachusetts in Virginia but we were England still Colonials possessing what we still were possessed unpossessed by possessed by what we now no more possessed something we were holding made us weak until we found out that it was ourselves we were withholding from our land of living and forthwith found salvation and surrender we were we gave ourselves outright the deed of gift was many deeds of war to the land vaguely realizing West but still unstoried artless unenhanced such as she was such as she would become so I think for me I was gonna say boy read that at an inaugural today whoo-hoo these sparks anyways yeah so I think there's a so so okay one of the problems that in these kinds of discussions is that you know we tend to think about things in terms of functions so you know there's a something over here and then there's the filter or code something that transforms it into something else so there's a sort of very narrow linear entailment but what happens is is and that's great you know it's great when you can find a cause and effect in a very specific link between the two and then you can you know generalize that repeat it that's you know that's what science is looking for but you know under that there are these correspondences in form so things have forms and the forms are localized but then you know localities can be small or large so when we start talking about you know what's the form of a thing it you sort of narrow it down to something and then you get a whole host of a correspondences that are entailing that but then you know you start moving forward in linear time and it becomes chaos because when you start moving into that linearity you're actually looking for functions so you need you need to be able to deal in both you need to like identify a form and then you know look at what happens over time and then see how the form evolved but then realize that there's other forms later on top of it and then they're kind of all moving together and sometimes they're very coherent sometimes you're not right so you have to have this sort but the problem is a lot we get mixed up so we a lot of times you know we're trained by the culture to think of functions and then when we have to get back down to forums we get this kind of psychotic schizophrenic you know view of it where we take one side and want to fight the other but really they're both happening at the same time and we have to understand how they relate and how you know pressures being put at one and then it's relieved over here and then you know and they also think about what your goal is is it coherence is a decoherence you know what's your sensibility what part do you play in it and so far as you're interacting with all these forms and you're a subject as part of them so when we start talking about history you know we can say what's important about this moment is it that we have a Judeo-Christian heritage because we can have all these other things I mentioned and but the Judeo-Christian heritage could be the central thing that is is leading sort of the the array of forms that are manifesting at that point in time and which are the thing that needs to be focused on if we want to go kind of a coherent development into the next frame or is it something else now I would contend that political identities are not the central thing that we should be focusing on they're necessary in other words we need to do policy we need a government we need a tax policy we need an economic management somebody needs to be there at the Fed setting interest rates somebody needs to be doing foreign policy all that needs to be done competently right we should expect you know competence in the political arena but what's what's causing a lot of the disarray is I think a failure to identify what this what the central this sort of the central formal impulses of the moment in other words it's there it's always there but we're not conscious of it so I get a question of you sure as a Christian I would contend that that it's not Christianity that that Christianity has largely played itself out it's been in control all this time for a long time and you know the failures have become increasingly manifest and and harder to reconcile and and also from a logistical point of view harder to like how are you gonna how you gonna unscramble the egg right so it was as a control I mean okay our formation it was the dominant you know social religious motive organization in Western Europe actually in all of Europe and you know scattered communities in the Middle East and elsewhere so what happened you know well it was years later and what happened but all of the all of the all of the all of the all of the comments that you made about the skepticism by which we can apply a Judeo-Christian filter to let's say Cold War identity and ideology all of that surely holds at least as true for Christianity in medieval Europe where in some ways it it became a very dominant it became a very dominant focus yet in let's say the East especially as it was losing to Islam other versions of Christianity also were expressed and one of that one of the strange things about Christianity is that it's it's got this capacity to re-engineer itself in radically different cultures and part of what happens in the Protestant Reformation is that the Christianity of of Germany that Martin Luther deals with versus the Christianity of England where Henry the eighth is trying to figure out what he wants to do versus the Christian of France under a monarchy versus the Christianity in in the hodgepodge that was Italy with the Papal States and I mean all of these all of these different aspects of Christianity endure and and again it's sort of like a stream where you have these different cultural areas of Europe that had been formed obviously by the the waves of people coming out of the East flowing into Europe and then the fall of the Roman Empire and then this monastic movement of Catholicism it's a it's a real it's a it's a real complex mix even then yeah which obviously launches the Reformation in which Luther says well he's trying to be Catholic and then the more the Catholic Church wants to tie him to a stake and burn him he gets more and more radical to the point of saying well Christianity is really you know the Bible plus reason has gone through my head and then of course after Luther even he and his good friend Karlstad couldn't stay on the same page and so you have Lutheranism the radical Reformation so it's that's a complex thing too. Yeah well but okay but there's a there's a point I think that that isn't captured and if you just look at the sort of the intellectual history and the social organizing and the sense of faith I think there's one thing that's missing is that that's radically changed human life in the last 250 300 years is the Industrial Revolution and globalization so we're not any longer in this you know my life is defined by my city my tribe my nation it's everybody is in the same boat and to industrialization is great but we're out running the amount of resources there are on the planet you know which could signal total civilization or even extinction for the species now Christianity has nothing to say about that nothing substantive to say about that it's not really a part of the Christian message for good historical reasons that wasn't the concern of people you know 2,000 years ago they were they were worried about getting through the day and they were worried about you know the mortification of a physical life that people experienced during you know ancient times it was it was you know life was dicey and uncertain and you died early and you got diseases and you know the the sense of like well my suffering ennobles me and brings me to heaven as long as I I believe helps it this vision that helps us all go here as a unit within our whatever our group whether it's you know Roman Empire or Christendom writ large that was a very necessary world feeling in order to to move things forward but that's not it's not the moment we're in now well I would argue now I would argue that okay so start Christianity let's say in a Jewish context with let's say the Jews huddled in Jerusalem what what was the meaning of Jesus Jesus death and resurrection and ascension according to those Jews and then you go to then you go to Paul and you have this you have this universalizing this you know at the beginning of the book of Acts the apostles ask now will you bring the kingdom to Jerusalem to Israel restore the kingdom to Israel what were those Apostles thinking they were thinking that finally this Old Testament vision of Israel being on top of the nations her imperial her imperial destiny would arrive now with Jesus and then of course it changes completely and then you have Paul who somehow this is going out through and the world's you know the world's King has come but the the transformation of the kingdom is a very different thing now when I if you read Paul I'd say well okay now we've got a vision of what Christianity is in many ways that's quite different from say what you would hear in a whole bunch of evangelical churches in America say well Christianity is the way that we go to heaven okay and when I hear that I always say well it's except for the fact that Jesus rose from the dead and the gospel of Judas was was was not accepted and now that also has filtered that Europe where this other vision takes place so whereas I would I would certainly see you know I certainly have my ideas and my own theology about what what Christianity really teaches you see within Christianity an enormous number of competing claims and visions in terms of okay what exactly is the story of the world and how does Jesus Christ actually fit in and how does that work my impression of what most people outside the church imagine Christianity is is something similar to what I thought I heard you articulate in terms of Christianity is a mechanism by which souls somehow get processed and go to a pleasant afterlife instead of an unpleasant afterlife and because what's what I think what what what's interesting and characteristic about Christianity is not just that whatever you live here then you have an afterlife there's this this interesting historical dimension to Christianity that isn't present in I don't know Buddhism or Taoism or some of these other so in other words you know well there was Eden right there was the garden and then we fell you know so now we're in in you know in the fallen world and that just sort of goes on cyclically you know for however long and then you know there's this magnificent moment when we're promised a sort of a teleological I don't know catapult into a world that will be redeemed not just I will go to the world will be redeemed to price that's right that's right that is what that's what's central I think to Christianity and I think I think the purpose of it though psychologically in its time was that find yourself in the Roman world it's it's sort of the end of the classical civilization it's very decadent you know Spengler thinks that the sort of the key the key sensibility of the classical world was a focus on the body of corporality so you know its corporality become you know orgiastic you know and and and really when that happens there's you know there's pleasures but there's also there's a lot of disgust and death and dying and you know so so given all of that you know I think and I like Spengler's kind of take on what happened here I don't know are you familiar with Oswald Spengler no oh he wrote the decline of the West in during World War one interesting I've heard the name but I've never read the book yeah so he's a very hegelian view of history but he fleshes it out with a very specific theory so his idea is that cultures great he calls some great cultures which which by this he means just literate cultures literate urban cultures starting from like Mesopotamia onward and there's like seven or eight of them and he identifies so his idea is that these cultures now granted this leaves out most of human history because there's no paleolithic there's no neolithic there's no you know what's happening on the sidelines of these great cultures but sort of within a very narrow narrow domain I think he has interesting insights so his idea is that these great cultures have a birth somewhere they're kind of mysteriously emerge out of some kind of economic social political religious ferment kind of like a star comes out of a nebula and and then they have a lifespan so they last about a thousand years or under generations or so and they go through particular phases of development if you stack them all next to each other you find that the developments are very similar as you go along kind of like a narrative but what's interesting is that each culture has a kind of a driving spirit that that makes it distinctive so the Roman the kind of Greco-Roman classical culture has a very different sensibility than than the European culture that we see a thousand years in you know kind of emerging around a thousand AD and Western Europe so his theory was that around the time of Christ you'd get what he calls the Magian culture emerging out of the eastern half but but largely in the Levant in the Roman Empire and that you know kind of kind of the Christian awakening around that time was you know the kind of the first self-consciousness about it and then you know by about 300 AD you get it you get cut taking over the Roman Empire and then by 500 the western half of the Empire is gone so it's just in the east now so so his idea would be that that there's a that that you know this culture emerges and what I'm saying is that I think the culture had these kind of needs there was something something there's a ferment going on among the peoples there you know a cultural ferment they had certain needs and that this is the sort of the sensibility that emerged now it's interesting about Spengler's view is so he tracks the Magian culture from being you know maybe kind of kind of starting to emerge around the time of the fall the Roman Republic you start to kind of see it when you know when Rome had taken over the whole area and Mesopotamia starting to die and you know the Parthians have taken over the whole old Mesopotamian area there's kind of like a lot of loose energy out there so he's starting to kind of merge at that time and what was I going with this I lost my thought yeah so so he sees the kind of emerging at that time and I lost I lost my train of thought where was I going with this well you were going you're basically talking about his his view of the the decline of the West that these cultures go through these predictable patterns yeah yeah so okay so I know what I was gonna say so the Magian culture has about a thousand year histories that goes tracks from you know around the maybe a little before the time of Christ up to you know a thousand AD when Byzantium is at its height and so is so he thinks that the Islamic Revolution in the 600s was part of the culture so so basically Muslims are part of the same culture as the early Christians even though we think you know coming from a European mindset we think of them as being East and the other actually if you go back in history he likens the the Muslims to the Christians as the Romans to Greeks and in fact if you look at the cultural chronologies they line up pretty well and they have a similar kind of imperial decadent sensibility that you see you know when they manifested in their time now obviously Islam now has become is you know far advanced from what it was when it emerged first well and Islam's Islam itself has had a number of iterations you know the Islam at the end of World War one many people thought Islam was itself just going to die and then obviously they and religions do this all the time they think seems like it's going nothing and then suddenly some some new person kind of reaches back into something in the past brings it into the contemporary area and off the thing goes again I mean you you had that in you know you had that in the United States in terms of the even the 1970s the born-again movement or Time magazine as Jimmy Carter on the on the on discover he's born again and Chuck Colson Chuck Colson goes and tells his wife I'm a Christian and then she's like what do you mean we've been going to the Episcopal Church all our lives now so you know religions are religions are they can really do a makeover pretty quick yeah so the closet look there and say how's this new okay but going back to this this point then from Spengler and then also from some of these other things we've been talking about is it's not clear to me that this sensibility that arose you know around 2000 BC with this with this sense of a historical rupture and eventual redemption I just don't see that it fits a being an American I mean I know we have this this Christian heritage but you know we also were you know we're you know British at one time so we got rid of that right okay so it doesn't mean we have to continue being Christian but it's a Grammy that is possible but at the same time you're saying the differentiation let's say between Latin America and the British colonies I mean there are obviously something happened to the in the culture of of England that was different enough from the culture of Spain and and I think I think we're right in in having a bit of skepticism about really easy really easy labels like Judeo-Christian because yeah obviously Spain comes out of Judeo-Christian Marx comes out of Judeo-Christian I mean Judeo-Christian all over the West and and everything's gonna have ties into Christianity now clearly something happened in the British you know basically with the you know so the Dutch just I don't know where the British because the Canadians as Jordan Peterson can attest are very very feel close very closely linked to the motherland you know I as an American do not I feel I mean I'm interested in British history I love British literature like I have an inheritance there but I don't feel like no it's the Americans had you know use my own purposes well back to your ancestors in the Netherlands yeah in New Amsterdam I mean one of the things I read a really interesting biography of Roger Williams not too long ago and and his the contention of that biographer was that Williams like many because you know tides were swinging in England you can if you were if you were a Catholic you were you know you were in and out and so the Netherlands was kind of this dump-off place that if you're on the outs of England you slide over to the Netherlands and including of course the pilgrims they slide over to the Netherlands and that's not quite right so off they sail and they're very commercial too what's that? They're very commercial too. That's right very commercial a lot of tolerance out of the Dutch and so you have New Amsterdam I think you know part of what happens in the Americas is you have these you know these these Puritans up in Massachusetts you have these Hollanders in the mid-Atlantic states and then you have the basically the drug-dealing Virginians the drug they're dealing of course is tobacco the drug-dealing Virginians and that whole thing and all of this stuff mixes into a very interesting new potion and then you're going to continue to have dissonance from dissonance from all over the world coming into America and that then creates a different culture which is clearly distinct from Canada it's clearly I mean one of the things that I found so interesting to Australia when I went there last last March was the you know the feeling of Australians during World War two they felt abandoned by the Brits and so then it was like you know Australia feels much more a part of America than England and if you go to Australia you can see well there's some interesting mixtures here but they're in an Asian context so you've got Asians coming in and that's adding some new things to their culture so there's a lot of moving pieces and a lot of these a lot of these plays there are but okay so but but here's I guess here's here's where for me here's where I just well first of all I've just never identified as a Christian I just I mean I realize I grew up in a very Christian town but you know my dad was an atheist and my mom was kind of into like new-agey type stuff which is where I got exposed to Jung pretty early and I read you know I read all of his number of his works and that was I know 17 or 18 so how do you read Jung? You're a smart guy but Jung is tough. I don't know I just I got interested I just started reading I read I focused on his writings on alchemy that was what I was most interested in. I read four or five books mm-hmm so I have a strong grounding I mean I haven't read that stuff for 20 years but I have a pretty strong grounding in Jung because I read him so early also I was really fascinated I mean I was fascinated with Lord of the Rings and science fiction and stuff when I was a kid I used to read you know novel on novel that type of stuff so I never I always felt the Bible was just like incredibly boring and irrelevant. I'll be honest with you you know you can tell me about it and I'll nod but I just I just have no interest. I mean I have an appreciation for history that has I've cultivated over time so I don't want to dismiss Christianity like you know like a you know an atheist like Sam Harris would you know I think there are things and we fool ourselves think that we know everything now. Oh we're still here. Can you hear me? I think my connection in a hotel so yeah hotels have crappy connections yeah so but my concern and I guess let me ask you this question do you think Christianity okay go ahead so my concern and this is something I don't want you know I don't want just a knee-jerk response but I'd be interested to hear you think about this and come back to me it's like we had these huge challenges of climate change and all these other things that I think requires a spiritual response in addition to economics and engineering all these other things but I think has to be organized around some kind of spiritual response or no people just aren't going to get on board with good solutions. What do you mean by spiritual? It needs to come from from the spirit it needs to come from within it needs to come toward it needs to be coherent and socially you know it needs to be those things if it isn't that it's just going to be surface level and and you're gonna you're gonna get all these people you know typing you know nasty little kinds it's not you know you're not gonna get like a real coordinated you know response that meets the challenge straight ahead and meets it honestly I mean that's that's what Trump is it's it's you know I don't want to take responsibility for this and no one knows what the hell's happening. The elites and in all the professions in Washington just have no fucking clue and so we're gonna elect you know all of our worst impulses to be our leader. And how's that working for us? That North Korea thing didn't we solve that already? Well we've managed not to start a nuclear war and that's a good thing. That's about what I was hoping for up to this point. But no I think there needs to be some kind of spiritual response. So my question is you know given that there are these manifest challenges we can actually identify we can put a shape around them and you know if there's gonna be a spiritual response it has to you know the way we organize ourselves unconsciously at a very deep level is around iconography. So and this is a lot of what Nissen and stuff are is there their iconography that that sort of bind us to to the feelings that are sort of emerging from the unconscious. We can let's set aside the ontological questions that that statement raises. But just in terms of a psychological analysis you know we need iconography. Now we get this personally in dreams and we get it in visions and things but you know what religion helps us to provide is it kind of drafts stuff that's happening you know collectively into a form that can be socially consumed and then kind of gives people some some some guidance as to you know some some stock forms and also some things to do if they're unsure of themselves. So we need that and it needs to meet the specific challenges that we're up against. So what does Christianity how does Christianity meet those specific problems writ large? You don't have to. That's a good question. But if you want to if you want if you want this effort that you're making to articulate the relevance of Christianity I would say answer that question in a way that I couldn't bat away. Oh I love how you put that up there. Well let me say this. So you're looking for a spiritual movement. What makes people want to participate in a spiritual movement? I don't think there's one answer to that question. I think it varies. It does vary but I'd say generally speaking people watch other people moved by a spiritual movement. And I guess it's also one of these emergent phenomena you know again that has tends to have a formal kind of a formal source so there's got to be something happening formally in the culture that has to be given a moment to kind of emerge. It's like why does one cat video become viral and why not another one? But if you look at it if you look at if you look at okay so a spiritual movement because I think I think it's fascinating that you that you make that point. It's spiritual movements tend to develop you know look at I mean look at the vast spiritual movements that have moved the world in the past. You know some are Christian you know we could others are there have been varieties of spiritual waves that have over some of what some we might imagine be positive some we might imagine to be negative. But you're right in that it's it's not just around well I guess if you if you look at the if you look at what you how you might best define iconography because icons of course are are symbols that we see through and it's it's people that are so let's look at let's look at a spiritual movement such as Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement. I mean that was probably one of the more significant spiritual movements that people can look at in relatively recent history in the United States and it's a it's a rather dramatic it's a rather dramatic thing that a good number of people moved the conscience of a nation in a relatively short time in a way away from what had been sort of standard practice in the south and within 50 years ideas about race and who we are together changed pretty dramatically and I would I would assert that at the heart of that movement were normal regular mostly black men and women willing to put their lives on the line for an idea and that changed that that changed the the hearts and minds of people and I think if you're asking say what kind of what kind of activity would spur a spiritual movement that could mobilize a nation I think that's important data and that movement never would have happened without basically the iconography the narrative and the the redemptive example of let's say the last major sermon given by Dr. King says I've been to the mountaintop I might not get there with you he takes all of this Christian all of this Christian iconography and brings it to the fore now of course there's some Gandhi in there there's some Tolstoy in there but you're asking the question where can we find a spiritual movement that might move a nation well probably look to some examples that have in the past yeah well so honestly this is this is one of the reasons I got I got excited about Jordan Pearson originally because I felt like he had he had the momentum behind being able to articulate such a thing like that's the kind of momentum you get if you can connect it to things that are that are broadly relevant and then also have not just drawing you know stories from the past but you know like new stories you know give me something new give me a new epic give me a new novel give me something you know new to organize around thing you know I felt like there was a just a small opening into the kind of public response that you could get if we had something that was more forward-looking unfortunately you know I think I think that the major well two major criticisms I have of his him is that he you know when he gets outside of his core area of you know scientific you know experimental psychology he's just he's just wildly wildly under informed and sophisticated as he thinks he is and to he's everything is backward looking you know which is fine I think we need to remember the past in ways that we aren't especially liberals but you know we also need a vision of the future we need you know a remembrance of the past and instruction from the past but also a vision of the future you can't just do one or the other you know vision of the future without any memory is like empty you know you know going just going back to the past is there's no future there's no tomorrow right well I think tomorrow is a few trying to forget I think Peterson's main goals when he found himself on top of a wave the heights of which he oh maybe but he you know to help individuals perform a little bit better so he's sort of acting as a mass clinical psychologist let's get some guys out of basements and get him into jobs and get him into relationships and patch up some yeah and that's that's kind of where he's coming from you know he's a psychologist yeah he's trying to help people like mass therapy yeah which which is fine and that's I still you know I still like him for all that but you know he clearly wants to also wander beyond that you know that specific prerogative and you know make grand pronouncements about culture and you know intellectual matters that he hasn't fully read up on and you know maybe isn't completely sophisticated about it and so on and so forth and so but I think the response that he got beyond the specific things that he had to say which some of which were very interesting and kind of needed to be said for me is what I think where I really got intrigued and I think I think there's you know if you go out on Twitter and you read the media I think people are kind of looking for it but they don't like it it's not there yet there's no one who has a package that everybody can you know can kind of you know get on board yeah I think that's I think that's true there you know it's hard to know it's it's funny when when these movements arise because there are movements that arise I you know you think you think about Billy Graham I mean that was a that was a sick come I often compared Jordan Peterson to Billy Graham Billy Graham filled stadiums and Billy Graham actually had a sense of institutions now whatever you think of Billy Graham's project you know that that was it that was a considerable movement Jordan Peterson it's he had he's had a wave I think we're going to see if he has another wave in or if basically he's you know had a nice little two to three year run and three years from now you know nobody talks about him if he if he wants to extend what he's doing he's gonna have to seek out someone who's doing something bigger and better and promote it become a platform he's gonna have to find something that that it has a actually has an original vision of the future and become an advocate for it otherwise again these you know he's gonna be limited by what he's come up with which is you know good practical psychological advice from a pretty sharp practitioner but not you know the next Hagel yeah well how how many people read Hagel when Hagel wrote I mean there's also a question oh you know I read this anecdote that that all the all the students would go to Hagel's classes and ignore Schopenhauer who was teaching at the same but but but there's also there's also a question of speed because I mean so I don't know you know I don't know it's it's almost impossible to know actually when someone writes you know what what kind of impact their their books will have long term there's often the case that someone writes and they're very popular now and then nobody listens to them other people they write and you know 50 100 200 years later suddenly their books are discovered and whoosh off it goes it's not just a matter of people you know intellectuals reading and you know a huge number of people understanding what you're right it's there you know the impact is more diffuse and it's also it's it it has to come out of multiple categories so there's got you know there's gonna be a philosophical component but there needs to be you know art that that also I mean art is how the iconography gets disseminated really that's how we get our images is through art so you know there has to be an intellectual aspect and an artistic aspect and then it has to align with forms of policy and you know the modalities of political movements and you know social practices that people are doing in their local communities all of that has to be connected into a coherent set of things that are you know moving along and in very complicated ways but kind of generally coherently moving in the same direction so you know it's not for any one person to deal with all of those but right I think you know if we're going to talk at a high level you know a small number of people can fill out the figure philosophical part and then even if nobody really understands it completely that stuff gets disseminated I mean who you said you said yourself you miss complicated but you know how drenched we are with you know ideas in the culture I mean he gets kind of dismissed in the Academy but you know name me one other intellectual who's had as much impact on the culture in the last hundred years so more impact than Mark and you would say where would you say this impact is is manifest and stories you know the whole idea of like well there's a hidden meaning behind things even some of the stuff we're seeing politically like you know you don't seem like a racist but you're really a racist in your heart you know you have this unconscious motivation that comes from this form of you that's evil you know you wouldn't have gotten that 200 years ago you would have gotten you're a witch or you know you're the villain in a Dickens story which isn't the same as being a hidden racist right that's a good point that's a good point this whole idea of like there's this this is hidden you know homunculus that can be good or evil and you know that's tagged with certain ways very it's very I mean it isn't something that you wouldn't necessarily talked about but it's very kind of like you know psychotherapy you know a lot of that stuff came out during the New Age movement in the 60s I mean that really got absorbed into the putt I mean it was kind of bubbling through intellectual circles throughout the 20s 30s 40s 50s right you know you kind of get this in like psycho and notorious by Hitchcock like you get some of that stuff happening in a dolly as you know there's these images so it's happening kind of up an intellectual level but you know by the 60s with all the baby boomers that there's a contingent of baby boomers that became hippies and you know became all this new agey stuff and you know that all filtered to that community fascinating you're right you're right well if we had a theme of this video it's like all of these things underneath that kind of get flowed into the stream and then you could say look at the impact of Jungian you can start you can pull it out of the stream and say well look at all the stuff that's connected to this and it's like it's true so very interesting well you are very interesting person Jeff I gotta I gotta run now but this has this has been fun so I will send you this video you can publish it I don't care we should talk again though because I didn't even get into any of my theories I mean we were just talking about you know cultural stuff yeah yeah that's fine we could get in my theory of consciousness or we could talk about you know my friends work and you know my understanding of that get into music and poetry and things like that cool cool all right well I will I will send this to you anyway and I'll I did the video I mean that the the quality of our connection is pretty crappy but I think mostly I could understand you the problem is that when I publish it goes on to audio it's it's it's difficult for people to hear but but I but you're a lot of fun I mean I could hear the audio pretty pretty well could you hear me pretty well most most of the time most of the time so so yeah I'll probably publish it this I thought I I enjoy I mean part of what sort of happened is that many of the people who watch my channel really like my stuff and so the conversations are very nice and nice conversations are nice yeah but I also like talking to people who look at the world in a very different way that I do and mixing it up a little bit arguing and debating I like that too so this I haven't had a good contrastive let's call it conversation for a while and and you know and you you've always throw a lot of interesting stuff I've been watching Deadwood and thinking about first Corinthians that's been fun oh I love that that bit in Deadwood is just amazing yeah but hey I've given you a question to answer so so homework assignment send send send me the question in written form and we can begin there although if you set it to the standard you can't bat away but I'll give you I'll give you a shot okay all right we'll have a good night you too Jeff bye bye all right here
