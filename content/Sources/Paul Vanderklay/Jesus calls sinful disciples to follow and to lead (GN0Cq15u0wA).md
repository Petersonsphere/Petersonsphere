 Hi, this is Paul and this is my Rough Draft for Sunday series. I've been doing a series on the post-Easter pre-ascension and Pentecost sightings and stories of Jesus and this week I'm looking at John 21. In the news this month there's been a lot of discussion about Bill Hybels' resignation from Willow Creek. Bill Hybels grew up in the Christian Reformed Church. He became a youth pastor of a large church in Chicago and founded Willow Creek Church and Willow Creek Church became really the flagship church for the seeker movement that dominated the evangelical scene in the 80s and 90s. The nominations like my own I sent junkets to Willow Creek to learn how to create a safe space for a dangerous message to be to have fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ to have prevailing churches and Bill Hybels was at the center of all this and for many who are not familiar with the history of evangelicalism in the 80s and 90s especially This was a this was a he was a true tremendously important person and a movement that transformed the way especially non-denominational and also many denominational churches Did ministry in the United States Canada and all over the world and Bill Hybels It was a tremendously important leader with many many tapes we get tapes every week from the Willow Creek Association books Making his resignation and all of the stories that have been coming out surrounding it just terribly sad Most of the stories involve impropriety with women invitations to hotel rooms boat private jet flights Messages like don't bring your husband you look sexier if you dress this way complaining to other women Complaining to other women when he's alone with them about struggles in his own marriage the church leadership now Willow Creek had you know Will Creek was for evangelical churches out in front on having women in their Women elders deacons and pastors women in their governing board and so, you know a lot of people who Say well, you know this kind of thing only happens when there's male dominated leadership Well, there was a lot of women in leadership at Willow and a number of the women who complained about them had significant About Bill had significant leadership questions and the church leadership not just the men but the women as well Failed to take seriously these stories So Where does that you know, where does that leave us? Well Ed Stetzer wrote a a I Thought quite a powerful piece in Christianity today as well on them the moral the moral of moral failings of Christian leaders and And went into this some way and basically, you know the system the system has to change but that's such a That's such boilerplate language for our culture right now that we we believe that You know the kinds of the kinds of failures that were That that Bill Hybels had for years, this is a failure of a system and yeah, I can agree with that it's a failure of a system, but Implicit in that complaint is the hope that we can build a system Where there will be no failure This week's sermon in John 21 is really all about John 18 and In John 18 very famously Jesus is arrested and when Jesus gets arrested The disciples try plan a which for humanity is violence Jesus gets arrested and the disciples take out their sword and Peter cuts off the ear of the of the servant of the high priest and Jesus says stop put your swords away and he heals the high priests the servant of the high priests ear and Then his disciples flee and this is after Peter made such bold Statements about if if everyone falls away, I won't fall away. I'll follow you to the death and Peter runs and then Peter, you know John sneaks Peter into the Into the high priests quarters Peter wants to kind of keep an eye on the things and the girl who was that who was the doorkeeper? Said to Peter you're not one of this man's disciples to are you he replied no I'm not now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire They had made warming themselves because it was cold Peter also standing with them warming himself Meanwhile Simon Peter standing in the courtyard warming himself He said they said to him you aren't one of his disciples to are you Peter denied it I am NOT one of the high priest slaves Relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off said did I not see you in the orchard with him Peter denied it again and immediately the rooster crowed Now my question for you is Was Peter's sin was Peter's sins were Peter's sins? Was Peter's sin if we look at this as singular worse than Bill Hybl's sins Were Bill Hybl's sins more disqualifying than Peter's for leadership? That's a really hard question and and how we answer the question reveals a lot about our assumptions About what's wrong with the world what's important with the world What character looks like? And I think especially for us in our in our particular context. It's a it's a very difficult question Now John 21 is an interesting chapter some people think John 21 is an Epilogue for the gospel of John because the gospel seems to end at John 20 and then we have this chapter John 21 And the chapter is full of symbolism It revolves around two things it revolves around fishing where you know fishing is obviously Symbolically laden in the stories of Jesus. I will make you fishers of men or fishers of people and shepherding shepherding as a long Symbolic history in the Bible Psalm 23 the Lord is my shepherd. That's really a Psalm 23 the Lord is my shepherd that's really a a royal psalm because to be the king of Israel was to be the shepherd and John 10 the Good Shepherd David was a shepherd and when Nathan confronts David with the sin of of adultery with Bathsheba and covering up Uriah's death Nathan brings in a parable about about a sheep Numerous shepherding references in the Old and New Testament. It's it's one of the one of the dominant symbolic motifs of the Bible And it begins here after this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the sea of Tiberias now It's very interesting that that this would the word that's chosen here for for revealed is is significant This is a theophany of sorts and and it's also interesting how John chooses here the the Designation the sea of Tiberias he could have said the sea of Galilee, but but he chooses the sea of Tiberias that in some ways presents this story to the broader Roman Context much more than just let's say just the just the Jewish context now This is how he did so Simon Peter Thomas called Didymus Nathaniel who was at Canaan Galilee Now this is the first time in the Gospel of John we hear Nathaniel connected with Cana Cana Obviously in John 4 where With the with Jesus famous miracle of water to wine at Cana the sons of Zebedee and two other disciples We're also with them now if you count the number there there are seven Which is also very interesting Simon said I'm going fishing we will go with you they replied and Never has a fishing trip being been examined or judged so harshly Than this one so they get into the boat and that night they caught nothing and it's very interesting because the the Greek word Here used for caught is not the usual word that you would use for catching fish or catching animals it's in fact the word for seized which John has used for for Jesus being seized and And that's it's much more of a common word for for used for seizing men And so right away with the boat and the fishing we're we're just invited to to pick up this fishing motif of Jesus calling his disciples fishers of men and now here they're fishing and by themselves they can catch nothing and this is you know many commentators see this as a subtle message of Impotence on the part of the disciples for being able to fulfill their calling in a sense now Peter as their leader But but but you know they fled they fled and and didn't stay by the cross of Jesus When it was already very early very early morning in the last very early morning we had was Easter morning So John is John is you know connecting these stories together Jesus stood on the beach now actually the the the land the Story there is earth and so already we have a sea and earth Connection going here, but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus Jesus said to them children and And again many have noted that that Jesus talks down to them and very much even though they're not recognizing him Presents himself as as their father or their master or their superior Children you don't have any fish do you and the question is asked exactly that way It's the the assumption is no and and again We we have the overtones here of of Peter and the disciples trying to go out and and and and act But without Jesus and without his power and authority they're they're impotent they can they can do nothing They can't they can't be fishers of men as as they were called to They replied no and he told them throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some So they threw the net and they were not able to pull it in because of the large number of fish now This is a this is a miracle of the new creation Where where Jesus is master of creation and in a sense guides the fish into their net and there are so many fish They can't bring it in now obviously Commentators especially ancient ones have read this story to be about to be about the church Then that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter now right away We're gonna see the tension between Jesus and these two disciples in this story is it it is the Lord So Simon Peter when he heard that it was the Lord tied around himself his outer garment for he was naked and threw himself into the sea But the other disciples came in the boat dragging the net of fish because they were not far from the land about 200 Cubics away, that's about a hundred yards Cubics away, that's about a hundred yards now What is so interesting to me about this passage when I read it this time is almost no modern commentators In fact almost no commentators talk about this little piece of the story Now and almost all modern commentators try to analyze this portion of the story in terms of the the mechanics and the physics of the the literal history that the story is referring to I Think actually this part of the story is is extremely symbolic and it's intended to be symbolic Jewish Jews weren't naked in public even in a group of men and And so he would have been wearing a loincloth. So so a lot of commentators Well, it wasn't actually naked but but that's the word that's used and then he He ties his garment around him and Now this this language is gonna be picked up later in the story in a very important place and he throws himself into the sea Also, it's important to notice that later in the story. We're gonna have Peter son of Jonah Jonah now there's a textual issue involved in that that I'm not gonna go into but Who is Peter right now? isn't Peter in some sense a Jonah figure and whereas the the pagan sailors Kovach at throwing Jonah into the sea to silence the storm Peter throws himself into the sea and you know, he wraps his cloak around him because he's naked There's there's so much symbolic overtones going in this story and and besides that this little segment has no meaning In the rest of the story because when we get to the next point, we don't have Peter getting to the shore first We don't have there's no practical reason why Peter has done this there There is something more to the fact that that Peter throws himself into the sea the and now again You've got sea is a very deep symbolic Figure in the Bible, of course the Bible opens with this sea of chaos and it's out of the sea that the sea monsters come and and and and it's it's and that the waters of baptism are in a sense a Death of us into the sea and so I can't explain exactly how this is working But it seems to me that in this story right here This is the this is the sense in which Peter casts himself into the sea And and now what's very interesting so when they got out to the land again, we have land and sea the contrast here they saw a Charcoal fire and the words used for charcoal fire here are only found is only found twice in the New Testament once in John 18 where we read it before and once here and So everything in this story both the fishing part and this part here and Peter casting himself into sea This is all about Peter and leadership and by virtue of Peter all of the rest of the disciples and and we see Peter and the disciples impotent seven of them the fullness the number of fullness Impotent and being able to fulfill their task. Why? well Are they naked? You know and and Peter casts himself into the sea. It's it's is it baptism? Is it suicide? Is it is it chaos? So Jesus when they get to the land They saw charcoal fire and laid there and a fish lying on it and bread and Jesus said to them Bring some of the fish that you have now caught That's very interesting to here where Jesus has a meal ready for them of fish and bread things that Jesus has multiplied in the past But now he says you bring the fish bring the things that you caught by the way you caught with my power But bring the fish that you caught That's what you're going to drive your sustenance from so Peter got into the boat and and here again Peter goes now back into the boat and this is in a sense if you look at G the boat and the storm in Matthew You know, the boat is often symbolizing the church. So Peter has to get back into the boat and hauls the net to land Full of fish now they're coming out of chaos and they're coming on to the land and it's full of fish 153 and which is again a hugely debated number And I think it I think it does in it does really symbolize the harvest Although there were so many the net was not torn. So now the net is symbolic of the church Jesus said to them come eat breakfast But none of the disciples dared to ask him. This is this is the this is This is this distance after the resurrection between Jesus and the disciples and and to what can we account this distance is it Is it the disciples failure at the moment of crisis? Is it the disciples failure to stand with Jesus? Is it is it the disciples failure to see Jesus is it the disciples failure to embody Jesus in that moment of crisis? They were they and they're they're even afraid to talk to him. Who are you because on one hand? They're they're afraid on the other hand they know who he is Jesus came and took bread and gave it to them and the fish likewise. So then is is there a Eucharist? Is the Eucharist theme coming through here? It was now the third time three days Three it was now the third time Jesus has revealed himself to his disciples Are they not yet going to see him after the third time? Now when they had eaten breakfast He sets a meal before them in the presence of their enemies Now when they'd eaten breakfast Jesus says to Simon Peter Simon son of Jonah Do you love me more than these and again the debate is furious? Do you love me more than the boats and the nets? Do you love me more than the disciples love me? Do you love me more than what? He said to them. Yes Lord, you know that I love you Yes Lord, you know that I love you and he said to them he said to him feed my lambs He said to him again a second time Simon son of John son of Jonah. I better correct that if I want to keep my Thing going here. Hang on. It's good to run through these things Simon son of Jonah. Do you love me? He said yes Lord, you know that I love you. He said to him shepherd my sheep He said to him a third time Simon son of Jonah Do you love me Simon Simon? You are a son of Jonah That is how you are when? when the when the time for arrest came What did you default to? Violence you defaulted to the tools of revolution in the world to try to bring about my kingdom and I stopped you and then you fled and Then you denied me you lived, you know, you didn't you didn't deny me like Judas You didn't go all the way you stayed in the twilight of our relationship and and that was That was the way You tried to keep yourself and not lose me and that was the way you tried to work at Peter and Peter knows it Peter was distressed because he said him said it to him a third time and of course this mirrors the three times of The denial and again, how do you how do you evaluate Peter's sin? do you evaluate it worse than Bill Hybl's betrayal of of his marriage vows of his calling of the trust that That the church had in him maybe think about someone that that you think is has done worse than Bill Hybl's How do you evaluate it? Do you love me? He said Lord, you know everything you know that I love you and Peter said and Jesus said feed my sheep now. Now what's interesting here is that? And I've never heard this brought up with this passage Why doesn't Jesus say Peter you're done Why doesn't Jesus say Peter get out of the twilight of our relationship? At least Judas had the guts to take it all the way He tells Peter to get back in the game Peter who has denied him Peter who has failed him This is such a This is such an interesting passage is such a powerful passage Jesus is installing in leadership this this flawed leader who has been broken Now we might like to imagine well well Peter's been tried and Peter's been restored so Peter's gonna be perfect and This is this is really the key verse of this chapter and and it's designated I mean that it tells us exactly that it is by the truly truly or the old King James the verily verily Verily in Greek the amen amen Truly truly I tell you when you were young you tied your clothes around you And walked where you wanted Peter just tied his clothes around him and Jumped into the sea of chaos like Jonah But when you're old you will stretch out your hands as in crucifixion and Someone else will tie you up onto a cross and carry you where you do not want to go Now he said this to indicate by what kind of death he would glorify God And after that he said to him follow me He's not telling Peter to go away Judas isn't at the meeting Judas has has already ended his life He's telling Peter even with your failings I Want to go away I want you to stay even with your failings you must follow me The church is for sinners The church is for betrayers the church is for deniers Now all church leaders are flawed More than you can or want to know that includes me That includes everyone I've known my father was My father was a hero of mine my father never did any of those I Don't think anyone has ever alleged that my father did any of those things that that bill Hybels was accused of my father didn't have a private plane or a boat or a vacation home He barely had an office Yet my father was a flawed leader and I remember another another Another friend Dante vanegas who was pastor of The second church I was ever a member of my father's church was the first and Dante was the pastor of the second I remember Dante once once telling me about How my father had failed him and how Dante was hurt There are no perfect leaders Dante There are no perfect leaders Dante wasn't perfect my father wasn't perfect I Am NOT perfect and that's this is not the place for me to tell you all the ways that I'm not perfect But just take my word for it This did was Peter or Bill Hybels worse Doesn't matter and and now don't get me wrong. I am NOT saying Hybels shouldn't have resigned I'm not saying the elders of Willow Creek shouldn't have taken action when accusations were heard in fact if If Hybels had been called to account for such things far earlier in his ministry How much better couldn't it all have been I'm not denying What we have learned I? am I am challenging the deep assumption that We can Within our power create systems or by our own moral performance conquer the sin that Plagues us and plagues our institutions and my proof for this is Peter doesn't at this point Get it even Peter turned and saw the other disciples who Jesus loved following them Who also leaned back on his chest at the dinner and said Lord? Who is who is the one betraying you who is the one betraying you Judas? Yes, Peter is going to all of them are going to run So when he saw this one Peter said to Jesus Lord, but what about this one? Jesus said to him if I want him to remain until I come what is that to you? You follow me see us Lewis picks this up in such a poignant scene and the horse and his boy And here we are whether you're a leader in the church whether you're a follower in the church whether you're not in the church at all This is the reality that that Peter is a denier and The honesty of the gospel records don't cover this up It takes it full on and Jesus Challenges Peter despite his failings and despite his you know, he took it poorly And Jesus says don't look at other people you must follow me you must follow me It would be lovely to imagine that Peter's little talk shaped him right up Peter was still playing petty games of status and preference Paul will call Peter to account in Galatians from shrinking back to eat for the Gentiles Peter was never a perfect leader God uses flawed leaders God breaks leaders God breaks us only God breaks us because only what has died Can be raised and he breaks our hearts so that we have a chance to be filled with him And not so full of ourselves and if there's any liability for leaders, and I think this is especially poignant in the Heidl's case It is when we get full of ourselves it's when we get When we start believing the as my friend Rod says the clapping gods. It's when we It's when we start believing our own publicity that we're great and we can do no wrong and we're full of ourselves and we we always make the right moves and And when we are rewarded with with a claim and with popularity and with money and with privilege and with status and with The positions and the seats that everyone wants this is when this is when we're most vulnerable to ourselves The gospel is not a story of perfect people being rewarded for their moral performance But broken people being rescued from their brokenness by God's grace and him using them still So the message of this is you must follow me Where well Read the story He tells Peter exactly what discipleship will mean Right now you've got a lot of freedom and you can do what you want to do you you know In Facing me you you throw yourself into the sea just like Jonah Peter son of Jonah Do you love me? Peter wants to live in the twilight of his relationship And Jesus says no you will love me you will serve me and And they will take you where you don't want to go and they will stretch out your arms and they will crucify you That is what it means to follow where you will be stretched out Humiliated broken possibly and the most pointless way possible This is exactly where God brings redemption and then the question is Well, what will we do So what is God doing with Bill Hybels, no, it's probably breaking him It's probably breaking him You know who knows the pain that's going on in his household in his marriage over over all of this stuff and and I pray that Yeah that that there'll be repentance and You know, it's got done with Bill Hybels, I don't know maybe he's done with him in the public eye I don't believe God has done with any of us Until they put us in the grave and even then it's the next chapter So God uses flawed leaders he used Bill Hybels when Bill Hybels was doing this stuff I'll pray that he uses him after But the lesson really isn't about Bill Hybels. He's not gonna hear this sermon The question is are you in your past is no excuse for leaving and that that finally is kind of the difference between Peter and Judas Peterson earth Judas runs away from the church Peter stays in Judas goes down to despair Judas leaves the church Peter stays in Your current flaws do not exclude you your current sins do not exclude you You should confess them and repent if you are able I should change that to sins from flaws Your current sins do not exclude you you should confess them and repent if you are able that's that's what we're called to do and so often We're so full of ourselves. We'd rather stay in the twilight away from Jesus not too close or he'll see us and then we'll be destroyed Well, what will actually be destroyed is our pride and our sin and all of these these things that that really are keeping us back Don't compare yourselves to others don't look at the other disciple don't look at the other leader Don't look at the other person and say well, what about him? It isn't fair Jesus says I'm not dealing with you fairly I'm dealing with you with what you need according to what I choose for you and you have questions about that Well, you have to take it up with him You must follow me You must follow me
