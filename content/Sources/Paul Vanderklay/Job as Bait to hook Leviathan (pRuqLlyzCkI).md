 weird yeah it's it's strange when you know if someone says the TV talks to me well now the TV's kind of talking to you but you're okay I've been watching your videos for about well since Peterson started his Genesis series so and they've been extremely helpful because I mean I grew up evangelical so I feel like you're coming from my worldview plus bringing up a lot of other stuff from your own background that that you just explained so well so I appreciate it well thank you yeah um I guess better introduce myself yeah tell us tell tell me a little I am recording it and I will send this to you and then you can decide what you'd like me to do with it yeah that's fine we can we can record it um my name is Jess I live in Kansas City I'm married to my wife and we have three little boys how many little boys three three wonderful so 12 10 and 7 and awesome Christmas and all that oh yeah and then I'm in my office right now I'm an animator oh animation studio fascinating it's interesting a number of people are illustrators and animators who who watch my channel again a lot of people who watch my channel are people who can spend some time at work and just have extra headspace to fill so right right yeah and I'm I'm high in openness so I'm just constantly like just listening to podcasts all the time or else I can't work without listening to something yeah sometimes I'll spend an hour just trying to find something to listen to rather than work with nothing I can and I can't wash the dishes without listening to something it says well that's not true I'd not that I can't but I'd rather not generally speaking so I get that right we get that so um so what's on your mind I wanted to talk to you about the book of Job okay and I was I had I've been thinking about the book of Job for like for a while it's been like five or seven years it's been really on my mind because I haven't and was trying to figure it out and and I feel like I've come to some some some realizations since about a year ago is when yeah because Peterson was doing Genesis one and then it's the the Tohu Wabohu and the in the chaos and stuff and and then you posted a video about how Jordan Peterson's influencing the way I read the Bible and you went into how the idea of chaos and and I actually just rewatched that videos it was from December 27th or something and then you who was it John Walton you you brought in John Walton into the into the picture and that was unbelievably helpful I think you I think you brought it to me the idea of the chaos monster and and that was from Peterson bringing up Tiamat and and Marduk yeah and and so because because the thing about the book of Job that I could never figure out is what the heck is this Leviathan thing what's it doing in there why why is why does God's speech build up to to Leviathan like why is that the the climax of what God says like it doesn't make any sense because growing up I was around like a lot of young earth and you know that world so Leviathan was just a was an alligator or a dinosaur or something and and it just it just never made any sense to me so so I I was like oh this has to do with with chaos and I don't want to go too long because I want to have a discussion about this but but I kind of just want to outline like what how the book how I look at it now and see what you think so so I think Genesis plays a key role because you got the Tohu Wabohu you have the the primordial chaos and kind of taking a hint from John the Pagino and his brother Mathieu Pagino I can't remember how to pronounce his name those Frenchmen why don't they use English names so he but I got his book that symbolic book I don't know if you ever got a chance to read it I've looked at just looked at about half of it yeah and and the one thing I liked was that he just is like I'm gonna start with the basics of what Genesis says I'm gonna build as if it's laying out the world and so he develops these concepts through the book and so I was like well what if I just do that with chaos and just say like what is this chaos at the beginning of of Genesis well it's it's the raw material with which God creates with so that goes along with kind of Peterson's idea of the potential the chaotic potential so it's not so we're getting away from chaos being evil or but it's this potential so I was like all right so let's let's just call chaos the potential with or the raw materials with the God creates out of that that's the clay for the potter that's the it's the wood for the carpenter so okay so getting into the book of Job Job was introduced we know he's a good man and he's a righteous man he's not perfect but he's the best best man have you considered my servant job right and then we get into this scene in heaven and Satan shows up among while God's managing the universe he's the sons of God show up and then also Satan among them and then Satan says I was going to God asked where have you been Satan says I've been going to and fro about the earth and I was looking through all the commentaries and there was one that struck me was that it's it's like the back and forth and circling of a of like a predatory animal and and this was key for me because when God says have you seen my servant job he's almost being a little sarcastic because he already saw Satan is doing this predatory circling thing and who is at the center was Joe and so so Satan says of course I've seen him and but he's not righteous on his own he's righteous because you protect him and so for me there was there was the accusation against job job's not good he's just protected and then God you're not or job's not righteous he's just protected and God you're not good you're just powerful so so God says all right and he agrees to to take his protection away which is which is funny and I now see it kind of like God is up to something and we don't know what yet and he's acting kind of because he should have just shooed Satan away and just said get out of here what are you talking about you don't know anything but it's like God saw some sort of opportunity to take so he took it anyway not to but um so then job loses everything his family as well as health and then his friends come and they sit in silence for seven days and then job talks speaks and this is when Leviathan gets brought up first because Leviathan curse or Leviathan job curses his birth which is significant because at the very beginning we learned that the family celebrated birthdays that was like the big thing they did and on the oldest brother's birthday is when all his children died and so he curses his birth he says I want to be unborn I don't ever want to have lived and he calls out kind of for he says those that will those that curse the day rouse up Leviathan to undo my life because he's thinking in his mind he's like if anyone can undo my life the monster the chaos monster can be roused up to undo everything that's how much he was in sorrow so this is where Leviathan gets brought up first I was like I was like so job knows about Leviathan and this is and so he knows about Tiamat and he knows about I think it's low tan which is the which is in variation which is the root where we get Leviathan okay not to so anyway the friends go back and forth they're like job you must have done something wrong you must have been some sort of sin and God is punishing you he is you know trying to make things right what you need to do is repent and God will restore you if we have a God of mercy we have a God of grace we have a God that is just he will restore you you just need to repent and job is just he is infuriated with this idea he's like I did nothing and we and we know from the beginning that he didn't do anything I'll probably get choked up at some point just because I mean it's just such a I mean I cry easily anyway but but it's just such a archetypal story of suffering that that uh sometimes I can't make it through it so anyway so job at the very end he he demands that God indict him because he says that if only I knew what I did wrong then I could have peace he he he wants God to bring him up on official charges so you like these there's a line in there that says I've signed the papers and all this stuff and and he says I want the Almighty to charge me officially and then the fourth fourth friend comes and talks and and while that while he's talking the storm starts building and then that's when God shows up at the end of his this other friend's speech and God shows up in the storm and God's pissed at the idea of bringing up job on charges and he's angry at the friends yeah and he's angry at the friends and he's and so Joe wants an answer he wants an indictment and God instead gives him this tour of creation and it and that I liken it to that this is God showing him his glory so God asked like where you were when the foundations of the earth were laid talks about all these different animals and stuff and the one thing that's striking about all the animals is like some of the animals were brought up in in the conversation between job and his friends like the ox and the donkey and stuff but they were they were talked about in how they served people like so they were work animals and then God talks about them in the wild sense so there's a wild donkey searching for searching for for grass and there's the wild ox and like he doesn't want to do anything for you like how are you going to you know what it what does the wild ox do for you and and every everything is almost devoid of man what God is talking about and it's and I say that just to just to say that God's thing you don't understand your suffering but do you understand any of the world at all yeah like do you understand where where the mountain goats give birth yeah do you understand like why your give birth to their young do you count the months they must fulfill and do you know the time they give birth they crouch they bear their young they bring forth the offspring they have carried their young grow strong and grow up in the open they go off and do not return to them who let the wild donkey go free who released the bonds of the donkey to whom I appointed to whom I appointed the step of its home and the salt wastes as it's dwelling place yeah it's beautiful beautiful the the one I like is the ostrich because he's like the ostrich is dumb it's careless with its young it's it's it says that its creator didn't give it's much it much wisdom and then it says but when it runs it runs you know yeah yeah so God's just going through all this he's like everything is is glorious like it's beyond explanation it's like it's like the planet earth DVD series yeah yeah I love this line here it's for God deprived her of wisdom and did not impart understanding her but as soon as she springs up she laughs at the horse and its rider that's oh that's good yeah it's it's it's so yeah it's incredible it's it the whole the whole speech by God yeah and a couple insights I got from oh so GK Chester 10 wrote in an introduction to the book of Job which was really good and he talks about how the way the way God answered job was not by answering his questions but by giving him bigger questions than he knew how to answer and so and so that was good and then you know slaadlo Zizek not I've heard his name but I've never he says he's a postmodern Marxist philosopher that that I've listened to for years and years because well first he's entertaining but anyway he's just really interesting dude and he he said in one lecture he let he loves the book of Job and he said that he thinks that basically God says at the end I like how he puts this he said is you think your life is a mess look at all creation it's all one big wreck but what I like about that like it's not orthodox but but it gives the sense that it's unexplainable right like like it like you can't get your head around it's it's simultaneously meaningless and more full of meaning then you can subscribe to it yeah yeah yeah so alright so then we get to the end of God's speech and and he starts bring he brings up behemoth and then he brings up Leviathan and the last quarter of God's speech is about Leviathan like a quarter of what he says and and it makes sense if if you if it's a chaos monster and what so what what's a cake so what's a chaos monster well the ancient stories were all stories of creation and renewal so when when Marta fought time it was to create the world and then when I forget who some of these other stories but there's there's tons of these stories in the ancient world these chaos comps I think is the category which they call it and so when God gets to this point he saying he's bringing up Leviathan and got in and Job knows what this means and he gives up he gives the answer to Job what what is suffering is all about he's he's like I'm doing something new I'm making I'm he's either renewing creation new and then it makes sense to Job and he has peace all this because I know I'm leaving something out here that I can just can't bring to mind okay but I don't know what do you what do you think about that because for me that struck me so profoundly that this was it wasn't just God talking about having more power over this monster it was him saying I'm doing something new this is a new like that and this is all like I'm not I feel like I'm not explaining this very well at this point but I forgot to lock the room oh yeah I used to I used to always remember to do that now I forgot he's the he's the next person coming in so what do you do you do like many of these per day it depends on the day I've got three today so okay there we go keep going well I think well I think it's really cool I love I love the care that you've that you've shown in in learning I like the way you framed it you know the the before the epilogue you know Job's answer then Job answered then Job answered the Lord I know I know that you can do all things no purpose of yours can be thwarted you asked who is this that darkens my counsel without knowledge but I have declared but I have declared without understanding things too wonderful for me to know it's a very common Hebrew answer you say oh yeah yeah David mentions it often in the Psalms these things are too wonderful for me to know well what do you mean by too wonderful for you to know it's it's human hubris that says if if if there's a reason if if I don't understand the reason there can't be a good one so if you read for example Tim Keller's book on walking through pain and suffering that's the standard Christian traditional answer about suffering that just because you don't know the answer to suffering doesn't mean there isn't one and that's the leap that's the presumption that we very quickly make mm-hmm and and the book of Job essentially says Job says I have you know but I have declared without understanding things too wonderful for me to know you said pay attention and I will speak I will question you and you will answer me I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear but now my eye has seen you therefore I despise myself and I repent in dust and ashes and what's interesting is that that if you remember the repenting in dust and ashes earlier in the book you know that's where that's where Job had went before when now it's important to also remember how his family how his family is taken you know it's the whirlwind collapses the house its Raiders comes in and steals the flock it's all chaos too and and and evil and you know so it's a it's an amazing book and I think you I think you laid it out well what do you think about the idea that well there's this old image can I pull up an image on here can you show me can I give you the power to share screen let me see more yep okay you're sharing screen yeah all right so this is an image from I can't remember where it's from it was it was made by a nun in like the 11 hundreds or something out of this prayer book and it had all these pictures so up in the upper left is God the father mm-hmm he's holding a fishing pole I love this so he's holding the fishing pole and then the the figure the portraits down the fishing line are it's David or it's Jesse and then it's the line of David so the fishing line is interesting then Jesus is at the bottom on the cross yeah with the hook and then the hook is piercing the jaw of Leviathan which is in is in the end of Job yeah so so God asked Job can you can you get Leviathan with the hook can you or can you fish him out can you pierce his jaw with a hook right so this is showing Christ piercing the jaw of I think that there's a there's an interesting idea here and and you see it actually in the beginning when God's talking to Satan is Job is bait Job is the bait to to stir up the chaos that God will use to create with huh and and then this is a this is a this is um it's a shadow of Christ yeah yeah yeah Christ was the bait he was lowered down the line of Jesse yeah yeah yeah to to win well I was thinking about this earlier it was like he was born during the Roman Empire like if there was ever a Leviathan to be lowered into man that was that was a good that was a good choice yeah and and well and you got to think about Satan's accusation towards God because he was like God you're not I mean he makes the accusation towards Joe but he implies that God you're not really good you're just powerful and so God takes away his protection but he baits Satan into I don't I don't know quite how to get to him but but he baits there man it's almost because why didn't God just destroy Satan so because you got to assume that you know John Walton talks about the wisdom of God I'm gonna stop sharing this right so John Walton talks about kind of the wisdom that God has in the end of Joe and so so God must have a reason to keep Satan around or else he just destroy him or shoot him away or whatever so so in God's mind Satan still has a purpose but he's got to trick Satan into that purpose because Satan will not do anything willingly because he's a fallen angel so you see this at the beginning because he's like hey have you seen my servant Joe God sees an opportunity and so it's something like Satan can't kill God because God's just too big so what does Satan do he attacks the things God loves and what do God love the most he loved Joe and you know this is what did God love most God loved Christ and and so he he cannot control himself like this is Satan's weakness he he is smart and wise or whatever but he has this desire to destroy that he cannot control and if he thought about it for one second he wouldn't have done it but he got he got tricked you got can't control himself you're exactly right he got tricked by God God saw this as an opportunity he's like God God saw this as an opportunity to make all things new again through the confrontation with Leviathan and in Leviathan like there's so many layers to this joke thing because you can read it as Leviathan is Satan or a servant of Satan you can read is Leviathan is Job's own spirit you can read it as you know just chaos or whatever so it works on all these levels which is what makes it beautiful I don't know what do you think it's really cool I think it's really cool it's very you know Church Fathers you know thought a lot about these kinds of questions and and they they played with these ideas no I think it's I think it's I think it's really cool and the I know some traditions like certain reformed traditions tend to focus exclusively on penal substitutionary atonement but Christus Victor and some of these other atonement ideas were you know were around in the Church Fathers and the Christian tradition and and some and some of them have very much had you know the duping of Satan and the you know the idea that you have of Satan can't help himself I think is a is a profound a profound one and one that scales pastorally you look at for example God's admonition to Cain to you know sin is crouching at your door it desires to have you but you must master it this this seems to be the thing Satan can't do and it's also it also scales up with well what is what is hell hell is we we finally fully give in give into our appetites to the point that we no longer exist CS Lewis talks about that in terms of in the great divorce someone who grumbles finally there's no longer someone who grumbles it's just a grumble and that gets into this idea of okay well well what is job now job job is fulfilling I love it I love the way that you laid it out job is fulfilling this purpose of God and God is using job as as bait now part of the difficulty that we have as what it one of the one of the side effects of the Enlightenment was the of our current reading of the problem of evil and I think I think Tim Keller makes a good case in walking through walking with God through pain and suffering that not only Tim Keller but also but also secular age Charles Taylor you know part of what happened in the Enlightenment is in the sense we got bigger in our own eyes and at that point we look at God and say surely you can't have answers that we don't understand this gets even this gets even more true when we get to the point of saying well God is merely a projection of what we are well if God is a projection God is less than us and a lot of contemporary a lot of contemporary apostasy tends to essentially say to God we are smarter than you we know better than you you are our servant stay in your place and the book of Job walks into that and just says yeah yeah yeah yeah even I even think that like the book of Job's interesting even for through like the Peterson crowd because job was basically the guy who cleaned this room the best that's right that's right and so so he's done everything right he's managed everything correctly he's kept his house in order he's got a great family keep and then tragedy strikes him and the question comes up what is God up to that's right and it you know in you know Peterson gives some good answers like what you need to do is don't make things worse and continue to you know continue to struggle with whatever burden reality places on you but I think the book of Job is good because then it gets to the real question of like what is reality up to you know what's God up to that there's something bigger going on and if if for the glory of God I hate you know I kind of hate that answer like you got a sort of frame it carefully but for the glory of God like God might need some bait you know we are his servants and we offer ourselves to him and that is very anti-modern yeah yeah yeah it goes against everything and what's interesting is is that but it's not like God was using Job necessarily like he did but God needed Job to do something specific because if Job cursed God Satan won that this episode or whatever and we would never have a book of Job and and so God needed to trust Job just as much as Job needed to trust God like there was a complete division there where God was like hands off and you know you know like Wyden at the very end God comes in the storm and says hey good job Job we did it yeah but but it's almost like he had to release his own wrath against Job to just cement that Job is really righteous like to defend you know the thing that was in Job that God trusted from the beginning and you know this is I mean I said before but this is like a shadow of Christ you know where Job didn't die but like Christ really went into the belly of the beast and you know if you're really wanting to make all things new that's that's the chaos that you got to get to yeah and that's the that's the hero's journey to go into the belly of the beast and then right and then you come out and into a different world no that's that's right that's I think that's all good stuff one at one aspect a little tweak at the beginning of the book there there's it's a two-sided it's a two-sided it's it's a two-sided challenge that there's two reasons that Job Satan dismisses Job initially the accuser Hassatan because you on one hand you protect him and it benefits him and so there's also an insinuation of corruption that God God and Job are in cahoots in corruption right and and that also gets you know gets overturned because Job as the faithful servant of the Lord it's so completely modern of us to demand that God give us kudos and in terms of a hierarchical vision of the world God doesn't owe us that this is this is what we owe him and it stops there our modern sensitivities hates that because we we default to seeing ourselves as the center of the universe and it is that is such a that the irony of of contemporary skepticism let's say is that on one hand we we default ourselves to see ourselves as the center of the universe on the other hand all of the the the new atheists say oh but we're nothing but we're nothing but we think we're something and on one hand they're offended at God would treat us as nothing but then in the other hand say we're just right trousered apes we're nothing and it's like wait a minute um if we're nothing why on earth are you making a big deal about visions of God's judgment against Jericho or the Canaanites or rivers of blood in the book of general book of Revelation nothing is nothing I I I care not for the rat that I drown you know right but it's almost like God had like you you've been talking about the hierarchy of values and this God has his own hierarchy of values because he did he did protect Job and he did benefit him and he restored him again so these things are important to God yes but there was something more important and it was this opportunity that he saw yeah to make things new like and I think that gets to the highest what God's highest value is is is glory creation and renewal yeah and it's something like that I don't know exactly but but like when that opportunity comes God will take it and then we're like why why would you do that because that there's a chaos monster now he's like this is the these are the raw elements that I create with you know and and there's there's a sense in the in the New Testament that because and and we know this implicitly when we know story if you would go to the movie theater and sit down and watch a movie and you just watched Iron Man polishing his his iron skin you know I don't want to pay 15 bucks to go watch a movie about that you you go you go because of the drama because of the story because the the it's the revelation you know the book of Revelation singular apocalypse it's it's the revelation of the hero who at tremendous cost to himself rescues the beloved and makes her glorious there's that there's a remarkable chapter in the book of Ezekiel where you know God takes this little baby girl that's kicking in the mud and the blood of her newborn birth and raises her up and exalts her this is his glorious story and then she turns on the one who rescued her and sleeps with anybody else and then God comes and rescues her again and and it's and the question that's always lurking in the back of okay so God rescues us and delivers us from ourselves how do we know in the age to come we won't lapse back and redo this age and so then you have certain you have certain religions that tend to have this this cyclical thing and Christianity says no and and I think the answer is in the book of Job here because after Job himself has undergone the hero's journey now he is tested and knows and the the the the young the baby rescued by Israel and rescued by the Lord and made a queen and then a fallen queen and then a restored queen are you tempted by fall again and the and the older wiser queen says you know I played that game I went after those suitors I I indulged my I indulged my appetites and I cursed the one who rescued me and I know exactly what those what those rivals have to offer and I now can rest secure with the one I know who truly loves me there's the story and there's the answer and you find the story again and again and again in Scripture and lots of permutations but the book of Revelation the church is the bride of Christ well the churches the book of Revelation begins those first chapters churches are a mess and you know John is it's the Nicolaitans and and and you're lukewarm and all of this stuff and at the end of the book of Revelation here's the church and well why why now is the bride ready to become a queen well she has been to the underworld and and she has gained wisdom and knowledge and she she has taken from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and now in a sense is ready for the tree of life and I mean there's interesting theological conversations that have gone through this infralapsarian versus superlapsarianism and there's all kinds of things but you know this is the drama of the story and we are the bride and he is the master he is you know he is the lover he is the warrior he is the hunter and and we will be ravished by him and never more thrilled you know CS Lewis does that well and and it's it's you know it's there this the seeds of it are there in the book of Job and it's just hinted at but then of course it comes to full flow it comes to full flourishing in the Revelation of the Son of Man there's some I was just thinking about this that there's interesting parts in Joe where it's almost like a mirror image of different parts of Genesis where where like after he he loses everything his wife comes to him and says why don't you just curse God and die yeah and it's almost like Adam and Eve where where he she's offering this to him and she's not irrational she's not stupid like it's the common response what Job said was the the uncommon response and so it's almost like he didn't fall at that point right and then and then it's almost the inverse of the flood where the whole world was fine just Joe was taken down you know yeah and and again the best man on earth Noah's the best man on earth Job is the best man on earth yeah no it's very true it yeah and then oh something else cool that that I learned was so after Joe was restored it goes through and it's like says what happened to the very end it says he had three beautiful daughters and these are the names and it and the names are like significant to how he deals with the aftermath of this suffering and so the the first daughter was called day to symbolize he was out of the night he's into the day the second daughter was named something something that translated into cinnamon but cinnamon's spice that makes things taste better but it's also for indigestion so it like And then the third daughter was named corn of something but it was like a it was a container for a specific type of makeup I don't know if this is totally accurate but I read in one commentary that that makeup was made by the ashes of this seaweed so it was made from the ashes of the seaweed that was down in the place where Leviathan lived and so this this was taken from the place of Leviathan and then those ashes were used for beauty it's cool and nowhere in all the land could women be found who were as beautiful as Job's daughters and their father granted them an inheritance alongside their brothers that's it's amazing seven sons and three daughters and and the most beautiful daughters and they received inheritance just like their brothers after this job lived 140 years he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation and so Job died old and full of days it's great it's great stuff it's it's amazing so yeah well thanks for talking with me Paul this was so much fun thanks for this with me I loved how you laid it out and and went through it and it's it's you know people you know one of the joys of I listen to people talk about the Bible and I think you don't know anything about the book it's you know you spend some time in a story like this and you just realize you know this is the best literature you know this is some of the best literature in the world it's just no I mean set aside the religious aspect it's just astoundingly good there it is and and it's and the deeper you dig into it the more you see and you and it just takes your breath away and oh it's revelation it's it's I really appreciate I really enjoyed you walking walking through this and now I'll send you this video and you decide what you want to do with it and I'd love to share it because I think people will I think people will enjoy it I think you laid it out well and I think it's terrific so you don't even need to send it to me I'm I'm cool with you just post it okay okay well I will do that I will I will probably post it tomorrow so no this has been this has been just so much fun I I love doing this so well thanks so much for all the videos you're doing I've been watching them and I appreciate you giving me some to think about while I sit at my computer and animate things well it's it's certainly my pleasure thank you very much for taking the time to to share this with all of us cool thanks Paul all right take care bye bye
