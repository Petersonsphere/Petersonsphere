 but I thought because you'd mentioned first reform quite a few times before in your videos and I was like waiting around for you to finally make make your video on that but and then you're doing these scheduled conversations so I thought why not just get your thoughts from it in person. Oh I saw that movie about when was it out about a couple of months ago two three months ago I saw it with a couple of I saw it with a couple of other pastors and I know you have to know so Schrader is a product of the Christian Reformed Church and he was a product of Calvin College went two years to Calvin College and then out and then of course he went to Hollywood and he made a number of movies including Hardcore which was about a Christian Reformed man going to California to try to rescue his daughter who went to California for a youth convention and so Schrader's been working that you know been working out his the stuff that he grew up in in the Christian Reformed Church forever. I always have such issues with Hollywood pastors they're so I don't know maybe maybe that's what other pastors are like but I don't know. Is it like they're always lying like the Peterson critique? Yeah there's a lot of that pastors are you know there's a great quote pastors are quivering masses of availability and actually I just had a conversation with someone this morning who was talking to me about you know he kind of went to church and he looked he sees priests and the one word he's a European the one word he asked for priests are that they're soft in that they all they do is try to please people or manipulate people by what they say and I think that's exactly what Peterson talks about in terms of in terms of pastors lying. What about them so you saw the movie what about the movie struck you? Well I watched it with my family and they're very much more in the just watching movies for their entertainment value and so this one being kind of more artistic and more confusing especially with the ending I think for them it definitely wasn't as enjoyable especially the strange ending. Yeah what I found interesting is kind of the I guess the inner life of the pastor especially a small-town pastor and like the conflict between the small-town pastor and then this bigger corporation pastor that kind of has encapsulated him and his church even and like there's this duty basically to the higher up because I mean they're the ones that are sustaining you but still the that almost like a betrayal for his calling in what he feels he should be doing it's kind of I don't read much of Kierkegaard but it seems like a lot of what his critique of Christianity was how it gave people the comfort and if you're actually taking Christ's words truly for what they are they're the least comfortable thing that you should be accepting it's like yeah I mean carrying your cross to your inevitable doom or going through the torture of existence itself and then doing it through faith it is that's not exactly something that appeals to a broad audience which is like the clear distinction between the the prosperity gospel churches and then the the Kierkegaard's or the the the pastor in the in the film what's his name yeah I thought that set up even though he needs he he needed to do a little bit more research on prosperity churches because it was a little 1970 ish but but but Schrader isn't getting any younger but I thought that set up was genius and and in many ways set up a lot of the dynamics of the American Church where you have the the booming evangelicals that are sometimes trite money oriented it gets exemplified in the prosperity of course and then you have the main line which you mean in the movie his his church is actually a museum and and he he gets to preach on Sunday but you get the sense that his day job is a museum that's what he's doing and the by the beneficence of the of the prosperity pastor will keep your salary will keep building you can have your little sermons for 12 people on Sunday and you know and and then the big donor comes in and gets ticked off at you know the the environmentalism that he suddenly gets gets gets awakened to and radicalized that the most disappoint well I don't know this is a deep movie and I've got to see it two or three more times the now okay spoilers here so if you haven't seen first reformed you better stop listening now because I'm gonna say some things that are important and they come at the end but when he you know okay so so at the end of course he there's so many interesting things at the end where he wraps himself in the barbed wire and you know I was you know I was really expecting him to go in and you know with the with the suicide vest and blow himself up well he doesn't do that but then he's you know the scene so much into it the scene where he's he and the girl are you know and yeah the floating thing but also the finale where yeah it's almost like a vision or I don't know it's something that like it's hard to tell whether or not that's actually her that's there that stops him from committing suicide and maybe that doesn't exactly matter I guess but yeah it's it's very strange because like all through the movie it's like this guy's falling down this this pit of despair through it like the realization of the entropy within the environment that that's occurring and then people within the the larger church that are basically ignoring it or really harnessing that comforting aspect of Christianity so as to not deal with the more more real aspects to it that which it seems like a fair criticism of modern Christianity or at least the the skin deep version of Christianity as something that allows people to go on with their day-to-day lives and as for like Kierkegaard or Dostoevsky who they're trying to bring back the the underpinnings of it with like in the the grand inquisitor of Dostoevsky talks about how the Catholic Church has locks up Christ but still leaves the door open to him for people to be introduced to him in some way but it's like I don't remember who this quote was from but it was something like that the church is the thing that keeps man separate from God but it's kind of a two-fold thing because the church is supposed to be what brings man towards God but the church is always kind of there as the intermediary between the two and because if man was to be fully connected to God or like to experience God in all of his terror and might I mean it's just like an exodus where Moses comes down from them from the mountain and the people can't even look at him because his face is glowing it's Moses is that mediator between God and man that because man is unable in their own limited nature and their own sin sinful nature to be encompassed with God I had this dream once where I was basically experiencing God but not in a personal sense but in a I guess impersonal sense where I was it felt like being inside of a black hole where everything around you just gets larger and larger and you get smaller and smaller and it gave me a kind of a realization where by being in the presence of the infinite you yourself become smaller and smaller and you like fade away or it's kind of this hatred that you have for your own fallibility and your own distaste for your own self it's the ego is very willing or desirous of holding on to what it actually has and so when it's put into a situation where it is could potentially lose that by experiencing God in his fullness you you either latch on to you what you know what you have which is yourself and then that that's the barrier between you and actually experiencing the glory of God in his all-mightiness I guess well I think you put it well a lot of people if I say something what well if you if you present them with some of the things that you just talked about in terms of the Old Testament that well why can't we see God to ask a question like that reveals and reveals an inability a lack of imagination in terms of what God might be and how being in the presence of God what that might do to you in terms of how you see yourself you know and I think you're I think bringing in Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky in terms of that movie is really very right because both the both the abundant life prosperity gospel church and the main line museum are are exposed as being that they're both exposed as how to say both exposed as being inauthentic falsities falsities lying they're lying churches and and so you've got the main line that you know he gets awoke and he's gonna take on the environmental movement they used to be a stop in the Underground Railroad you mean that's that that's what they're riffing on the the prosperity church or they don't want to get into politics at all and shut up about the put shut up about the industrialist who's you know polluting the earth and you know it just lays out the poverty of the church on the American scene and now in that way I thought the movie was the movie was genius I thought the movie disappointed in its you know we in a sense you know as a pastor the movie peers into this the heart of the tortured pastor but I guess to me what what's frustrating about that is most good pastors I know are tortured to one degree or another you can't live you can't you can't live in you can't do this work without a degree of torture because you are you are always being faced on the one hand with the the pain of this world which is ever-present because people come to you with their pain because because they're in pain and they need help the pain pain shared is pain divided but as a pastor you want to imagine that you can resolve their pain and more often than not you can't and so you could let's say go to the go the the one route and says well the church ought to always be able to immediately heal the sick that's the Galilean ministry the the irony of the of the entire ministry of Christ is that he comes to a point where the only way he can address the the only way he can actually address the suffering of the world is to take it all on himself and so again towards the end of the movie we've almost got the moment of thinking is I can't think his name I think of his name too is the pastor going to take on the sins of the world and obviously well so first he's gonna be a suicide bomber well that's Jesus wasn't that Jesus didn't say I'm taking you Romans with me no so then he wraps himself with the with when he was watching the video the suicide bomber that of the video he watched like the people around it were all okay so it seemed like it was a explosion that it was smaller in scale I don't know if like it would take on the entire church itself but I remember seeing like this person just walking out in the open in the video that we was watching and then the people around him were still like getting up so it could be that he had a large enough amount of explosives to blow up the entire thing but anyway he wasn't willing to risk at least hurting the woman so but so that's an interesting point that it didn't catch so you think perhaps he was willing to in a rather exhibitionist way take his own life as a martyr but not take the rest of the museum and the industrialist with him now I don't think he had enough to actually take on the entire thing I think it was definitely a like like a Buddhist monk lighting himself on fire something like that where it was a expression of the point that he's trying to get across it he obviously didn't care much whether or not the people all these higher-up businessmen got injured or all that at all from the explosion but as soon as she came that's when he knew he couldn't risk her or her unborn child's life within her to be damaged or especially psychologically damaged maybe from that yeah yeah well it's interesting how in the movie none of the pastors or the churches actually bear witness to Christ in a way that the imagined viewer of the movie could respect what do you mean by that well so we know that the you know so we know that the main the mainline pastor is drinking himself to death and he's you know when confronted with hey what's with all the bottles in the trash here buddy so so the mainline pastor well he's got a drinking problem he's about to have a problem with a young hot widow you know he's he's flirting with becoming an echo terrorist the prosperity he had an extramarital affair with the woman that was trying to help him that's right forgot about that so he had had an affair he calls off the affair with and this woman seems to deeply care for him but she high up in the prosperity church and leading that watching that little watching that little quartet sing at the woman's direction that just brought me back to how many painful services in the 70s is like oh Schrader if you could only if you only went to a church like this currently you'd have so much more material to work from that strips off the veil of the church where actually like what when you experience church like and you hear the magical singing in the organ playing it's all expressions of God but when you when you're within the church and you're like listening to them going through the practice it completely ruins the illusion it's like learning a magician's tricks from the inside kind of it well and the you know I sometimes look at some of John Crist he's a he's a he's a comedian he had this church hunters video that in part one and two where you have this young this young couple doing their church shopping and they're going through all that they're looking for and I watched this and I'm thinking Schrader if you only knew that it is that it is so much worse than what you're portraying and well maybe not so much on the mainline side because I think Schrader I think he's been hanging out with the mainlines that's that's where he's been going to church and you know when you look at other videos where he talks about you know where he's where he himself is gone in terms of his Christianity so he gets he accurately portrays the desperation of the mainline but he doesn't fully he doesn't fully understand the desperation of the prosperity church and where what what American culture has done to the church and this is such hard stuff to talk about because the church is always the church is the church is always in this world a compromised witness because our capacity to bear witness to Christ yet on this side of our consummation is in fact compromised and it's compromised by us and so I think that aspect of the movie yeah bringing it back to Moses like God has the desire to kill all the Israelites because they created this idol and Moses is the one like don't do that gosh just put an entirely bad name on yourself it's like yeah the role of those that can experience the infinite it is to make it feels weird to say but like water it down so that those that can't experience it in its fullness can at least have something and then hopefully come to a greater place like like Joshua becoming that that next Moses essentially which kind of brings me I guess to some sort of theme within because there was the woman that he had the affair with that actually loved him and was trying saw how he was destroying himself both psychologically and physically through his drinking and her desire to keep him from doing that but for for the pastor himself it her being near him was a constant reminder of I guess his own fallibility because that when he actually committed that well he said he didn't consider it sin but it is kind of this like you can see he has this self-deprecating self-harming sensibility to him so that anyone that was wanting him to actually get better doesn't realize just how bad he is it's like yeah kind of like what I was saying with with the dream I had had that one time where when you're it when you're in the presence of something so much better than yourself it like Peterson says it is a judge against you your ideal constantly judges you and so for you to be in the presence of that ideal it is something that makes you hate hate your own your own self and so for him that ultimately almost went into suicide suicide for a good cause with within it but it was still him harnessing the hatred he had for himself up until the point where he could I guess let go of that and to accept the love of the the widow the Mary type figure and her name her name was Mary it's really interesting in terms of the character to be kept the pastor because remember his backstory was that he encouraged his son to go to Iraq oh yeah and his son was killed so you almost get the sense that okay he had bought into he had bought into the the brand of American nationalism civil religion and been you know that you know that then became corrupted so now he goes so he had that the right had failed him and so now he turns to the left and the left is failing him and he he can't he can't he doesn't he's he's a hollow man and so one of the one of the scenes that really struck me was when he's talking to Mary's husband who's the echo terrorist who himself will kill himself who's the echo terrorist I was listening him to him talk to this echo terrorist and think I don't know any pastor who would talk to someone like this that that could have been the most amazing part of the movie but kind of true to form that the pastor's words were so completely empty and bankrupt and the pastor knew his admonitions were bankrupt he had nothing to say to this individual who was looking at the and I know I always get crap for this in the comment section I'm not a climate change skeptic okay so I get crap for that but look at the sobering you know the sobering prognostications in terms of what we are pumping into the atmosphere and the oceans in terms of unleashing carbon via fossil fuels I listen to him and I think you you don't know the gospel at all you know that that that was at least the prosperity pastor had he had something more than than the mainline pastor than the yeah well yeah so I know just a few minutes but that that does bring up kind of the the the theme where Ethan Hawke is within a church that has very few members still still actually coming to it it's almost like he he's part of a a dead religion and he's still like the last person that's holding on to it and then there's the prosperity gospel yeah yeah and then there's the prosperity gospel who have just altered christ's message so that it can fit the the modern youth and absolutely self-serving that's yeah it's absolutely self-serving so this that this religion that is supposed to be about around a man who does the ultimate thing in self-sacrifice now is represented by an institution that is completely self-serving yeah I mean yeah that that's a strong a strong critique of Christianity especially how it's been twisted from Jesus or within like Nietzsche's book the Antichrist he has nothing but good things to say about Christ himself but everything bad to say about how the church has basically made it so that people did not need to follow in Christ's footsteps because of his the watching away of sins that gave people the the freedom to continue their their normal lives but it it's still necessary because if you are in such a position that say you you hate yourself and what you've become you need some sort of method of actually reviving your your spirit because if you have complete nihilism and hatred for yourself your that gives you absolutely nothing that you can do in order to cross continue forward anyway the two sides of it are you've got cheap grace on one hand you know Bonhoeffer's term where you Jesus says I died for your sins you say thanks you know off I go and then you have the Messiah complex on the other which says I don't need a savior I'll save myself and it's it's the two different it's the two different sides of it now I don't think the mainline pastor doesn't know grace in the movie because yes he is trying to save the world and he is you know he becomes the martyr and that's part of the reason that I always use the Heideberg catechism structure in my sermons of misery deliverance gratitude because that the antidote to cheap grace is not moral castigation it's gratitude because the problem with the problem with you know addressing cheap grace with law is that it also empties Christ and Christianity of the gospel then it just becomes then it just becomes more self-salvationism and so the I thought I think the Heideberg catechism nicely sets it up and says misery first of all you can't save yourself and that addresses both because to the messianic person you're not God enough to save yourself or this world and to the cheap grace people you have no idea and this is one thing I love about Peterson you have no idea about your capacity to destroy yourself and the world and do it willingly and happily and all along the way think you're a pretty good person that's who we really are and that's how bad we really are and so you know you need a savior as big as Jesus to do it for you because you can't do it yourself okay now that he's done it now what if you say oh gee thanks you're you're you're still you don't get it you don't see yourself and this is where you get into John Calvin's point that in order to know the gospel you must know yourself and you must know God they they because they both work together and I know that that goes in a lot of interesting ways but sorry to jump in with a sermon I don't have a one o'clock so we got a little bit more time so okay yeah I guess just kind of finishing up yeah I see how much of the the movie is about a man who has lost his faith and has lost grace like he's lost all of the cheerful acceptance of suffering and it's just accepted kind of his punishment of suffering yeah yeah it's there's no hope for the man there's no hope in his world and the only hope is Mary and the baby that she has which for me when he ends up making out with her it's like that just was crushing because maybe maybe she represents redemption in the movie and hope for a future because because remember her husband did not want to have a child because there's no hope in this world and she wasn't ready to buy that and it's like pastor if you could it's right in front of you well maybe Schrader maybe that's where maybe that's why Schrader has Mary pregnant at the end of the movie maybe that's the hope in the movie I don't know but the pastor can't keep his hands off her yeah yeah it's kind of like three different positions that are all not well fitting with each other like Mary who is kind of like free of inhibitions somewhat and is willing to do this weird kind of sexualized thing with with the pastor without I mean there was no like with her in her own mind I don't think there was any sexual aspect to it but just watching it it is very strange well the making out with her I mean oh yeah yeah at the very end and that's you know the weird thing I could say okay this is I could go there symbolically but when at the end he's just making out with her it's like oh oh the one the one piece of hope in the movie pregnant Mary that no one else can see maybe I don't know who knows no images I reread I reread I had a long car trip yesterday reread the audio book we listened to amusing ourselves to death and I always feel a little guilty listening to amusing ourselves to death just because that book but you know it's oh where was I going with this well well she's you know she is kind of the the hope the hope in the movie and authors when you make it here's the crazy thing about images when you make an image this is partially true of literature too also true of literature you never quite know all that the image will communicate and movie makers have that a lot they really good movies probably even the makers of the movies didn't think through all of the interesting lines of what they created that doesn't mean that it's detached from it but it's just fruitful that way so anyway well well you didn't tell me anything about yourself who are you John and yeah sorry about that you want me to pause it now so that doesn't go on YouTube I don't know what you want to do no that's all right I'm kind of I guess a middle of the ground type religious person where my parents are kind of ex-hippies and kind of took on the position of anti-establishment religion and are more involved with the like Hebrew roots I don't know if you're familiar with any of that it's the Christian Jewish yeah yeah the messianic Christian community and so I wanted to get a fuller understanding I guess of my own or a fuller understanding of what religion was I guess and that's how I kind of started to get involved with Peterson and then from him just kind of expounding outwards into a lot of other different types of fields and things like that it's very interesting because like originally like listening to Sam Harris on Joe Rogan podcast I recognize within myself that I guess I didn't have the strong enough roots to combat Sam Harris's types positions and like I knew that if I were to go further down that road I could very easily lead become a Sam Harris type or atheist type objectivist type something like that and so I kind of took flocked over to Peterson to get a better understanding and I think that that's just been so much more helpful for myself and my walk and trying to understand all of this it's been yeah great actually just great for me and so for the last year I've been involved with an online Jordan Peterson just kind of discussion group where we went through his lectures and some of the recommendations of his books that he's done and we kind of like meet each week and talk about it so anybody listening if you want to join it's the joanbpetersson.com community is our website and it has like all the different links to the group and the forums things like that and so if you want to participate we we host it for anybody to join but yeah and I don't know I don't know why I really scheduled a meeting with you it's just something very strange to see like a youtuber to do this type of thing where I guess that's what I consider you is some sort of youtuber and just put it like how many meetings do you do like on an average week it's gross yeah because I noticed your schedule and you have like it's mostly blocked for this day you gotta like schedule two days in advance depending upon how long of a conversation you want to have to it's so cool that you're actually doing this well I'm a pastor I mean I'm yeah for a second but now you're a pastor and this is now you're an internet pastor I'm an internet pastor this is what pastors do we talk to people do we talk to people and because you know I mean you are on there with Robert and most most of the conversations I do I don't post because most people are not interested in being up on YouTube which is probably a probably a pretty wise thing but no and to me it's this has been this has been fascinating I mean I pastor I don't pastor a church like the pastor in first reformed and I'm not a pastor like the pastor at first reformed but no it's to me this is cool this is this is just fun so and the fact that anybody else cares to watch just yeah it's so weird yeah like like from your channel I've been also like uh been watching Noden and Network yeah he's got such in-depth stuff and like I'm reading maps of meaning now and like he's bringing a lot of the pieces together it's so so incredible this weird expansion that Peterson has and then like everyone connected to him kind of has too it's super nerdy it is super well thank you it's fun this yeah yeah so what what is that website again say it again Jordan yeah it's dot community yeah dot community and yeah we meet up every Friday night and Saturday morning and then we usually have like a a regrouping call or something on on the Sunday after that but and yeah how is it it's just online yeah it's an online thing so we've got people in India Australia uh places in the US Sweden as well is it a discord server or how do you do it's like this it's a it's a video call yeah that we do oh wow so you might get a few more after I post this yeah hopefully I mean it's still pretty small so if anyone wants to join you are more than welcome to participate so okay well there you go thank you John great talk yeah thank you Paul yeah thanks this was great nice
