 Hi, this is Paul and it's Friday so it's rough draft for Sunday time. I am preaching this week at Living Stones and we have gone through the book of Kings and I'm going to be dipping into a variety of the prophets for the next little while. And we're going to begin with Jonah. Now I found a very interesting YouTube channel by Will Schroeder as he makes some really excellent videos and one of the videos that he makes is why every story is the same. Now he goes into Joseph Campbell and before there was Jordan Peterson there was Joseph Campbell and as we discussed in our meetup, a couple of our last meetup, Joseph Campbell was highly influential when Jordan Peterson was just a young man coming up and Joseph Campbell talked about the monomyth and you can read this in the hero with a thousand faces and here is, I'm taking a bunch of these graphics from Will Schroeder's YouTube and Will Schroeder does a terrific job walking through this whole thing and he uses Star Wars as an example and a friend at the meetup had told me that in fact George Lucas talked a lot to Joseph Campbell when he put Star Wars together so it all follows nicely and you have the call to adventure, supernatural aid, threshold of the guardians, challenges and temptations, the abyss, death and rebirth, transformation, atonement, the gift of the goddess and you have this hero's journey which is the monomyth which is sort of a circle. Now I've also been watching some Northrop Frye, again for those of you, probably won't put all this Jordan Peterson stuff in the sermon, but for those of you who are waiting for Jordan Peterson's biblical series, one thing you might look for is that there are recordings on, not on YouTube, but on the web of Northrop Frye and if you watch Note in the Network, Note in the Network has been diving into the notes in Maps of Meaning and finding a lot of Northrop Frye and you can find a whole series of lectures that Northrop Frye gave on the Bible as literature and this is in the second lecture where Northrop Frye talks about the pattern of nearly every biblical story, it's in fact even the pattern of the Bible itself where you have infidelity, bondage, return and deliverance and this U shape is in a sense it's not exactly a circle, some people like to look at these things as spirals, but it's a return and it's a new return so there's an element of alignment with Joseph Campbell's hero's journey as a circle, but here you have a U and actually Northrop Frye will have a series of U's, a series of Ups and Downs throughout the Old Testament and of course the story of the Bible begins in a garden and ends in a garden within a city and all of this. Now one of the observations that Frye makes is that he says that this is the dominant pattern of the story, episodes follow it, the book itself follows it, it's all nested within but it's almost always this comedic format and he said of all the parables that Jesus told the only one that doesn't fit it is Luke 15, the parable of the prodigal son, but if you listen to Northrop Frye he was not a biblical scholar, his study was in literature and I think he makes a lot of very helpful contributions to the field of biblical scholarship but I would see his, I would challenge his take on the story of the prodigal son which is the common story amongst just about everybody evangelical main line but I like what Kenneth Bailey, let's see if I have one of Kenneth Bailey's books here, I like what Kenneth Bailey does with Luke 15 and Kenneth Bailey has made Luke 15 the virtual, almost his career and so Northrop Frye here says that the prodigal son voluntarily returns but there's a nature in which the prodigal son does not voluntarily return, he is forced to return by hunger, he is forced to return by desperation and as we get into the story of Jonah you might see where I think Frye is right in integrating this element but it's not the kind of story that we tend to like in our culture where we go into bondage and we free ourselves and then suddenly we are in control and we see things right and then we create the new world and so now as we go, we take a look at the book of Jonah and I'm going to contrast it with, I'm going to contrast it with Dan Harmon who Will Schroeder brings out in his video as kind of cleaning up and simplifying Joseph Campbell's monomyth a bit, Dan Harmon talks about the story circle and it has these eight phases and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to read the book of, the first two chapters of the book of Jonah, next week we're going to do the next two chapters but this is the most, chapter one is the most famous part of the book of Jonah and it's usually the part of the book of Jonah that people know if they know anything of it. Now this is a problem because the book of Jonah, if you only know chapter one in the book of Jonah you don't know the book of Jonah and over these next two weeks we're going to see that but I'm going to read the book of Jonah and I'm going to, as I read it I'm going to track it with Dan Harmon's story circle which is derived from Joseph Campbell's circle and we're going to keep Northup Fry's you in the back of our minds and we're going to try to see, understand the book of Jonah more clearly by contrasting it with probably the most famous story in America today, the story of the original Star Wars that came out in 1975 and we're going to ask, want to ask ourselves what kind of a story is Jonah and really what kind of a book is the Bible? Is Jonah the hero of the story? What is his mission? What will the point of the story be? In some ways we're going to have to wait for that, wait for that until next week and what we're going to see are these nested episodes within nested stories so this week chapters one and two, next week chapters three and four so if you can't wait until next week you can always read ahead but you're going to have to wait until next week to see how I treat it. The book begins, now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amittai saying, this is the first verse and here we have in a sense the protagonist, I might change the slide, hang on, this is like I always say this is rough draft so I often pause the video, move slides around, add things, this is part of my sermon process so the story begins and the story has a protagonist and part of the way stories work is that the reason stories have protagonists is because we like to identify with the story, we like to live into the story, the story is a kind of thing that we try out things in a mental way so that we don't have to risk our bodies and our lives with them in a very physical way and so the first step of the story is the introduction to the protagonist and usually what happens is that you meet somebody initially but you keep looking for a better protagonist and so Star Wars for example opens with R2D2 and C3PO and the movie fades and as Jude Reines and well Schroeder actually says it's nice because you're kind of afloat and we're going to have water and a bunch of those kind of things in the story of Jonah too so here we have Jonah the son of Amati and the word of the Lord comes to him. Well what does this mean and who is Jonah? Well we know a little bit about Jonah. Jonah pops up actually, popped up actually in the book of in the book of second kings and Jonah is a prophet in the northern kingdom during the time of Jeroboam the second and those of you who might not remember your history of the northern kingdom Jeroboam the second was on one hand considered an evil king because he followed the ways of Jeroboam the first and he did not follow the Lord but he was also a successful king because at this point again we've talked about this before Syria is struggling with its own dysfunction Egypt is struggling with its own dysfunction and actually Amaziah or Uzziah from the northern kingdom and the northern kingdom are both doing very very well at this moment and this gets reflected in verse 26 the Lord had seen how bitterly everyone in Israel whether slave or free was suffering and there's no one to help them and since the Lord had not said he would blot them out the name of the Lord under heaven he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam. So here you have this here you have this example of how the Bible is is not really karma because we all expect that well if someone is successful they're good and if someone is evil they're bad if someone does good things and they'll be rewarded with good things and if someone is evil they'll be rewarded they'll be punished with bad things but here you find an evil king Jeroboam the second who in the manner of the world is is very very successful and the northern kingdom flourishes at this point and and this is the time that we meet this man Jonah who is a prophet and he's a prophet so the word of the Lord comes to him and it's his job to do what God says to speak the word of the Lord that's that's what the call of the prophet is so the word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amati and now there's an evil empire and the evil empire is Assyria and Assyria and again if you go back over my sermon series and in second Kings Assyria was a very evil empire and they were a real problem and they would in fact eventually destroy the northern kingdom and so everyone in the northern kingdom knew who their enemy was and while they often fought the Arameans or the Syrians just north of them when the Assyrians would come along even local rivals would band together to try to hold back the great evil empire and so here of course in Star Wars you have Luke Skywalker he's out on Tatooine and you know he's nobody he's got the sense of mission in his past but but his uncle is keeping it from him but now suddenly he sees this recording of a beautiful princess saying help me Obi-Wan and hmm not all is right in Tatooine not all is right in the galaxy things are in trouble and so the hero the protagonist is charged with a mission arise go to Nineveh that great city and call against it for the evil has come up before me now this should be exactly the kind of thing that Jonah wants to hear because Nineveh is the great city is the capital of the evil empire Assyria and God is calling him to go to Nineveh and to declare it as evil to call it out to call a condemnation on it and Jonah should be ready to go to do this just like Luke Skywalker is ready to get off of Tatooine and get out into the big world and save the princess and and he doesn't even know what he's going to do but he just knows he wants to go so he's got to find Ben Kenobi and hear about Jedi's and lightsabers and and off he's going to go but Jonah rose and fled to Tarshish which is the other way from the presence of the Lord he went down now one of the things that I'm using this particular translation for the sermon partly because this translation preserves some of the some of the elements of Hebrew there's a there's a lot of spatial elements in the text of Jonah there's ups and there's downs and arise go but he doesn't arise and go he doesn't go up he goes down and he flees to Tarshish he doesn't go north east he goes south west from the presence of the Lord now now that is going to be keen you're going to want to watch that phrase as we go and you're going to see it in fact repeated because well where is the presence of the Lord well it's it's in his temple in Jerusalem it's in it's amongst his people and it's in fact wherever you go in the will of the Lord you're going with the presence of the Lord and this is in fact something that will be worked out throughout the prophets especially when you get to Ezekiel that I did a long Sunday school class which you can find on on my church channel on YouTube but arise but he rose and then he fled to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord and he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish so he paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish away from the presence of the Lord Jonah is going the other way and he is running from the presence of the Lord so is Jonah our hero or is Jonah an antihero you know an antihero is a protagonist to a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism courage and morality and at this point we don't really know why Jonah is doing this and we're not really going to find this out until the third and the fourth chapter and the question of motivation is vitally important here even though we're not going to deal with it in this sermon today we're going to deal with it next week but all we know is that Jonah goes now this is we're left in tension here as any good story does and the tension is built up in us and we wonder why is he fleeing from the presence of the Lord where could you flee from the presence of the Lord and a Hebrew would have it would have the Psalms in the back of their mind where can I flee from your presence well if I go down to the depths of the earth you are there if I go to the highest heavens you are there can you flee from the presence of the Lord how is the presence of the Lord related to obedience how is the presence of the Lord related to identity and fulfilling a mission and how is he an antihero well if he is an antihero then what kind of story is this although antiheroes may sometimes do the right thing well he's not going to do the right thing it's not always for the right reasons it's often acting primarily out of self interest is Jonah acting out of self interest is he afraid of Nineveh see I get this is just a masterful story because all of these questions flood our mind if in fact we know something about the context of the story and we wonder is he going to defy conventional ethical codes is he going to defy the will of the Lord well that's about all we know right now that he that God has told him to do something and Jonah has a mind of his own he's finally thinking for himself which we all think is a noble quality he's thinking for himself he's being a rebel and he's going to flee from the presence of the Lord and so he goes down to Tarsha down to Joppa down into the ship going to go away to Tarsus to the other end of the world to flee from God's presence now we go to section four in the story circle which is the search it's the road of trials as Joseph Campbell says and as Will Schroeder says nothing can save you here Luke goes into face Luke begins to learn the force but then as he's learning his ship gets captured by the Empire's Death Star and they infiltrate the you know they're in the midst of it there's the tension there's the chaos but the Lord hurled a great wind upon the sea and there was a mighty tempest on the sea so that the ship threatened to break it up now one of the things if you pay attention to Jonah and you know anything about other parts in the Bible should pay attention to the early parts of Genesis and all of these elements you have the sea you have the wind in fact Genesis one opens with the sea which is Tohu Wavohu and the spirit of the Ruach the wind the spirit of God hovering over the waters well here we have the great wind upon the sea and there is a mighty tempest on the sea so that the ship threatened to break up look at this we're in a ship you got Star Wars ship here you have a ship on the sea there you had a ship in space then the mariners were afraid and each cried out to his own God and they hurled the cargo that was on the ship into the sea to lighten it for them but Jonah had he's still going down had gone down into the inner part of the ship and laying down and was fast asleep now nothing in this story is incidental or accidental everything in this story is intentional okay so that the captain came so the captain comes down to find Jonah what do you mean you sleeper what do you mean what do you mean Jonah what what how is this there there is something there is meaning here in this story arise call on your God do what every normal person would do in the ancient world which would be call on your individual God to see whatever God you have a relationship with whatever God you have paid into the service of whatever God you have invested yourself in call on this God and maybe this God can save us from the chaos of the waters perhaps the God will come and give a thought to us that we may not perish now here's a little something else that's important you look at this word tempest and it's a special word in Hebrew and so if you have the right software or you have a strong concordance where you can look at the little numbers or sometimes there are programs on the internet that you can do this you do a little textual search and find out what is this storm well this is the storm that the Lord answered Job out of in the whirlwind this storm comes up in the Psalms you usually find a lot of the symbolic language it's applied in the Psalms this is where God speaks in Ezekiel 1 when God shows up to the now exiled priest Ezekiel way out in a refugee camp by Babylon I looked and behold the stormy wind came out from the north in a great cloud and brightness in it and fire flashed forth fire flashing forth continually in the midst of the fire there was gleaming metal there's the stormy wind this is the tempest this is the this is the presence of God this is when God shows up heaven and earth quake at his presence but but the sailors are all looking for a God Jonah is sleeping in the bottom of the boat why is he sleeping he is avoiding this God he is fleeing from his this presence he is fleeing from his presence into unconsciousness he is trying to get away they're all calling out is there a God is there a God and Jonah's like oh yeah there's a God and we're right in the middle of him you're not you're not waking me up to something I don't know I'm intentionally trying to sleep through him and I will endanger all of you in the boat just to try to live in my willful blindness now one of the things Will Schroeder points out is that in this circle there's this transition from top to bottom which is a transition from life into death it's a transition from consciousness into unconsciousness it's a transition from order which is the dry land to chaos which is the sea and you see all of this in the story of Jonah now point five is find and Joseph Campbell calls this meeting the goddess and now this this is usually now again if you every story is the same if you go to the movies at some point the hero who is usually a man now Joseph Campbell will go into this and I know there's this gets this gets you know testy with a whole bunch of people because you know masculine feminine male female all this stuff that we're fighting about now but generally speaking the man is the hero and then there's a woman and she's a beautiful woman but in this woman and then this is always often played in all sorts of things but what's interesting here is there's no woman in the story Jonah this is not a romantic story in fact there are no there are no women characters in this story at all and some of you might say yeah that's why we should put the Bible away okay well Princess Leia finds Princess Leia in the center of the Death Star and what is she doing she's sleeping then they said to one another these are the sailors come let us cast lots that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us so then they casted lots and the lot fell on Jonah then they said to him tell us on whose account this evil has come upon us what is your occupation where did you come from what is your country and what are and and of what people are you this calamity has fallen us because of you Jonah you are responsible for this mess and he is and he is not going to deny it and he said to them I am a Hebrew and I fear the Lord the God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land your God made the sea this chaotic sea that we're terrified of as Hebrews and the dry land this place of stability where God brings order to the world then the men were exceedingly afraid because they you know they all they were spiritual but not too religious they all had their little gods and they all worked their little gods to give them their little fortunes in their little place in life but here they meet Jonah and Jonah is the real deal he's a prophet and he fears the God of heaven and earth he fears the big God at the top of the hierarchy he fears the God that is in charge and everybody there knows it and they're like you know you really you know we we like we'd rather keep our little spiritual gods down here below we don't want to deal with the big God we'd like to we'd like to stay as small people in a small story what is this that you have done now that has lots of layers because you surely must have done something to anger this God who is now very much all around us and threatening our lives and you brought us into it the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord oh but you can't flee from the presence of the Lord because the Lord was very present at that moment and they were terrified point six take meet your maker oh yeah Obi-Wan sacrifices himself creating a distraction that allows the party to escape the Death Star this is where this is where the hero or the antihero or the protagonist is forced to act the captain goes down to the bottom of the boat and wakes up Jonah then they said to him what should we do to you that the sea may quiet down for us seems like they want to flee from the presence of God to this terrible presence for the sea grew more and more tempestuous he said to them pick me up and hurl me into the sea is Jonah a hero he's acting like a hero he's he's now for the first time instead of putting the other sailors at risk because of his attempting to flee from God now he takes up the mantle in this moment and acts like a hero and practices the welfare of the soldiers at his expense pick me up and hurl me into the sea but now notice Jonah doesn't hurl himself into the sea he wants them to do it for him so how much of a hero is he then the sea will quiet down for you for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you yeah I'm trying to flee from the presence of the Lord and if I flee from the temple of the Lord where he is present where I can where I can be in that aspect of his presence I will discover the other aspect of his presence the one that terrifies me nevertheless the men rode harder to get to dry land they're spiritual but not religious they are okay okay we're going to manage this we call to our gods that didn't work now we're going to rely on ourselves because notice Jonah doesn't throw himself into the sea Jonah says for them to throw him into the sea but they could not for the sea grew more and more tempestuous around them you cannot your arms are too short to box with God you cannot beat this God oh small little human being you're working your little spiritual but not religious gods you're trying to you're trying to you're trying to muster all the little spiritual bribes that you've given in order to make life work but you are no match you are no match you are no match for this God for this God of heaven and earth for this God of the sea and the grunt of the dry land for this God that is that is not some minor actor floating around in the universe but the maker of heaven and earth therefore they called out to the Lord they're done being spiritual but not religious it's time for them to meet their maker it's time for them to get serious about their lives it's time for them to stop playing games with their little gods and their little bribes are they on a hero's journey who is the hero therefore they called out to the Lord oh Lord let us not perish for this man's life let's not die on account of him and lay not on us innocent blood for you oh Lord have done as it has as it has pleased you now now you begin to see their problem Jonah has not thrown himself into sea that would be a hero move Jonah has said you need to throw me into the sea oh what are we beginning to see in Jonah we're beginning to see a pattern we're beginning to see that when Jonah acts Jonah acts in his own self-interest Jonah acts in order to get away from God Jonah acts in a way that Jonah doesn't have to act Jonah is avoidant these people know if they throw him in well now his blood will be on their hands Jonah keeps putting them at risk Jonah keeps wanting to have his welfare be at the expense of the sailors but now they have no other choice so they picked so they picked up notice up should put that in the slide hang on gotta pause so they picked up Jonah and they hurled him down into the sea and the sea ceased from its raging oh this is a language these pagan sailors can understand then the men feared the Lord exceedingly remember how this started when Jonah introduced himself first words in the Bible are almost always important Jonah explains himself I fear the Lord really Jonah what is your fear of the Lord like this this fear of the Lord that seems so binary and is sometimes he fears the Lord she doesn't fear the Lord Jonah fears the Lord now the sailors fear the Lord Jonah's disobedience has raw faith in the hearts of the pagan sailors now it's a certain kind of faith but they fear the Lord and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows hmm but what what is the nature of our relationship with God Jonah seems to be an amazing evangelist even when he does wrong the rest of the world is coming to God which is the Old Testament mission point seven return bringing it home they successfully fight off an attack on the ship and they return to the rebellion encampment to plot their attack on the Death Star but Luke is bummed because Obi-Wan is gone and Leia is with him and kiss your sister kiss your sister yeah a little sorting out needs to be done in the in the whole Star Wars story and the Lord appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in now now this is very interesting this always makes me think of Kierkegaard despair unto death because Kierkegaard tells the story of you know what if you what if you despaired in life so much that you took your own life only to discover that ending your physical body wasn't in fact a ceasing of your identity and your conscious self and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish saying I called out to the Lord out of my distress and he answered me out of the belly of Sheol I cried and I heard and you heard my voice got out of slide now if you look at Joseph Campbell's formula this is the death of Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights he was in the death and rebirth phase and in fact in another video Joseph Campbell and the myth of the hero's journey they in fact use they in fact use Jonah as an example of death and rebirth and and and this is death and rebirth of a sort and it's three days and three nights of course we think about Jesus and and his resurrection and he's in the belly of the fish he prays from in a sense Sheol he's he's dead but he's not dead and and and here Jonah has a change of heart there's a transformation that's supposed to occur but we're only in the chapter two will a transformation occur we have lots of transformations in life we have lots of turning points in life we have lots of moments when we cry out to God and we're rescued and we and we make vows and we say I'll never again do this thing only to do it again and again and Jonah in fact sings a psalm in the belly of the fish for you cast me into the deep into the heart of the seas who who who who cast you in Jonah did the sailors cast you in did you cast yourself in did God cast you in how does God act how does God work how does his agency work you cast me into the deep into the heart of the seas or maybe the sailors cast them in but Jonah understands who's in control of this story who is the real agent moving history and the flood surrounded me all of your waves and your billows passed over me then I said I am driven from your sight that was your point wasn't it Jonah you drove yourself from his sight yet I shall again look upon your holy temple what is the temple the temple is the place of the presence of God but you fled from his presence Jonah the waters closed in over me to take my life the deep surrounded me the chaos the deep the Tohu of Ohu the reeds wrapped around my head at the roots of the mountain I went down to the land whose bars closed me in forever yet you brought me up you brought up my life from the pit read the Psalms you'll hear this again and again and again this happens to Jonah in the bottom of the ocean it happens to people in the pit of bankruptcy in the pit of despair in the pit of divorce in the pit of cancer in the pit of all of these things this this this thing scales from from physical to metaphorical and back and forth and back and forth and if you say well it's just metaphorical no no no no no it's every layer when my life was fainting away I remembered the Lord and my prayers came to you into your holy temple you heard me because that's where you sit those who pay regard to vain idols oh you mean the sailors those who pay regard to the vain idols forsake their hope for steadfast love you know the gods of the sailors didn't deliver them but I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you Jonah this is quite a departure from what we saw in view in chapter one that I have vowed I will pay big words from the belly of the fish salvation belongs to the Lord now I will read you the story of Jonah the hero is Jonah the hero has he changed this is only chapter two got to look at next week now Joseph Campbell in his schema Jonah will emerge from the belly of the fish he'll be vomited up onto dry land the place of order but but what will he now be the new will he now be the master of both worlds will he be master of the watery world and the dry land will he now march to Nineveh the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time arise go to Nineveh that great city and call out against the message I tell you will he go to Nineveh you can read the story we'll get there next week if he goes to Nineveh does that mean the transformation has been completed does that mean he will now faithfully follow the Lord we still don't know why he ran from the presence he had this this reconversion this recommitment in the belly of the fish but but but will it stick is Jonah a hero story is Jonah the hero of the story how does his trip to the underworld change him who understands the biblical stories Northup Frye or Joseph Campbell is it a you is it a circle I'm going to add a couple pictures here who understands the biblical story better Thry or Campbell or is the story different from both of them now now now Frye makes the point again that the pattern of the biblical story which seems very much the pattern of this story all others depend on human confession of helplessness and divine intervention that's certainly what we saw here well well Jonah Jonah didn't Jonah's helplessness was was was not was it sincere he didn't throw himself in the water he he had the sailors throw him in the water at their expense at at their risk now who is the pride who has primary agency in this story who is the main actor who is the hero of this story does Jonah use his agency how does Jonah use his agency every time Jonah makes a move he's avoiding he's avoiding the presence of the Lord he's avoiding becoming the hero he's avoiding throwing himself into the sea he has the sailors do it how is Jonah's agency nested in God's plan well that's a lot harder because God's plan is a lot harder because God told Jonah what to do and then Jonah went the other way and then you're going to flee from my presence I will show up in the sea you think you can flee from me you think your little sailors they're they're spiritual but not religious gods can somehow stand against me Jonah does Jonah not know God we're going to look at that in chapters three and four maybe Jonah knows God too well maybe Jonah flees from God because he in fact knows him but then Jonah has to resign himself to the fact that he cannot flee from God he will find God in the temple or God in the tempest and he's going to have to pick so he's he's hemmed in behind and before is Jonah the agent here he certainly has agency he certainly is making decisions he certainly is making consequential choices does Jonah get what he wants well he seems kind of happy and his saw him in the belly of the fish does Jonah know what he wants does Jonah suffer does Jonah's agency bring suffering how does the morality of the Israelite who fears God compare to the morality of the pagan sailors notice how the Israelites faithlessness and the tempest of the Lord set up the situation where the pagan sailors begin to fear the Lord exceedingly and make sacrifices and vows how does this tell what does this tell you about how God uses his servants salvation is of the Lord is very much the theme sentence of the book and in my opinion the theme sentence of the Bible who is the hero of the story what dissent does the hero undertake he doesn't take it willingly he even gets the sailors to throw him in how do Jonah and Jesus parallel three days in the fish three days in the tomb is Jesus a better Jonah where does Jesus go does he flee from God's presence when he comes to earth he's not fleeing or does he hear the command of the Lord and come into this world and go into this chaos and spend three days in Sheol we're only half done it's only chapter two do you identify with Jonah do you identify with the protagonist how and why have you fled maybe you identify with the little pagan sailors maybe you're spiritual but not religious maybe you're either trying to work your little spiritual schemes to get to get your world to shape up as you want maybe you're rowing like crazy back to the dry land how should this inform your reflections on your suffering who's bringing your suffering have you fled from God's temple only to meet him in the tempest are you renewed by your travels to the bottom of the sea so many people that I know will tell me I would not be the person I am today if I had not gone into the pit it is the journey in the pit it is the journey in the pit that made me who I am today but most of them will also say and God isn't finished with me yet how does your experience of God's past rescue change you we'll see how it changes Jonah we'll see if Jonah is master of both worlds now or if Jonah is still just kind of not that good is that us is that you is the change permanent the Solomon chapter 2 those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love but I with a voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you what I have vowed I will pay who finally has to pay can you pay enough can you actually take maximal responsibility for what you've done in this world for what you've done to this world or do you need someone else who can pay for you salvation belongs to the Lord
