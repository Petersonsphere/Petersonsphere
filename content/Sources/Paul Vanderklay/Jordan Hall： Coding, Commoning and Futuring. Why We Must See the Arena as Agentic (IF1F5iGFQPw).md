 This is Paul. I received an invite to participate in the Stoa this morning and I had the time change messed up and so I thought they were going to be new in California time but they were 9 a.m. California time and so I didn't make it which was a big disappointment to me because what they're discussing today was a very interesting video by Jordan Hall that talks about market, state, laws, norms, and code and then there was a subsequent conversation that the Stoa did where they talked about the sacred and I think in a lot of ways this gets into many of the conversations that I'm having around religion because I think that when Jordan Hall here talks about code it functions very much the way the code and he's going to get into commons very much the way sacred the way prior to the elevation of state which in many ways is a deep has a deep relationship with church because obviously before church state and temple were deeply connected this is this is part of the point that that Tom Holland has been making the Greeks didn't have religion because that categorization is a is a product of Christian ization and so when Jordan Hall here talks about code in a lot of ways that's sort of a modern connection with I think a lot of what Jordan Peterson was doing when Jordan Peterson went with sacrifice because sacrifice was sort of the invention of the future and and again I think Jordan Hall's articulation of code functions in that because he's he's pointing to the ways that market and state are failing and as as many conservatives will know that at least in the American conversation state state can't function as a replacement of religion in that laws can't function as a replacement of religion because laws tend to proliferate and go beyond what law is able to actually capture and and I think this is part of what we're seeing now in the the chafing over new forms of religiosity that we're calling woke I think what they're trying to do is continue to have the state expand but what we what we see happen when the state expands too far as we see totalitarianism because the state tries to the state tries to encroach in space that it where it can't perform and the the founding American fathers understood this in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of religion because the state might be able to manage performance and external behavior but it can't manage the interiority and so part of why we see sort of the new woke religiosity getting totalitarian with respect to state is that it is it is an overreach and and we see that but we we currently don't have a lot of language for it that isn't in our system segregated over to the religious and and secularity sort of functioned as a religious proxy as long as the code was there working but as the code continues to be pushed out we're we're increasingly having this crisis now Jordan Hall's video suffers from all the same things that many of my monologue videos follow from and it also has exactly the same benefit which is he is trying to language and at the end of the video he sort of thanks the audience and I completely understand where he's coming from he's trying to language something that at this point remains quite ineffable we we don't quite know how to talk about this part of the reason we don't know how to talk about this is the continual demand placed on us by pluralism to find more public to find a way to share code and that's what we're trying to do in the space basically and and and that's different so he's going to hear talk about what he means by what he gets into the space and so I'll start the video here a cracking open of the the classic market state false dichotomy and the reinsertion of of commons or commoning and what then happens by the way is a real shift in the notion of which it would market the state was called really are so what we what we most of the time modern Westerners imagine market and state to be I would propose is in fact a very degenerate consequence first and foremost of in fact having them only be in relationship with each other and not in relationship with with the commons I think this is a really key point and when we get into the commons you know when I when I think about commons I think of for example the Boston Common now my my sister and brother-in-law's church is Park Street congregational and it's right there on the Freedom Trail if you take the if you take a tour on the Freedom Trail the tour guides will stop and talk about the importance of the the Park Street Church right on the Boston Common well well what is a common and this is what we're going to get into and the second video that I'm going to play from gets gets more into that question of common and I think I think Jordan is right that you've got market see market is sort of a way to to divinize and and and turn money into an agent okay it's it's in a way a a way to money is a fiction but it's a it's an enchantment mechanism that's what market is we talk about the invisible hand of the market it's it's really an enchanted an enchantment mechanism and and so that's at play here and state of course already is a principality it's already Voltron up into this agentic force in our world and and what Jordan Hall notes is that commons has no agency in our world and in many ways is sort of left defenseless and then when you do actually bring the commons not just in but recognize that it's more fundamental the other two modes shift quite substantially and so I mean this both conceptually but then more importantly practically and I think that opens up what I suspect is the the primary path of what is the most both viable as well as sustainable direction for a future of governance which is why this particular topic is so meaningful to me now now commons there I think it's I think it's easy to note that commons was consumed by government and markets and and this is a function of demand population Brett Weinstein has a really good video early on where he talks about the the process by which species invade by which human beings invade territory that is defenseless and and really in many ways the only in in population growth as a really interesting dynamic here because of Ken if you read Ross Douthat's book on decadence he notes that part of the reason for our decadence is our lack of growth our lack of population growth population growth has negative consequences as well because it puts demand on limited resources and and of course that mother is the necessity is the mother of invention so so all of these dynamics are playing together and so commons is often consumed if you have a if you have a poverty of the sacred and I think if there's something we're seeing the poverty of the sacred is something that is very much connected to decadence as well because because decadence is part of decadence is a lack of the sacred and so there's a lack of boundaries and limitations that that naturally constrain commons will only the the power that commons has to stand up to market and state will be the sacred and so as as as Jordan Hall continues to talk about here is going to to illuminate some of those tools that state has such as law and and talk about how they relate to the commons okay so laws norms and code first pass let's go with norms norms are in some sense very easy norms is the the sort of the field effect or the feedback loop that is oftentimes happening at the strictly hominid a mammalian level and in fact I would say the best thing to think about that is that it's actually grounded in that place so when you walk into a room and you cannot help but be noticing what seems to be sort of the vibe or the appropriateness in the room and you feel like you're fitting in do you feel like you're out what is right what's wrong which is very much happening as subtle signals of rightness and wrongness that are flowing between among people you know I have a two year old daughter and so I get to watch in real time as she's playing with absorbing and fiddling with what is how norms actually work at least within our family culture and for the most part for the vast most part of the vast most part this is not explicit for the vast most part it's actually not even homo sapiens right for the vast most part is mammalian and hominid and then there's the homo sapiens cultural specifics on top of it so it's a big pyramid the metaphor that I'll use to kind of hold all three of these in line is the notion of parking with your wheels turned quote unquote the right way on a hill now is commentary on norms I think is good norms are norms are are deeply inter relational but but norms work on code that is easy yet to easy yet to talk about now now the use of the word code in this conversation is interesting in that it's we're continuing to so there's this adage about we always use the metaphors of our current level of technology and and code and I don't that's something that we do I don't think it's something we should be embarrassed by because technological advancement does provoke insight and learning in the world and of course code is riffing on computer code and and this is something that is is we're learning more and more about how you can make non-overtly physical work and that's why we've we're shifting from mechanical to to to computing metaphors because okay gears there's a sort of obviousness to it but there's a sort of enchantment to come for computers for us because they're so powerful and they do so much and we're such visual creatures and so now increasingly we're we're living through screens now norm is also deeply visible but again because of how the internet has created a global village we have a crisis of norms and in how this relates to pluralism we're we're really stretching and reaching for them so his his illustration that he's going to use of a of car with a wheels turn and I'm going to have to think more on that in terms of I like it because it's technological it's sort of a a technology meets physicality and you've got a slope and you've got a car and you've got a human agent and now that agent is going to be replaced to a degree by some AI power and so you park on a hill of some steep grade and you park with your wheels turned the wrong way in the in the mode of norms someone will come up to you and tell you you've got your wheels turned the wrong way now depending on the norms of that particular culture they may be uh brusque about it and tell you to get your shit straight or they may be kind about it it may be an elder it may be somebody else but the point the most important point is that it's very peer to peer it's just sort of the notion of what people in the culture do within for each other to support them in doing the right thing and it doesn't necessarily have to be even a sense of violation it could be a sense of just mistake or error hey by the way you forgot to turn your wheels in the right direction and I use the term field effect here I think that's important that there's you know and I'll loop back to it's this point this concept of this notion significantly in a bit that norms have almost a a sensibility in the direction of what I've called coherence or integrity that there's a kind of a we're in a in a party for example a group of people and things feel like they're more or less hanging together the state or the the mode of norms is is quiet or okay but when somebody is let's say somebody's getting too drunk and they're getting a little bit raucous there's a felt sense at the level of the of the of the body that that's something is getting out of whack and that's I think that's the essence of the basis of of norms so then laws now I would I think he's right there and in religious terms at least in Hebrew Hebrew Judeo-Christian terms shalom would be the the the status of the field and and if someone is violating a norm there's a rupture in shalom and there's a break in the let's say let's call it the commons of community and something something is and I think that's I think that's sort of the right the right way to pitch it we're very familiar with and a point I would like to make is that from a historical perspective we have been living through the great era of laws the great era of norms may in fact have have terminated somewhere around the agricultural revolution meaning that the great human prehistory was the era of norms and then we began the movement into laws very much in direct relationship to things like writing and the ability to write down rules and something like say the the constitution and the Napoleonic code even more so is moving more and more in the direction of extracting governance from the mode of norms and moving it into the mode of laws an increasingly regulatory construct I don't know if you ever saw that famous picture of somebody standing next to a printout of like the Trans-Pacific Partnership it was like a 12 foot high stack of papers to govern some very specific subset of human relations that's that's laws and so in the metaphor you you park your car and you have your wheels turned the wrong way and in the mode of laws there's a very specific set of formal roles so it's not necessarily in fact it's very much not the right or responsibility of just some other person to inform you that you have parked with your wheels in the wrong way if they do so they're acting in the mode of norms in the mode of laws it would be something like the the parking cop or something along those lines who actually have and and I think this is a this is a really good illustration here and I think he's exactly right that in the you know part of what you see in the medieval period is at least in Europe is this constant struggle between church and state and again I've been reading more in the Reformation period lately and part of part of what I mean part of the reason Luther deploys the Protestant Reformation unfolds through Luther in the Holy Roman Empire is because of its legal framework and and in some ways Luther in order to to blunt the power of the church leverages the state against the church and it's the electors it's Luther's elector that protects him market is in there too because Luther's elector did not want to see Luther killed Luther before the Wittenberg was a Luther's elector had amassed a huge amount of of of relics which is deeply ironic in in in Wittenberg and then when Luther rises of course Luther will mean the end of that relic market the elector protects Luther well why well he protects Luther because he very quickly sees that as a market power and as a political power Luther outstrips the relics and the way that the Protestant Reformation will unfold will mean an end to to Roman Catholic tyranny in the way that it was realized in certain places like the like the Holy Roman Empire now part of the weakness of the Protestant telling of the Protestant Reformation has long been the blind spot of the places where the Reformation didn't happen and that was Spain, France, Italy, the Reformation flourished and and and England kept swinging back and forth in a very violent and bloody way but the Reformation happens in in some places and not other places well why well the answers are market-based they're political they're they're they're very deep and difficult things to answer and and I like here where he contrasts norms and laws because okay a person walking up the street and I like before where he talked about you'll have you'll have cultures where this this recommendation to turn your wheels will be done politely let's say Canada which is known for its politeness and let's say other cultures where it would be less polite and let's say New Jersey where I grew up so in Canada oh oh by the way oh you should you should you should turn those towards the curb so that if the brake lets go your car won't roll down the hill let's be very very polite Canadian way to do it and more New Jersey way with hey idiot turn your wheels that'd be much more New Jersey so but and then the cop comes and says I'm going to cite you for not doing this because in Canada someone might politely agree and then walk away and not do it in New Jersey someone would say well you know what do you care to you know mind your own business I'll park my car the only you know in any old damn way I want it's more New Jersey so but so that's the that's the that's the those are the norms and of course the law comes in and says you shall park your car this certain way because and this is where commons comes in because streets are sort of commons all right and so the in this sense both norms and laws look out for commons and so commons and shalom are sort of working in the in the same area there has the job to check and make sure that everybody's wheels are parked the right way and there would be a formal articulation an explicit encoding we call it municipal code 317.4 which will endeavor to enumerate in a finite set of semantics the specific qualities of this of this rule set and here we see sort of the rise of the Napoleonic era because in the in France with the decline of the monarchy and then the French Revolution you have these vast swings and then in a sense what Napoleon comes around to is say okay we're going to now manage this with laws and and Napoleon rewrites the face of Europe and not just because of his conquest but because even after Francis pushed back and settled back into its own borders people recognize that oh we have this new tool of law and and we can in that sense maintain shalom with law and and you see this is in a lot of ways what's going on in terms of the the culture war and the conversation about woke well we need to make these things into laws and because we're not we're not making enough progress with norms if the grade is above four degrees then wheels must be turned you know all that kind of nonsense and in the mode of laws you've got explicit articulation of what the rule is and endeavor to define it with some level of precision and comprehensively and then formal roles which would have to do with things like evaluation adjudication and enforcement right so at evaluation you might have the traffic cop who just sort of comes by right to the ticket you may complain in which case you've moved into the juridical process of assessing the state of facts and they're mapped into the state of laws and then you might be ultimately fined and if you choose not to pay then you'll be on the pointy end of the enforcement regime now of course different governance uh structures will now way back in the 1980s when i was in college my major was in history and one of my favorite favorite professors basically was working through issues of modernization theory and and part of what happens in modernization theory is that you go from the implicit to the explicit you go from norms to laws and you have the power of the state to to sort of maintain these laws and and this is sort of a natural progression now i think it's important to recognize that there isn't strictly a linear development between these things you find laws very early on so for example when i am preaching through i just finished a sermon series through the ten commandments those are laws well the ten commandments really aren't laws as such you can find laws in the mosaic code because generally speaking a law will have a specific behavior and then a specific enacted punishment that an agent in society will have to will have to prosecute will have to execute okay we have all that language and and so kings were there to to to put forth the law and and so you see you know even in the the period of the protestant reformation the roman catholic church couldn't actually execute anyone the roman catholic church by virtue of how there was a discussion on the bridges of meaning discord about church and state and and and it's noted that the roman catholic church couldn't actually execute people the state executed people and so part of the crisis that happened with martin luther was the church couldn't get the state to kill luther the church couldn't get the state to burn all of luther's writings and now in the the proliferate what the printing press did was well you can now printers would love it if you'd burn their books because people would just buy new and and so what you begin to see in with many of these disruptive technologies look at the word that we choose disruptive what we see with many of this these disruptive technologies is that the the norms and the laws are being disrupted by something else and what's what what's disrupting them are other deep coding within us and so the coding and he's going to get to the coding the coding is is analogous to natural law but as our reach over the world gets larger and further we're outstripping natural law and as we get further and further from nature we're increasingly living in designed environments where as he says a little bit later humans have designed it and the the the design of it is the code so that's what we're talking about instantiate laws differently like the laws may be handed down as a result of genetic lineage and rules like who gets to create the laws and who gets to enforce the laws is based on that we currently live in a regime where at least ostensibly it's associated with the notion of a you vote for your representative leaders and they have legislative authority and then judges are appointed in some certain fashion and then the executive function appoints the evaluation and the enforcement on that's the way we've done it and the architectures of the mode of laws and its relationship with the mode of norms over the past whatever 10 000 years has been a big piece of how the the story of game a has played out so then we've got the third the third is code and code is actually i think at this moment both is the most interesting because it's the one that is shifting the most fundamentally now now when i first listen to this and we start listening about code it's like okay what's he talking about here and and so i've i had to listen to it a couple of times and to sort of think through it because again code we're reaching for a contemporary metaphor and and again you understand code because of what i said about the fact that when i when we talk about nature okay what are we talking about there's there's the aspect of nature that i've been talking about with my videos about c.s lewis's book miracles of physics of the thing that goes on its own and he's leveraging that here in code and and he's he hasn't brought quite to the fore but if you're living let's say in a rural environment and you're a farmer the the larger systems of planetary movement of seasons of weather patterns govern your lives okay but many with urbanization more and more of us are living in a designed environment and this this this environment has been designed by people via well norms have been involved laws have been involved and and so and in the the things beneath this design is now code all right and that is in some ways displacing these broader rhythms of the earth moving around the sun of the earth being on an axis of geology and geography and weather and plant and animal evolution and biology systems that have for us been for most of human history we've been tremendously dependent upon them and they've been resistant to our effects at colonization but over you know in the last 500 years and especially in the last 200 years we have in some sense gained an upper hand not completely as we're living in a pandemic but we have gained an upper hand and so increasingly we are living in we are living in environments of human design and that code is beneath the design now this again this gets very much at the culture war stuff about about an ascendant morality and we can redesign the world and is there a human nature and all this jordan peterson stuff that we've been talking about for a couple of years and you know some people are skeptical and some people are optimistic and we've seen some we've seen some early prototype attempts at remaking remaking humanity within utopian visions and in a sense the the communist experiment was far left and the nazi experiment was far right the nazi experiment was was uber natural in other words part of their anti-semitism and their project was to get rid of all of this design in a way but of course they you couldn't really pull that off because you needed mastery and and in all of this there's a there's a sort of a narrative that if we can get the design right then we can get back to nature and we won't need law we won't need law and norm and obviously there's there's elements of that in the in the communist narrative where you know the state is an intermediate process and once we get rid of that will be natural and the nazis had sort of a similar idea with respect to to the state you know you we need to use warfare and the power of the state to get rid of states again read timothy sniders book black earth to get rid of states so that natural things will natural processes will emerge and then these hierarchies these racial hierarchies will emerge and of course that's the that's the whole nazi project now now a little bit later jordan is going to say some similar things and i don't want to trigger you all with that because you can find language like that in the bible in in the book of jeremiah for example that the knowledge of the lord will you know will be in humanity as the waters cover the earth this kind of thing that you will no longer need a law jeremiah 33 because the law of god will be in our hearts it's a very similar it's a very similar idea and narrative progression and the idea you know all these ideas in many ways come from the bible they just take some very strange routes so so so the idea is that well law is sort of an an intermediary governor and you see similar ideas like this and for example the apostle paul that sees the law in similar ways and so sees the movement of of the coming of the spirit of god in us and you can find this in paul's epistles about the spirit is that law is displaced and now we are governed by spirit not by law law is always seen as well this this state mediated mediated intermediate thing and and we can see this in children for example because children are very quick to understand rules and at a certain point in their development they're very excited about rules and then they want to throw off the rules and so you can see the developmental aspect to law in this okay and and what we're looking for is to get to a freedom beyond the law you can see this in in literature that here's all these rules of grammar and c.s lewis writes about this actually it's only until you've actually mastered all of the rules that you can selectively transcend them in some ways that the people who really know grammar well will say yeah to the to the neophyte they'll look at the child and say you're not doing it right you need to first use you need to first use the laws of grammar and master them and then in fact then you can violate them because that's because then you actually understand what is rule and what is exception rule and exception live in the same universe and happily so because that's that's the way that the world works and again this is a deep part of jonathan peugeot's work that there's rule and then there's exception so so there's again i'm jordan i found jordan hall often difficult to understand he he's he's sometimes so meta he just seems to float off and so but with these ideas i'm really connecting with these ideas and part of the reason i'm making this video is because i want to help those of us who are more concrete yeah i got a note from someone in the bridges of meaning discord server says i want to do another conversation with you i said why is because everything that happens in the verveky stuff just floats off into we need to get more concrete more down to earth and that's right well this is the this is the connection between heaven and earth we have to have the stack in a sense it's that it's sort of the tower of babel stack it needs to go from the earth all the way up into the heavens but actually i think what needs to happen is is heavens needs to i mean just gets into the emergence versus emanation and all of this stuff that we're talking about and i don't want to flow it off into being too esoteric and so that's why i'm making this video because i think what what jordan is is illuminating here and highlighting here is actually deeply germane to the conversation so code in its earliest form would be the laws of nature you know so if you park with your wheels pointed the wrong way your car if the brake fails will simply roll out into the middle of the street that's code that's something that is strictly unconscious the human agency has nothing to do with it at all okay and this is where we get into this tricky agency business that's because because okay so is is that agency well not really it's sort of the agency of god number one it's the agency of the arena that's the agency of gravity it's physis as as c.s lewis notes in his book miracles it's things that go on their own um and you can think of code as creating the uh the boundary conditions or shaping the phase space of choice um so again it's the arena in in terms of verveckis agent arena relationship irrespective of choice itself and that's a pretty fundamental definition of code um however and of course uh technology itself feeds back on nature it's a technology because again we're increasingly living in designed environments not environments that is before our design changes code right so we once had in in our code that human beings could not travel through the air um and then of course technology changed that such that human beings can travel through the air and that entered into a whole new regime of norms and laws on how one behaves when you're traveling through the air as a human being now at the sort of the point in the exponential technology acceleration curve uh code is becoming more and more a part of of the way we actually modulate uh governance and and here i point specifically to something known as the internet of things which is going to become more and more and more uh important whether that's dystopian or not and it may very well be very extremely dystopian now now the internet of things is so the nest thermostat in your home um which is connected to your smartphone so it knows when you leave the house and when you enter the house it's it's connecting it's it's all of this little automation which is increasingly ai which is sort of as agents managing our lives i mean a hundred years ago you know the the the servant at the house who knows you're returning will cut wood and stoke the fires or 200 years ago so that by the time you re-enter the home the house will be warm now google knows where you're going and that you're coming home and so it's going to turn up the heat a few minutes before you enter the house via your thermostat and and so you can see how this is coding this is part of the reason why we're dealing so we're struggling so much to talk about agents and and part of part of humanism and scientism has been well the only agents that we acknowledge for the sake of covering one eye to see the world with the scientific image the only agents we acknowledge are ourselves there are no agents above us or beside us because that's enchantment this is part of the reason aliens keep coming into the conversation because those are those are agents that we sort of can fit within our scientific frame who are above us because we look out into the heavens and we say well there's enough there's enough systems out there that surely if things run on their own there must be other agents like us who are simply functions of the arena that have have made them so that they're out there this is why aliens keep popping into the conversation and well i'm going to leave the aliens alone now but this is this is his point that because of because of all of this technology the internet of things is going to be a big part of this we are going to be living in an enchanted world again enchanted by code that human beings have written let's make it a self-driving car to really make it work your card pulls up to the curb and the software inside the car causes the wheels to the car to notice that it's on a grade and therefore to execute a subroutine that turns the wheels in the direction that was coded into the architecture at the moment of its creation or at least in his most recent push update from the cloud so the human in this case has nothing to do with it the human simply gets into and out of the car and that's code now now i just recently i i i was driving i've been driving all these different cars because i buy cars and i sell them to my kids basically because my kids were all at that age when they would get out of college okay when you get out of college you buy a car from me i'm your car dealer and you buy a car from anyone else but you get your best deal from me so so i just recently bought a new car and i replaced a 2003 mazda protege 5 which i really like that car that was a great car it's a fun car and now i have a 2020 a new 2020 mazda another little car that i drive around in but this little car has radar and blind spot protection and haptic feedback in the steering wheel and it watches both sides behind me if there's cross lane and this car compared to i mean my 2003 protege 5 it had a cd player that was an upgrade from cars i'd had before i tend to hang on to my cars for a while and but the you know it didn't have bluetooth didn't have an ox jack didn't you know and i want to listen to podcasts and things so now i've got android auto and bluetooth and so do i use the bluetooth system or do i plug in the cord and get android auto i don't have wireless android auto yet but um but you can and so i'm playing with this and so the code has the car has all of this code and so if i if i forget to lock the car i get a notification on my phone oh you haven't locked the car yet and and and i know that this is i mean this is my mazda is not a a luxury high-end car if you go to lexus or acura or some of these higher end cars the technology just keeps going and so what does that mean and this is the code that is that is built in now notice when we take code as being the laws of nature we humans are simply reacting to what happens to be the laws of nature but in this more recent formulation somebody somewhere wrote those rules so there's a form a form of a massive very important crucial form of human agency which now becomes in many ways the most important piece of the future of governance which is how who is code written because now code begins to define everything to maybe put it in a more concrete sensibility uh it's funny uh long ago i think maybe in 1990 maybe a little bit later i read a short written piece called the postscript on the societies of control by a frenchman named jude lois and in it he more or less predicted the future in a eerily accurate way and one of the things he talked about was the flows of dive visuals modulated in space and the example here would be something like what's going on in china with you with uh social uh social credit scores and so you have imagine that you live in a world where you have a some sort of biometric identity it could be mechanical in the sense that you have some sort of arm band that you wear it could be synthetic in the sense that your you know voice print and face print are your identity but the point is you have a biometric identity that an internet of things a omnipresent technology that's watching you all over the place can track and your state for example your social credit score modulates what doors open and what doors don't open so if you're sort of above 800 you're allowed to go into the into the into the mall and buy stuff if you're below 800 that door just simply won't open for you uh those are the kinds of things that begin to happen in the context of the of the the era of code which we have now begun to really enter into okay um and so to well what is the what is the state well the state is this the state is this god basically small g god it's not the hebrew god because remember the hebrew god god number one god number two that's agent arena the state is a god the state is a god that lives within the arena of the natural order the laws of physics it is a god that lives within a meta divine realm and it is in this case a as many gods are kind of a composite human being and in order for that god to work well it it both is sort of god-like but then is is dependent upon human beings to feed it just like ancient pagan gods and ancient pagan temples the the temples were places for the feeding of the gods and and depended on what the gods ate and you know what the gods ate most of is what the priests ate and so in the ancient world these gods were these gods were these gods grew their power out of the temple and the gods were in a sense the whole priestly class all together and and in that way you know pharaoh the the heads of state were also gods they were embodied gods now you can get into jordan peterson's first lecture of the biblical series where he notes that part of what happens in the christian revolution in the roman empire is that the god is above every human instantiation of god and and these are some of the struggles that you see in the hebrew scriptures between the kings and the prophets because let's say between david and the famous bathsheba incident there is a god above david and david must answer to it now let's pick another famous bible story of ahab and jezebel and nabath's vineyard nabath has a vineyard that king ahab wants because it would make a nice vegetable garden and it's nicely close to his palace in samaria and so he longs to have this vineyard and he can't because well i can't because he has inherited these laws are they laws are they norms or are they code see this is where this gets tricky because things become code even in you know pre-modern societies and so ahab is basically throwing a hissy fit because he can't have nabath's vineyard and jezebel who is a princess of the of of tyre of the tyrian phoenicians walks in and you're acting like a baby you're the king if you want nabath's vineyard take it so now we've got some issue of commons going on here and so ahab basically pulls a very totalitarian move concocts a story now notice he can't even just take it by force because that would arra that would alarm everyone and so what he does is he basically concocts a story and makes nabath an enemy of the state to justify his seizure of the vineyard and of course who comes in but the prophet and elijah comes in and says i know what you did god revealed to me what you did and he's not going to permit it in other words the in the ancient world code law and you get this from hammer robbie you get this in moses this is pervasive in the ancient world law comes from the gods or from god and that's critical in understanding the creation of the commons that's where we're going in this um because there there is a space it's a sacred space it's a holy space it's inviolable and the reason ahab was having a hissy fit was he was caught between this inviolable sacred space and his desires and and basically in terms of religious worlds you say yeah that's that's that's you know grow up and learn to deal with it and it's a it's the tantrum of a two-year-old i want i want my brother's toy oh it belongs to your brother and you'd better not take it now we're you know it's it's kane and abel it's all of this stuff that's built in there and and jezebel says huh you know that's create a pretext take the land have your vegetable garden be a real man well what's jezebel doing what is she well she's slowly taking out the code of moses in ahab and putting in the code of of the tirian finitions so you know this is these are very old stories that are happening here and it's just that we're you know these these things continue to evolve as technology evolves and and just to kind of throw something out there this doesn't fit quite right but it's it's maybe useful in the in the era of laws the concept that sort of represented the notion of what good law was was the notion of justice so the the notion of justice represents the degree to which and and now justice is in some ways the interface between good law and the code the articulation adjudication and enforcement function of law is felt to be good right in some way and the more people who feel it's good the more the felt sense of justice pervades the the community because it's because it's in harmony with code in the in the era which again is where you get natural law and his code is very tightly connected with natural law someone should tell carl that one paul's talking about natural law again carl carl thought carl believes i'm beyond hope code or specifically in the mode of code i would propose that the equivalent is something more like design so that well-designed codes is is coordinated with just laws something like that and then in the case of norms i don't actually have the right term maybe it's healthy like healthy community or something like that but no i think that's right i think that's exactly right just to kind of hold on to that that when we actually enter into these three different modes being now consciously applied and noticing how each one relates to the other and what's their coordination with each other right not just independently but actually what's the whole that contains them we now have to think about what's the the the notion of what is like right relationship and good balance between and among all three and and that would be shalom in in the hebrew conception it is it is life the way it's supposed to be everything is working together and again you will find you will find elements of that in the hebrew prophets they have various ways of communicating that and their poetry and their imagery now in the hebrew prophets then you also get these get these images of a new order which is coming where the lion will they lay down with the lamb and the you know the the wolf and the oxen will eat straw together wolves don't eat straw you know it's getting a and neither will they harm or devour on all my holy mountain now i'm tweaking some of these things as i go but but this is you know this is the stuff that is played out in the bible how does justice feed back on design and how does design feed back on justice and how does health feed back on both something like that okay so that's the first so now we're going to swing back on state market and commons you'll notice is definitely related but it's related in a very odd way and if the first is almost like at the level of fundamental modes the second is more like institutions so more like tools and in here there seems to be three distinct tools although it may not be strictly three it's definitely not two but it may be more than three historically we've seen state and market and now i'm going to introduce the commons the first thing i noticed when i was beginning the process of contemplating this and having conversations about it is that many people were confused about the notion of the commons as symmetric conceptually to market and state that the commons has oftentimes in our certainly for the last hundred or two hundred years been thought of as the object of governance not the subject of governance i.e. that we need to use the state to prevent the tragedy of the commons okay now this is really that movie just made there from object to subject that is really interesting because that is a move of enchantment okay he has just agentified the arena because in many ways commons is prior to state and market commons is default commons and and this in a further conversation that i i'll play a little bit from the same channel commons you know one of one of the examples of of the the bit of commons that remain is air or atman or the commons that remain is air or atmosphere and and even notice that the the various valences of these words continue on and in the next video they're going to relate air to spirit and and so that is in some ways the um the the last frontier of commons that we inhabit land has been taken over and owned and and so states and markets have done that but commons is in a sense primordial commons is in a sense the default and commons has been basically continued to be devoured so um and so what the movie just made there making from object to subject he's just agentified the arena or we need to assign private property rights so that the commons are uh whatever sorry that can't possibly work it's almost antithetical but you get it right the idea is that the commons is an object the commons is sort of like the land that isn't owned by the state or the market but we need to use these these modes of governance the market in the state to govern the commons it's an object of governance and the proposition that would make is that is in fact precisely the error that commoning say common law is in fact a mode of governance and is in fact the more fundamental mode of governance and it may coordinate very very closely with norms and so these may be sort of two different ways of looking at a very similar the same thing but um let me and i think you know norms are interesting here because again norms develop collectively from agents and and you know early on when you talked about norms how norms develop you know it's our mirror neurons we we are watching each other's faces very carefully and we are especially attentive to this now that we're wearing these masks and as a pastor you can't do pastoral care with a mask on because there needs to be this subtle communication and our faces are you know our primary means of communicating with each other and so and so it it happens in this space and so norms sort of emerge from agents desiring connection and harmony and shalom and not violence and colonization and manipulation see if i can do a little bit more to map these things out a little bit what do i mean by commoning or the commons so some examples of things that are in the commons at the level of object that are not often considered or not always considered to be in the commons will be something like language so the the shared language the shared resource that in some sense nobody owns and everybody uses is a very important commons collective sense making the ability to tell the truth and orient towards what is true in collaboration with each other is an s is a commons certainly obviously things like the oceans and the atmosphere are also commons but also say for example the amazon which is very interesting you know in some very important sense the amazon is both the place where the indigenous peoples of the amazon live and a the sort of the lungs of the atmosphere and so these notions the commons is includes many many overlapping what what some people would refer to as a claim or a relationship with so i have a relationship with the amazon as part of a commons and then somebody who lives in ecuador has a relationship with the amazon as part of the commons they may be both and they may be many right that person in ecuador may have five or six distinct claims on that same object but the question is how might we resolve those claims using the mode of commoning not the mode of state and not the mode of market and see this is where this tensions get very very interesting between them because what is state well state is a a collectivized agent and and market is a decentralized agent and but they're both agentic and so commons is again arenic and he's saying it commons is not only arenic it's also agentic and and these these these polarities are working back and forth but you've got state and market are within they're they're sort of within the agentic commons but then they devour it okay a fundamental proposition i would make is that a catastrophic error for the past 150 years at least if not more is that the endeavor to manage the claims on the commons using either the market or the state or both uh creates uh havoc creates a disaster right and i think the reason for that is the sacred is missing that there's there's in the story of nabath and his vineyard and ahab and jezebel the collapse happens when the sacred is violated and the sacred in that sense it was instantiated in law the law of inheritance it was instantiated in norm but the the um the protector of that was the god was you know the god of israel and so he sends in the prophet and the prophet says this is where you get ideas of ideas of karma let's say because the god comes in and violated something here and your violation of it will be meted out now here's here's in religious traditions the god is patient why well why is the god patient well the god can be patient why why do we struggle with patience we struggle with patience because we're short-lived the god isn't short-lived and so the god will the god will have his revenge and so ideas of karmic justice of you know okay ahab you are going to pay for what you did with nabath's vineyard and if you read if you read samuel the book of the book of samuel first and second samuel it's two books that was split into it's one book that was split into two because scrolls were only so long um if you read the book of samuel when ahab finally dies nabath comes up again why well because he violated shalom well why well why nabath well again and this is part of the way that the the bible and in fact human beings work the the violation of shalom in the taking of nabath's vineyard and and for example with david as well the violation of shalom in taking of bethsheba and and killing uriah the hittite the violation of shalom of shalom it it must be it must be accounted for and and it will happen in time but the stories are emblematic of this wasn't the only this this was an incident this was an example of who ahab became in his deformation of the code that had been built into him which goes all the way back to sinai okay that's how that works in terms of biblical logic and what you see in the northern kingdom is the continual deformation the continual corruption the continual decadence of the king the kingdom is is dissolving and what is it dissolving into it's dissolving into all of the other nations and so these lost ten tribes so what does that mean it means that the kingdom dissolved into the rest of the world and the only place that in a sense that the dissolving was was resisting was the southern kingdom and so it's a long complex history but it's playing out in the same way that that jordan is talking about here not neither the market nor the state is in fact the proper governance mechanism for the commons and it is largely through the rediscovery and the revivification of commoning as a as the proper governance mechanism for the commons that we can in fact regenerate the commons all of the commons and then what actually happens which is very interesting is that allows the market and the state to settle back to release things that were never there in the first place and therefore settle back into a much more subtle and stable location that they're more appropriately able to handle and and so here and this little corner of the internet the religion that's not a religion why are we looking for a religion so we're looking for we're looking for the code and and that has to and that that code has to govern and and actually market and state leverage the power of code in order for them to function properly within the ecosystem that's really what he's looking for here this relates so so here i'll do is i'll kind of loop back to the first this relates also to the notion of laws norms and code laws have been pushed way actually the more i think about it the more i'm astounded by how far beyond their capacity laws have been pushed we're living in the sort of uh this massively hypertrophied legal regime where laws are pushed to try to do stuff they couldn't possibly do the emergence of code as a as a conscious modality and the building skillfulness and design will release an extraordinary amount of responsibility the emergence of code as a conscious modality that's almost jordan peterson's god right there the emergence of code as an as a almost conscious modality that's jordan peterson's god and that is when i look at this new wave that is that jordan peterson rode was a part of and and and really helped accelerate and i look at for vacay's religion that isn't a religion this is what we're this is this is what we're looking at here now when we get when i get into the next video this same video of mine but the next video that i'm going to comment on um hang on i gotta read a text here when when i get into the second video that uh so peter limberg sent me these because this is all part of the stoia and and i'm very interested in the stoia because when i when i visited the stoia i noted that well he's doing something very similar to what i'm doing in terms of an estuary like he's more using zoom and meetings and and i'm more using the discord and youtube and all that and youtube so and and my local meetups because what we're really talking about in this video is what has been what is is religion but it's deep religion it's not just oh you know this this thing that churches do and and when i was thinking about this this morning i was thinking about the fact that for many deconstruction is because of the bifurcation of these worlds and the world where cell phones work and governments achieve things and all of that is the world so people look at churches and churches don't work very well but this stuff works very well prayer doesn't work very well but technology works very well and so there's this bifurcation and and what i think all of these things have in common is an attempt to reintegrate them once more okay to to say okay well what's going on here in the religious space and what's going on and they're not two worlds but they're they're they're really connected well how are they connected well that's so we're trying to figure out we're trying to figure out how they are connected and how we live within them okay that's in some ways the the estuary project let's connect these worlds and and so that's why i think this conversation i the some of the insights brought out in commons code for me you know really started to help put some things together and and i think for many of us okay that the ian mcgillchrist conceptualization between our minds we've been feeling these things intuitively and so we're trying to articulate them we're trying to systematize them we're trying to understand them in a way that is captured by the left brain and because the right brain is feeling dissonance and saying i'm feeling dissonance left brain help me out i'm trying so you know this is this is the the stuff going on in my head and the stuff going on between our heads and and this is what we're trying to do but i really think this uh this deep code commons is is deeply helpful and it connects up with a lot of older and ancient things and will allow laws something like 90 percent of laws will simply evaporate because they were no longer be needful again i can i can read passages out of the book of jeremiah that say that almost exactly and will actually i think also reawaken norms to a very large extent um so what i would propose that's that's right because the norms the norms are sort of the the community weaving it together it's the little agreements that we have with each other and um but they're very implicit but they're very rigorous and durable is that what we will see in the evolution of the migration of um of governance is that in some sense we will see a significant expansion in the conscious awareness of the role of code as code begins to hold more and more responsibility we will see a somewhat massive and i said like 90 somewhat massive reduction in the scope and responsibility of laws and but also we will see a meaningful increase in the scope and responsibility of of norms and there will be much more of a of a sense of symmetry or balance between the three modes than we've seen perhaps ever now this gets into a very big deal in within christian communities but also a very big deal between christian communities and atheist conversations or non-theist conversations which is the the agency of how this is accomplished and and in the bible it's it's a little weird because on one hand it's quite clear that god will do this but it's also clear that god uses people and and so actually getting that right in terms of a part of the conversation between let's say protestants and catholics is the agency of the church and and part of the pluralism that that has happened in protestantism which is which is always seen as a bug and and is in some deep ways look at my look at my question and answer where i talked about protestantism the the the agency of the church the church doesn't always exhibit good agency and anyone you know people outside the church throwing stones at church are like yeah you don't it's like you think you think you have to tell me that i live in this house you're throwing stones at i don't understand why people run out of here the words of one woman here like their skirts on fire um you know i i understand why people flee the church get you know trust me i i as a pastor you see more of it than most people do because you see the stuff that doesn't get aired and yeah but you're seeing this thing all around so so you know how how does how does this process manifest itself and again the the the the biblical image is one of this is this is the role of god's spirit god's god's son and god's you know the son and the spirit both um you know in a sense bring to earth see the sun descends look at the gospel of john the sun descends the spirit descends like a dove they bring to earth thy kingdom come they will be done as on earth as it is in heaven they bring heaven down to earth and then look at um we're in the christmas season now you know um let heaven and earth rejoice i mean the earth there there's this antiphonal process that happens the angels come down in luke and and sing to the earth and then the earth responds in song to heaven and so you get this up and down and up and down process and so the the fact that the kingdom comes in process jesus comes when the time is fully when the time is fulfilled when the time is ripe and and so this is the process that happens whereby we get to these eschatological visions of lions and lambs laying down and the earth is covered with the knowledge of the lord no longer will someone have to go and talk about the law because the law of the lord will be in each of our hearts and all of this is the language of the bible and you know this is this is this is the stuff he's working on in this video it's fascinating to me and then if i look back again i apologize and i'll probably stop talking after this because i feel like i've run out of useful things to say for the moment something similar happening in the in the in the other cluster so that as we reawaken and rediscover ways of going about commoning as a form of governance this will release enormously the amount of burden that's being carried right now particularly by the state and allow things to shift a lot massively actually so maybe i'll just kind of dot drop down a level of concretion so that was all happening at the at a pretty high level of abstraction of more or less pure concepts in their relationships to each other if i if i take this jumping off point and drop down what i would propose is that in this new relationship the content of the state that the legislative function will almost entirely evaporate that if you think about it if laws are going away in a big way like reducing by a factor of 90 then the legislative function as it turns out was actually it is a primary hypertrophy meaning it's it's vastly more takes the best more of our time and energy than would be appropriate the king comes it's the return of the king the the king the king only in a sense returns and you know presidents have you know trump sort of broke from this but presidents usually send out their you know they they do you know think about trump's negotiation with south with north korea trump wanted to go and just do it do the deal himself generally speaking when trump was doing this and say well usually what happens you have these negotiations negotiations negotiations the king comes in to receive the bounty and so what does the king do in anticipation of it he sends his emissaries or he sends his army or he sends all the others and then finally it comes in and and and and it's fulfilled i mean that's that's what we're talking about here and that the state becomes much much less about the coding of law or the writing of laws the crafting of laws and then their evaluation adjudication enforcement and much much more about just adjudication so i would actually say that adjudication perhaps and probably adjudication and enforcement are and that being the natural thing that lies at the center of the state and that for the most part the the content of the boundaries on behavior that we interact with on a day-to-day basis will live in some combination between norms and code and that if you run into something at the level of of of laws this is because something has significantly has broken and this will actually be called into a mode of adjudication and so i would put like at the adjective say for example wisdom might map to the state which is a very interesting prospect to be thinking about that right and look at the king look at look at the book of eclesiastes look at solomon solomon is you know the wisest man in the world why is that well well where's the law about two prostitutes fighting over a baby and you know i'm i am you know i i was we're talking about language as a commons and i was complaining about amazing and vixen dixon noted yeah fascinating yeah there's my word interesting i used to use that word so much when i was learning Spanish that my Spanish teacher's like you need to learn more Spanish words so you know but this this this little video i i haven't i haven't been excited about a little video like this for a while and and yeah i'm i'm very excited about this i'll get into i'll keep going i'm not done yet that um it's at the level of the the collective awareness of the necessity of listening into what kinds of innovative relationships need to actually be brought to bear will be happening in that thing that has been held by the state for some very long time so so notice right here i'm very much pointing to a the need for a nician hammer around the notion of the state that the idea of the state that we've been living with for for a very long time perhaps for thousands of years is quite wrong and need well and i think this needs to be you cannot understand the state without understanding the church and you need to go into late antiquity and you know what you know some of tom holland's work and some of the work that i've you know look at looking at peter brown what what happens with constant with constantine and why does he why does he embrace christianity what mode is he really in and that's that's one of these that's one of these turning points in history like the protestant reformation where where christianity takes over the roman empire and now notice that many of the titles that roman emperors have had were taken over by the pontus what is a pontus that the roman you know constantine was the pontus he was the bridge between heaven and earth now the bishop of rome is the pontus is the pope and you know all there's there's deep stuff going on in here that i don't know how much of this history jordan hall knows but this is this is built into our world at a very deep level needs to be smashed and then inside of that we will see like this sort of like curled up fetus that is the actual thing that should have been living in that place that we'll be called eschatological this is pure eschatology right now wisdom and that it's the sort of a kicking up in some sense it's like hey whoa something is off like our ordinary modes of navigating life seem not to be working right now can we slow down a little bit and invoke an inquiry or calling into wisdom where there's a deep inquiry into what's up in the world what's up with us what's going on has something happened where the context of the world has so changed that our norms and our code are no longer adequately or effectively mapping to reality do we need to actually be more explicit about articulating some change and then allowing that change to then percolate through our norms and our code to then create a new support structure that can hold reality as it is you know that would be sort of the state in this future explicit highly conscious like consciousness itself isn't that god consciousness itself i i i again i i i couldn't so again peter limberg sent me this and i was gonna have this conversation with them and i botched the time zones and but when i listened to this i thought oh my this is so this is so dealing with what we're dealing with and i gotta talk about this and then i couldn't talk about it with them it's like ah but i then i thought well maybe it's better that i do some work on this first because this is really important to digest and now i want i want to bring in another video be the conversation with evan and forest okay this is the second video that peter sent me and peter's up there i'm trying to figure out where i can put my little square because we got all these squares i'll be peter i'll be paul and in hollywood squares i'll be in the middle and so um stoichus potter peter limberg of this of this stoia sto is a porch i mean oh gosh it's it's fascinating to me the way these conversations are going in the language or they're using and he brings in these four jordan hall couldn't have made this meeting we get this whole we get this whole thing of not people not making their meetings here and mine was my fault but and the first part of this the first part of this conversation i i really got into so let's let's get into it and bonita roy i don't know any of these people but bonita roy i think really nails some things right out of the gate here and i'm worried about the i'm worried about the volume level in their video so i'm going to turn my own volume down yeah at least you know you can get the first word in i don't know about reading um yeah so i had a good segue from jordan's uh previous session because i had this i had this impulse to deep code the commons which means try to get to some fundamental terminology of what the commons was before we all went off in all our directions of you know making comments on the commons but not knowing where our starting point was so i spent a little time looking at that myself thinking about my own thoughts and i what i realized was like um when i when i think of the commons i i naturally make a distinction between for example a cooperative a cooperative as i understand it is where individuals own their stuff they have property rights to it but they're willing to share with others uh that are defined as the cooperative and then there's something that we can call the collective where their stuff is owned by some entity that represents the group right it's not actually owned by the individuals in the group so that's that's another term that people associate sometimes with their approach to comedy so when i drilled down i realized that the commons was neither of those the commons is actually something quite sacred and precious because there's the word it's sacred and part of where this conversation doesn't go with these four is the the deep connection between sacred and prohibition that's something that our culture that's a goat our culture really kicks against we really don't like that of course we don't like that because the sacred is a giant no you shall not you shall not you shall not we don't want to hear that we want to hear about possibility but this this gets at the deep the deep we don't want no and again this this something this is the deep code in human beings why in a perfect garden is there a tree with a prohibition around it why we look at ourselves say you put that in our violation of that prohibition is inevitable that's something that has to be dealt with and so the sacred is and again i look at the mosaic law the sacred is you know you have inside the camp and outside the camp you have common and holy okay this is the language from the mosaic law it's common and holy and and there's a deep relationship between commons and holiness and and part of the reason common has been destroyed is because of the lack of holiness there needs to be the holy makes the common okay and and without the holy without the sacred you won't have a common let's keep going because there's a lot of good stuff here humans originally meant something that can't be owned or is not owned by anyone or any legal entity so then i started thinking i kind of got down a rabbit hole can't be owned by any human entity okay there is an owner but the owner is a level above and again this is where we're getting into our democratic our democratic culture that and and again the the what i call sometimes the the virus that got out of the lab which is it belonged in the lab where we cover one eye and we do science we take out the the personality we take out the person but we have to do that in order to uncover the other eye to see through both eyes that's what we're looking for so with the manifest and the scientific image are properly nested so that they can function together and and and so the holy creates the common all right that's foundational here oh uh about what is the commons today so we can think of the atmosphere i mean very little is left like the atmosphere maybe some parts of the ocean then i got into this rabbit hole how about our microorganisms or seeds or migratory animals or our gut biome or the human genome or the human immune system these started to mean the commons to me and i i got so i felt that they were under threat so first of all i'll just put both my things up there and then let the conversation carry on so that was kind of like my starting position and the rabbit hole i got to and the question that i want would like to pursue on more practical level is when we think of consciously creating commons first of all under which one of those terms uh how do we avoid how do the how did what we create avoid becoming an insular mimetic tribe or a cult so if we're trying to create a collective do we just select like from our you know mimetic tribe like how do we design these things so that and i think her first observations that a commons is not a collective and it's not a cooperative and again this is this is where the sacred and the holy are coming to bear here because there needs to be an agent a level above us and that is again what jordan peterson notes in the first biblical series where in in the roman empire the god the the emperor is below the god and and the god that the emperor gets his laws from the god and ahab cannot take naibat's vineyard and david cannot take uriah's wife the and and we have this instantiated in our in our in our land that we're a we're a land of laws and not men and women and and this is in fact what's what's under threat currently and in our we we no longer are able to agree upon the laws and we see these systems breaking down and we see laws as merely human and therefore viable and and so basically what we trigger is ahab jezebel and naibat and we trigger david uriah and bathsheba and now the laws are just pretexts by which we get what we want and there can be no commons in such a world because again the holy the sacred creates the commons that's that's how it works it can work no other way and and again now that we're in a situation where we're living in a designed world where we've had where the where our function of the coding is much more obvious we have these anxieties about justice let's let's get in a little bit more here they don't become that or does it actually even matter in your definition of the common so that's that's my kickoff i don't have answers they they came to me as a series of hard to answer questions so i think it's interesting here to go into the sort of history of the commons as a term and as a concept for a second so what i mean by this is there's a link between the term in english and the term the commons because when you go back far enough most land was not specifically owned by anyone and so commoners were the sort of people who derived a significant portion of the sort of economic inputs to their livelihood from the commons which was the sort of i mean the land may theoretically have been owned by the king who owned everything but you know right there okay the land is the king owns everything and the commoners they're not citizens they're commoners and they're not nobility because nobility are sort of intermediaries and and so you can see this play out in a medieval structure all right and he's exactly right and commoners derive it from the land they can't own the land they can use the land but they have to do it in a commoning way and so you have your norms and and to one degree or another and and again the pot the apostle paul gets into this which which this just fascinates me how how this is coming up in this context and where this conversation goes later on in the video they're they're in there for an hour and 15 minutes nobody who is a conservative christian will recognize where this congregation goes between the three of them in terms of where it goes but in this part right here because the apostle paul basically says that the law when when laws emerge as they are and as they have to it it reveals a failure of coding and norming now again in this world we have to live with laws and and this is a constant issue in the church okay and and maybe as a pastor this is why this video really struck me because because of the eschatological nature of christianity and the the language of the apostle paul where now we are governed by the spirit that the tensions that are playing out in our culture are always playing out in the church where we and as a pastor i've always been very hesitant to create rules to create law but there are always law around the church but and in fact in protestantism john calvin in my tradition says the church has three there are three marks of the church the preaching of the word which is basically the explanation of the bible the sacraments which is the instantiation of the portal of grace into our lives and church discipline well what is church discipline well in in the in the last 30 40 years within churches church discipline has been destroyed and it's been destroyed by markets it's basically been destroyed by consumerism church discipline has been destroyed and because before you can let's say discipline a church member they've left the church and they've gone to another church and or gone to no church or are watching church on tv or on youtube or something like that and so but but churches are always reluctant to do this because there's always a sense that once you get to the level of law the other things have failed and this is where this is where this vision that jordan hall this eschatological vision that jordan hall is talking about he's right that that that is the that is the goal that is what we're leaning towards where no longer will there have to be a law and all of these things but the knowledge of the lord will be in everybody's heart it's again jordan hall's language is it's it's right out of the book of jeremiah jeremiah 33 it's right out of the book and this is a key passage that um that that shows up in in examinations of new pastors in my denomination and quite reliably because this is the flow of christian narrative and and we're dealing with it right here let's see they're not going to play a lot of this video but a little bit more perhaps it wasn't i didn't have a claim stakes to it by some specific noble or landowner and then you see a transition going on with you know what you might phrase as like the increasing encroachment of property rights into every aspect of the land over the next several hundred years and then the commons has been diminishing ever since and you see this diminishment varying across different uh you know western cultures so for example in a lot of european countries there is still the right to roam right where you have a certain right to traverse land that may be owned by other people or by the state to go for walks essentially on it and we don't have a similar right preserved here in the united states so you can well we have beach access which i think is analogous but again he's you're noting all of these tricks and hacks that laws do to try to preserve something but we we know it's being lost and and we're anxious about it because it this gets into this gets into issues in cities so as i was thinking about all of this stuff as i was thinking about all of this stuff i i came across an article in the new york times how new yorkers want to change the cityscape for good the pandemic led to mass experimenting closing streets to cars new yorkers embrace the change and want permanent spaces for playing dining and performing new york city in north america has one of the most vibrant street lives i i grew up in patterson which is about 15 miles outside of new york and and one of the things that happened after world war two was the loss of street life in america and i have to move my little box here and let's say i can scroll here and so there's video here of um you know of street and the pandemic has in some ways revived street life and and street life was sort of revived in the is it was it the the chop or the chat or the you know the the the taking over of those blocks in seattle for a while and then it deteriorated and i think in in these experimentations you have norms and and what's happening in many of these streets right now and in many cities right now is the the sort of revolution that's happening is the the sort of reticence to um to deal with let's say homelessness because well homeless people treat streets as commons and but these are people who for whom shalom has been destroyed in their worlds and so they struggle with many people i know who live on the streets some of sometimes they're financial refugees into the commons into the streets but but often they have mental illness or substance abuse issues which mean they can't live with others they can't share a domicile they can't even share an apartment building in other words the lack of this natural commons is is a is a huge problem because they can't maintain the cohesion and coherence of themselves and they have reciprocal narrowing all the way down and and it destroys them and so then you begin to see the relationship between commons and these dynamics and and so this i i think in some ways the at the heart of our culture is a naivete about about what it takes to be a human being because a vibrant street culture is an accomplishment it's an achievement and it's an achievement of the sacred and the holy because again you'll never have the common without the sacred or the holy holiness creates the common not the other way around the common can never create the holy the holy must create the common it's and get back to our emanation versus emergence i don't think emergent can ever create i i don't think the emergent can ever create the holy holy must always be an emanation and and i think i i think it's in that dynamic that these things are actually realized and and it's for it's for this reason that our attempts at this without the holy continue to fail now maybe that's a good that's a good place to to end the video because i think it's it's sort of in this space that that the the conversation i mean we've we've always had we've had our little corner of the internet has little sub corners and so we sort of have the christian corner with uh you know peugeot and i and we have the you know the the non-theist corner with with john vervecki and him and and and and uh civilla for example with her her value there's something very there there's something you know my god number one and god number two very much gets into the god of the hebra's as agent and arena okay well that's easy to say but it's hard to figure out and and what jordan hall was dealing with is sort of the gentrification the gentrification of the arena um but then of course coding is in some ways arenification of the agent all right and so so what jordan hall is sort of creeping in on that and the subsequent conversation begins to encroach then they they get over into rights and it's like well if that if that conversation goes further let me pause here and go back to it i could say the commons has been even further circumscribed here than it has been in certain places in europe so i think that historical trend is an interesting lens into a disc and and i've never been to europe but my impression is europe has done better with things like street culture and better with the commons because of their their more ancient code that is instantiated in various ways in the cultures discussion of what the commons is and perhaps uh you know a project if you will of recombining which seems to be something that jordan was gesturing at during the last session so i wonder what your thoughts are on that well and again i don't think you're going to get into recombining without the holy because the holy makes the common the common can never make the holy for my own part um benita i really liked your your introduction and i found it quite thought provoking um in terms of the way of thinking about commons the one that i personally hold to and i really loved your invocation of the notion of the sacred in connection to the notion of the commons and and particularly connecting it to breath right to the air and that led me to to really reflect on uh you know connection with what you're saying evan in the sense that you know originally the whole world was commons and then over time it started to become less common and you know so it was the whole world was commons but you never found a civilization which didn't have the sacred because and and i think when we get into this question of religion and what religion is and the role that it plays that's vital because again the common can't create the sacred because the common doesn't have the doesn't have that thing it the holy creates the common the commons is the arena but you must have heaven and earth in fact now the the notion of commons has been pushed to the very limits in the sense that you know air moves from place to place the winds come and go those particular oxygen atoms that exist here are going to move over there shortly you know soon and so while we can even think of uh like land you know i think about space and i say okay well at some point or another they're going to just start marking off territories if you're inside this volume you're within our demilitarized zone you know think of asteroids and the space bases and stuff like that so in a sense even space doesn't come as close to the essence of what is meant by the commons as as the air does as breath does or if we were to regard that the air itself were to not be commons to be owned by somebody then the action of drawing breath would therefore be a trespass upon that that property if someone's property rights and of course uh you know it's not very far to see that uh you know if you're unable to draw breath you're unable to live and therefore the connection and the immediacy between the vitality of the commons and the vitality of one's own personal life is therefore an immediate and direct one and so in this sense you know we we kind of come to the essence of the notion which is that of all of these things that which is most intimate to life the breath itself is is is is really needing to be a commons in order for there to be the possibility of life and and and so that's why the notion of spirit and and sacred and spirituality and stuff like this you know because all those ultimately are about breath if you look at the etymology of the word at least are they ultimately about breath or is breath the is wind and breath breath with respect to the domain of life and wind with respect to the domain of common life between us this gets into the work that i've been doing on spirit what we mean by that word and trying to trying to push against sort of a cartesian dualism with respect to spirit and and same with my my work on miracles i mean this is this is why these conversations to me connect and and they're surprising for a lot of people because these are not the people church people talk to and that's a problem because there's a worry that will church people lose their way when they enter into these conversations i don't think so because well just look at the shape of the bible itself and so he's actually uh force landry is going to get into objects and and also into objects and verbs which again if you've been following the conversations with michael l and karen and barfield we've got nouns and verbs and and in a sense the when the beginning of maps of meaning you can conceptualize the world as a a place of objects or a form for action commons are a form for action because they're commons okay it can't be owned it's not a cooperative it's not a collective it's a commons it's open space but the sacred is in this space and if you have again you cannot have commons without the holy or the sacred it's it's going to it's going to be it's going to be colonized by agents as the power of the agents open in other words you need another agent an agent of all agents to oppose every other agent within and this is again getting back to the themes that i've been talking about with respect to the the religion of israel this is the deep insight of the hebrew prophets that that you cannot you cannot relinquish the arena it will be it will become a metadivine realm that will rule over the gods well what is it that rules over the gods it's the god well what is the god it's god number one and number two it's the agent in the arena well then you have the the terrifying and and and this this this is what it means to be human the terrifying realization that you are subject to things that you have no control over how ought you to relate to the thing of all things or the thing that is the thing that is that is in fact beyond thingness well let's let's let's not let it be agentic enough so that it sees me now you're not going to get away with that you're you're always going to agentify it because you need it so because again you're not going to have commons without the holy the holy preserves the commons it's the holy that preserves nabat's vineyard it's the holy that preserves the marriage between uriah and bethsheba it's the holy that will come and reassert itself in time in in sort of a pezhoi and karmic fashion you you you cannot resist sleep your body will demand it you will lose your agency by trying to step out of that system so yeah i you know my apologies to to peter limberg and john revaki and jordan hall and missing this conversation um i was so tremendously excited about this conversation that i had to jump in and this is the way i butt into conversations when i'm not even invited but i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i in this dialogo space in the internet i i think these are really important conversations and part of what i do in terms of leveraging my status as a christian minister is these are conversations that christians should pay attention to because i think christians can engage in these conversations even as conservative confessing christians like myself and and i think can engage productively into these kind of conversations because in christianity and in the church we actually have a deep wisdom that informs what's going on here if we can do the translation so i hope this was helpful
