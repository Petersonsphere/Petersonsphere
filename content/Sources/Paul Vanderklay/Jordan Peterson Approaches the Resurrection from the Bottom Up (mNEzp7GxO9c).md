 Hi, this is Paul and I want to continue my commentary on Jordan Peterson's Easter video. Now he released this video a little bit ago and it has, it's full of a lot of interesting things. It's a pretty complicated video and he reads, he reads pretty much everything in this video because as he says it's complicated. And now there are five parts in this video and the parts are not of even length and I've done a little bit of commentary on parts one and two but I want to take a look at the overview and, in a sense, the posture of the entire video. So part one has the nature of experience and he has just a very condensed version of do we live in a world of objects or do we live in a world of being and so he walks through some of that stuff from Maps of Meaning and he goes back to this diagram which if you watch the Maps of Meaning videos he goes into a lot. Now this is, now this is, this is the world of the ought and the world of the will. Now it's very interesting that then he goes to this, this representation which is, which is kind of the hero's journey where you have, you know, the person between what is and what should be and then there's, there's chaos interacts and the person is thrown into the unknown and then a new person emerges from it and now the connection with, with resurrection, I think here is, is easy to see whether that is fair to the resurrection story is a much bigger conversation that I'm sure we'll get into at some point but the idea of, of rebirth, see this is, this is part of what makes the Christian story of the resurrection so difficult to talk about because there are, there are so many layers to it that on one hand you can say oh this is a story about rebirth, about new beginnings, about starting over. Yeah, you could see that there but it's a lot more than that and, and if you, and part of the difficulty about always noting one layer in a, in a multi-layered story is that if you, if you park at that one layer you've reduced the story to something else and then the Easter story is like the, the butter, the caterpillar becoming a butterfly or something like that and it's, it's pretty clear from the New Testament that the, the New Testament authors saw the story in a much bigger cosmic way than simply a metaphor about new beginnings and new birth and I'm not saying that's what Peterson is reducing it to but it's interesting when he, he brought this diagram into it, it, you know, reminded me of the maps of meaning course and all that he's been through there. It also, it also reminds me of, it reminds me of, you know, in my conversation with Peterson he mentioned that he's got N.T. Wright's Magnum Opus and, and so it's, you know, I hope he, I hope he reads the New Testament, the Old Testament and the people of God because in, in that N.T. Wright, in some ways that's N.T. Wright's version of maps of meaning. Maybe I should pause the video and grab it from the shelf. It's been quite a few years since I read this and actually I got the title wrong, it's the New Testament and the people of God not the Old Testament and the people of God and this was, this was one of the first books I read by N.T. Wright and this is part of his, really what's his Magnum Opus, New Testament and the people of God, the, the victory of God which deals with the Gospels and then the resurrection of the Son of God which I hold up often which is here, like I said this is Magnum Opus, the volumes are this big and his latest one which I don't have a physical copy of but I've got it on, on Logos and on Kindle which is his treatment of Paul and so, you know, this is why I always say N.T. Wright's more books than I have time to read but, but in some ways in terms of N.T. Wright, this is kind of his maps of meaning because he goes into in some ways the prolegomena, what is, what is a story and how does a story work, history in the first century and knowledge and all that kind of stuff is in, is in this, that volume of N.T. Wright's work but, but it also struck me in, in the first thing that this is, you know, we, you almost can't talk about Christianity in contexts where, in a lot, how am I going to say this, Buddhism is around in, in North America and, and it's, it's popular with a lot of people. It's interesting here, one might reflect on the relationship between frustration and journey and, and the hero's journey in a sense, if the will doesn't get frustrated, then, then the hero doesn't go into the underworld, doesn't descend into chaos and then doesn't have the transformational journey if there is no frustration and, you know, we can, we can think about that in our context where we have, at, we, where we have tried to shape a society to eliminate frustration, where we have tried to shape a society to eliminate things that stand against our will and, and in the sense, if you don't have anything that stands against your will, you don't have a story and if you don't have a story, you don't have interest and this, this gets into, I think, Peterson's, Peterson's contribution in terms of understanding known territory and unknown territory, order and chaos and, and how we need both of those and I actually often think about that when I think about the life of the age to come because, for example, in the, in the revelation representation of the new heavens and the new earth there isn't any sea and I wonder, well, how will we be if there's no, if there's no chaos? Now it's pretty clear there's no evil and, and again, Peterson differentiates between evil and chaos and I think that's a helpful differentiation but as current, as, as we're currently constituted, we cannot imagine a satisfying existence without challenge. My homeless friend Daniel always used to quote the, quote, quote a Mormon saying there must be opposition in all things which is something out of the book of Mormony, love to show it to me but anyway, so, so in, well, let's not get lost in the, in the, in the woods here, so in, in part one, the nature of experience, maps of meaning stuff and, and some, some engagement with the hero's journey, the relationship between order and chaos and, and some of that. Now he transitions into the second part with, with a sentence, the second story which is deeper is essentially religious and it's not easy figuring out always what Peterson means by the words that he uses and, and so religious and, and I think what he means by religious is very similar to archetypal which later in the video he'll talk about that where you can't get beyond it and, and that's in a sense I think how he's using religious language and again if you go back to my video where he responds at Lafayette to the question what is religious, that which we act out in accordance with our, I'll rephrase it, our axiomatic presuppositions and then this is actually very close to the definition of religion that I was raised with and, and a conservative Calvinist world where all of life is religious and, and all what we do in this world is we live out the, we live out our beliefs, our deepest beliefs, our truest beliefs and those are the things that, that guide our action. Now the second story, so the first story, kind of trying to not lose the forest for the trees here, the nature of experience and the second part are some axiomatic Christian, some axioms of the Christian revolutionary story. In other words, if you take his definition of religion these, if you're a Christian should be the basis of your actions and now he has eight of these and, and these are, I think his creation of these is, is really helpful to, to get a sense of, you know, what he sees Christianity as being and some of you might say, oh isn't that simple. Well I'd say no it isn't simple, the church has been wrestling with this for 2,000 years so his eight axioms, I'll just run through them quickly, to decide that and then, to decide that and then extract the proposition that being is good despite its tragedy and malevolence and he uses the, the Columbine killers as illustrations of that in many of his pieces. To work in consequence for the continual and eternal improvement of that being and to know that, and to know that as love, not a bad definition of love. Part of the difficulty we have with the word love in English is that it is too broad, which is why for example C.S. Lewis wrote a book called The Four Loves, which is, which is well worth reading. In fact on Audible you can find a recording of C.S. Lewis reading the book The Four Loves in his own voice, so if you want to know what C.S. Lewis sounded like, and his voice was pretty famous, you can, you can look that up. To do such work in truth, boy there's so much in these that, that you could spend a lot of time unpacking them. To let everything inadequate burn off in that pursuit and to welcome its replacement by what is better. Now this is, this is such, this is such deep Peterson stuff and if you're, if you're deep into Peterson, you've heard all this before, but you could, you could spend a long time on each of these sentences, well this is what theologians do essentially, to know that as, to know that as the sacred imitation of Christ. To know what? To let everything inadequate burn off in that pursuit and to welcome its replacement by what is better. Now, now pay attention, this is in the context of a discourse on Easter and the meaning of the resurrection. So again he's, he's tying the resurrection to this, this transformational journey and, and again as I said before, that is a layer of the resurrection story. If you reduce the resurrection story to that layer, and I'm not saying Peterson is doing that because he always leaves the door open, but if you reduce the resurrection to that layer, you have reduced the resurrection and you, you won't understand, you, you won't understand the rise of Christianity or its teachings if you, if you keep it at that reduction. So the next axioms actually follow on four. I think if I were to be Peterson's editor, I'd suggest that maybe these next four are actually four, four A, four B, four C, four D, these are sub points of four. I might be wrong, I might be wrong. To know, to know that as the sacred imitation of Christ, that's the replacement. Maybe just five is a, is a sub, sub point. To understand that although Christ's sacrifice redeems us, all the work still has yet to be done, and here we have the heart of the Calvinist-Arminian controversy, but actually it might be further back than that, and people have talked about Pelagius in context of, of Peterson. So, but that's, that's the question of our work versus God's work, and C.S. Lewis gets into that. We've been wrestling with that question for a long time in terms of how to articulate it. Now, on how to act it out. To accept that work as, as the sacred meaning of life. Well, okay, so maybe that's, maybe five should be four, sub point of four, and maybe seven should be sub point of six, and then eight is, is finally his eschatology, to strive towards the heavenly city on the hill in that manner. So, there's a lot in there, and I spoke about them a little bit, but, you know, I could even go over these, you can go over these again and again and again and again, and that's, again, this is what theologians do, because there's lots of stuff in these highly condensed axiomatic statements. Part three. Now, part three he introduces as his chapter for my seven in, in 12 rules for life, and so when I first listened to it, I thought, oh, I've listened to this already, I've already taken a look at this, and so I, I kind of skimmed it, but now in preparation for this video, I went over it again, and I noticed right away, he doesn't start at the beginning of the chapter, and I noticed that, that this is actually an edited, condensed, redacted version of the chapter, because the chapter brings, begins with, um, the chapter, the chapter begins with, um, life is suffering, and goes through kind of the, the hedonist, the hedonist justification for a selfish life, and then he, he jumps into, you know, a really, a favorite aphorism of his, every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost, and, and this is something that, that Peterson brings up quite a bit. Every preacher knows, people remember your illustrations better than your points, and, and what's interesting about this particular redaction is that, um, he, he keeps a lot of the illustrations from the chapter, and he condenses the points, and he changes a lot, changes a lot of the language, so if you're, to me, this was interesting on a number of levels, because for, when he talks about how he wrote maps of meaning, he talks about it, he spent three hours a day on it for 15 years, and he poured over every word, and I tend to think that this, for him, is part of his thinking and writing process, and he's probably continuing to do that over 12 rules for life. He's, he's, he's probably, he's probably still mulling over the text, and that's actually not a bad way to think, because as Peterson has talked about, and actually again, as Alan Jacobs has talked about, I finished his book on, on how to think, you know, thinking is in a sense having a conversation with yourself, and, and one of the key things about doing that is, is, is figuring out how to have something apart from yourself with which to converse with. You can kind of do it in your head, and we'll talk about the Watchers a little bit later in this video, you can kind of do it in your head, but this is, this is how we think, and this gets into also a little bit of Tolkien in terms of the ring, because why does, why does Sauron create the ring and pour so much of himself in that ring, and, and you kind of get some of this stuff in Harry Potter with the Horcrux. Now you had Harry Potter fans out there, it will kill me, but you know what I'm talking about, where there's something to our desire to differentiate ourselves to the degree that it's helpful to engage ourselves as multiple persons. Now obviously we want to be integrated selves, but we also have two hemispheres of the brain, and you know those, those studies when people have, their brains are split, you know, that some of the weird things that happen with respect to that. It's also interesting to think about this in the light of the Trinity, which again is a Christian doctrine where, where God is one self in three persons, and, and so you would almost imagine for all of eternity, you know, people sometimes say, well God made the world because he was lonely. No, it wasn't lonely, there are three persons for him to deal with, and, and again if you think about how all of this plays out, Peterson hasn't talked much, well, hasn't talked a lot about the Trinity per se, but when you think about this, this nature of being and what is required to think, anyway back to Peterson, so he's, you know, he's continuing, obviously continuing to mull over what he wrote in 12 Rules for Life, and what's interesting about, about this particular element of this video is this is a redacted version of, of Rule 7, and, and you can see why he has the image he has, which he'll refer to, and I'm not going to play through it this time, I'm, to me, I'm, I'm constantly torn, you know, people, one person said to me once, I don't know what videos to make, and I thought I could sit in front of this computer and make videos all day. I don't know what that says about me, but maybe it's my process of thinking, but, you know, so this is a redacted version, and, and so I've got basically a few observations about it that I'm just going to do for this video, and I'm going to leave it at that because I've got a lot of work to do, but the construction is from the bottom, and, and, and that's key here, and it's, it's something that outside of religious contexts, these are the only kinds of conversations currently legitimate in the public sphere. That's perhaps a good way to put it, and this is a consequence of secularism, so this gets back into our long conversation about secularism, or what it means to be secular, and the transition that Europe took from Christendom into secularism, and it gets into Charles Taylor's The Secular Age, that massive, massive book, yes, Charles Taylor, so, so this is the only, this is the only, this, this is the only kind of conversation that culturally is currently fashionable, and respectable, and in some sense, legally admissible in court, or in the legislature, in our current context, and so part of what I've been doing in my videos is, is exposing some of the foundations of this context, and so Peterson is working from the bottom in this, and so, and this is key to understanding all of Peterson's biblical series. Peterson is trying to figure out the Bible from the bottom, whereas source critics in the terminology of, of biblical studies, source critics try to get at the underlying documents of the Bible. Historical criticism tries to get at the events behind the Bible. Peterson is in a sense, maybe this is, Peterson is in a sense doing Darwinist criticism of the Bible, and, and he's trying to, Darwin slash Jung criticism of the Bible, and he's trying to show the, the biological, psychological underpinnings of the story. This is what he's trying to do. Now, for those of you Christians who are a little reactive about Darwin and evolution, I would, I would suggest that if the Bible is the kind of book that Jesus claimed, seemed to say it is, then that Bible will have more layers than we can comprehend, and it will be more true than we know, which would mean it shouldn't surprise us that it would have this kind of layer. Now, whether Peterson gets that layer right, that's a, that's a fun thing to talk about and a good thing to explore, but it shouldn't surprise us that the Bible should have this kind of layer. Jesus says things about the Bible, heaven and earth will pass away, and since before his word, and, you know, we get this respect for the text from the long tradition of the, of the rabbis and the prophets and how it, how it develops in, you know, how it develops in the, the Hebrew scriptures and then comes to be regarded by Jesus in, in second temple Judaism as NT Wright usually likes to say. So, so this is construction from the bottom, but I think it's important to bear that in mind as we think about it, and this is again part of the reason why a lot of religious people, when they listen to Peterson's biblical series, they will be turned off by it because in a sense in church, we are usually addressing or assuming the Bible from the top, and, and that's not a bad thing, and, and again, if you think about my Genesis 1 representation, you have earth, you have heaven, there's the top, in a sense, idealism comes from the top, empiricism comes from the bottom, but now some of the historical, some of the historical philosophical reasons for this, again, we have, we are post-Decart here, and, and we use Dao as an acid to eat away the accidents to arrive at a base essence or self-evidential truth, and this is also Lockian, this is post-Lock, because we are continuing to practice in this evidentialist assumption where there are justified beliefs. Now I haven't really gotten much into, let's see if I've got the book handy, when I was in, when I was in college, I had to take a fifth year because I was undecided for way too long, because way too much stuff is interesting, and so I, my fifth year, Nick Waltersdorf was back on campus to teach a course, and I had to stay, I had to do a fifth year to do, to get all my Greek in before seminary, so I took a, took a course on epistemology with Nick Waltersdorf where he used the stuff that he and, and Alvin Plantinga and others had developed, and actually if you look at Philip Carey's great courses series on philosophy and religion, the last chapter he goes into Waltersdorf and Plantinga, and so I've got the book, I kept that book, I probably still even have my class notes from that, but they're really helpful in here because in a sense what Plantinga and Waltersdorf begin to do is to ask questions about Locke, and to say now this is the project that the West has engaged in, is this really, is this really merited, is it necessarily so? If you under, if you know Porgy and Best, ain't necessarily so, so, but Peterson's project here is definitely from the bottom. He's using post, he's using Cartesian doubt, he's in a sense using Lockean evidentialism, and we're constructing this from our ground of certainty, and again for Peterson, and we've gotten into this in the epistemology and when I do my next video on CS Lewis and morality, we're going to talk more about Peterson's Darwinian epistemology where if in a sense you begin with the modernist assumptions about epistemology, they get bolstered almost immediately. If you poke a modernist with a little bit of skepticism regarding, you know, the regarding the constructions of their ideas and their feelings and their beliefs, they will fall back into pragmatism and say we can have confidence that our capacity to think is true because we can predict things in the world. Okay, first of all, the class of things that you can predict is surprisingly small, but, and that is a pragmatic attempt to bolster your position. Now Peterson in a sense calls the materialists on that and goes full Darwinian on them, which is why he calls Dawkins and Harris Newtonians, and we're all looking, many of us are looking forward to Peterson and Harris's big debate that's coming up, but Peterson goes full Darwinian on them and basically says what we can know is within the confines of survival, and that's really a Cartesian move too, and so there's a real tradition that's being experienced here of foundationalism, of evidentialism, and so this is Peterson's project, and now he's applying this to the Bible because he's in a sense, he's way over here saying we need this book to keep society together, but he's way down here in terms of saying now we got to build this up from the bottom and hopefully we'll meet in the middle, and this I think is the reason why the biblical series is so important for him to do. Now if you go to Philip Carey's great courses, Philophysis of Indian History in the West, it's important for us when we read Descartes to appreciate him within his historical context, and Carey does this because if you read Descartes, you know, I think therefore I am, I can't, my existence is self-evident, well how can I not fall into solipsism and fill out the rest of the world? Well the reason I can do it is because of God. Now we're seeing the difference of our age. Descartes at his time could say God, Newton at his time could say God, today if we say God everybody says I'm not taking any God answer, you can't use God to carry your philosophical baggage for you, but Descartes is living, you know, in a different age and so he does. So where does God fit into Descartes' project? The first thing Descartes proves in a type of ontological proof after his own existence is God's existence, and in that basis he proceeds to argue that the external world is not an illusion since God wouldn't try to mislead us. Now that's really important because again when we get into, and we're going to talk about the monarchical view, in a sense our ability to assume, our ability to easily assume a monarchical view gets undermined, and so Descartes begins the project of building from foundations up in the Enlightenment period and says okay we've got to build from foundations now, and Locke will actually kind of open this up more fully, but we've got to build from foundations. The first foundation I know is myself, the second foundation is God, and now I can fill in the rest of the picture, whereas before we just had God filling in the picture. Now we're skeptical of God so we got to start here and then God will fill it in, and now you have your monarchical vision by which you can see the rest of the world. Descartes' proof for God existence is based on the idea of God I find in my own consciousness, so it's a form of the ontological argument. This is a sign of things to come in modernity. God becomes a part of my project to make sense of an alien universe, and you can even hear the echoes of this in Freud's skepticism, and someone pointed me to a Reza Aslan video, a Think Big or Big Think video, I'm dyslexic, I always get word orders mixed up, about you know well God is the projection of us, he's basically recycling Freud's argument, and you can see even the roots of that are in Descartes. I turn to the self first, then make God a part of the self's project, and this is what Philip Carey calls the turn to the subject. Now we're still striving for that monarchical vision that God has, and that's important. We want a vision where the subjective is pre-redacted, in other words taken from the subject, pre-reacted, in other words taken out already, already cut out so that it will be true of every observer, and if you understand this you begin to get the sense of why, what do you do with all your social enemies, what do you do with all your political enemies. Now tyranny says kill them. In Western democracy we say outvote them, which is an improvement on kill them. We say try to persuade them, but people are very difficult to persuade, and so then in Western democracies the game gets into sophism, and it's interesting to remember that of course the sophists in Greek democracies, sophism is basically about win in arguments, rhetoric. Augustine was trained in rhetoric. This was considered the highest, this was at the top of the dominance hierarchy. If you can convince everyone of yourself, well then you don't have to kill them, then in a sense it's a much more powerful tool because if you kill people, I've been catching up on the walking dead, and Negan keeps saying people are a resource. Now Negan is a tyrant, but if you can, since can mind wash people, if you can influence people, if you can argue with people, if you can convince people, you have something far more powerful than if you can merely control people out of compliance. Now this gets theological very quickly too, but this gets into what in a sense we're striving for, this monarchical vision. We want a vision where the subjective is pre-redacted, already cut out, so that it will be true of every observer regardless of all consequences of personalist naturalist construction, and this then gets into C.S. Lewis's miracles versus reason thing, and in a sense when rationality rules does his video, we're using rationality to try to convince others. Now many other people will say, well let's instead of using rationality because rationality is really hard with people, let's use emotion to convince others, let's move their feelings, let's use pathos to move other people. With the 2018 elections coming up, both political parties are going to move into using fear to convince people to vote for one party or another because fear motivates people, but as you can see the game in a democracy moves to changing hearts and minds, and that's more powerful than tyranny because in tyranny you, if you, you know as Peterson notes about Piaget, there's a cost to tyranny. If people will follow you freely, that's far better than if people will follow you out of grudging compliance or fear because that grudging compliance and fear has to be maintained, and there's a cost to that so that the greater good is changing people's minds and hearts rather than trying to force compliance out of them. Although compliance is a powerful tool, gets used all the time, it's, it can be useful in the short term, but it's problematic over the very long term because the costs are high. Now what this actually connects to is the, the story of the tower of Babel. Now here again is my Genesis 1 representation, and if you've watched any of my Ezekiel classes, you know that I talk about this all the time, where you have the Genesis 1 representation of heaven and earth, you have heaven above and earth below, and in the rebellion, heaven and earth are cut off, and, and what's interesting is that perhaps we're in a late stage of the game where we are so cut off from heaven, we have cut ourselves off from heaven publicly, and we as a public now no longer speak of heaven, even though our project, our scientific project is in fact a tower of Babel-like project. We marshal our technology, and we marshal crowd power, crowd source, and in a sense we try to build a heaven to the sky. Why? Because we want to have that monarchical vision that heaven affords. In a sense, what we hope science will give us is an ability to look down on all of creation. I'm at the top of creation, um, Karen Carpenter, I'm at the top of the world looking down on creation, and then she goes and talks about love. Well, hey, you get past a certain age and your glands aren't firing that more. What you want is power, um, because if you have power, you can get love and, um, and porn stars and playboy models and, and all kinds of things if you're a celebrity or, or wealthy enough. So, well, here you have it. So, so in a sense, you can see the relationship between science and the tower of Babel here, because we, we want this monarchical vision where we can look down on the rest of the world, we can, where we can see the world without subjectivity, where we can see it as it is. Now, again, part of where Peterson comes in here is Peterson is casting doubt on that project because he says, if you cut out subjectivity, don't sneak it in later. And this is exactly the same point C.S. Lewis makes. In my conversation with Peterson, Peterson said that Lewis is a, um, as a Christian apologist, which he is, but that's a reduction of Lewis. Lewis has also written a lot of very interesting philosophical works, which I think is in very interesting dialogue with Peterson, which is why I'm making these videos. So, so this is in a sense the, the scientific project to build a tower up to the heavens so we can achieve this monarchical vision and we can see the world, but we might ask ourselves, why do we want to see the world? What are our motivations? Do we want to arrive at the heights of heaven only in order to see creation? I don't think so, because science combined with our hearts yields technology. Once we see things, we want to do with things. Once we see things, we have an idea. How can I make things better? How should it be? Go back to Peterson's schema from Maps of Meaning. Or do we want to storm the gates of heaven to unseat the sovereign? Now the, the biblical story of the Tower of Babel is ambiguous on the motivation and I think it's ambiguous because everyone assumed everyone, everyone knows why she's building a stairway to heaven. She's building a stairway to heaven so she can be God. And this was established in, in Genesis 3. If we can replace God, then we won't be bothered with his pesky choices and we can live by our own will. And now we're back into the double bind of tyranny and nihilism. Tyranny, the, the problem is, what do we do with other people's wills? And, and this is now playing out in American politics. Well, shut them up. Why do we want to shut them up? Why do we want to kill free speech? Because we don't want them in the court of public opinion. We want to control the court of public opinion. We don't want debate. Well, if we don't want debate, why not? Because we have, now this gets into post-modernity, we have lost, well, modernity finally is a skepticism about rationality. We have lost faith in rationality. And if we've lost faith in rationality, then all we have is grabbing the center, is grabbing power. And, and well, here's the story of the 20th century. Once you lose rationality, you lose the conversation and you yield everything to power. Now, as Peterson rightly critiques, this certain element of post-modernity, well, then all you're doing really right now is a naked power grab. And if, if, if that's where this goes, well, then it's just going to be civil war, because then, then we just wind out where it is. And, you know, it's very interesting if you look at, for example, in the book of Revelation, the way the story of the world ends is in a sense by God, this is so complicated, this is so complicated. Jesus conquers the world by his sacrifice. In the book of Revelation, the story is finished also by the force of God. Now, C.S. Lewis wants to nuance this in the great divorce, the door to hell is locked from the inside. But, but all of these stories are engaging the question, what do you do with the wills of others? Now, I think part of, part of the materialist dream is that if we can so construct the, if we can so understand the constructed wills of others, then we can shape them. But as C.S. Lewis continues to point out in Miracles and in Other Things, whose we, and this is exactly what Peterson is pointing out, whose we, you've not, you've said that everyone else's will is constructed but mine. They're all Muslims because they were raised Muslim. I see things clearly. And this again is, is, is C.S. Lewis's big point in his book, Miracles, that even those who are trying to be post-rationalists are not escaping rationality because they're still using it. And you can't be post and still keep deferring to it. It doesn't work. In other words, and this gets back into Lewis, Lewis will say, finally rationality, well, Lewis is in some ways very platonic. And, and so Lewis, Lewis's God is, is pretty platonic. I remember a guy, a guy I knew who, who I deeply respected, one of the best, most smartest guys, best, most well-read. I remember once he, kind of cursing Lewis and his Platonism. And I was, this was 15, 16 years ago. I remember hearing it, just tucked it in the back of my mind and thought, huh, everyone else, everyone else loves Lewis. Here's a Lewis skeptic, a deeply Christian man. Why? And, and some of that has to do with, with rationality here. Lewis, Lewis isn't God. But replace God, we won't be bothered by his pesky choices and we can, and we can live by our own wills. And, and again, this gets back into tyranny and nihilism, which are in a sense two sides of the same coin, the same problem of other people. Hell is other people. Now, now Peterson in part three, and again, I'm not going to run through it right now. We'll get into sacrifice and motivation. Sacrifice is surrendering a good we possess for, now this is where I'm going to want to play with Peterson a little bit, because through most of it, sacrifice is surrendering a good we possess for in exchange for something better. In other words, it's mercenary, it's transactional, it's in the service of acquisition, it's, it's still in the service of the, of the rebel self. Now, but that's not the only ground for sacrifice. Sacrifice is also, and I'm getting this from the Heideberg catechism, and if you watch my sermons, you'll understand misery, deliverance, gratitude. Sacrifice is also an expression of gratitude for something already given. And this is key in the Reformed faith, where when Jesus on the cross says to Telestai, it is finished, well, what do you mean it is finished? Well, it's just this thing finished, or is this thing finished, or is everything finished in this moment? Well, it's archetypal, because you can't get beyond it. Well, where then is sacrifice left? Where then are we located in terms of the things we do? How does that work? And, and, and so Peterson in a sense continues to see sacrificial as transactional, but I want to suggest that there's a second meaning of an understanding of trans-, of, of sacrifice and role of sacrifice, and that is that sacrifice, sacrifice is gratitude. Sacrifice is an expression of gratitude for something already given. In other words, and, and this is in fact a huge point that you see in parent-child relationships, because the difference between these is watershed in the nature of relationships between unequals, for example, between parent and child. So if, if you send your mom a card for Mother's Day, and your mom thinks she's only sending me a card for Mother's Day because I keep threatening to write her out of the will, how is the card looked? Or is the card received as my daughter loves me? Which does the mom prefer? Now, now this, this, this relationship between the transactional and gratitude, the more you work this relationship, it just keeps going deeper, because the daughter can say, I'm going to send mom the nicest, the nicest card for Mother's Day that I can imagine so that she'll feel grateful and she'll know that I'll love her, and if she knows that I'll love her, she'll treat me well, and she won't write me out of her will, or she'll leave everything to me and not my jerk-off brothers and sisters. These things just keep going down, and this is why this is such a hard problem, but I don't want to simply leave the transactional alone on the table, because I think gratitude is, is finally a better place for our hearts to live, because if you live in the transactional, we do see tools, and we make the world our tools, and we make other people our tools, and I think it's in, I've got 12 rules for life around here somewhere, but, but I think it's chapter three of Peterson's book, chapter three or four, I don't remember, it's the one where basically he deconstructs generosity and doing good and world saving. That's a devastating chapter for me, because, you know, I'm a family, I have generations of, of world savers behind me, and, but Peterson's critique is dead on. Is this, am I actually doing this out of gratitude, or is my anxious, selfish, greedy, insecure little heart fooling my, my frontal cortex in service of my own self-righteousness to convince me of a goodness I don't have, and this, again, is why my Calvinism, and I really should do a video on my Calvinism, why my Calvinism gets archetypal, because at the base I am, you know, you've got total depravity, and total depravity does not mean I'm as bad as I could be. Total depravity means that my motivations are always compromised, and everything I do is morally compromised, and I can't cleanse myself from this compromise, and even if I highlight that Peterson's idea of sacrifice here is highly transactional, and I would say, oh, I've got a better way of gratitude, or are you being grateful because God will like that better, and it's like, I can't get out of this. Well, that's why I'm a Calvinist. I can't get out of this myself. I need, you might say I'm a 12-stepper, I need a power higher than myself to save me from this. So Peterson's project is to dispel the dismal smear by materialism and post-modernity against religious narratives. He is, he is seeing that through his study of the 20th century, he has seen that losing the logos at the center of your society, you devolve into the twin problems of tyranny and nihilism, and I think through Peterson, he's really helped me to see that this is religious, that Peterson is in a sense showing the religious roots of this political phenomenon, and we're seeing this played out in our, in the culture of the West right now, and this is a struggle right now over, well, if materialism finally wins, we're going to devolve into tyranny nihilism, and perhaps nihilism is the canary in the coal mine, in the coal mine, in the coal mine. I'm sure the coal mine is cold too, but nihilism is in a sense the canary in the coal mine, and the success of the West has bred the nihilism because we've been able to have nihilism on the, we're feeding off our dead liberal fathers, I mean classical liberal, we're feeding off our dead liberal parents, and so, but the nihilism hits first. We haven't, we haven't been able to we haven't devolve, we haven't descended into the kinds of tyranny we see in the Soviet Union or in Nazi Germany, but we're getting more tyrannical, and you can sense that, and we'll see how that, how our system deals with that tyranny, and you know, some are arguing, well, Trump is more fascist, and the left is more tyrannical, and we've got polarization, and again, if you look at, if you look at what Peterson is saying, this makes sense. Of course, we have polarization, and of course, these are the two poles, so, so we have fascism on one side, and on the right, and then we have tyranny on the left, and, and this is where this goes politically if you lose it religiously. This is at the heart of Peterson's argument, and this is an important argument, but it's, again, it's not an argument everybody's going to take the time to go through and figure out, so, so he's trying to dispel the smear of materialism and post-modernity against religious narratives, and to invite us to re-engage in the drama, because remember, first we act out what we cannot articulate, and, and this is where we should show a little bit of gratitude for our fore, for our forebears who acted out the kind of political things that have kept us from tyranny so far, and we know that, well, I, I try not to get too political in these things, because I'm not a, I'm not a politician, and I'm not a political scientist, but you went from, you went up from a, a rather, a rather, I, I don't know Russian history enough to know whether the Tsarist rules were tyrannical, but you went from a tyrannical, you went from a tyrannical Tsarist rule to a tyrannical communist rule to now an authoritarian Putin rule. Well, they've, they've, Russia has been practicing various forms of tyranny all along. The founding fathers in the United States, and, and some of those in Western Europe and Christendom, have been practicing a degree of freedom, and they've had practices in society that have helped keep things from sliding into certain kind of tyrannies. Now, there's always a tyrannical element of institutions, Peterson is dead on right there, but I should, you know who you are, thank you for this. A guy sent me a little gift that he had carved, and you can see the lobster, and you can see that this, that the snake of chaos eating himself. Um, put him up here by bucko. I'm so easily distracted. Oh yeah, politics. Um, so, so in the West we've had practices that have helped us, that have kept us from sliding in some of the worst tyrannies, but we shouldn't feel so good about that. Germany, of course, slid into a horrible tyranny, and Germany was a highly Christian, Germany was at the top of the heap in terms of science and religion, you know, in the, in the late 19th, early 20th century, along with England perhaps, and so anyway, to invite us to, Peterson wants to invite us to re-engage in the grammar. First we act out what we can not articulate. Next we represent what we acted out, and this I'm adding in here, as an abstraction that can become a tool for further engagement in other parts of the drama. Okay, first we act out what we cannot articulate. Next we represent what we acted out as an abstraction that can become a tool for the further engagement in the other parts of the drama. I was, you know, through thinking through the Peterson stuff, I was thinking about, okay, what's the relate, he's getting this from Piaget, of course, what's the relationship between action and articulation, action and representation, and it seems there it's not, it's a cycle, and so we act things out, we articulate it, we represent it, and you might ask, well, why are we, why are these representations so important for us? Oh, because when we abstract them, we can attempt to move them over to another area and apply them somewhere else. This is, in a sense, the great utility of abstraction, that we can use it to apply in different places, and so this is what Peterson is doing through all this, and says we have to keep these stories because they're foundational, and he's saying, here's my pursuing these stories from the bottom, and he's obviously having effect because he's having an effect, we can see that in the numbers that are watching him. So why is Peterson a gateway drug to the church? Well, again, this is a big question I've been wrestling with, and we've been talking about this with a lot of you, and a lot of you have put forward answers, and now let's avoid the flaw of imagining there's only one element to this, let's imagine there are lots of elements to it, so there's psychological layers, there's economic layers, there's identity layers, there's lots of layers to this, okay? Let's just assume that for now, but let's see if we can expose another layer. Why is Jordan Peterson a gateway drug to the church? Now the watchers, now when I say the watchers, what I mean are these, I don't even know what to call, I call them watchers because I don't have another word for them, are they motivations? Peterson talks about sub motivations within us, and I think of this internal yungying great cloud of witnesses in my head, there are all these tiny little sub Paul Vanderclays that are in there, and they're watching all the time, and the conscious Paul Vanderclay that, again, if you watch the movie Inside Out, maybe the control board of where the little peeps are pressing the buttons, we're watching Peterson, and we're watching him go through this, and our watchers are figuring stuff out, and when we listen to this, we're feeling the nihilism, so motivation is there, boy, you got to do something about this nihilism because it isn't right, and you got to do something about this tyranny because you've been trying to control your husband or your wife or your kids, and it just isn't working. People are not easy to control, and we don't love people when we control them. Look at the old Star Trek iMUD, where they wind up on this planet, and this guy has built these beautiful female robots, and he's bored. Well, why is he bored? He thought, these beautiful female robots that completely bow to his will would make him happy, but they don't. Again, chaos order back and forth, so our watchers are back there, and they're dealing with all the stuff we're dealing with, and Peterson comes along, and one of our watchers says, watch this guy. He's like, well, I'm busy. Watch this guy, and that watcher will keep bugging you. Watch this guy. Watch this guy. Listen to him. Listen to him, and the committee is fighting about it. Again, these are metaphors. Don't confuse the metaphor for reality. This is just trying to gain an insight into what's going on. We have no idea what consciousness means. We have no idea what—we have not deconstructed people. Why? Because the minute we do, if in fact people are the kind of things that can be deconstructed, we will devolve into eternity. Eternity. Eternity. We will devolve into tyranny. Read Brave New World. That's essentially what that novel is about, and if you've never read Brave New World, read Brave New World or get it on audiobook if you don't read. But anyway, he's a gateway drug to church because the watchers are already acting out the drama, because the watchers have been convinced, and they're saying, go to church. Go to church. Go to church. Well, which church? And how? And church is full of snakes. Church is full of people. And so then they start poking at the rider. So now I'm switching metaphors. We've got the inside-out metaphor of the people on the buttons, and now I'm switching over to Jonathan Haidt and his rider and the elephant. So the rider starts trying to pull the elephant over to church. The elephant doesn't want to go to church. Well, why doesn't the elephant want to go to church? Because the elephant likes sleeping in on Sunday, and the elephant likes going out to Starbucks on Sunday, and the elephant likes having brunch and watching football and whatever you do on Sunday morning. Don't go to church. But the rider's up there, I think we're going to go to church. I think we're going to go to church. And the elephant's like, I don't want to go to church. Except, of course, for those of you who are raised in church and all your little church-raised elephants are used to going to church. So then when you stop going to church, part of you nags in the back. The elephant's like, you should really go to church. You should really go to church. So Peterson, in this long conversation, is triggering the watchers. And that yungi and internal great cloud of witnesses, or internal cloud of witnesses as opposed to the great cloud of witnesses in the book of Hebrews, are watching Peterson and moving the rider to coax the elephant into church. Now this gets into something that I'm not quite up to in miracles, but which is a really important thing because, you know, Peterson, oh, why does he get upset? Well, he gets upset because he sees society careening and he studied the 20th century and he says, this is a, you know, when I hear, I can hear him say it in my head, this is a bad idea. All right, this is a bad idea. Until the corpses stack up. This is why Peterson goes off on this stuff because he's motivated. His watchers are in the back of his head saying, this is a bad idea. We've got to keep this from happening. The difficulty we have is that when we see something that we don't think should happen, we're always tempted by tyranny and nihilism. That these things won't go away. We're tempted by these things. And if you, even if you watch the crappy prequel of Star Wars, Anakin, you know, so much human evil is done to try to avoid other human evil. And this is where Christian eschatology and tyranny actually come together. Because if you can believe, and this is where when we get into Peterson saying, and it's up, it's up to us, let me go back to that, sacrifices and motivations, it's up to us to fix it. It's up to us to fix it. And this is where Christian eschatology comes in and says, no, this is God's project. Well, that sounds, I can't trust that. I can't trust that because, well, why can't you trust that? Because I don't trust God. Because I don't believe there is a God. Because, okay, well, let's analyze this pragmatically. If you are afraid, you will always be tempted to tyranny. And so if you want to save the world, only I can be in control of it. What Christian eschatology does is back you off that and says, no, vengeance is mine, saves the Lord, God will judge. God will actually finally call the world to account and he's going to call you to account too. So don't get too tyrannical. Don't be in the process of trying to control everyone because tyranny is a bad deal. And Peterson will say tyranny is a bad deal. Now everybody is saying, well, Peterson should run for prime minister. I think Peterson, I'm not going to tell them what to do, but we imagine when we get to the top of the hierarchy, we can control everything. Every U.S. president learns that lesson pretty darn fast that in our systems, part of the reasons we've set up the systems are so that tyrants don't happen. That's why you have checks and balances. That's why you have courts. That's why you divinate the process and everyone in the system treats the process as sacred. And if you violate the process, there are consequences. So if you embrace Christian eschatology, you can on one hand say, I'm going to deal with my anxiety via eschatology. I'm going to finally rest in what God has done for me. And I'm going to work out of gratitude. I'm going to finally believe that in the final analysis, God will save the world. And I am going to do everything that I can, even at great sacrifice to myself, to try while maintaining the freedom of my neighbors. That's what loving your neighbors means. It means maintaining their freedom. While maintaining the freedom of my wrongheaded, evil neighbors, I will give my life sacrificially for them. This is the Christian message. And you can see why. So Peterson keeps saying, you can't recreate a fairy tale. And the difference between religion and ideology is that religions are self-balanced. Now, some of the critics of Peterson have said he's acting pretty ideological. And I think at point times they have a point. And I know Peterson has surrounded himself with his own group of critics, which is a truly helpful and healthy thing to do. And it's actually very wise because the thing that Peterson's going to have to be careful of is not becoming a tyrant, is not himself sliding into tyranny, and not himself becoming, creating an ideology. Well, how do you avoid creating an ideology? By submitting to a religion which is already fully formed and out there. Now, I'm a Christian pastor. I'd recommend Christianity. Thank you. But here's the thing. And so then if you look at eschatology, you can say, built into eschatology and built into what we have in the Reformed faith of Christ having completed the work, affords the individual the capacity to work both at great sacrifice and in great freedom without anxiety. Why? Because if you have to save the world, you're probably going to do it at the expense of others because this is what we do. If you say, God will save the world. I am his servant. I will do everything in my power working full out to serve him. You say, fine. What mustn't you do if you're going to serve him? Hate your enemy. You can't violate their will. You can't become a tyrant. And could it be that this, in fact, is what has given the West its ability to at least so far, to a certain degree, maintain the freedom of the individual? Because deeply built into the story, at layers that we struggle to see or articulate, we know that on one hand Americans love happy endings. All of our movies are that way. On one hand, we have a hopeful eschatology where Gandalf comes with his white horse and saves the remnant at Helm's Deep. Every time I see that part of the Lord of the Rings movie, I tear up because, hey, it's archetypal. Jesus comes on a white horse and saves his beleaguered servants who are under the boot of empire. And, well, this is the story. And so if you embody the story, if you act out the story, well, you can say, well, yeah, I can I can pour myself out even for my enemy who has bad politics and bad ideas and every kind of reprehensibility out there. I can pour myself out and I can even lose happily because my God reigns, because Jesus is alive, and because finally the story has a happy ending. You might say, well, how do you know that? Well, I believe it. Well, you can't know it. Well, what do you mean by no? And, no, let's take its pragmatic step back. All right. What is your anxious-filled self-centeredness actually accomplishing? I would make the argument that it's exactly this that has created the endless tyrannies in how many different fashions throughout the history of the world. This is what makes human history bad and evil. And it's actually the surrender to the good God and his eschatological future that affords us both the zeal of trying to reflect our God and making the world better and not stepping over that line and doing it at the expense of others. And in a sense, what the Bible says is that God will deal with the other. And if you might say the only way the other will be dealt with will be by violence. Yeah. Well, then God will do the violence, not me. And read Miroslav's Volf, Exclusion and Embrace, where Volf basically says, so he was there at the breakdown of the former Yugoslavia and the civil wars that followed. And he said, if you're a materialist, you must settle all your scores here and now in the blood of your enemies. If you're a theist, you can leave it to God. Well, what difference does that make here and now? It makes a world of difference here and now. Because God can finally exact vengeance and justice, both more justly and more painfully than we can do now. You might say, well, I don't like the idea of hell. Well, then you don't like the idea of justice either. And if you give up on justice, well, now you're back into another camp. So, and this gets into a point that Louis makes in Miracles in Chapter 6. And he's talking about some misgivings about the bigger points that he's making. And I'm a little bit ahead of myself. I do want to go back and deal with Louis Chapter 5 on morality. That brings me to the second consideration. The state of affairs in which ordinary people can discover the supernatural only by obtruse reasoning is recent and by historical standards abnormal. And here Louis is getting into the fact that, okay, so we have released, we have gotten people off of the opiate of the masses. And we no longer deploy religion on a mass scale like it was back in the bad old days. Now, everybody's there to believe for themselves. Well, guess what? When everybody believes for themselves, what do you discover? They're walking around with basically a lot of ideas that aren't much more refined than I see, I want, I grab. And in fact, the whole process of civilization is to get us beyond that. And so what you're trying to do is teach the whole world a better way. Now, if you watch the Freddie and Paul show, Freddie's my friend. Freddie didn't get very far in school. Freddie did finish high school. He does have a high school diploma. Freddie every now and then, you know, tries to attend a community college class. Freddie has hope and aspirations for being more than what he is now. Along the scales of the hierarchies we commonly assume. I don't know what Freddie's IQ is. Freddie sometimes says things that blow me away with his brilliance, but not a lot of people would listen to him and say he's brilliant in terms of the way that we value brilliance in our society. But here's the miracle about what religious systems in the past did. I have, so there's another guy who made profession of faith here once, Down syndrome man. And that was before my time here. And the, the people who are on a church council who did his membership interview were amazed at how this man with Down syndrome could express faith. And those of you who are Christians out there know this. Then you have to ask yourself, we're such believers in education. Our ability to educate people gets so exclusive and hierarchical and narrow so fast. How could religion deploy wisdom in a way that even a man with Down syndrome can embrace? Think about that. Think about how powerful that is. Think about what an achievement that is. You know, Peterson's onto something here because religion did that. You, you, the, the Down syndrome man I'm thinking about every day goes to school, goes to special school to keep him busy. So, you know, he doesn't bother the, his brother with whom he lives. Religion was able to deploy to people with even incredibly low IQs a, a noble sense of belief that preserved them and gave them meaning and happiness their whole life long. And we're impressed with cell phones. You can give that Down person, Down syndrome person a cell phone, he'd probably struggle to figure it out. But religion did more for him than a smartphone. Think about that. And, and I've been, I've been thinking about this idea for a long time and it's, it's hard to figure out how to articulate. And I didn't plan on articulating any here, but, but there it is. And so this is part of Lewis's point. All over the world until quite modern times, the direct insight of the mystics and the reasoning of the philosophers percolated to the mass of people by authority and tradition. They could be received by those who were no great reasoners themselves in the concrete form of myth and ritual and the whole pattern of life. Even a Down syndrome person can love Jesus and know what good and evil is and know what right and wrong is and, and deal with that struggle to the same degree as someone with an IQ, you know, in the one fifties or one eighties. In the conditions produced by a century or so of naturalism, plain men are being forced to bear burdens, which plain men were never expected to bear before. We must get to the truth for ourselves or go without it. There may be two explanations for this. It might be that humanity and rebelling against tradition and authority has made a ghastly mistake, a mistake which will not be less fatal because the corruptions of those in authority rendered it very excusable. On the other hand, it may be that the power, capital P, let's see Lewis, this is a reference to God or a God-like principality and power. It may be that the power which rules our species is at this moment carrying out a daring experiment. Could it be intended that the whole mass of people should now move forward and occupy for themselves those heights which were once reserved only for the sages? Is the distinction between wise and simple to disappear because all are now expected to become wise? If so, our present blunderings would be but growing pains. But let us make no mistake about our necessities. If we are content to go back and become humble plain men obeying a tradition, well. If we are ready to climb and struggle on till we become sages ourselves, better still. But the man who will neither obey wisdom in others nor adventure for her or himself is fatal. A society where the simple may obey, the few seers may live. A society where all were seers could live even more fully. But a society where the mass is simple and the seers are no longer attended to achieve can only superficially. But a society where the mass is still simple and the seers are no longer attended to can achieve only superficiality, baseness, ugliness, and in the end extinction. On or back we must go. To stay here is death. This is Jordan Peterson's point. Although Peterson hasn't quite got there yet. Lewis is there already. This is Jordan Peterson's definition of the truth. So there it is. Why is Peterson sending people to church? Well the watchers are watching and and people are instinctively knowing either I've got to go back to the seers, which is going to church, or I've got to climb this myself. Well I'm climbing it myself and well why are you watching my videos? Because if you've found anything I'm doing helpful you're climbing behind me or maybe you're climbing ahead of me keeping an eye on me and you got a rope on me. I appreciate that because you know you can fall off mountains. And this again is why Christian eschatology and Christian afterlife Christian afterlife theology helps because it reduces my anxiety and encourages me up the mountain. But it's not finally me getting up the mountain that saves me or rescues me. So again I think Peterson got here. I'm sorry. I think Lewis got here before Peterson.
