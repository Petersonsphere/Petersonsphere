 Hi, this is Paul. One of the early things I did in the history of my channel was a commentary on Jordan Peterson's biblical series and as many people have noted I never finished it and part of the reason I never finished it was I sort of got taken over by everything that was coming at me all the conversations all the people trying to figure out what what to What to do with it all and I've always in the back of my mind wanted to come back to it Part of the reason I think that biblical series was so important was not necessarily that it's the most significant Intellectual Contribution that Jordan Peterson has made that could perhaps be his maps of meaning But it certainly was I think perhaps the most important religious contribution and potentially social Contribution because it seemed to be in particular the biblical series that impacted many of the watchers who were struggling personally with depression with nihilism with what we today call the meaning crisis and so it was in the biblical series that they Something happened we'll say it that way and that Again and again when I talk to people and again it could very much be the sample that the sample of people that are coming to talk to me obviously with the interest in religion and the interest in the biblical series that That that's just the group of people coming to me, but I think that that particular series was was important Because it gave Peterson away in a sense to take everything that he had learned from maps of meaning and to pour it through The Bible now I'm making this on September 11 2019 after doing a lot of listening to John Vervecki doing a lot of conversations with a lot of different people and one of the things now having been immersed in John Vervecki's work and having before that been immersed in Peterson's work paying a lot of attention to Both of them there is a degree of commonality between them and as I mentioned in one video that had some serious sound problems the One of the better ways to understand the Jordan Peterson phenomenon is within I think this larger frame that John Vervecki shows and conceptualizes in the meaning crisis Peterson approaches it in a very different way and in some ways I was listening to you know part of part of what caught me early in Vervecki's videos was his treatment of shamanism and shamanism is a Interesting is an interesting phenomenon for example people have noted that Shamanistic practices like looking at you know bones of birds or entrails or something like this There's sort of a there's sort of a randomizing function that happens when we're forced to focus on something outside of ourselves and that allows us to see the world in a slightly different perspective and I mentioned when I was working on some of those videos on Vervecki stuff that the Bible Even if you believe that there's nothing to it that it's a random book the fact that Millions of people over thousands of years have been looking at that same random book and And things have come out of it the Bible provides a very interesting narrative Filter Through which a huge number of people have looked at the world that in and of itself makes it a fascinating Artifact of human civilization now What you think about the contents of the book Well, that's what you think about the contents of the book But one of the one of the questions that I'm gonna be wrestling with in a few videos I had a conversation with a guy named Jeff and I'll be playing my conversation with with him Probably in a few days and he gave me some challenges and I really enjoyed challenges and part of my order chaos Mapped territory unmapped territory Dynamic means that I really enjoy challenges coming at me and he he basically gave me some challenges to say can Christianity engage the challenges that the world is Looking at today now part of the difficulty that we have is when you hear ministers say those words It's framed in a particular Context and I think part of what was so refreshing about Jordan Peterson's Engagement with the Bible again not unlike Northrop Fry's engagement with the Bible Someone coming from a different discipline someone coming not necessarily from the position of a believer But someone coming to the book and asking quite honestly Can this book shed light on humanity and how? And so on one hand they don't have sort of the eye of the beloved That looks at their beloved and you know the eye of a parent that looks at their child and says My my child is like every child and wake Lake will be gone above average and and beautiful because they're my child But someone who looks at the Bible through a different eye and says there's these things in this book and their dynamics and phenomenon around this book that Make it unique in all of human history and it's something that's worth looking at and Jordan Peterson Had the interest and the courage and actually the vision to Rent out the Bader Theatre I'm sure he had a he took a considerable risk when he first did it that you know Anybody would buy the tickets and lo and behold the place sells out and it sells out 15 times and then he takes his book tour around the world and that sucker sells out. I mean he Whatever you think of Jordan Peterson he had the vision and the guts to step up and try it and It worked it something succeeded and so Given that so I want to take a look at the biblical series again and Maybe I'll I'm the ADHD So I have two way too many projects that have begun and not finished But I want to take a look at this series and again I have to try and do it while not letting my other projects drop because This series was really important for a lot of people and part of what I enjoy coming back to something after I've been away from it and lived apart from it while at the same time doing a lot of study into Jordan Peterson listen to A lot of his other videos going through the meaning crisis videos with John Verbeke doing all the other surrounding listening and conversations It's not the same biblical series to me anymore and now being a pastor who comes around and around and around On the Bible again and again and again. There's always the same dynamic every time I come to a text maybe a story I know very well a text. I know very well every time I come to it I am different and then I come to the text and so my life is different and the text speaks to me in a different way so I want to look at the biblical series and so I'm going to do Basically how I got into this but I I haven't made a PowerPoint series and I'm playing with some other Software right now to see how that goes and Well, this this whole YouTube adventure for me has been one great trial. So let the trial continue Now I'm gonna play it at 1.25 speed And that might mess with some of you because I know a lot of you play my videos faster But we'll see how it goes. And again, I'm sure you'll let me know in the comment section For The audio listeners this the psychological significance of the biblical stories lecture 1 May 16 2017 this was about the period that I Jordan Peterson really came on my radar and I really started listening to him intently Well, thank you all very much for coming it's really shocking to me that you don't have anything better to do You know seriously though it is I mean, you know And it's fun watching some of these older videos because you can see some of the ways that this You know that Peterson's been sort of Transformed and how could he not be by I'm trying to figure out where to put my put my camera here if I should have it at the center How could he not be with everything that's happened to him and a lot had happened to him by that point because it was you know October September 2016 that the c16 thing happened and Again, he had the wisdom and the foresight to okay something's going on. Well, let's let's Let's try this biblical thing and see where it goes It's very strange in some sense that there's so many of you here to Listen to a sequence of psych of lectures on the psychological significance of the biblical stories it isn't something I've wanted to do for a long time, but Still does surprise me that There's a ready audience for it and well, so that's good. So we'll see how it goes and I'll start with this because this is the right question The right question is why bother doing this and I don't mean why should I bother doing it? I have my own reasons for doing it, but you might think well why bother with this strange little book at all and And you know it was this that got the attention of course of a lot of religious people and yesterday I talked to I talked to trip and trip has been a Christian his whole life and His response was similar to mine in that well, this guy's taking the Bible seriously. That's something I can respect He's extending respect to me it leads me to want to extend respect to him That's a good question, you know It's a contradictory Document that's been cobbled together over thousands of years. It's outlasted kingdoms many many kingdoms You know, it's really interesting that and Jesus comment of the Sermon on the Mount comes to mind about what how his word will endure And yeah, it's endured It's endured and it's and it's not stopping turns out that a book is more durable than and stone It's more durable than a castle. It's more durable than an empire and that's really interesting You know that it's something in some sense so evanescent can be so long-living So there's that that's kind of a mystery. I'm approaching this whole Scenario this is the biblical stories as if they're a mystery fundamentally because they are there's a lot We don't understand about them. We don't understand how they came about We don't really understand how they were put together We don't understand why they had such an unbelievable impact on civilization. We don't understand civilizations And they continue to have impact on civilizations And how people could have believed them We don't understand what it means that we don't believe them now or even what it would mean if we did believe them There's and then on top of all that there's the additional problem Which isn't specific to me, but it's certainly relevant to me that no matter how educated you are You're not educated enough to discuss the psychological significance of the biblical stories, but I'm that's very true I'm going to do my best and partly because I want to learn more about them and one of the things I've learned is that the best way to learn about something is to talk about it and And that's something I agree with as well. I'm lecturing. I'm thinking you know I'm not trying to tell you what I know for sure to be the case because there's lots of things I don't know for sure to be the case I'm trying to make sense out of this and I have now part of part of this gets into Now one of the things I can't do with the softwares go big and go small in terms of my little screen as I've done in other videos One of the interesting things about Peterson is is he in a sense has a sort of perpetual openness about this and One of the big debates in the Jordan Peterson Fandom for a long time was is he on his way to being a Christian? well he's been making these similar noises for a very long time and it's it's almost in a sense that this is this is I Don't know how I don't know how in motion he is as much as this is how he is I've been doing this for a long time now You know you may know you may not that I'm admirer of Nietzsche Nietzsche was a devastating critic of I would say dogmatic Christianity Christianity I've got some issues with the repeated use of dogmatic because I don't think that word means what we think it is when we use it there because Everyone is dogmatic when it comes to some things and I understand what Peterson is saying here I I would think that actually the the dogmatic is and inflexibility For the sake of Secondary issues that should not be primary to the pursuit of truth or even in religious terms to the fidelity of Christ As it was it Nietzsche was a devastating critic of I would say dogmatic Christianity Christianity as it was instantiated in institutions I suppose although he's a very paradoxical thinker because for example one of the things Nietzsche said was that he didn't believe that the scientific Revolution would have ever got off the ground if it hadn't been for Christianity and more specifically for Catholicism because he believed that over the course of Really a thousand years the European mind so to speak had to train itself to interpret Everything that was known within a single coherent framework coherent if you accept the initial axioms now Single coherent framework, but also within a single institutional framework something which of course would be broken up during the Protestant Reformation and in Peters I do want to get back now that I'm again finding a way to do some of these commentaries on video I want to I want to get back also into Peterson and Bishop Barron because in that video they had a lot of Commentary about the church in the 20th century that I thought was was helpful and good As it within a single coherent framework coherent if you accept the initial axioms a single coherent framework and so Nietzsche believed that that Catholicization of of the phenomena of life and of history Produced the kind of mind that was then capable of transcending that its dogmatic Foundations and then concentrating on something else which in this particular case happened to be the natural world And so Nietzsche believed that in some sense Christianity died in its own hand It had spent a very long period of time trying to attune people to the necessity of the truth Now in terms of the natural world if you go back to the videos the early videos that I did in spring of 2018 I spent a lot of time on the process from you know why the product how the Protestant Reformation sets up the enlightenment and One video that I haven't been able to produce because of the sound error and the other software is a critique of Steven Pinker's Attempt to somehow disentangle Christianity from the enlightenment I don't think you can have the enlightenment without the history of Christianity in Europe No absent the corruption and all of that That's always part of any human endeavor and then the truth the spirit of the truth that was developed by Christianity turned on the roots Of Christianity and everyone woke up and said something like or thought something like well. How is it that we came to believe any of this? It's like waking up one day and noting noting that you really don't know why you put a Christmas tree up but you've been doing it for a long time and that's what people do and you know, there are wreath and and that's a that's an excellent illustration of the The tradition in the West where and this perhaps is a sense of corruption itself where the the reasons for things disappear sometimes because of the cause of things and And we continue to do them and then we wake up and say well, what is this Christmas tree about? But I'd sure would miss it if it were gone reasons to put a Christmas tree up, but you've been doing it for a long time and that's what people do and you know, there are reasons that Christmas trees came about but The what would you say the ritual lasts long after the reasons have been forgotten? so now Nietzsche, although he was a critic of Christianity and also a Champion of its disciplinary capacity because you see the other thing that Nietzsche believed was that it was not possible to be free In some sense unless you've done unless you had been a slave and by that he meant that you don't go from childhood to full-fledged adult individuality you go from childhood to a state of Discipline which you might think is akin to slavery to self-imposed slavery that that would be the best scenario where you have to Discipline yourself to become something specific before that you might be able to reattain the generality that you had as a child And he believed that Christianity had played that role for Western civilization but in the late 1800s he announced that God was dead and you often hear of that as It's important to recognize that Peterson's take on Nietzsche is not without controversy Well Peterson's take on a lot of things is not without controversy But a number of other people who have read Nietzsche deeply I have not Have some real questions whether whether Peterson actually gets Nietzsche right here something triumphant But for Nietzsche it wasn't because he was too nuanced the thinker to be that simple-minded see Nietzsche understood that This is something I'm going to try to make clear is that We There's a very large amount that we don't know about the structure of experience that we don't know about reality and we have our articulated Representations of the world and then you can think of outside of that there are things we know absolutely nothing about and there's a buffer Between them and those are things we sort of know something about and we okay, and so right away We're going to get into the the bicameral mind. There's the there's our representations that we have about the world That's our mapped territory And then there's this unmapped territory these things that we don't know about the world and then there's stuff in the middle that we're always That we're always working on we don't know absolutely nothing about and there's a buffer between them And those are things we sort of know something about and we don't know them in an articulated way Here's an example. You know sometimes you're arguing with one of your someone close to you, and they're in a bad mood you know and They're being touchy and unreasonable and you keep the conversation up and maybe all of a sudden they you know they get angry Maybe they cry and then when they cry they figure out what they're angry about and it has nothing to do with you even though You might have been what precipitated the argument You know and that's an interesting Phenomena as far as I'm concerned because it means that people can know things At one level without being able to speak what they know at another and so in some sense the thoughts rise up from the body And they do that in moods and they do that in images and they do that in actions and we have all sorts of ways that We understand before we understand in a fully articulated manner and so and now if you pay attention to what he just said There's there's actually a few things in motion there It's not only that we know things that we're not conscious of But but also in the sense you have the question of what what do we mean by what am I? That I know things that I'm not conscious of because in very many ways I very closely identify with my conscious self But there's there's more to me and over the over the years I've talked about my consciousness Congress that that actually there are a whole variety of people But is it it's in a sense like that There's this one little platform perhaps. It's right in front of the microphone That's that's speaking to you if we want to sort of sort of a homuncular vision different different people from there take place, but I Know things that I cannot articulate and and we often have this sense someone put up a meme in the discord server of this Kind of fake-looking cat standing next to this real cat and and the meme was something to the degree of You know, the real cat is the thought in my head and the fake-looking cat is the thing that I can sort of express Well, we have that all the time that we know things that we that we can't articulate We're not quite sure how we know them and sometimes we think we know them and we're wrong But we're quite mysterious this way and we're quite large this way and we're quite Legion in this way It's of ways that we under they do that in moods and they do that in images and they do that in actions and we And people often ask me about emotions and I'll tell them, you know emotions are in a sense ways of letting other parts of your mind and other parts of you that you're not terribly conscious of communicate with you and That's why I'll often tell people that emotions emotions make bad masters, but they're good messengers And so you should listen to your emotions, but you should listen to them and you're gonna have to evaluate them according to Everything else that you're confronted with have all sorts of ways that we understand before we understand in a fully articulated manner And so we have this articulated space that we can all discuss and then outside of that We have something that's more akin to a dream that we're embedded in it's an emotional dream that we're embedded in it Now that dream that we're embedded in of course, you know, we're knocking on Jung's door pretty quickly and And dream itself the use of the word dream in this context is is interesting I Think it's it's we have to pay attention that is use of the word dream here is an analogy and it's what it's Analogous to is in fact that when we do dream we are confronted with all kinds of things that don't necessarily make sense and while we're dreaming we we're sort of trying to make sense of it and I would assume all of us have dreamed all of us have dreamt and And it's a common experience at least of me in a dream that you're you're having a dream and then something happens and part Of you says well that doesn't make any sense and sometimes in fact in the middle of the dream you say well Well, I suppose I'm dreaming. I suppose I'm asleep right now. And so it's And what he suggests is that this this reality of dreaming isn't something that's necessarily Isolated to what we're conscious of when we are Consciously dreaming to the degree you can see right away the fudginess of that word consciousness and this The consciousness of the dream while we're doing it and in other words where we're living in a we're living in a context that is More mysterious than We care to Imagine or let on between each other That thing that's more akin to a dream that we're embedded in it's an emotional dream that we're embedded in and that's based at least In part on our actions and I'll describe that later and then outside of that is what we don't know anything about at all And in that dream, that's where the mystics live and that's where the artists live and they're Again it's helpful to remember that this is a metaphor that he's building here and and in fact this metaphor has Locality so mystics and artists live in that space and and that is and that is true Well, what what do I mean that that's true? Well mystics and artists tend to be the people who socially are willing to say things that the accountants and people of status let's say perhaps in scientific communities are unwilling to say and They're willing to draw and they're willing to express and in a sense their Mystics and artists and musicians and poets are mediums and their mediums between this this dream like existence that we're all actually encountering and And what see right away you have to ask the question. Well, what is the other realm that that he's noting this realm of? this realm of of literalism this realm of mapped territory The media and in that dream that's where the mystics live and that's where the artists live and they're the mediators between the absolute unknown and the things we know for sure and You see what that means in some sense is what we know is established on a form of and and so my wife is a schoolteacher and I have a Childhood family therapist in the church one of the things you often do with children is you have them draw a picture and when we look at that picture we on the basis of Psychology experience we we try to come to some conclusions about what's been going on in that child's life What's been going on in that child's mind at what developmental stage is that child so on and so forth? knowledge between the absolute unknown and the things we know for sure and You see what that means in some sense is what we know is established on a form of knowledge that we don't really understand and that if those two things are out of sync so you might say if Articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream then we become dissociated internally Okay. Now what he says here is very important now, of course This is May 2017 come June 27 18 2018 is going to be having a conversation with Sam Harris their first thought their first conversation on Sam Harris's podcast as As one individual has noted this is on guys saying stocks An early conversation that he had with someone else about the Peterson Sam Harris conversation. It's right at this point that that Sam Harris and Peterson will have a falling out because in a sense what the assertion of the celebrity atheist ethos is is that This little thin slice that we imagine to be completely mapped territory This is the only valid knowledge and it's from this knowledge that we should work from and it's only from this knowledge that we should Work from I just had a very interesting conversation I don't know what in what ways I will roll this out Just a very interesting conversation with JP and as so often happens in a good conversation the conversation evokes larger the conversation evokes larger Images for me and and so he believes in panpsychism and so in a sense everything is alive or everything is a conscious and What Sam Harris and the celebrity atheists will do is they say well, it's just this it's just this literalistic This literalistic way is our mapped knowledgeable territory and and in that ways biblical literalists and Celebrity atheists very much are coming from the same Epistemological tribe and they're saying this is this is nothing It anything that we will publicly accept at knowledge as knowledge must be above this line Anything that's a little too dreamlike a little too mystical. You're too short to ride the ride That's in a sense what they say and and what Peterson is doing right here is saying now Wait a minute all of this all of this literal mapped Repeatable Territory is built on All of this other stuff and we're not really sure what all of this other stuff is We think knowledge of knowledge that we don't really understand and that if those two things are out of sync So you might say if our art You see what that means in some sense is what we know is Established on a form of knowledge that we don't really understand see there it is what we know is established on a form of knowledge, we don't really understand and Sam would say no what we know is established on what we can verify and what can be measured in a lab and anything Beyond that might be interesting for amusement or emotional purposes But life should be built on the goods that we find in this thoroughly mapped territory And then if those two things are out of sync, so you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream then we become Dissociated internally and and this is where Peterson comes at us as a clinical psychologist And this is this is where of course if you read Jung's autobiography some of the interesting places of that autobiography were these these places were Jung as a young doctor goes into a Mental hospital and basically the doctors say well don't bother talking to the patients because they're crazy. He's like well What are we doing here? So then he starts listening to the patients and as he listens to them he begins to say, you know It isn't just this isn't just randomness. This isn't just static There are there are connections here to much bigger stories and and so what Peterson lays out here is that and And this is this is you see this if you're a clinical psychologist, you see this if you're a pastor that You might want people to just be happy if there's food in the fridge and a roof overhead Everything would be fine and Peterson says no, that's not the way people work There has to be a coherence between behind this this far larger emotional The this far larger there the whole consciousness Congress must in some ways Be doing well for you to be able to go to work every day on time And if that stuff underneath is not doing well It's going to bubble up in your normal life And and this is the source of of how much angst in society when when someone looks at someone else and says boy they had they had everything anyone could have ever wanted and then they committed suicide or You know had that affair or you know, Anthony wiener took pictures of himself and sentence I you know anybody else says now wait a minute. That's just dumb and crazy But as a pastor, you know Well all was not well underneath and it's in that underneath area that in fact a lot of the really important things Happen and so Sam Harris might say no, we're just gonna live up here and it's like oh, yeah, that's that's a river called denial and there's a lot of stuff below the surface of that river and if You're around long enough, you know that We form of knowledge that we don't really understand and that if those two things are out of sync So you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream, then we become Dissociated internally we think things we don't act out and we act out things. We don't dream and right there We think things we don't act out. Oh, I'm as a pastor you deal with this all the time. Well, I'm a Christian I believe in these things. Well, you don't act like it Well, well, well what I did right there was not in keeping with who I said I was Okay, well and then you trot them off to a psychologist and what's the psychologist going to do? Well, let's talk about your childhood What does that have to do with the fact that I'm Anthony wiener and I showed my Johnson to some girl on the internet What's going on? well Peterson is saying we're a lot more complicated than you could imagine and we do things that we know It's what the Apostle Paul says in in Romans 7. We do things that We're not transparent to ourselves So you might say if our articulated knowledge is out of sync with our dream, then we become Dissociated internally we think things we don't act out and we act out things We don't dream and that produces a kind of sickness of the spirit and and that sickness of the spirit It and that sickness of the spirit then becomes you know in pastoral or Christian terms duplicity That you know you can be we have this all the time with churches and churches deal with this all the time You know what why those pedophile priests and then people come up with ideas well if they were allowed to marry then oh or if they were allowed to be gay then or or or it's it's never that simple and to Pontificate about ideas about fixing other people, you know if Anthony wiener's wife I don't know why I'm talking about Anthony wiener But he's just a good example of someone who he look at and say this guy's a congressman This guy has achieved this guy has risen to heights that many other people would envy He has a beautiful brilliant smart wife and he's got a great career And then he goes and does dumb things and he can't stop doing dumb things. That's not just Anthony wiener but alcoholism or or drug addiction or People go and do strange things I think again about Chris Arnade's That is our nades book. I mean he went on these long walks here. He's a successful is a successful stockbroker and But there's something eating on him underneath and starts going for walks and then people say well don't go for walks in these neighborhoods It's like I want to go for walks in those neighborhoods Oh really I want to hang out with the junkies and the winos and the prostitutes and and the people at McDonald's and I'll even dare Go into church and not just the nice respectable churches like you'll find in In Manhattan and great cathedrals where everyone seems to be behaving themselves up in this literal literal error But the but the dirty little churches where where people are jumping and shouting and carrying on and doing all this stuff Well, what's that doing for you? Well something does on something is going on underneath that I don't often let peek out of the top See its cure is something like an integrated system of belief and representation and Then people turn to things like ideologies which I regard as parasites on an underlying religious substructure now I think this is important because again we see this in people that okay So so there's there's there's life on the surface and then there's all of this emotional stuff going on down below And we look for quick fixes and sometimes you look for quick fixes and religion sometimes you look for quick fixes in a bottle A powerful way is to look for an ideology and as he's about to say an ideology is kind of a broken religion Well, why would we want a crippled religion? Well, we want a crippled religion because it's simple. There's there's one reason for My misery my life is a mess. I've not aspired to the places Well, someone's kept me down who it's the Jews or it's the whites or it's the blacks or it's the rich or it's the women Or it's the men. There's one reason why I'm looking for a crippled religion There's one answer to my problem and if I can blame everything on it and then then suddenly I find a whole group of other people who have the same answer to Their problem and we can all be together and we can all say, you know whose problem it is It was Donald Trump or it was Barack Obama or the Democrats or the Republicans or the shrinks or the educated or the the evil people or You know any pick any people you want the ideology is a crippled religion. It's been it's been it's become Simplified I should let him say I've heard this video so often I almost always know what he's gonna say even if you asked me I couldn't lay it out it's down there below the consciousness level to try to organize their thick things like an integrated system of belief and representation and the integrated system of belief and representation is a religion. Okay, it's something that Thousands of people have been working out over thousands of years and you know, there's a lot of conversation Why is Paul talking to John Vervecki because I'm learning a ton from John Vervecki and is somewhat of goodwill and and I really like Talking to John Vervecki. I'm a little skeptical about his about his project because in a sense he's competing with religions and religions have Significant things that they bring to bear because they've actually been Helping people with these things for thousands of years now to the degree that our times are uniquely different from other times That's arguable But this is this is part of what's going on Again to try and organize their thinking there's one person to blame or one group of people to blame or one thing to blame or one And so if we can just take care of that thing Oh, but it's gonna be hard to take care of that thing. Okay, so we're gonna have to break some eggs as Joseph Stalin did And that's a catastrophe and that's what Nietzsche for saw you see he knew that when we knocked the slats out of the base of Western civilization by destroying this representation this is God ideal Let's say that we would destabilize and move back and forth violently between nihilism. Let's say in the extremes of ideology. He was now There's a lot of simplification in Peterson's argument here too and and when I publish my conversation with Jeff That's I'm really interested in what the response to that Conversation is going to be because a lot of people aren't gonna like him and some people aren't gonna like some of the things I say in it, but that's that's the way this game goes We'll keep it interesting but You know reading CS Lewis's the discarded image the You know the transition well underway Looking at CS Lewis and looking at Owen Barfield and and doing all the learning and the growing that I have over the over this Last two years in those areas There's a lot that went on and of course in order to say anything you have to simplify it and I do it all the time You know if we're going to knock ideologies for being overly simplistic Simplifications we have to watch them ourselves particularly concerned about Radical left ideology, you know and believed and predicted this in the late 1800s which is really an absolute intellectual tour de force of a staggering magnitude predicted that in the 20th century that hundreds of millions of people would die because of the Replacement of these underlying dreamlike structures with this rational rational but deeply incorrect representation of the world and now again if you listen to the verveky lectures and again partly because of the software I'm using I can't quite as Easily just switch back and forth, but if you listen to it so verveky's lectures 1 to 25 are kind of the full lot philosophical and when he deals with Romanticism that was one of my favorite videos and then also the crash in many ways verveky's dealing with similar things as Peterson, but but They're coming about it in different ways and so they both recognize that That something something deep was lost and in the 20th century some very Some very bitter things came to fruition and it was a bad time and of course Peterson In some ways continues it blows my mind when he says he's never seen a therapist Because someone might argue well, perhaps all of this is in fact He's he's working out his trauma from the Cold War with his with his very visceral reactions to to the the fascists and the communists You know we've been oscillating back and forth between left and right in some sense ever since and you know with some good sprinkling Of nihilism in there and despair in some sense. That's the situation of the modern Western person and increasingly of people in general You know I think part of the reason that Islam has its backup with regards to the West to such a degree and there's many reasons and not all of them are valid That's for sure But one of the reasons is that you know they being still grounded in a in a in a dream Let's say they can see that the rootless questioning mind of the West poses a tremendous danger to the integrity of their culture and He's Peterson said a little bit of dabbling with that, but that's a very interesting observation He makes about Islam and again it reflects his Peterson is high in openness And he's he's very willing to engage in conversations with with people of goodwill over a number of topics Including Islam it seems now and it does I mean Westerners us we undermine ourselves all the time with our searching intellect, and I'm not complaining about that You know I mean it there isn't anything easy that can be done about it, but but it's still it's still a sort of fruitful catastrophe And you know it has real effects on people's lives. It's not some abstract thing You know I mean lots of times when I've been treating people for depression for example or anxiety they have existential issues You know it's not just some psychiatric condition It's not just that they're tapped off of normal because their brain chemistry is faulty although You know sometimes that happens to be the case It's that they are overwhelmed by the suffering and complexity of their life And they're not sure why it's reasonable to continue with it. You know that and and I think right there Peterson opens begins to open up Something which for me was powerful and important maybe I'll I don't know I'm still trying to get the handle of this software You know when I talked to Sevilla she made the comment that one of the things that she noted was that in She wasn't at that point in her life a particularly religious person she was doing her clinical work She was going into psychology. She wanted to help people she was doing her clinical work in a poor community And and she began to understand that religion for most of human history has been our Again, let's give Jesse Ventura his nods Has been for us the way that we deal with the pain and despair and the brokenness of this world and And religions have in many ways carried the load before psychology ever came into the came into the form and These stories and these practices all of this were were vitally important to help human beings survive Now Sam Harris might jump in and say see we don't need that anymore And I'd say no, we don't need that anymore And maybe Anthony wiener could have used a little more church And it's been interesting to me many of the people I Began to notice after a certain point particularly when I was getting ready for the Australia trip How many people had come to me and told me stories about their depression and how? And again, it seemed crazy watching these videos particularly the biblical stories I've been reading about the Bible and the Bible is a very important part of my life And again, it seemed crazy watching these videos particularly the biblical series watching Jordan Peterson Make them help them feel better and I thought well, that's interesting and Well, some people might say there are more significant side effects to watching Jordan Peterson videos than Necessarily taking some pharmaceutical that doctors will with trial and error Tried to combat the mental illness. In fact, I had a very interesting conversation With a with an academic who is doing work that you know, basically challenges The entire conception of mental illness that has been dominating and I'm fairly active With a with some mental illness advocacy groups in Sacramento And part of why it's difficult for me to kind of go a long way with them is that What happened in the 20th century is that we secularized alcoholism and mental illness Called a disease did all of those things for some pretty particular reasons But as Jordan is saying, well part of this is because insurance companies will pay for pills And they won't pay for talk and at some point you learn as a pastor that People's well-being or their lack of well-being often has a great deal to do with everything else That's going on in their life and that these are not isolated things and that Your depression very well might have something to do with your diet Very well might have something to do with your genetics very well might have Some medical underpinnings very well might have everything also to do with How you grew up that the talking cure still helped in many ways and why is that And so again, Peterson is having the courage here to say, hey, you know Let's look at this stuff fully and in many ways this is physician heal yourself Because Peterson has been very open about the fact and he took heat with this fact Which was terribly unpolitically correct, mind you, when he talked about his periods of depression And his battle with depression and he was very open about that and people say, oh see We shouldn't listen to him because he's crazy so much for stigma and mental illness and ableism In many ways, Peterson wanted to heal himself and of course if you read 12 rules for life He's very open about Michaela's suffering and what that does to parents who have a suffering child Who's working through all those things and so he and his wife have histories of Autoimmune disorders, histories of depression and of course that would lead to the Peterson diet In many ways in his whole body, in his whole life he's been embodying this entire movement That he got going and in some ways what he's doing at the Bader theater with people paying $35 a head is that he's healing himself by talking about the Bible which is in fact Oh, how often has this happened? You can look at the David Berkowitz story, the son of Sam killer Who was a schizophrenic by the time he's arrested and has life imprisonment without parole They force him onto antipsychotics and then he starts reading the Bible and You know now at least some of the videos I've seen and things I've read now he's a professing Christian and he feels badly about what he did. Well, he should feel badly about it what he did But you might say, ah, he's a Christian so therefore he finds forgiveness. Yeah, forgiveness is a Is a powerful thing. Well, you think well he's a monster like that is A monster like that is unworthy of forgiveness. Oh, okay. So we're gonna play that game and That's that's a difficult game to play because you're gonna reject this this judging god, but then You yourself are going to judge So there's a lot going on here. And again, Peterson hasn't even gotten to we're only 11 minutes into this This is the problem with these videos is that he's got two hours and I talk for five minutes for every minute of his and It's combinatorially Explosive what happens they can feel the terrible negative meanings of life But are skeptical beyond belief about any of the positive meanings I had one client who's a very brilliant artist and as long as he didn't think he was fine You know because he'd go and create and he was really good at being an artist He just you know, he had a personality that was continually creative and quite brilliant although he was self-denigrating and but as soon as he started to think about what he was doing then, you know the The It's like a Like a drill or a saw or something like that He saw the branch off that he was sitting on because he'd start to criticize what he was doing Even the utility of it Even though it was sort of self-evidently useful and then he would be and it would be very very hard for him to even motivate Himself to create And and that story itself is a fascinating story because here's an artist and as long as he's Someone just knocked at my door that's a very interesting story with this artist because In a sense it shows the two modes when he when he's in his art mode in a sense he is he is in touch with this other Substrata of the dream world and and this far more intuitive thing and he says well when he starts to think well What what do you mean by think? Well when he starts to? practice the sam harris rationalism when he when he starts to use the the The left area of the brain again, this is this this is schematic not necessarily literal where he's starting to think in you know logically then suddenly he's Well, he's having real trouble and he's he's probably anxious and depressed and nervous and he's trying to fix things and Well, that's a that's a very very interesting story and he always struck me as a good example of of The consequences of having your rational intellect divorced in some way from your being Divorced enough so that actually questions the utility of your being and it's not a good thing. It's not a good thing and It's really not a good thing because it manifests itself not only in individual Psychopathology, but also in social psychopathology and that's this proclivity of people to get tangled up in ideologies Which which I really do think of as as they're like they're like crippled religions That's the right way to think about them. They're like a religion that's missing an arm and a leg That's missing an arm and a leg but can still hobble along and it Now before he goes too far into that. I want to I want to get back to one thing He just said because it's important provides us The only thing and so that it actually questions the utility of your being and it's not a good thing It's not a good thing and it's It's really not a good thing because it manifests itself not only in individual Psychopathology, but also in social psychopathology now right there So this relevance realization That is sort of verveky's way into this I've Boy, that's a powerful powerful thing that verveky has highlighted and it's a powerful representation of so much of what's going on here and What what peterson just just hinted at? Is something that I just talked with jp about his panpsychism, which was a very interesting conversation I'll have to have to figure out sequence for some of these videos i've coming up because I try to have conversation and then And then monologues and I try to keep kind of a pattern of them and you know Some verveky material some peterson vivereal and other conversations, but i've got got a lot of interesting conversation partners coming down the road I might have to Well, we'll see how many videos I can get out. I try to keep it to one a day But there might be some days that I put out more Sorry hate to bury you in videos Peterson's an individualist and Individualism is an important thing we very much see ourselves as individuals and this barrier of skin that we have that keeps us distinct from one another is a Very important barrier and foundational barrier But it is not necessarily the barrier. We think that it is And again, if you go back to the barfield stuff human beings for a long time have human beings for a long time Did not conceive of themselves as individuals anywhere near as much as we do now One of the hebrew kings before the babalonians put him to death the babalonians Cut, you know killed his sons before him and then gouged out his eyes. So that would be the last thing you would see Now we think well, that's a horrible thing to do Yeah, but it's way more horrible because of how they conceived of themselves And if you read the old testament one of the one of the most Difficult things that you can do to a person is that they would be cut off and what that essentially means is you kill your you Kill their children so they have no They have no representation going on into the future by virtue of their children The bible in many ways is a book about how death is overcome And one of the key things that happens with jesus is the resurrection Because before that the euthyopian eunuch let's say who you can find in in the book of acts A eunuch is cut off and has no future. Well, how can how can the eunuch live on? One of the things that the bible does and it's rather subtle, but it's quite clear Is that it shows many other ways to live? Simply then besides the old testament way of having many children now at this point peterson makes the point that these Once your Once this once this Once this underneath Which is very complicated and often dreamlike and something we don't have a very good handle on but is actually quite critical Because it's this it's this estuary between the far open sea of chaos. You have my right and my left mixed up I don't know how to stay in the box It's this estuary between let's say the controlled rivers of california And this the the sea of chaos that comes in through the golden gate bridge here in the water system of central california If there's trouble down below there's going to be trouble up above and it's going to manifest itself and this isn't just true of individuals because We are not as individual as we imagine that we are it is also true of us as groups now one of the things early on in my reading of yung that I really wrestled with was the idea of the of the collective unconscious but the more I study both the the limits of our individualism and this this Represent representational network that we are always concocting and that we are using that are in our minds as individuals But that in a sense we are sharing via culture and we are sharing via art and we are sharing via actions And we are sharing via images I I Jung's collective unconscious is Our limits to this. Okay, because that chapter with freud is a very interesting one, but In many ways This is this is the same water in this estuary that we are all swimming in And and we can see this in memes we can see this in looks look at a so i've been married to my wife for now 31 years It doesn't take much, you know, we watch each other very carefully and A marriage is a high stakes relationship in many many ways and and you bring all of the stuff underneath into it All it takes in a relationship like that is a look or even my relationship with my children Our children know things about us that my wife and I don't know Okay and sometimes we'll see that because one of my sometimes my kids will say something and I'll hear it and i'll think well that was almost revelatory in terms of something I had not seen in myself and this is me myself But they saw and and they've they've spent a great deal of time watching us And they've learned about us And well what you're saying what you're not saying that was the end of that pinker interview That was I thought the best the most interesting part of it to me. I'm very curious about pinker's new work but There's a whole lot more going on. So we have my wife and myself and five kids There's a whole lot more going on in a family of seven Than what meets the eye and all of us are engaged in very very subtle Games and maps and chess playing and all of this and it's going on very deeply Amongst the seven of us in ways that none of us understand and none of us control and this isn't just true of a family now now there's a larger family because I I had two sisters and both of them married and had children and my wife has a brother and he married and had children and We had parents and and on and on and on as you start going out you begin to realize Oh my goodness. There's a lot in play here. Then you go out as a culture and you realize oh my goodness There's a lot in play here And and you really notice this if you go into another country And you begin to stay in that country and you learn that other country the longer you're there the more you realize You recognize No matter how much I get into this country I will always be an outsider to one degree because i'm not a native here And now you'll be welcomed and and and you'll find new parts of you opened up by that other culture But you recognize that and and children who are you know, even children who are adopted as infants Go into a new family and it's very very common for them at some point You know to to long for that first family and to have knowledge and to try to connect and there's that what do they call the You know the initial wound or something like that. That's a very real thing even even children who are adopted as infants So there's a lot going on here and and all of that if you begin to recognize it you begin to say Oh Well, what does this mean? And and so what peterson is saying here is If things aren't well underneath They're not well on top and so peterson is darwinian assessment in the sense of says well We all sort of know this in the world and this is part of the reason why many many people in africa and latin america want to move to north america and to and to europe and and why there are masses of people in hong kong who are asking for freedom and they're waving american flags and And and there's a lot going on here and and it's told by the actions and and we don't fully understand it And that that isn't to say that And i've known many immigrants who come to the united states and yeah, the money's better and the freedoms are good and all of that but but they they want to speak their mother tongue and they long for that food from home and in fact, of course My ancestry comes from the netherlands and and many of those dynamics were there and so Even though I you know, there's holy bull and and there's there's all of these um, there's all of this dutch stuff that lingers in the community and And so we're mysteries to ourselves and our mysteries are not just individual They're communal and all of this stuff has to be All of the stuff on one hand we do manage but we manage it badly And to pay attention to it could be helpful for us because we might just get a little bit wiser and a little bit smarter and we might in fact be able to operate up here on the surface in a little bit better way if if if what lies beneath was in better order and if there's anything i've learned in terms of watching the jordan peterson thing happen is that Whether or not how intentional people could be people started putting the things down below in better order and They weren't just depressed and they were happier and their relationships were better and and things began to get straightened out And and and that can even start with something small like cleaning your room which became a mean but it's also quite a serious thing And so suddenly There's a lot of important stuff going on And that's this proclivity of people to get tangled up in ideologies which which I really do think of as As they're like they're like crippled religions That's the right way to think about and they're like a religion that's missing an arm and a leg but can still hobble along And it it provides a certain amount of security and group identity But it's it's warped and twisted and demented and bent and it's a parasite on something underlying That's rich and true and that's how it looks to me anyways and so So I think it's very important that we sort out this problem um, I think that And and now pay attention we're doing this at as the prolegomena for a biblical series and and essentially what he's saying is that The bible had a lot to do with a lot of what's below And a lot of people say yeah. Well, that's the problem and he's saying well, yeah but Just looking at people who don't have the bible It isn't terribly self-evident that the bible is the problem because in a lot of these places in the world where The bible has been deeply formative. These are the places that everybody wants to live now. Someone could argue. Well, how about latin america? How about honduras and guatemala and el salvador where people want to get out of the bible is just as formative in some of those places fair point Peterson will then throw in english common law and so maybe not just the bible but how the bible is taken and um So so these these conversations get very complicated I think that there isn't anything more important that needs to be done than that. I've thought that for a long long time probably since the early 80s When I started looking at the psych the role that belief systems played in regulating psychological and social health Because you can tell that they do that because of how upset people get if you challenge their belief systems It's like why the hell do they care exactly? What difference does it make if if all of your ideological axioms are 100 percent correct like and and this is a this is this is a Really important point that well you attack someone's religion and they care, you know, why do your mom, you know your mama jokes Why do they land? Um what you attack people's belief systems and they care. Well, why why do they care and and the irony of the of the new atheist movement is that There's so much angst in it and and many other atheists who are not anti-theists sort of say Okay, so they believe in a sky god and you think that's superstition. Why do you care? Well, well if we could get rid of that then then what well then your political your political agenda could be moved forward Is is that really what this is about for I think a lot of people it is And essentially what they'll say is you listen to richard dawkins on unbelievable, you know, look that one up. Um On justin briarley's show that that was a terrifically interesting program richard dawkins basically says, you know Well, you know the bible and religious people they didn't bother me until they started attacking science. Oh so religious people can have all the sky god they want just leave the textbooks alone in texas or So then it's really just a political thing. Well, if if we didn't have so many christians, then democrats would get elected more Oh, well except The african-american population in north america is the most church-going segment the most church-going racial Demographic of any segment at all and they're reliable democrats. So what do you do with that? So, you know people aren't playing fair all over the place and so peterson is saying hey, wait a minute this religious stuff matters and and you can't just Move it away You should talk about it. You should engage with it and and it matters because as a psychologist you might know and and we're seeing potentially a change in psychology and and Sevilla has has made this point a number of times that you know the the psychiatric Schools are a little bit less Anti-religious than they used to be they still are because sometimes people that I work with will They'll be good they'll be seeing a psychologist and and they'll tell those like how well i'm going to talk to my pastor about that Psychologists usually kind of I don't know if you should talk to your pastor about it Okay, so, okay, you don't trust pastors fair enough People get unbelievably upset when you when you poke them in the axioms so to speak And it isn't it is not by any stretch of the imagination obvious why you know, but there's some it's like There's a fundamental truth that they're standing on It's it's it's like they're on a raft in the middle of the ocean and you're starting to pull out the logs, you know And they're afraid they're going to fall in and drown It's like drowning what and what are the logs protecting themselves protecting them from and why are they so afraid to to move beyond? the confines of the ideological system and And of course the the celebrity atheists will say well, well we we should We should do that, but you could just as well turn the tables on them and say well, why do you care so much? These are not obvious things so I've been trying to puzzle that out for a very long time and i've done some lectures about that that are on youtube Most of you know that and some of what i'm going to talk about in this series You'll have heard if you've listened to the youtube videos But you know, i'm trying to hit it from different angles and so Okay, so niche's idea was that human beings were going to have to create their own values essentially Now he understood that we had bodies and that we had motivations and emotions like he was a romantic thinker in some sense But way ahead of his time because he knew that our capacity to think wasn't some free-floating soul But was embedded in our physiology Constrained by our emotions shaped by our motivation shaped by our body He understood that but he still believed that the only possible way out of the problem would be for human beings themselves to become something Akin to god and to create their own values that was steps and he thought that the person he and even that insight that Okay, so what I really want to get into at some point, I probably won't even have time today is Well, what is god? What do we mean when we say this word god? and and right there well If god is dead if there is no god if there's no no one in the sky if if god number one is has been dispelled by darwin and And and so well, let's just let's just push away god number two and all that silly superstition well Someone has to fill that function Well, what what exactly is the function of god and in many ways the celebrity atheist say god has no function and it's like, ah I'm very skeptical of that idea. Well, what do you mean god and and so Notice what the title of this this is the idea of god in fact God is something the idea of god and it's not even just an idea That there's stuff going on that actually helps human beings live and when you take it away, they don't live so well And and this of course sets up peterson saying to sam harris, you know You act as if god is real as does peterson and so on and so forth Talked about the person who could create their own values as the over man or the superman And that was one of the parts of nician philosophy that the nazis I would say took out of context and used to fuel their You know superior man ideology So and you know what happened with that that didn't seem to turn out very well. That's for sure and See, I also spent a lot of time reading carl jung and it was through jung and also jean piaget He's a developmental psychologist that I started to understand that Our articulated systems of thought Are embedded in something like a dream and that that dream is informed in a complex way by the way we act so, you know We act out things we don't understand all the time And if that wasn't the case then we wouldn't need a psychology or a sociology and anthropology or any of that because we would be Completely transparent to ourselves and we're clearly not so we're much more complicated than we understand Which means that the way that we behave contains way more information than we know And part of the dream that surrounds our articulated knowledge has been extracted as a consequence of us watching each other behave and telling stories about it for thousands and thousands and thousands of years Extracting out patterns of behavior that characterize humanity and trying to represent them partly through imitation but also through drama and mythology and literature and art and all of that to represent what we're like so that we can understand what We're like and that Process of understanding is what I see unfolding at least in part in the biblical stories And it's it's halting and partial and awkward and contradictory and and all of that Which is one of the things that makes the book so complex now Boy, he just threw a ton of stuff through there So let's go back a little bit and and again Nietzsche and Jung get a lot of attention By Peterson listeners, but Piaget deserves more because actually some of the best stuff that Jordan brings out here is is is from Piaget And trying to represent them Partly through imitation but also through drama and mythology and literature and art and all of that to rep And so here's the thing so you've got well, we might what we'll we call this we might call this culture And and when Peterson had a conversation about You know, oh you can you can keep the art and you can keep the sam harris you can keep the art you can keep the cathedrals You can keep the music but we're just going to take out the god part again Well, there's god number one and god number two right there because no there's There's there's something of god in All of this stuff. Well, what do you mean? There's something of god in and now this this is tremendously difficult to figure out how to talk about And and I think in a sense some of the biblical language is some of the best because What I think the bible says about this is the good the good stuff that's in the music and the drama and the actions and and and all of this stuff Let's let's call that glory Okay in isaiah 60 You have richard mao wrote a very interesting book on this You have you have the kings of the earth bringing the exiles and the wealth of the nations back to jerusalem and and this is this is the glory and this is And so god abraham kiper, you know god basically says, okay. Well, this is mine. I'm claiming this Well, what do you what do you mean? You're claiming this? I thought people did this. Yeah people did do this, but I made people Well, what exactly is this project and and in my dutch calvinist upbringing we were taught in class um the the cultural This is a lot of herman bobink and abraham kiper back here. There's the there's the cultural mandate be fruitful and multiply and fulfill the earth Well, what does that mean? That means do do culture and represent and and so in a sense god number one is built into all of that stuff Okay And and so when when harris says no you can keep the music and the cathedrals and the art We're just going to get rid of god See again, that's that's splitting god number one and god number two and peterson saying there's some Some of some of what you have to attach the word god to in all of this stuff down below And now a lot of people listening to this will say That'll make them nervous and again, but this is partly because god number two with the recession of god number one post darwin God number two was sort of expanded to fill the void but the before god was split in a sense in the in the splitting and yet another splitting of the world that when When darwin says well we can account for this world without intention We can account for this world without without mind without a without someone having a goal or a goal or a plan or Form for this okay, then god number one goes out the window But all of this stuff that peterson is talking about god number one is all in there Okay, and and so when we're talking about god no This is so hard to talk about it's in there represent what we're like so that we can understand what we're like and that Process of understanding is what I see unfolding at least in part in the biblical stories and it's That process of understanding is what we see in the biblical stories. And so this of course the bible god number one and god number two are fully integrated and so This is this is what causes a lot of people to Have issues with god number two because of the fallout that happens in god number one is It's halting and partial and awkward and contradictory and and all of that Which is one of the things that makes the book so complex But I see in it the struggle of humanity to arise To rise above its animal forbearers say and to become conscious of what it means to be human and that's a very difficult thing because we don't know who we are what we are where we came from or any of those things and You know the white life is an unbroken chain going back three and a half billion years It's an absolutely unbelievable thing. Every single one of your ancestors reproduced successfully for three and a half billion years. It's absolutely unbelievable. We rose out of the dirt and the muck and here we are conscious but... And some of this, of course, this is talk that I would have imagined would have kept them out of Liberty University. But this is also what gives them credibility with the side of the culture that says, okay, well, I can imagine that everything was just sort of came about unplanned and unintended and boom, here we are, three and a half billion years. It's amazing that a planet would be stable that long, stable enough to allow the fragile thing that we call life to develop on its own. And of course, there are some people now who are getting increasingly skeptical as to whether or not this, we could ever be so fortunate to have had all of this happen for three and a half billion years of unbroken procreation. Not knowing and we're trying to figure out who we are and a story that we've been telling or a set of stories that we've been telling for 3000 years seems to me to have something to offer. And so when I... And that's an extremely important point because even... Again, as I said before, even if you think that the Bible is... there's nothing to it, it's sort of... it's a record that people have been bouncing off of the same text quite reliably transmitted for the last 3000 years in one way or another. That alone makes it of incredible value. It's in some ways more reliable than the dendrochronology that we use to try to age things. Okay, we're going to match up all these tree rings to find out what we're wet and what we're dry years because the Bible is more pervasive and out there. And so then to just imagine, well, we're just going to figure this out. Oh yeah, that's not real smart. If I look at the stories in the Bible, I would say in some sense with the beginner's mind, it's a mystery, this book, how the hell it was made, why it was made, why we preserved it, how it happened to motivate an entire culture for 2000 years and to transform the world. What's going on? How did that happen? And to continue to motivate cultures and continue to transform the world, it won't be represented in the news, but the Christianization of China, I would dare bet has something to do with what you see going on as the largest ethnic mass of people becomes increasingly individualistic. I mean, here in California, there are many Asian peoples here and one of the things you learn very quickly about Asian culture is that they stick together and we Americans who are individuals and are things falling apart, we're like, wow, we really respect that. Well, yeah, and sometimes the Asians look at us and say, wow, I sort of long for some of that individualistic freedom and so you try and figure out, well, which one is better. So this stuff continues. So often people imagine, well, the Bible is just in our past. Well, that might be in your past, that might be in your rear view mirror as an individual, but you're probably doing so at your peril because a billion Chinese are reading it more and more. It's by no means obvious and one of the things that bothers me about casual critics of religion is that they don't take the phenomena seriously and it's a serious phenomena. I mean, not least because people have the capacity for religious experience and no one knows why that is. I mean, you can induce it reliably in all sorts of different ways. You can do it with brain stimulation. You can certainly do it with drugs. There's especially the psychedelic variety. They produce intimations of the divine extraordinarily regularly. People have been using drugs like that for God only knows how. Now, intimations of the divine. Divine is another one of these words that are going to fudge. Now, it'll be intimations of the divine. It'll be, of course, what people see the divine and so let's give Matt Dillahunty his due. But we're going to have to come to terms with that word because, well, functionally the divine is that which is at the top of the hierarchy, that which is of ultimate importance. In my Sunday school class, what is the difference between politics and religion? Religion is of the always. Well, is there now in the always? Yes. Is there always in the now? Yes. And so you begin to see, okay, well, so something happens when you, and I read Michael Paulin's book on psychedelics I thought was a really helpful book for me. When you disrupt the way the brain works, and you know, Verveki has talked about a lot of this. Well, the Bible has been doing this to us for a long time and other religious practice and you don't just need chemicals to do this. You do this in a sense while you're praying and you do this in a sense while you're fasting and you do this while you're in community. I was just, you know, I'm going to be talking with Guy Sengstock and we'll be talking about his circling thing and so there are actually a couple of videos out there on circling and I'm watching this and it's reminding me of church retreats and, you know, other experiences that I've had in the past. It's like, oh, this is going to be interesting. We are mysteries to ourselves and we really don't know how we work. I'm going to have to figure out how far I'm going to go with this because he's going to, he's getting into some stuff that I really want to talk about and I'm running out of time and I'm still just learning my new method of doing these videos and I don't want to spend too much time doing one that I in fact throw away and you never actually hear anything I've just said. For a long 50,000 years, maybe more than that, to produce some sort of intimate union with the divine. It's like, we don't understand any of that when we discovered the psychedelics in the late sixties. It shocked everybody so badly that they were instantly made illegal and abandoned in terms of research for like 50 years. And it's no wonder because who the hell expected that? Nobody. Now, now Jung was a student of Nietzsche's, you see him. Okay, well maybe we'll stop there and we're at about 1915 and he's going to start talking about Jung so I'm going to stop it here and I'll see how my new process is working.
