 Hi, this is Paul. This is the second hour of the Jordan Peterson, Bishop Barron conversation that I'll be doing commentary on and I'm going to start right where I left off or just a little before. Do you, I wonder if you read your countryman Charles Taylor much the Canadian philosopher because Catholic too. Taylor said that we in the West, let's say Western Europe, America, Canada, Australia, we might be the first civilization ever ever to think you can find real happiness apart from a transcendent reference point and everyone we're used to hearing religious people make this point and because we're used to hearing religious make this point part of our suspicions laden suspicion laden reflexes says they're only making this point in order to lure me into their church so they can get their money and improve their status by pumping up their numbers yada yada yada yada yada. A point I continue to make is that people don't know if you really push people to describe what happiness is. I just someone on Twitter just tried to get me into a little conversation because they talked about okay so there's woke at there's woke soteriology which is the woke manner of salvation and then there's woke ha martial armatology which is a woke doctrine of sin but what about woke eschatology Marxism sort of has eschatology and wokeism doesn't have much and I referred them to John McWhorter's talk in it feels good to be a victim with him and him and Glenn Lowry because John McWhorter's McWhorter basically says you know when you hear people say it's time for us to come to terms with could be race in America okay and McWhorter pushes on that and says what do you mean by come to terms really I can think of a soundtrack you might be thinking of but when might people say well that let's say the the number of police killings of black Americans is proportionate to what the racial makeup of American and this was sort of on the heels of an Anthony Bradley tweet that said what if we looked at this not as a function of race but as a function of poverty is is police shootings a function more of a part more of poverty than race or you know that's where you get into relevance realization but but the point that that McWhorter makes is that it's actually really hard to have people describe what the good life looks like now they're in GK Chesterton makes this point we usually navigate towards the good life in opposition to something pinching us at the moment so let's say you're having relational difficulties the good life is and then you imagine sort of the opposite of what's pinching you in your relationship maybe you're having financial difficulties so the good life is whatever's the opposite of what's pinching you financially and so Chesterton makes the point that that's almost always in opposition to some pain or or let's say you know police shootings the good life is that there'll be no more police shootings okay right now in the United States we don't currently have hardly any shootings of the US military against civilians you might say well that's a weird thing why would we worry about that well if you lived in another country where military actually patrolled the streets or border checkpoints I lived in the Dominican Republic not far from the Haitian border and military checkpoints were a regular pattern of life and military officers military soldiers would sometimes shake down Haitians who are living in the Dominican Republic and steal their property and I think I've told a story about that once on my podcast but the point is that almost always our vision of the good life is in contrast to whatever it is we're feeling some pain or discomfort or we're pushing against and protesting against to actually have to be able to mentally construct what the good is is remarkably difficult and so Bishop Aaron is sort of pointing that here that we as a society in some ways I'm gonna riff on Peugeot a little bit in some ways are a parasitic society and we're always parasitic as sort of the opposite of the bad opposite of the evil that's the good the good is the opposite of the bad but that is insufficient for us because then we sort of play whack-a-mole with our pains oh I'm hurting here let's fix that so our medical establishment generally works we don't have health care we have sickness care a number of people have pointed that out and and in for our society you know I look at the discussion in Sacramento about dealing with homelessness because I've got a lot of experience with homeless people and well let's get them into drug treatment program okay and and absolutely I you know many of the homeless people I know have some pretty serious drug and alcohol issues why do they have the drug and alcohol issues let's say you get them sober well any time you work in a sobriety program you begin to realize that well there are underlying resentments that are fueling that okay what are the source of those resentments well then suddenly you're into how are they treated by their mother how are they treated by their father what happened in their marriage what's happening in their job what's happening with their health there's a whole range of other issues and and so the presenting issue might be the drug and alcohol problem problem and it might be exposed because they're homeless but once you start digging into those issues you realize well how many billions of dollars you're gonna throw out the fact that this person's mother didn't treat this person very well when you've got lots of other people out in society who are sort of bearing with the resentment that they have towards their family members or their ex-spouses or their children or someone or their boss and we're not throwing millions of dollars at them but what if they just decided to be homeless and then they could get free you know it just you play whack-a-mole instead of actually seeing shalom and part of Bishop Barron's point here is that as a society it's it's very difficult it's very difficult for us to to look up at the stars because we no longer believe the stars and this is where we're gonna get into this conversation about worship. What in human history has felt something like the alluring darkness beyond what I can control and know is necessary a relationship to that realm is necessary for happiness. We're the first culture ever that said no I don't care I'm indifferent to it but that does produce versions of hell for sure because something will take the place of the transcendent point of reference. I made the point in my conversation with Jonathan Pigeot and Andrea with the bangs that we play whack-a-mole with these gods so right now I'm into Minecraft or I'm into sports or I'm into this I'm into that so we keep chasing these little gods and when we make these little gods our main god problems develop because there are other gods in competition with them and so the way to do it is to make the main god the main god. Now when you get into when you get into worship here one of the things that I thought of at this point in the conversation was actually the conversation with Pigeot and Peterson where they got into worship where Pigeot is making nearly the same identical point as Bishop Barron here. Then it scales up it scales up after that it jumps up a level and it also scales up in terms of because one of the things that one of the things that you talk about like looking up to the star and looking up to the highest thing you can look at and then aiming towards that you know once again one of the things that that does is that the first thing you do is actually where it's a form it's attention. You wanted to say worship. People like the word worship it's a form of reverence a form of veneration you submit yourself to that aim it's not just that you see the aim and that you aim for it you actually have to submit yourself to that which is to what you're aiming. And that submitting yourself has to do with not just oh I plan on doing this it has to be its liturgy there's you know there's often a building involved there's a community of people involved there's there's a lot going on to that you know there's this there's this old Dutch I think it's a Dutch song amid the thronging worshipers in the Lord my God I bless this is what you do you gather a group of people and you say okay this is who we are this is what we are all pointing to and if you're all pointing to that then suddenly things start to fall into order now there's still plenty of disagreements and bickering up and down the way but it's that one thing that you're all pointing to that sort of keeps you together. Same things happens with nationalism of course you know it's the it's the country it's the flag it's it's the thing but but nationalisms are always you can't quite they can't go get all the way to the top and when they do get all the way to the top there's problems because then you open up you open up with with genocide against rival nations or something like that so back to this worship point now okay I think this is the correct one close some of the other well it seems useful even even from the perspective of humility I mean I don't know if this is a reasonable thing to say but a tyrant who believes in God is likely preferable to one who doesn't because at least in principle sure tyrant is held accountable by something that isn't him where that's right he even and and he would get caught at least in principle again in the operation of his own conscience don't you I I love the fact in the scriptures they're very unique this way they do not apotheosize their leaders and it's very different from so many other ancient cultures where the Kings become like gods and there's the Bible I think the Bible is only honest about its leaders and his Kings even the greatest even David murderer adulterer Solomon Saul the whole realm of them that's a brilliant insight of the Bible that all these people are under God and they're under judgment and that's a that's a liberating idea and when we lose that the leaders do become apotheosized well you saw that in Rome constantly in ancient Rome that literally happened you know and there's always a proclivity for that to happen that's the imperial presidency you know right and I think it's very important I always tell when I when I'm preaching on this subject to Christians the fact that Jesus is called the Son of God it was so important because it was dethroning the Roman claim that the Emperor was the way austute that ooh you know so one of the titles after Julius Caesar is is devious he's he's divinized then his son Augustus becomes the son of the God you know so when the the first evangelists were saying I've got good news about Jesus the Son of God they were saying right it's not Caesar he is not the Son of God this one whom Caesar killed by the way he's the Son of God but the Bible's always making that move of knocking our own pretensions off their their pedestals I think that's an amazing observation actually and it is one of the things that that that is extraordinarily striking about the Old Testament is that it's so sophisticated psychologically because what's happening there is that the idea of absolute sovereignty is disconnected from the person bearing the sovereignty and so at the very least again speaking psychologically what you have is the representation of God as that which is sovereign and now each individual can be a representative of that and can have that operate within them but they aren't that and that that that well as I said at the least that's a brilliant psychological innovation and the fact that the biblical characters are so they're realistic to the point of Dostoevsky and painful yes you know Abraham doesn't leave home till he's what 80 he's a late starter right and and then his life is just one god-awful catastrophe after another for the first while it's like you know you have some contempt for him let's say because he's hanging around his father's tent and then he does finally pay attention to the call of adventure to God's voice and he goes out and encounters tyranny and starvation and corruption and yeah and he makes all sorts of mistakes and you know and it's easy to be contemptuous I think of the biblical characters because of that but it actually speaks to their intense psychological realism and it's so useful for for people to see that because Abraham for example is blessed by God despite the fact despite despite his evident character flaws and that's the case for for for the Patriarch is evident I made this point in the first video is evident inability to actually trust God to believe for arcs in general and then for his remarkable right a descend of yours I'll put in the throne that will last forever to David who was a deeply flawed character what I find cool is that even before you get to the human characters go to the very beginning of the Bible and you have a dethroning of the cosmic pretenders to the absolute so in the creation account you know Sun moon stars planet animals the earth itself all the things mentioned were worshiped in different contexts so the author is saying no no no no they're not divine they're creatures but then he turns it around beautifully but they have a purpose which is to give praise to God so they're not God they should be dethroned from that but now they're given the privilege of praising God with their manner of being led by the conscious creature human beings who in Catholics know this whoever comes at the end of a liturgical procession is the one that leads the prayer so Genesis the opening verses sound like a liturgical procession you know their first is then that evening came morning followed in the fourth day and it's like a steady procession of liturgical actors the last figure the human being is the one now that will lead the chorus of praise to God so in my mind it's the master theme of the whole Bible if you want is we're rightly constituted when we give praise to God and can lead all of our creaturely brothers and sisters in the right praise of God so it's the it's the worship it's the praise that draws the community together that focuses us us up beyond ourselves gets us into it's as Peterson says to Peugeot it's it's sort of a if you if you think about better than all the way to its logical conclusion Peterson doesn't quite connect the dots here but Peugeot more does it leads to this sin is bad praise from it's without fail in the Bible it's they went after false gods they went after the gods of those people they they abandoned the teaching of the Lord bad praise leads to the disintegration of the self so that's now in the psychological order that's really a praise very praises what what you praise is what you pursue and so if you're pursuing the wrong thing then you're going to fall apart right one of the great biblical ideas I think is you become what you pray so what gets your worth shipped that's the origin of our word there what's the highest worth for you you become that you know so you become what you worship you're meant to become children of God but what happens we end up worshiping something so every one of us worship something and we become conformed to that and then if it's not God we disintegrate and then like Satan we start beating our wings and making the world around us worse and and it's not just disintegrating it becomes a limiting and I had this I had this point actually then our mommy our Armani tweeted it out today this little conversation with Jonathan and Andrea where I was talking about the little gods and let's say the thing you're pointing to is the basketball God that it's been your greatest idea to be a basketball player well that's also becomes your limit and maybe to be a wealthy person or maybe to be a moral person or maybe to be this all of these things these individual things become your limit if in fact you want to become all that you can be not just a great basketball player not just a wealthy person not just a fine moral husband if you want to be all of those things you actually actually have to shoot at that which is at the top of all of the hierarchies of all of the platforms of all of the conceivable things and then all those little gods actually remain in their places so that the world around us disintegrates that's the Bible the Bible tells that story over and over and over again you know which is why you know from a Catholic perspective a Christian perspective that Jesus on the cross is offering the Father right praise on our behalf and see now you're getting to the mass which is very powerful you know that the mass is the great act of praise where we join ourselves to the sacrifice of the Son we we we can form ourselves to Christ I have to ask you about that because it's just burning a hole in me well I'm in chronic pain a lot of it and it's constant and I'm not I don't know what to do with it generally speaking I know things that make it worse you said something a lot of ideas were flashing through my mind and I want to I want to hit at it because it's a crucial concern you said something so surprising that Christ on the cross was offering up the proper praise to God it's like well I'm not gonna just let you say that without noticing it because that's a hell of a thing to say so I'm gonna put together some things that you touched on and and I think part of Peterson's I think Peterson is exactly right to stop him there because well it seems like the cross is an awfully strange place to be praising that God what does Jesus do on the cross he quotes Psalm 22 my God my God why have you forsaken me so so we're supposed to praise him though he slay us we're supposed to praise him though he abandoned us and that becomes one of these archetypal moments where usually often we praise in response to some gracious thing in response to some good thing and now at that moment Jesus is is suffering and and so I think you know I really love that Peterson stopped him there given the the rather cruciform existence that Peterson is experiencing now it's it's an audacious thing and and Christians ought to be a little careful about being you know Christians ought not to be glib with this and Christians I know that have suffered are often not glib with this because there's sort of a holy reverent moment reverent moment when you sort of you have to breathe deep to to to to enter into this because you know its weight and its cost and then we can address this so you said in the Bible one of the things that's remarkable about it is the conception of the divine so the conception of what is of highest worth is stripped from some of its obvious objects of projection the Sun the moon the cosmos the stars but then also earthly leaders of other cultures idols and also earthly leaders of your own culture says no whatever the ultimate divine is it's not to be found in its fullest expression in any of those examples it's something else okay so then the question is well what is that else well the Christian answer is well whatever it is for in its human form let's say it's something human it's something that humans can aspire to it's both of those is it something human it is something humans aspire to and and so I mean if I were talking piece around I'd probably stop and there's it expand on that a little bit more the and and it's made manifest in the figure of Christ something specifically human but then you have this terrible paradox with Christ which is partly the paradox that you just laid out which is a very difficult thing to get a grip on and and those of you who are following my rough drafts or my sermons and followed this channel for a while will know that there's something with Christ you have to when you when you look at the stories of Jesus you have to understand Jesus in the context because Jesus in the context are are sort of set off against each other because in a way the question is what is the perfect man well there's Jesus what happens to the perfect man when he is in this world this is what happens well you mean he's he's hounded he's hated he's loved by some and hated by others he's he's he's both enormously attractive and enormously enraging and he is so honest and blunt that at some point they're just if they get a chance they're just going to kill him yes that says something about him and it says something about the times and when you read the Gospels you'll you'll often hear Jesus say something to the effect of this generation and when Jesus gets the news about John the Baptist this generation they're not happy they they play a tune and they ask me to dance and when I dance they say he's a drunkard and when I weep you know that in other words they're saying this generation will not be happy with me and the prologue of the gospel John gets into that because the light comes into the darkness and the darkness hates it because the darkness loves its sin and and this is something that you see played out so so sometimes when Peterson talks about this he talks about and I can understand this just basically with well the world is just the world and the Bible no the world isn't just the world there's a valence to it and and so the world is considered to be in rebellion right now and for that reason the light has come into the darkness and the darkness does not understand it the darkness will not overcome it depending on which translation of the of the prologue of John that you look at so what is it exactly why is what Christ is doing proper sacrifices it because it is what is it his willingness to bear the pain what is it yeah that's close to it so we say the word became flesh so the the word who is always in the presence of the Father so the word doesn't worship the Father because the word is God so that we shouldn't talk about worship within the Trinity itself this gets complicated but now the word becomes flesh because the Father God so loved the world he sent his only son that all who believe in him might have eternal life in his name he sends the son into flesh but into flesh that's been so compromised by sin so not into a pristine creation now what do you have that's interesting these these these you see Baron was just making a similar point that I was just making but he used different words question theologically would he have sent the Sun if creation had not fallen that's an interesting question right in fact the valuable fall that laid the yeah the face cool right yes it's a remarkable idea it is indeed but like Duns Scotus argued you know the Franciscan medieval theologian that God would have sent his son even if we hadn't sent but that's another question so let's take that apart for just a sec so that people are clear about it so the theory here is that Peterson likes to play with theology good for him there is something wrong with the structure of creation that that's its steepness and sin and everyone has to ask if they believe that and and it seems to me that people do is there's and and this is so so Peterson loves to say okay you need to you need to tell the truth in a sense you need to lean into being he uses this Heideggerian term you need to lean into being with the assumption that it's good Christianity you've got well in him we live in him we live and move and have our being the Apostle Paul X 19 referencing a pagan poet very much not though the meta divine realm of paganism but God number one that that we are within but yet there's also this context where we have our sister who is nature and we have rebelled against God and our so our sister rebels against us and we're stuck in this very dysfunctional this very dysfunctional world and when we have our next conversation with with JP Marceau and John Vervecky we're gonna get into some of this because the Bible has a way of laying that out might even have there's a lot that goes on there so so this question that Peterson is wrestling is in some ways the great puzzle and and different worldviews have tried to answer it in many different ways I mean Gnostics have basically said well that this world is the this world is the creation of a demiurge it's a lesser God the Manicheans had a variety of ways but this is this is in some ways the great puzzle how can we account for this world which on one hand seems to be consistent beautiful glorious and on the other hand full of decay and pain and loss and how can you have how actually can you construct a narrative model that adequately addresses all of the data the sense that things aren't how they should be that we're not how we could be that something right it has gone astray and is continuing to go astray which is a mystery in and of itself if it's a God created world it's like well why is that precisely there's the great puzzle well I mean the quick answer is is corrupted freedom you know or a misguided freedom you might say but the word comes into flesh into fallen flesh and the cross is what the cross is cruelty and hatred and violence and institutional injustice and stupidity and if you read the passion narratives it's a beautiful sort of poetic presentation of all that's wrong with us that comes out to meet him and bearing all of that he continues in his relationship of of obedience and unity with the Father so bearing the sins of the world bearing all the dysfunction and twisted quality of the world he brings us back online so in he's almost reiterating CS Lewis in his chapter the grand miracle and his book miracles and you can find it other places CS Lewis doodles but it's Christ coming down taking us up with him in the attitude of the word made flesh on the cross we see a sinful corrupt hate-filled world now brought painfully back online that's the sacrifice of the cross that's pleasing to the father so we should never play the father is like a is a dysfunctional alcoholic father that you know is now demanding this blood sacrifice it's it's rather the father is pleased it's interesting here because that that's never something you hear Peterson say so in many ways again as been noted by many of the comments from part one of the treatment of the commentary on this both are in some ways addressing the audience of the other and so Bishop Baron here tries to anticipate in some ways the the dismissal of the crucifixion redemptive historical narrative made by the new atheist and it's interesting because this is this is never something that Peterson says or goes into by the Sun's entry into our fallen situation and his bearing of all that dysfunction even as he brings us back online to the father so why does okay so let's say Christ maintains his I know this isn't exactly the right way of thinking about it but it'll work for rhetorical purposes I think it's so Christ is tortured by betrayal by by physically and spiritually as well because the best way to torment someone is when is to punish them despite their innocence right and that's a great goes in front of right right or maybe worse than that to punish them because of their virtues that's even better and so that's it's better because it's worse and shoot I lost my thought that it was having before because Peterson Peterson goes here maybe the thought will could return that's intrinsic in this story as well Christ bears up under that he doesn't repudiate God doesn't repudiate his own essence it's something like that he but then what is the is the example of that is the example of bearing up under that exceptional duress and maintaining a moral stance is that now is he's asking atonement theory questions and he's using sort of the example theory and Bishop Barron to say well no not so because part of what's happening is as many of these questions have been dealt with in the past and and so Bishop Barron of course as the menu of a theologian or someone with the same training as me you're used to all of these examples because they're in fact stock these are these are stock conversations that are in the back theologically and Peterson just basically initiates one of the options and so then Bishop Barron initiates the response I think there are actually better approaches to these conversations right now because shoot I had that thought it was all in my head and and then it was gone that'll it'll bubble up again it always does the example that redeems the world is it that if you do that in your own life the world is de facto redeemed it is that but more because if it's just that then a plagian system would be true that we just need a plagian see you've got a trained theologian a trained a well-trained pastor will have all of these stock answers questions and answers built in because these things have come up throughout time theologically and so you notice he mentions Pelagius Peterson didn't mention Pelagius and if you want to take a look at who Pelagius was I remember when job my friend was first introduced to Pelagius he's like I like this guy I thought oh you're gonna have a fun time in the Dutch Calvinist Church if you say I kind of like Pelagius because of course in the period of the Reformation that part of the big complaint from many of the reformers against the Roman Catholic Church was that they were semi-Pelagian they weren't they're just leaving the door open for Pelagius enough but of course it was Pelagius and Augustine had their had their tussle you know 1500 years ago or so a good you know moral exemplar it's something more than just merely good I mean it's super human what's being asked for no true but it is so and and what what Peterson is getting at here is something that I've been picking out in my sermons which is that okay so Jesus does these things what is our participation in the story and and we've been paying a lot of attention to the way stories work within us psychologically and so sort of beneath this is Peterson's question well how does this work psychologically and in the background for Bishop Barron will be deep deeper questions about okay how does this work ontologically and and metaphysically you know questions and questions about the fall as Christianity has called it often and questions about redemption how how does this work and and this is one of the big areas in which a sort of materialist framework undercuts the plausibility of these and I hear that when people come to me and say okay so let's imagine Jesus managed to do this somehow relationally and of course God is reduced just to God number two and Jesus is reduced just to a man and then what we have here is really in a sense an implicit an implicit recreation of paganism within a meta divine realm and again a lot of this stuff a lot of the answers to this are built into Christianity from centuries and centuries and centuries ago and you sort of initiate those and Bishop Barron's answer now because these are stock questions and answers but this is part of why theologians real living theologians you actually need because now with the advent of psychology with the with the the background of assumed materialism or or physicalism even non-reductive physicalism suddenly there needs to be some addressing of these questions because the old answers to them didn't take into account these new realities and and this is where in a sense the the the lack of connection between the two of them now don't you shouldn't expect Jordan Peterson to have a a a substantial education in church and theological history he's a psychologist he's been spending his years studying other things Bishop Barron this is where again status binds and blinds neither of them have much time to watch each other's videos you know a low status person like me can spend a lot more time studying Jordan Peterson very closely I don't have enough time to study Bishop Barron very closely I tweeted out this morning that I think for the two of them would be helped by someone I'm not proposing myself someone who who knows both of their work better so that they could sort of bring them together because I would actually respond to Peterson in some different ways with these kinds of questions because I think if you know enough of of Peterson's implicit theology there are ways of addressing them that some of the traditional answers don't really get at very well tell me more metaphysical about it it's a reworking of the way things are if if Jesus takes upon himself all the dysfunction of the world see now if you say a line like that reworking of the way things are most people whether they're Christian or not are going when you say the way things are this mental image of a physicalist or materialist universe is and where Peterson and Peugeot were going in terms of the story verse and the matter verse and Peterson how can the story verse impact the matter verse and so when you get into Jesus miracles you get into exactly that water to wine multiplication of loaves and fishes stilling a storm corpses into revivified human beings but the resurrection is in fact a far grander miracle as is the incarnation because what's happening then is you're actually beginning to tinker with the code of the universe but now and this is where you know we sort of get the simulation arguments that argument has sort of become a virus that has gotten into the system and bit by bit by bit once I'm using that language of it's getting into the code now suddenly in our imagination new ideas are opening up about how Jesus changes the code and maybe you saw the matrix and the substandard sequels or but but you know right there this is how I'm using magic words right there I'm beginning to retool this but that's what happens in cultures and this is part of the reason I just finished listening to Jonathan Peugeot's conversation with I forget the name of the I haven't read any of his books but just just published today there's some interesting things in that conversation too there's so many conversations not enough time I should do a commentary on this but it's like when am I gonna do that I got time for doing this commentary today and I had two wonderful conversations this morning two randos conversations that were just wonderful we'll see if either of them come to light on the channel but where was I going with this yeah the the times are changing and materialism and physicalism are are beginning to to relinquish their hold which means we're going to have fresher theological conversations and probably some heresies coming into the picture and swallows it up in the ever greater divine mercy so it's it's Christ bearing swallows it up in the ever greater divine mercy it's a beautiful way of talking I don't know that that way of talking is going to connect with a lot of people unless they already inhabit that way of talking very deeply in all of our dysfunction but transfiguring it in his great act of forgiveness and obedience to the Father that I think all of that coming together simultaneously is the sacrifice that's pleasing to the Father in some ways the word from the cross Father forgive them they know not what they do is that is the most important or playing with this to Jordan that after the resurrection so Jesus comes back precisely to those who had denied him and betrayed him and run from him in his moment of greatest but not as political enemies I've been making this point repeatedly in my sermons because I think it's a vital point the Bishop Aaron's about to make it right now need and it almost any telling of a similar story if that it all happened and then the person who had died is back from the dead and he appears to those who had you'd expect him to you know wreak havoc on them right so Jesus shows his wounds to be sure because the wounds of Jesus are a sign of the world's dysfunction if I'm ever tempted so here's here's something I'd have a you know because people are like oh you should talk to Bishop Aaron I think what would me and Bishop Aaron gonna talk about there's a question I like talking about say okay Bishop Aaron because this this is a really smart dude and he's better educated than I am I mean he writes books why do the scars remain say I'm not sure I think that much more has a pastoral answer so anyway you know when we were younger the book I'm okay you're okay came out right so we're always tempted to say well you know basically we're okay just need a little I remember my father preaching on that book and you know he took it apart like a good Calvinist would well fixing up around the edges whenever we're tempted to say that it's the wounds of Jesus that say otherwise I was insisting earlier that I don't you know that that it isn't merely misguided good that turns people towards the darkness very interesting comments on this part of the conversation so I I do love reading the comments and it's I so thank you for your comments your comments I I almost always I can't the way the YouTube surfaces them I can never get them all but usually the first comment I'll go through and and even if I don't heart it doesn't mean that I didn't read it or I disagree with it I don't know why sometimes I heart some and not others and comment but I really do appreciate your comments but that's an interesting part of this conversation where they sort of kind of dug down in there and now Peterson comes around hey yeah my point earlier it's it's it's voluntary desire to produce the darkness as well anyways I do do that very anyways I want to make sure I get my point in here you know as Sam Harris would say we need to stick a flag in that seriously and it's an interesting idea is that the ideal is wounded in proportion to the degree that everything has deteriorated away from the ideal and that's a cool way of saying it I'll probably steal that it's almost by definition true right yeah yeah no that's true but it's just the is the very act of the will itself it's the problem that you know Bishop Barron's I hey I'm a preacher I'm on a roll here you keep interrupting me and and Peterson's got the same problem because they're they're both preachers and they're both they both getting on rolls and of course you've seen me get on plenty of roles it's part of the reason I do monologue videos because they're all a role and sometimes I'm not a very good conversation partner because I get on a roll and I talk too much but let's continue self is structured in such a way it has to be seeking some kind of at least apparent good but that's our earlier issue points into so the wounds show that the dysfunction of the world which the Son of God took upon himself but then then the word of shalom which is in all the resurrection accounts that Jesus says peace so when when Paul for example says I'm certain that neither death nor life nor angels or principalities nor height nor depth Romans 8 one of my favorite passages or any other creature could ever separate us from the love of God well how does he know that because we killed God and he returned with a word of forgiveness so that means it's like it's like for the divine goodness and forgiveness can trump any evil even the evil of killing God so we killed him but yet he returned in forgiving love I think that's the moment when Christianity is born in the dual sense of yes we kill them look at the wounds but he says shalom to us nevertheless so that I can't run away from him I can try you know that's what the sinners do I can try but ultimately the divine love is such that it's it's greater that's why Paul can also we're sin abounds grace abounds the more as Christianity so the greatest sin we killed the Son of God there's no greater sin than that we're sin abounds grace abounds the more and see all of these again keep preaching Jordan until you interrupt him that was made possible in the way by the great sacrifice of the cross which is why it's a saving act now that's I'm now Peterson wants to do a little preaching striving to understand person okay so I want to ask you a bunch of questions about that so we talked a little I do love this but before about the church bleeding its people they're leaving the young people are leaving and okay and and it's interesting why Peterson goes back there at this point whether he's just kind of okay preachers been preaching long enough let's get back to something you're more interested in or also well yeah well you know that's that that should be the that should be the easiest thing in the world to sell right but did we just forget the way this world is because we talked about that because this world is the kind of world that would take the perfect man take the Son of God and put him up on a cross and strip him naked to shame him and have him wear our spittle and our mocking crown and and drink wine vinegar because that's you know and I make this point often in my sermons that okay Jesus the perfect man he comes into the world and he talks to us and we want him to shut up you have to take that into account too with the church now in the resurrection and then this is part of thank you Robert who sent me the book and the one thing that I asked is that he at least sign it so I have it this book dominion of available in all the best book shops as Tom Holland says it gets into the culture it gets into us and so we still might want to kill him but now 2,000 years later even among the critics of Christianity as René Girard had noted they are judging Christians with a Christian yardstick at least partly Christian yardstick fair enough good point and what that does is forces Christians to actually continue to get better and so you know as Bishop Aaron kept saying earlier it's coming and going I mean God it is it is it is not a fair fight he will win he will win my sense of that before about the church bleeding its people they're leaving the young people are leaving in my sense of that is it's because the church does not demand enough of its of the young of young people yeah now follow this here this is a point that Peterson made in their first conversation in July of 2019 but just demanding young people so one of the conversations I had today I think there's a good chance he'll let me share it one of the conversations I had today was with the young man who like many of you you know found Peterson really helped him he got his life in order started applying things had success and then that hits you know stumbled but what do you do that Peterson is going to have a number of points where he says this is what the church should do and they're sort of contradictory and that doesn't mean any one of them are wrong but Bishop Baron just gives the sermon where it's good news and it's God's grace and we killed God and God still comes at us with peace and wow wow wow now Peterson's like you're not and I tweak Peterson a little bit here you're not expecting enough of your people you should need to be more demanding on them and he's gonna go into that in terms of his experience with the crowds but in all fairness to the church that's not all that Peterson does because if you go back to the end of the Russell Brand video when does Peterson always break down when he talks about the encouragement when he when he looks out there and says they're sheep without a shepherd to quote the Gospels to quote Jesus the sheep without a shepherd I need to go out to the men and encourage them and when I encourage them they rise to the task and so for Peterson it's not demanding so much but it's a sort of encouraging demanding and again with Russell Brand he talks about that with respect to his father and that's part of the reason I did that commentary video on Peterson and Russell Brand well there's a commercial product placement right in the middle of my my commentary but but and so this gets into the consciousness challenge that we have because we see things one thing at a time and then we can see two things but we set them against each other and three things is about the limit so so Peterson is gonna go off on this you don't demand enough but I've been in plenty of churches where people are like well it's all about the moral demands and again to gosh I should find that video so it's Jonathan Peugeot and Paul Kingsnorth and Paul Kingsnorth makes the point in this video that he says all my experience of the church was just moral demand it was just moral demand maybe I can find it and play the clip I couldn't pull up the transcript to search it but he said you know he grew up in church and all the church was is do this don't do that do this don't do that and and that made him reject Christianity so I don't think Peterson's point here is wrong but it doesn't take enough into account and that's clear of Peterson's experience too because on one hand he's placing the bar high and on the other hand he's helping them move up it and and this reminds me of John Calvin's commentary of the book of Genesis where you have Jacob wrestling with God and John Calvin says it's just a brilliant thing and I think actually listening to Peugeot John Calvin who was an expert in church fathers and theology with with God's God fights us with his left hand but he upholds us with his right hand and so that's and that's why when Peterson sort of focuses on the church needs to require more oh do you think that's really gonna happen because Jordan that's not what you do you both challenge them and you encourage them and you have to do both of those all right so let's play it I think doesn't demand enough and by not demanding enough it doesn't indicate its faith in their possibility and yeah and I again oh gosh what article was I reading no that was the Russell Moore article that I did a video on where and I think more his point is real that not only does the church not demand enough in the certain way I was just talking about but neither does it actually believe in its own message enough that's something preachers have been saying forever so now in Orthodox Christianity as I understand it there seems to me to be more and I did it's setting off this feud here between Orthodox and Catholics and Protestants careful now Jordan emphasis on the idea that it's each human's obligation to become like Christ that's a goal oh we just triggered the great Theos is no Roman Theos is a Roman Catholic doctrine no that's what Protestant say we just use different language well that's that's that by definition we could say and we could speak psychologically about this as well that means to become the ideal the ideal that's beyond rationality even that's what you're aiming at that's what's hypothetically within your grasp for and it seems to me as well that that's what the mass hypothetically within your grasp see the again the nuance here is that oh this is something I can try to do and and so that's part of the reason Bishop Baron brings in Pelagius here because the argument will be that I don't want to get into the Augustinian Pelagian reformational spat with this because I don't think that spat is going to do us any good right now even though I'm sort of invoking it by saying that it's by grace you have been saved through faith it's not our works list any of us should post symbolizes is that and I'd be happy to have it any objections to this I would be happy to hear the the incorporation of the host is the is the embodiment it's the end oh now he's bringing in some Catholicism I don't know the Orthodox Jonathan Bejeaux just sent me an email said would you be interested in having a conversation with a with a with an Orthodox priest who used to be Christian reformed I said sure I would I said let's bring him back into the fold I thought for Jonathan and him it might be let's try and bring Vanderklee back into the fold somebody just left a comment Paul are you have you ever considered becoming Roman Catholic everyone's trying to recruit me I feel like I feel like a 18 year old LeBron James incarnation of Christ within that's what it's acting out that's the idea I mean in some sense it's it's the consumption of the saving element but the saving element is actually a mode of being and this isn't hit home it's like saving element is actually a mode of being yes I see this is this is where people with theological training get really picky about language which which isn't often helpful miss you know miss missionally look what the church the church demands everything of you yeah absolutely everything the gospel demands everything of us the church the relationship of the church with that is complex because churches can get tyrannical churches can get yeah again you got to be careful with some of this stuff and then the reason that that people are leaving is because that adventure isn't being put before them it's like look you can have yes that's not the reason that's one of the reasons but again in talking to lots of people who have deconstructed in the process of deconstructing it's much I think generally speaking it's not that churches don't do challenge oh gosh I mean I listen to how many churches do how much how much challenging but but I don't think there is a sense within the people of the potential reward so I I read I read a wonderful chapter last night on the the counter that Roman Catholic reform counter-reformation which really starts before the Reformation and I was unaware of how many of these significant reform efforts and I'm actually thinking about doing a video just reading that chapter and then adding commentary because I learned so much in that chapter and and what you had you know both before and after you mean for did the scope the span of the book is 1450 to 1650 both before and after is you have all of these people renouncing their wealth renouncing their sexual liberty renouncing the their freedom to I mean that the church the church has done that but it did so in the wake of corruption and so Peterson's point here is good but it it has to stand with a whole bunch of it has to stand with a few other points not only do you challenge them but they need a they need an engrossing vision up there that start a guy them to pull them towards it to say and and Peterson is piecing that together because remember first you talked about Orthodox theosis and now he's talking about the challenge and and I think that's how Peterson is right because what Peterson does when he does this is say you could be this man you know the person who who who stands strong and helps at your father's funeral Jaco willing and this is part of the reason that Peterson points to examples of masculinity that are that are good and noble and right and again Peterson made those points in the in the Russell Brand video and so it's both and but Peterson is only sort of talking that the challenge aspect you need the vision that is an obtainable vision of the good that will move you towards sacrificial effort cars and your money and all of that but that's nothing compared to the adventure that you could be going on yes I wish you'd preach to our people because I think you're absolutely right about the language we'd use is be a saint that's what that's the ordinary goal of every baptize see now in the middle of a conversation it's it's really unfair to me of course to sort of pay but but you're gonna have to flesh out you're gonna have to cast a vision of that saintliness that is beautiful and attractive even if it's costly and and difficult and and with that heroic vision then you draw people into it but that's that's just the beginning because once you would you begin on that hero's journey well you know you've got Sam and Frodo almost giving up and you've got all of these issues that's part of the hero's journey to ties person is to be a saint a saint means someone who's holy or utterly conformed to Christ now press that to be conformed to Christ means you're willing to go into the dysfunction of the world to bear its pain and to bear to it the ever greater divine mercy and love now fill in the blank Francis of Assisi mother Teresa maybe in our time like when we were younger if someone said well who's a living saint we all would have said Mother Teresa but what did she do she went into the worst slum in the world I've been there and she bore the suffering of the world literally picking up the dying and bearing their disease and bearing their psychological suffering and and she she took on herself the wounds of Jesus but then think about you know the smile of Mother Teresa she brought to that place the ever greater more super abundant mercy of Christ that's being a saint and you're dead right I think we're not sufficiently calling our people to that kind of heroic. I can tell you one thing I've experienced and this is this is really something to see I spoke in about 150 cities sequentially with a day or two in between and it took two large audiences three to ten thousand all the time something like that and I always paid attention to the audience singly because I was always talking to one person at a time but also en masse you know to see to hear because if if the words are in landing in the right place and hypothetically emanating from the proper source then there's silence and sometimes that silence can be dramatic and that's why people say well you could have heard a pin drop it's no one's moving because their attention is 100% gripped by whatever just happened and one thing and you can do that in a theater but you've got to give them a track to walk on and that's what the church can do and this is part of the reason I make videos because again I look at Billy Graham it's like Billy Graham was able to fill a fill a statement put people in there but you had to connect them with the community that is going to walk alongside and again I wind up buying three of these things and I'll probably accumulate a half dozen more by the time I mean if he does another book tour and he comes out to California and we do our meetup you know but the point that he made in the Russell Brand video that this is much more about community which I was really happy to and I happy to see and I've only you know I haven't gotten too far into this book yet I just in fact pull this one out of the box because I bought a Kindle version I bought the audible version I buy this version Amazon used to give a nice little discount when you get the Kindle and the physical but anyway I'm running out of shelf space right here the inspiration but you've got to give the track and as I talked to someone today you also have to as they're learning to scale the mountain you give them some support you give them some ropes you give them you give them some because that they're not going to be a great climber Dallas Willard talked about the difference between training versus trying and you have to go into training you don't become Jacko willing just because you wake up and say I want to be like a Navy SEAL no it costs him all along the way thing that reliably elicited that was the proposition that the meaning that sustains you and protects you from corruption during suffering is to be found in responsibility and people that and I thought I thought part of the reason that that produced silence was because no one says that now they say happiness or they say rights or they say privileges or or or they say reward or something like that they don't say pick up the heaviest load you can care and care and in all fairness to the church you'll hear a lot of responsibility talk in churches very and care for that matter and stumble forward and I've seen people cut those ideas and put them on t-shirts and and play with them and and so it's not that the church is and I don't say any of that against Peterson I mean part of what's going on here is Peterson himself doesn't know why this happened none of us do which is why I've spent three years studying it because it's worth studying it's worth paying attention to and that's why Baron is paying attention to it that's why other that's why you all are paying attention to it asking too little of its people you know I that that that moment right now okay Bishop you know Bishop let's hear it now it is asking too little of them I quite agree it's precisely and so there's no heroism in it did they there's no call it to well because and because finally and again I think churches are churches try to put heroism in him but the mix isn't right so you know Jordan has a point but Jordan was doing this long before and you got the videos of it Jordan was doing this long before he became Jordan Peterson author of where's my copy of 12 rules for life anyway I've got about half a dozen copies of them but yeah the I call it the culture of self-invention is a very boring culture Stanley how our was is a Methodist theologian who said he defined liberalism or you know the modern attitude as I have no story except the story I invent for myself and that's finally a very boring place to live it seems to me that in fact you're part of this incredibly rich and complex narrative which I would refer to as God's creation and God's providential movement but I go back to Luke's gospel you know when Jesus says to them Duke and Altam is it the Latin way go out into the depths you people have been horsing around in the shallows way too long that's where the fish are by the way but also it's where adventure is it's where that was where the glory of life is get out into the depth and we have I think allowed our people to be kind of horsing around by the seashore all the time it's also where what and again gosh am I gonna have to pull that up I should so monasticism begins with people wanting to become athletes athletes for God spiritual athletes renouncing everything and as Peterson the point Peterson makes again and again and again institutions get corrupted and so by the pot by the by late modern or not late modernity by by the late medieval period there's a ton of corruption even among the monasteries one of the most remarkable features of the Catholic Reformation is how the church as a whole was transformed by monasticism broadly defined that is by the clerical class that was subdivided and guided by rules of a monastic character and this development seems all the more remarkable in the light of the fact that in the early 16th century monasticism as a whole was woefully corrupt and under severe attack Erasmus's contempt for monks and monasticism in general reflected an attitude that was common among reformed minded humanists no vow is more sacred than that of baptism notice because monasticism became eventually all about you have a rule and you're supposed to stick to that rule no vow is more sacred than an out of baptism you might hear a you might hear Luther or a or a Swiss reformer say something like that he argued taking aim at the monastic assumption that true holiness required valves of poverty chastity and obedience his critique was not only theological but also based on an observation most monks fell short of their ideals Erasmus constantly argued because of many of them had no genuine vocation as a cow doesn't make a monk he quipped neither do clothes make a Frenchman beginning with Martin Luther who had come to loathe the monkery now remember Luther was an Augustinian monk in that in that conversation that Peugeot had with what was the dude's name I forget already with the author Luther says you know like Puritans you know scourging themselves Puritans didn't scourge themselves physically they sometimes did so mentally or psychologically but they didn't do it physically Luther was an Augustinian monk Luther knew the regime the platform of of spiritual athleticism and its corruption by the 16th century as well as anyone which is why he mocked it as monkery Martin Luther who had come to loathe monkery and everything associated with as the ultimate corruption of gospel principles and genuine Christianity Protestants attacked the institution and its members with great virulence sometimes even with physical violence Luther filled his writings and sermons with anti-monastic invective and even dedicated long treatise to debunking the air of monastic vows Eurich Zwingli called monks fattened pigs in disguise whose vows were grounded solely in hypocrisy and idolatry adding that there were no people on earth richer than monks and none more avaricious and you say well how could that be they took vows of poverty ah they didn't own it individually but they owned it collectively and any follower of Jordan Peterson that is skepticism skepticism of Marxism can well understand how even in a certain way sort of a Marxist monkism well we have no private property how of course you have your your your little place outside of Moscow there are many ways to to to pursue avarice even if at least you formally renounce private property in Protestant pamphlet literature monks figured prominently as exemplars of every vice such as social parasites living comfortably while others toil for them at the beginning of the 16th century laity and clergy alike were all too familiar with the worst failings of monasticism while Catholic reformers focused on weeding out and rehabilitating corrupt monastics Protestants launched an all-out assault on monasticism dismissing it as inherently cupped and corrupted unnecessary in 1525 a woodcut by Erhard Schoen relies on late medieval stereotypes but conveys the new Protestant message monasticism must be abolished because monks are the tools of the devil Protestant attacks on monasticism derived from the observation of social realities as much as from theology in many ways they reflect public sentiment even at the summit of Catholic Church hierarchy the problem of monastic corruption had been admitted in the papal commission that wrote the brutally honest conciliam that I can't speak Latin like Bishop Baron called for the abolition of all conventional lax orders and assessed all monastic institutions as so deformed that they are a great scandal to the laity and do grave harm by their example this was the state of monasticism in the 15th and 16th century nonetheless these men and women who followed a lifestyle that Protestants rejected as un-Christian and who were always reviled by them as the epitome of corruption managed to infuse new life into the Catholic Church in unexpected ways even as such grave assessments were made they also proved true two of the most significant unquestioned assumptions of Catholic reform first monastic or semi-monastic institutions did have a useful role to play in society at large and second the moral and spiritual health of the regular clergy was key to the renewal of the church as a whole long before the Council of Trent first assembled in 1545 a reforming spirit could be found among the regular clergy here and there reform was a constant and inescapable necessity among the monks nuns friars and priests who ostensibly left the world behind as inescapable as the corruption that could so easily infect their communities since the various rules in Latin regular regulate or lie wish should learn Latin they ostensibly follow followed caught they ostensibly followed calls for constant self scrutiny and the rise of austerity it stands to reason that the regular clergy would often reform themselves but they also sought to improve the church as a whole and even the world itself especially after the establishment of non cloistered orders such as the Franciscans and Dominicans whose sole purpose was to minister to that very world whose values they shunned and established orders the key to reform was always close at hand and the rules that the members were supposed to observe one would think then that simply enforcing the rules would be simple enough but nothing could be further from the truth rules had always been open to interpretation and over the centuries many modifications had led to no end of trouble in terms of both the behaviors allowed and the discord caused within those communities differences in interpretation of the rule of st. Francis for instance had torn apart the friars minor and even the church as a whole in the 13th century any would-be reformer who wished to reinterpret an order's rule more strictly faced two major challenges aside from the immense difficulty of compelling anyone to reform his or her behavior again just being a challenging moral scourge in church won't do it it was also legally impossible within the Catholic Church to force anyone to submit to an interpretation of a rule different from that to which the vow had been made and so they were they understood vows in other words conventional Franciscans could never be forced to become an observant or to observe any rule that that he had not vowed to obey a difference is acknowledged between the rules that were corrupted or ignored or rules that had been legally mitigated obvious cases of corruption such as the flagrant breaking of vows of chastity could always be legally corrected and on those grounds Cardinal Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros I do speak Spanish and other properly authorized reformers could expel hundreds of monks and friars from their communities but mitigated rules that led to subtler forms of corruption allowing monks and nuns to have personal servants for example or to visit freely with friends and family could not be summarily undone in such cases only the Pope or some legislative body within the order itself could enforce changes insistence of this kind of reform were rare and even then those who had taken their vows before such a reversal were not bound to observe the stricter rule that's just the beginning of the paragraph but so you know rightly so Jordan but this is a very long story in the church of inspiring people to to to holy self-sacrifice for the will of God for the vision of the kingdom for the welfare of the world the church has been working on this for a very long time protestants and Catholics alike text you from hell is yes you you need to be engaged in something that's deeply meaningful enough to justify the suffering and all of those people who both the corruption and then later on in the chapter goes into there's this enormous explosion of monastic orders that happens at the time of the reformation as basically new not it's it's more difficult it's more difficult to reform as the established church or turn around and establish her said to start a new so lots of new orders develop that were extremely energetic sacrificial and this has been going on in the church Protestant Catholic Orthodox for a very very long time and nobody speaks more eloquently about institutions rising corrupting falling rising again I mean Peterson Peterson knows that very well and and and so you know part of what happens in the story of Christ is the only thing deep enough to justify that level of suffering is absolute immersion in a cosmic drama and then you ask yourself well are we and Peterson's in the sense beginning to answer his question about atonement right here each of our we each emerged immersed in a cosmic drama and it's it's not so easy to say no to that it's a life or death situation and everything's in it well and I would say the the instinct of a Christian is to go where the suffering is so I spent a lot of my life forming priests so working in the seminary eventually I was the rector of the seminary so my job was to help these young guys discern the priesthood and I would say that's that's the the test I mean do you do you have an instinct to go where the pain is to go where the suffering is if you want to live a comfortable life then don't become a priest you might be a bad priest you know if you embrace a comfortable life but it's the Mother Teresa model it's the Duke and Altam go out into the depths and the depths mean the depth of human suffering what you guys are doing why isn't it working well what's what's our problem it's true that we're not doing enough of that and I do think we've I do want to make the point that in all fairness Jordan Peterson has three and a half million subscribers and his books sold millions the church is huge every year many many young people Protestants Catholics Orthodox go out into the world at great sacrifice all over the world Jordan is looking at the weakening ossified corrupt Western Church but in many places in the world you'll find enormous sacrifice but it's so interesting that when Peterson went to say liberty he was impressed by some of what he saw and and yet his conversation I think with David Nassar was one of the best that that he has had it come to bit to the modern thing which is a preoccupation with rights and freedom and my individuality and so on well you see this more church activism so much now is that so much so like the church seems to be replacing itself in some sense with social activism it's like we've got enough social activists yes well but I'd say this I really do have to read that whole chapter because it gets in any of these issues that the church has been wrestling with and part of what happens with the Protestants is that the Roman Catholics continue to work the monastic orders and what happens with the Protestants is they turn to in a sense to colonize the magistrates Christian Lee and to then have the government do the work now of course that's that's a huge conversation and it's very interesting when I listen to conservative conservative Protestants complain about well you know the government is taking care of the poor instead of us and it's kind of like that's a Protestant idea really Pope Benedict the 16th who's a great intellectual hero of mine said the church always does three essential things the church worships God it evangelizes and it cares for the poor poor broadly construed as I say anyone who's suffering right but that first move as we said earlier is indispensable the church worships God it teaches the world right praise because without right praise the whole thing falls apart and the reason he mentions that first which is I 100 100 percent agree with him he's absolutely right and the activism that Peterson is talking about is a church that sees worship of God as incidental because the activism is what actually happens in the world which begins to sort of initiate Stephen Smith's definition of paganism that it's the that it's this imminent ism now my bookshelves and that's secondly it evangelizes what's that well that's a cool thing too because who won Gellion in Greek good news they were playing with that because the the Romans would have used that in the eastern part of the Empire to announce an imperial victory they would send an evangelist ahead with the good news who won Gellion hey Caesar won a victory so these very edgy first Christians who had zero social status no power no military behind them said oh no no I got the true who won Gellion it's about Jesus risen from the dead who was put to death by Caesar but whom God raised so that's the proclamation of the good news that now we have hope now the sacrifice has been made and God's love is greater than anything that's in the world okay now I got those two things in place now serve the poor now go where the pain is go where the suffering is now these aren't necessarily sequential there's a logical order to them but I think Bishop Aaron would agree they're not necessarily sequential but if you divorce them from each other and that that has happened so who cares about worship and that's fussing around with altars and sacristies and who cares about evangelization let's just get down and serve the poor then it does devolve simply into social work right but if the three are together worship God evangelize the dying and rising of Jesus and serve the poor now the church is is cooking you know all right so let's look at the second one of those so yeah you know it seems to me I can understand evangelism Jordan you don't say understand this not that whether I can understand it or not is a hallmark of its validity but I have to try to understand what I can understand I can understand the idea that bearing forward in a moral direction acting as if notice he turned it to moral that's not really moral is an aspect of sanctification of what happens but that little turn right there I mean in many ways somebody had a great meme on bridges of meaning about Protestantism I mean it's really hard to not be Protestant just sort of like it's really hard hard to not be postmodern and that little move right there I mean that's exactly what gosh I can't remember that author's name he complained about being is intrinsically good and that hum that humanity as part of that is also intrinsically good but now remember just a little while we're talking about this fallen world and this is why you know just sort of remember keep hold these two things in common because they're both they both have to be dealt with but they also co-live in the same world together bearing up under bearing all that up as a set of propositions even in the most extreme cases of suffering I can see that as a valid moral good that's that's Christ's refusal to be what would you say corrupted by the injustice of his and and terror of his fate and so that might be something like you don't have the right to become a tyrant no matter how badly you were tyrannized let's say that's that's a it's very Jordan Peterson reading of Christ and I think that's an unshakable moral proposition but then there's the resurrection element of it because I could say well the first thing I would say is well I kind of understand that psychologically okay so he's basically following death and resurrection he's he's trying to interpret those things okay I'm tracking better now parts of us die and and they have to die because they're in error they have to be cast off and we're reborn constantly as a consequence of our movement our ascent forward there's no movement forward without some death of the past and so I can see the resurrection idea as a metaphor for the part of us that continues onward despite our failures and constantly reconstitutes our spirit it's not something trivial but then there's the insistence on in the church of the bodily resurrection which is well let's call that a stumbling block to modern belief no no doubt about that that's something more than mere metaphor and so you might ask well why is it insisted upon why isn't the proposition that he asked almost this exact same question to Peugeot you have a transcendent moral obligation to bear to to to operate for the good of all things regardless of your suffering a hard line no justification with the defeat of death necessitated I'm not trying to make a fundamental critique of the idea of the resurrection because I know there are things that I don't know I know that for sure and God only knows how the world is fundamentally structured but but it seems and this is a Nietzschean criticism in some sense to an Freudian criticism it's that seems in in some real sense too good to be true yeah so and and so what do you make of the what do you make of the resurrection how do you conceptualize it even as it's related in the gospels okay bishop barren you you talked about evangelization you set up the crucifixion the resurrection you and Jordan had talked a lot about the crucifixion let's see how you hit this one yeah good you're raising a lot of interesting things first of all everything you said about it first give me a minute to think in terms of psychological archetypes and metaphors good fine I think those are legitimate I think those are our correct perceptions of things and it has indeed functioned that way in a lot of the literature of the world resurrection type stories but I think what's really interesting about the new testament as as lewis said you know cs lewis when someone said well the new testament is just another iteration of the ancient myth and he said anyone that says that has not read many myths because there's something so distinctive about the new testament and what I I would say Jordan first this I think from the first page of Matthew through revelation what you get throughout is this what I call this grab you by the shoulders quality they knew about literature that is conveying deep psychological and and philosophical truth you know paul certainly knew that literature very well doesn't sound like that though it has overtones with it it bears some of that is he making an argument for the physicality of the resurrection his family resemblance is with it but what what you find on every page is this one galeon this good news so everything you said is true I think it is true but it's not exactly news it's part of the philosophy of perennus has been around for a long time and a lot of the great thinkers of the world and again I agree with it I like the philosophy of perennus but I don't know what that means you're talking latin again preacher come on preacher new testament is people who grabbed everyone they met by the shoulders to say something happened something's happened here that we were not expecting that was not part of our of our thought system and you know nt wright makes this point very very well in his very fat book the resurrection of the son of god but again I see this devolving into what lewis says we're arguing about the first five minutes we're arguing about the physicality and again I'm anybody who's listened to me knows I am not a skeptic of the physicality the work that I've done over the last three years has made me far more committed not only to the reality of the physical resurrection but the necessity of the reality of the physical resurrection for Christianity to work at all not a question there but how to communicate that the resurrection is not just another miracle and this is what lewis goes into in miracles it is a it is a it is a fundamental transformation of history how to communicate that and I think in some ways as as I think is one of the most one of the biggest liabilities of the bible is that it is a book and and bishop baron earlier said what is a saint but rather the gospel incarnated in a person's life that's what a saint is and of course the reformation said we are all saints and okay but there are there are hierarchies still and see this is why peterson just sort of laid it out in front of you and I don't and this is why I don't think I don't know I I I don't disagree with what he's saying would I've answered the question the same way again it's this is a conversation you take your best shot and you just take your best shot when you're in the middle of it and you can go back over my videos and all of you do in the comment section anyway you should have answered that way okay and it's so shaken us up that we feel obligated to go careering around the world and indeed to our deaths announcing it and defending it and what it was was the fact but again announcing it and defending it and sort of you know here we are on youtube arguing with matt dilla hunty that's not really what we're talking about and and again I don't think that he's reducing it to that but that is what is heard here in the in the 10th chapter of acts of the apostles uh this sort of almost tossed offline we who ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead um I don't think people trading in mythic talk use that kind of language mythic language and again I say it with high praise I love the myths see and and I think here he's responding to a rather low resolution view of peterson but I don't think this is peterson's question uh but you know once upon a time and in a galaxy far far away and then a mythic story unfolds but you read the acts of the apostles do you hear about what happened it was first is up in Galilee and then in Judea you know those people that John the bat member John the Baptist well and then there's Jesus and then in Jerusalem and then we you ate and drank with him after his resurrection from the dead it's that's what and then look at Paul Paul who saw him on the road to Damascus now the Pauline letters man they do not read like myths they just don't and I love the myths I love the philosophy of Prentice but it doesn't read like that it reads like someone who is has been so bowled over by something interrupt him Jordan he's not answering your question redirect get him there he can do it and he wants you to know about it and it's changed everything and I think what it was was what we said earlier it's okay now now we know God's mercy and love is greater than anything we could possibly do why because we killed God and that's why you Paul will say I'm going to hold up one thing to you Christ and him crucified and crucified a man was the most horrific thing they could imagine in the ancient world it was deeply embarrassing even to talk about a crucifixion Paul says no no let me put it right in your face see the author of life came and we killed him but I got the good news who won Gileon is God's mercy and love is is greater because he brought this Jesus back from the dead that's what you do have you do have the following argument which is that it isn't clear which is harder to believe whether that happened or whether people made it up and Jordan said the same thing to Jonathan and I think I think it's a great all right when he said it when he said it I thought you know that's exactly right because if they made it up that was really something and that that does strike me quite frequently reading the New Testament there are there are lines in there that hit so hard you think hmm it isn't obvious to me how someone could have just thought that up so and there is that well and Jung Carl Jung who I greatly admire you know he believed I think in the same way that CS Lewis someone made a comment on Twitter that apparently um Bishop Aaron used to teach Jung so not not talk Carl Jung because there's a lot younger of course but used to teach him at seminary which is interesting did that and he doesn't talk about this that much but there is this archetypal mythological pattern of the dying and resurrecting hero that has this psychological reality which is extraordinarily deep yeah but that that archetype was realized once in history and that's the fully realized so it it came from the the mythic and but in a way you're saying it was realized once in history never to be realized again and that's really the point that's made by the gospel that no it's the beginning of the realization realm let's say the realm of eternal truth the realm of pattern instinctive pattern for that matter and was fully realized at one point in history and you might think well if it's going to be fully realized it has to start somewhere you know it can't start everywhere at the same time or right right what's an archetype look like when it takes flesh might be a way to get at well well and the thing is we we do see this and it does grip us because movies like we see representations of this all the time in in my new book i talk a fair bit about harry potter and no harry potter is definitely an archetype taking christ figure taking flesh well clearly he's in battle with satan himself obviously i mean and and she has an unbelievably profound mythological imagination and the thing that's so fascinating about all of that is that because her mythological imagination is spot on she captivated the entire globe and and produced you know this immense storehouse of wealth and dominated the entertainment landscape for a decade and you know people don't take that seriously but it's a it's a great mystery to watch that absolutely they should it's it's a it's a for not you know anything that grips people's attention like that is obviously worth paying attention to by yeah so you know emery right lewis called them good dreams right so all the sort of archetypal anticipations of the gospel they're the good dreams of the race um or use the union i love of young too i love you too so what what tack should barren have taken here i think you should have taken the lesson from peterson's earlier admonition that the church doesn't challenge and inspire and i think rather than making a point about the physicality you can make the point about the physicality stronger by using it to challenge and inspire and and i think the little retort about the archetype becoming flesh i think that is more along the road than just sort of the renegotiating the the the supernatural natural debate that we see played out all the time on on how many christian atheist debates but what happens if that sort of archetypal anticipations of the gospel the good dreams of the race um or use the union i love young too but what happens if that archetype i could i could just play that keep enjoying that i love you too of the person or use the union i love young too but what happens if that archetype of the person perfectly pleasing to god you know cons language what would happen if that archetype became flesh and indeed and that is the saint that is the power and and again and we're sitting here looking at screams talking words and words can be magical words can be powerful but nowhere near as powerful as a relationship with someone who is embodying it that's the most powerful and and so if you want to inspire someone inspire someone to embody it embody it you say yeah but that's going to be really costly yeah well again back to peugeot's conversation with the author indeed that's how they put it the word became flesh and dwelt among us i think that's also the question we should each be asking ourselves in our own lives yeah it's like well who could we be and you say well you don't have now peterson's doing it to himself he's preaching to himself right here have to ask yourself that question it's like well good luck with your conscience then you should be another christ that's the objection to the self-created person it's like yeah the the idea that you can create your own values is well good luck right try good luck with that project yeah good luck right it's not it's not going to work you know newman referred to the conscience i always love this as the aboriginal vicar of christ in the soul so he took the language descriptive of the pope you know the vicar of christ but he said the aboriginal vicar of christ which is the conscience john henry newman okay because oh i was thinking of eric neumann so no john henry newman and i it's it's a beautiful way of describing it because we'd say the christ dwelling within you is the voice of the conscience that's that that little eric neumann versus john henry newman in some ways there's the conversation right there between these two calling you to sanctity ultimately to heroic self-sacrifice to being who christ is it also is it is what people worship because here here's a way of thinking about it technically well look when i have a conversation with you there's something i want from you i want i want everything you can give me i want you to be as as as as there as you can possibly be that's what i've been demanding all the time if my attention assuming a properly constituted subjectivity if my attention wanders that peterson got that in this conversation he's that fast means you're not delivering and so if you're wandering around and everyone's attention is wandering away from you you're not delivering and conscience because we're so social we're social creatures to the final degree conscience tells you when you deviate from the ideal and that ideal is what people worship they by attaining the attending to that manifestation of the ideal in you they worship it and so that's there it's there in the in the demands that we can't help but make of each other and of ourselves there's no escape from that and so i know i do think it's a perfectly good question what would happen and this is the right question for your life what would happen if you took that seriously and so again what i see again back to peugeot's conversation and i don't say that to criticize i just say this is what peterson's working on this is where he's at this is what's churned so i'm gonna ask peugeot this i'm gonna ask bishop erin this i'm gonna this is this is what it's what he's chewing on right now is that it doesn't seem to me to be if the church can no longer attract young people it has to be that they're not taking that with sufficient seriousness now yeah i i think there's a lot to that i don't want to externalize the blame it's like i know the church is a human organization and all of that and but but it's still evidence when i was coming of age so back in like say the 1970s the presumption of the church was we should make this thing as easy as possible because if we make it hard these people are going to run away so again this part of the conversation is sort of a redoing of the conversation from 2019 it's not a bad thing but it it's telling we don't want to make it we want to make it intellectually easy so i got a very dumbed down catholicism it was through the grace of god that i discovered later in life the very rich catholic intellectual tradition when i was going through school including through high school you know banners and balloons and collages and it was a very superficial we got the clearer impression when i was a kid that english and science and math and all that were serious subjects religion was like religion was like gym or it was like you know and that was definitely not true in terms of my calvinist school the religion classes were very serious this was dower dutch calvinists i don't know what else like art class or something it was considered not that serious so we dumbed it down intellectually and we lessened the moral demand for sure because we didn't want i think people i think people to run away and then see we lessened the moral demand it's not really moral demand it's it's the existential challenge and vision for envision it's the better word you know i'll say it bluntly rather pathetically we tried to be as relevant as possible that was the term from our time right and that's like the uncool guy at the party man right you know if you have to strive to be relevant you're you're you're not matthew mcconaughey all right all right all right you're not on the cutting edge that's for sure right and so there's a study i read some years ago that i thought was very plausible the conclusion was what young people find compelling in a mentor figure are the two things one is that the person knows a lot about the subject that he or she is sharing and secondly they're really committed to it and when the kid sends those two things there's a lot to know here and this guy or this woman they really they really believe it they find that compelling you don't need you know the the games of relevance you don't need to dumb it down in fact smarten it up and and make it as intellectually challenging and morally challenging as possible we cut cue the cue the youtube new media conversation because that's exactly right we dropped a lot of practices that were that were much more common years ago you know to kind of draw young people into the challenge of it so that is a problem absolutely well you know one of the things that i've been so delighted by is my observation that there's a tremendous hunger for serious conversation yeah public hunger for it and when i when i have engaged in my lectures i'm always extending my myself to my limits of thought like that's what the lecture is it's an it's an attempt to go past what i think and there's absolutely no doubt that that um everyone in the audience is on board with that i mean it was the case when i debated sam harris for example that discussion which and they paid to be present for it even you know it was as technically complex as sam and i could make it and you know and that might not be as philosophically complex as the absolute ideal but it was it wasn't dumbed down by any stretch of the imagination and there there's just there was there's no reason that that is if you spoon feed that material it it catches no one what and i can tell you this those new uh atheists so sam and and hitchens and dawkins those guys uh they were good evangelizers i mean for their position uh i deal with yeah they didn't dumb it down either they didn't dumb it down they had the two things i talked about they were they were intelligent and they were passionately committed to it but every day on the internet when i go into these comm boxes i hear the phrase ologies what's a comm box do you mean the comment section it's from hitchens and dawkins and sam harris a lot of young people read them they didn't hug them into atheism they argue them into atheism so i've been telling our people we got to stop trying to hug people back into the faith we have to argue them back into the faith we have to make it compelling and you need hugs and arguments actually i had a friend i've been walking with this friend of mine on talking with him and you know he said something quite interesting he was raised in in a communist country and was an atheist after that um uh he said his family um observed christmas and he criticized them for that because it was logically incoherent and then he realized that all that would happen if they abandoned christmas was that they wouldn't have christmas anymore this is a great line it wasn't like he had something to replace it with right it was and so it's mad and harris owns that which is quite interesting because it's magical you might even call it naive if if you're of the sort of mind that would call that naive but do you want to have it or not and if the answer is to all replace it with another weekend then that's really not helpful and the problem with the atheists is that they don't have the best they can offer is something like a materialistic utopia and i've got nothing against that like i've been talking to people like bjorn lomborg and and uh who who who lay out this vision of an increasingly wealthy world where absolute poverty is a thing of the past and where people can take the levels of health that are more or less taken for granted in the west for granted everywhere in the world through a process of incremental economic improvement and you know more power to that i think but i also know that that that isn't a sufficient story is and there's a kind of despair that goes along with material security it's called the meaning crisis i really am excited about john verveckis conversation with jordan peterson i really hope that happens because the adventure is drained out of it and dostoevsky touches on this and this is where i really learned this when i first encountered this idea you know dostoevsky and notes from under the ground says um look this is something you have to understand if you gave people everything they need so that they had nothing to do but eat cakes and and busy themselves with the continuation of the species if if they were so happy that nothing but bubbles of bliss would appear on the surface of the water that they were in they would smash it all to pieces just so that something adventurous and unique could happen and so right like there has to be a call to a higher order of spiritual being let's say a psychological being that accompanies that materialism or it's or we won't even accept it'll kill us no absolutely it'll kill it'll smother us um it's got to be the call to sanctity and the call to sanctity is a call to love uh and they're dostoevsky you know love is harsh and dreadful it's not a cute little emotion or it's not a it's not a sentiment real love is harsh and dreadful because it means going into the place where people are suffering and becoming another christ and bearing the burdens of the world um that's serious business love is is and something awful about it you know but when you someone someone's also something awful about the judgment you know because if you love someone you also hold them to a standard yeah you will they're good right and that means holding to a standard do you know this is russia trigger this is my mind i'm reading the these wonderful books by this priest walter czizak i don't know if you know that name he died 1984 but for 23 years he was a prisoner in the soviet system so he was arrested in 1939 right when the war got going with the with the germans and make a long story short he was in lubyanka prison for five years in moscow basically in solitary confinement then he was sent for 15 years or so to siberia to the worst work camps you know and he describes it in this book called with god in russia in this kind of bold just straightforward way but all through it he says okay i i went into russia to be a missionary to announce the gospel it's it's not the way i expected it to be i didn't expect to be in a prison camp but okay this is what god has willed obviously at least his permissive will is that i'd be here so i'll do what i can so for 23 years this man set up when he was in solitary a jejuite uh program of prayer and he would go through his day he had the prayers of the mass memorized then when he gets to the camps they would smuggle in little bits of bread and wine so he would say mass on a little table clandestinely you know and he would minister in his own quiet way to the people around him i'm telling that story because in the most horrific circumstances in a way he never saw coming he said okay but i'll try to be a saint here i'll try to be christ bear the sufferings of those around me and bring the grace of god he was finally sprung in 1963 jfk was involved in getting him out with a prisoner exchange as he left russia he's he's the plane's taking off and he did the sign of the cross over the country bless the country and it's incredibly moving story because it's not at all flashy it's told in a really almost bland manner but it's someone who decided no i'm going to go in the depths i'm going to deal with what i've been given and it's horrific i'm in a i'm in a soviet siberian concentration camp doing hard labor but i'll be christ for the people here um now he's preaching that's it i mean that's the adventure there's the hero's journey that he went on so well so let's get back to the to the resurrection idea there because again see that story to some degree see now that the cruciform story bishop barron just preached set up jordan for more investigation into the resurrection doesn't require the resurrection to to to to to to underscore his heroism in fact to say in some sense to say well that was motivated by faith in the resurrection in some sense undermines the heroism of the action and again i'm saying i'm not trying to casually dispense with the idea of the resurrection at not least because of its undoubted metaphorical structure and but there is this this crazy emphasis this crazy idea that somehow bearing up under all that burden reformatted the entire structure of being and that's associated with i believe and i'm no theologian i believe that's associated with the idea of the harrowing of hell is that is that well yeah there's something but what i do is a first step though that's the church the church christ's resurrection is the seed from which the church grows and the church is the means by which god wants to reconfigure the world that's right we're not there just to kind of whisper our convictions among ourselves our whole purpose is to go now and and recreate the world he's right but when he let off that's the church especially in the context of the previous conversation church has heard a sort of this weak institution that is not as successful in colonizing the world as let's say apple corporation and and and i think i might have sort of led off in a different way to have to describe the mission and have that be recognized as the church rather than leading off with sort of the institutional moniker that's the church's purpose so no i read it reminds me i read history and history is so interesting that it's unbearable right if you read history it's it's unbearably interesting and yet if you go sit in a history class taught by the typical history teacher it's so and i think that's what he said well church church is like that unbearable history class but but this mission of the church that the the the when you're really getting into history it's unbearably interesting dull that you can hardly keep your eyes open there's you know you need to memorize what happened in 1612 and that's not the point the point is the unbelievably magnificent drama and so then again if that story that that the church is telling is not being taken up it's not being sold there's something about it that's not being sold properly i'm not saying i have the answer to that you know but like i saw this kid once when i was in you got part of it answer for it jordan which is why we're all paying attention to you montreal and he was about 17 years old and he was big guy big like six foot five guy and and uh you know like a physical specimen and he was standing on the corner of of a like a shopping area and he had two pink shopping bags in his hands and he looked kind of bereft and i thought you know if you came up to him and said um i've got some heroism in battle for you around the corner he dropped though and you said it right he dropped those damn pink shopping bags in a second and be off for the adventure of his life yeah and and you you you it has to what is it is it a lack of faith that that a fundamental faith that that is sapping the lifeblood out of that story because you're saying well here i'm calling you well now in all fairness the fundamental adventure of his life for a hero in a physicalist world will look something like a marvel cinematic movie okay you're going to use that big six foot five body to go and rescue a damsel in distress fair enough christ inverts that in a very interesting way and which which not only says well it's not just six foot five specimens of masculinity that have a heroic role but tiny little women who can barely believe that god loves her can be a hero and so so and and you know again this is james scops reading mother therese and you know one of the three or four books out in the world that actually have a blurb by me on the back i should i should probably write read what it says the highly the high spiritual voltage of a saint is supposed to inspire but can be simultaneously but can simultaneously expose our own insecurities and deficiencies though mother teresa's secret dark through mother teresa's secret darkness james scops invites us in this lovely book to look at our faith doubts and marriage to jesus how do shining saints cast shadows and common saints bear light read on that's what this book is about and so to sort of invert peterson's well what about the physicality well jordan the physicality inspires even the little women of the world and and women sacrifice all the time in their own way in a feminine way so often i mean every mother does you to an adventure that's as great as any adventure you could possibly conceive by definition this is the ultimate adventure that you're being called to yeah but but the hobbit hole is so attractive i mean they're so billbow would rather stay in his hobbit hole i mean it's comfortable and i got my doilies and it's nice yeah we all know this we all know this bishop inspire him you know go after him bishop go after him change that man it's comfortable here so gandalf has to summon him to adventure it's a it's a it's a burden it's a task you know and so the church has got to play that role of of gandalf to get into these hobbit holes and get people motivated to get them out you know what's walter cheesick i'll tell you exactly he's a Jesuit novice in pennsylvania 1930 something and popius the 11th at the time from rome says now you're doing it russia's just gone communist the church is being persecuted i need and he said it this way i need heroes to go into russia and you jesuits you're kind of my shock troops i'm going to summon you into russia and young walter cheeziks 18 or 19 says he just knew that's where i'm going and he went up to the speaker and said i'm in okay they sent him to rome to study russian language and russian liturgy and they sent him into russia so i mean he was summoned he was summoned to adventure he took it on you're in why like what happened in your life yeah now we're cooking if to to pull you in this direction and and and how has it worked for you you know what was jordan for me uh i was a catholic kid you know going to mass on sunday um but not all that interested in religion and i was interested in baseball when i was like 13 14 why do i all do all these rando stories on my channel why all these boring conversations this is why because they're not boring because this story of an enfleshed person who has become a really impressive man i mean i mean think what you want about bishop barron he is a very impressive man he's not a perfect man and i've you know critiqued his performance in this conversation plenty throughout this video but he's a very impressive man and how did you become and and and and and peterson sees that that robert barron is impressive if if robert barron wasn't impressive and what he's accomplished and he's accomplished things that jordan peterson uh that jordan peterson values that he you know sort of an exception to the image of the weak church well what's your story and why do we want to know the story because we will pull patterns out of it and we will look at them on our own and we these will give us insights for opportunity and obstacles but i'm in high school freshman high school class and it was a catholic high school so it's a religion class and one of the teachers laid out for us one of thomas equinas's famous arguments for god's existence and i did not disbelieve in god and i believe in god but i never in my life thought that you could think about god in a serious way and it opened up something it set my mind on fire and um i started going to libraries back in those days we went to libraries and and part of what's you know profoundly inspiring about roman catholic priests are you know the aspect of not being married you know it's a it's a sacrifice and that's that's part of what's impressive because oh i'm yeah um bishop barron looks like a reasonably attractive guy you know isn't a sports don't know sexual orientation not gonna ask but you know he took the vows he went in and as a protestant preacher i look at roman catholic priests who have taken a vow of celibacy and i say hey good on you that not necessarily that i want to make that a rule of the church in the christian reformed church i don't and to invoke that conversation but that example of commitment to the cause is is is already impressive and it draws attention and i was taking these books of thomas equinas off the shelf i had no idea what i was reading but i but i was i i still to this day think of those like magical days that i discovered something that just turned my my mind on you know so that was the opening of the door then the other book i read at that time it was so influential was thomas merton you know merton they he's a trap i remember reading merton early on too boy merton merton grabbed me this monk he'd been a man of the world you know all the way and then had this huge conversion experience and becomes the most radical kind of monk you you can become and those two thomas's equinas and merton had a big impact on me when i was a kid because there's something romantic about it you know merton's was the story of someone kind of falling okay romantic so go back to the brand video back to for americans romanticism and spirituality so deeply connected love with god totally um that's what got me in the door and then i followed a lot of the intellectual path i was always kind of a thinker type and that got me into the the priesthood and then you know off i go but at every stage it was something like a summoning to mission is language we would use summoning to a mission of ever greater kind of mission that kept me going i always found it i don't know the most compelling option on the table it always struck me that way as you look at the options of life like well serving god yeah duh wouldn't that be the most exciting thing is the one because you're raised in the church and and you're brought there and and and so okay bishop baron now in i don't know how old bishop baron is i can look it up there's wikipedia bishop robert baron is 61 years old looking good for 61 years old but yes i mean so you've been you know at least faithful enough to have not lost your lost your position as bishop and so that i think his turn right there and that's inspiring and then peterson pulled it out of it and you know it's a shame that since now we're we're at 141 and we're starting to cook and we only have 10 minutes left that's it is that apart from the terror that that might reasonably evoke it's it is the best by definition and again you could just speak psychologically here by definition that's the best game you can play that's how it struck me when i was a kid yeah well it's almost a tautology you know right it struck me that way you know so and i understand everyone's different everyone's path is different but lean into it bishop this is this is the minute you're looking for in this conversation this is where you go for the heart and i think he's come on come on bishop do it but that's how it struck me how grace i would say you know entered my life and i truly i've been a priest now for 30 what five years um bishop now for five years um i've i've never been i've never been unhappy as a priest i mean i've suffered certainly and have gone through difficult times i've never been unhappy though as a priest i've never been tempted to leave see and and and when when he talks about himself like this and again this can get maudlin and you got to be really careful with this but when he talks about himself like this this is compelling because he's being honest and and we all would imagine you know hey you know vows of celibacy um sacrifice serving the church um and and now he's this is this is this is the most compelling he is in the whole video i've never felt like oh god why did i do that i've never felt that um and this social media enterprise of yours you know when i introduced you i noted that you're come on don't let him redirect you bishop come on you this is the moment make your play perhaps the most well-known catholic speaker in social media circles i think that's a reasonable presupposition do you have competitors so to speak oh yeah there are some people i was one of the pioneers in a way because i know like when youtube first got started was 2006 by early 2007 i did a review of um scorsese's movie the departed because my my instinct was let's talk about the culture let's talk about things going on that have a religious overtone you know so i started early 2007 right when youtube got off the ground and then everything else facebook and instagram came along and then others sort of saw what i was doing and got into the game too but i guess i was one of the first ones to do it not that i know that world that well i got all these young people that helped me navigate that world but i've been providing a lot of the content and and so what's what's that been like and how is that received by your peers or your superiors for that matter i i would say well to answer the second part first i think well i think they saw oh yeah this is good i'm glad he's doing it i'm glad someone is taking the initiative and they began asking me early on like hey tell us more about this and how are you doing it and what are the pitfalls and how's it working so i think my superiors have always been you know very open to it interested in it when i've spoken to the now that i'm a bishop i'll speak at the bishops conference meetings about it and there's always tremendous interest now these are all older men for the most part they don't know you know facebook from you know french fries now this is something about working in the church work so he's 61 i'm 57 and we regularly although not so much with me now i've got a lot of younger pastors around me and i'm getting to be one of the old guys but it's true the church but they get it they get the importance of it and and why it's worth doing and and the the success of it in a way has been a source of of surprise and delight to me when i started youtube videos i mean we thought if we got 300 views we're doing great i was thrilled when i my first one got to 300 views um you know and then it just grew it just grew from there and i think it was a willingness to talk about the culture and then engage people so i can't do it as much now but in the early days i would get in the comm boxes and i would really enter into these debates and hierarchies bind and blind you know as you know 97 percent of people that come on convocs are mad at you for some reason or they you know don't like the convocs like what you're saying so okay i was able then to at least have an argument i could get into the you know lists with them well i'll tell you it's interesting you say that because i've certainly met my fair share of opposition in the media domain let's say and we lost the moment you know it's like you can't you know the the moment was there bishop you had to go for the throat you had to i know it's theoretically but especially with you know the legacy media um but i'm stunned by the positivity of the comments it's absolutely overwhelming i can't really make heads or tails of it that it's so consistent oh but you know there's always a few negative comments but if you're doing this kind of video this is something i learned when i started is that you've got they've got some shit posting and you've got some jokes and you got all of that but in terms of long-form video um most of your comments comments are commenters are fans and and so and that's why i really appreciate the comments because many of the comments that you write are helpful distant and it's been very system and i just noted on twitter today that actually i really appreciate the negative comments and the critical comments i learned a ton from them gaining to me so and i i don't really i don't i guess the reason i think that's the case is because i think i'm encouraging people you know who have okay remember challenge but i'm encouraging and again that this is a big thing that comes with peterson again and again this is deep this is deep in his motivational structure in his heart haven't had any encouragement or enough and that's lots of people maybe everyone because i mean how much people should be encouraged to the ultimate degree right they should say well you want to reveal the divine within in your own particular way you could do that and well you know i'm curious about you did the reddit am8 and you a couple times well i did that i've done it twice now and i think one one year i was like you were first and i was third and not because they knew me i'm sure they didn't but i just got on and said i'm a catholic bishop who loves to dialogue with non-believers and atheists or something right so you're asking also inviting some pushback there as well so yeah but but it was i loved it we got an enormous response now a fair amount of obscenity and just people that hate religion see part of it might be religion and i'm so cuss at the bishop is that like a game institutionally identified with religion so all that but but i love both times i did that the questions that emerged and the themes that emerged were very illuminating to me you know so no i i've loved that world too of entering into it and it's you know it certainly gets attention people watch these videos and then i've done a lot of you know writing and so on longer form things i've done documentary films as well about what kind of crowd are you getting now with your youtube channel and your podcast what what's your audience numbers yeah we have like 77 million or something uh you know total views oh yeah on you on your channel yeah wow that's that's that's a lot are people cutting up your your videos and posting them in pieces as well not like you jordan he doesn't he nobody's nobody's clipable as clipable as jordan jordan jordan you're the king of that that not long-form bishop baron yeah sometimes sometimes um i'm trying to get the an average it depends on the type of video we're doing but yeah we're getting you know good numbers solid numbers um not in your ballpark but well 77 million total views is like that's far beyond respectable that's i mean you'd think about comparing that to something like a published book i mean youtube has a reach that's absolutely staggering right and i appreciate that very much you know that all these different forms and then that's just youtube you know many of all the other forms of social media so you know i'm look as an evangelist as someone trying to speak for the church i'm delighted by that and um you know we just did it we just as you did i mean i think the first video of yours i saw you were in a like a poorly lit room sitting in this chair talking about nicha or something and i thought well this guy someone said oh he's getting these enormous numbers and i thought well this last part of the video isn't really terribly interesting but it's actually vitally important because this is where these two are bonding personally and i probably don't need to play it and bishop says you know he just said prayer for tamian for jordan and so it's it's a good it's a good pastoral ending to the video i'm about out of time so i should wrap this up and there's um i'm not going to do a third of these but yeah i i would have liked to have seen bishop lean in a little bit more i would have done it differently it's not a criticism i probably but and i'm also not sitting in the hot seat so you know i could have i could botch it even worse i'm not saying he botched it but yeah it's it's i hope they have more conversation you know because it because you know tammy is praying the rosary and you know what do i want as a christian minister i want i want them to find life and life abundant and i believe that comes from union with christ so and that's something that bishop barron um hold in common even if there might be differences in attire and uh marital vows between us but um yeah so overall you know good video um and hopefully not two years between conversations but i think again the conversation would have been better served if if someone else was with them to facilitate the conversation that both of them knew and you know i think actually brett weinstein did a good job it wouldn't be good for these two but did a good job with with jordan and sam harris um douglas murray did too with jordan and sam harris so i think i think someone who knows both of their work quite well and i think that would have actually allowed them to get quite a bit deeper into into things that were not necessarily deeper but closer and again at the end of the video sort of a pastoral moment but but it's the closer we're looking for so anyway uh there's the second part of the commentary i hope it was good for you it was fun for me to make and uh let me know what you think i do really enjoy your comments and if you want other people to you know like and subscribe but um you know the when we do our saturday we do our friday every friday we do a question and answer uh bridges of meaning discord i do it in the discord not just on youtube there's a chat section i do stream to youtube live but why do i do it in the discord server i do it in the discord server because it's sort of an estuary and we can actually have more conversation in that harbor than we can really have just sort of with the youtube facilities and um yeah and i look forward to hearing from you thanks for watching
