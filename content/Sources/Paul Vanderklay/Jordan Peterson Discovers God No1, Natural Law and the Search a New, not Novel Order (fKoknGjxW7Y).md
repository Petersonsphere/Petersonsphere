 Hi, this is Paul. I'm gonna do some thinking about God number one and God number two and natural law. Now I'm gonna be on vacation for what to the channel might not feel like any time at all or might feel like two weeks. I'll have a couple of conversations banked up for then but I don't know what my usual daily postings will look like if I'm posting daily or if I'll be able to post much at all or if I'll post more. Vacations are weird for me because the channel is partly work but really partly just a way to record my thoughts and when I go on vacation depending on what kind of vacation and who I'm with either I'll have more thoughts to record or fewer thoughts to record. Now one of the things that I've pointed out a number of times on this channel now over the last couple of number of weeks is that I've started a sub stack and I'm sort of using that sub stack in conjunction with Twitter. I'm using it in conjunction with Twitter to sort of reign in add some constraints to me. Part of my ADHD difficulty with writing is that just as in my videos it gets so divergent and so I'm always wrestling with frames that will sort of keep me disciplined so that I can do something so that I can get a little bit of productivity out of my chaotic brain. So this morning actually I wrote a sub stack. I didn't post a video this morning. When will I post this one? I might post it today. This is the way it goes with my channel. My channel is horribly unplanned. I don't plan or organize much and we'll get into planning and organizing a little bit later when we get into natural law and some of my issues with the formulation of it. We'll say it that way. But first you know God number one and God number two is a regular question that I have people asking me about and so I actually wrote a sub stack about it after I saw that Tom Holland I knew that they announced this that they're going to do a World Cup of Ancient Gods and I thought well that's fun and it's I think really important and even just the even just the graphic in his tweet is very much sort of superhero Marvel cinematic universe movie type things which I think in terms of our imaginary is exactly where it should be and it prompted a lot of thinking about my God number one and God number two and I'll just read through this and the link to this will be in the notes now again if you part of the reason I started with the sub stack and the Twitter summaries of my videos is that not all of us have hours in our day in order to listen to videos and actually the truth for me is that some days I have a lot of time to listen to videos and podcasts and some days I have no time at all and so not everybody people will often come on and apologize that they haven't watched all of my videos and I think that's some of you have lifestyles where this works for you others of you don't and I have a good number of friends who tell me I'd really love to watch your videos but I just don't have time and what they do have time for is probably a 500 to a thousand word blog post and so that's how I'm using sub stack and I'm using it to try to organize and constrain and put a little bit of order into my chaotic learning experience which is really what this YouTube channel is so this is the sub stack today finally some clarity on God number one and God number two it began for me with the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris debate my favorite podcast now I'm my favorite podcasts can change almost daily sometimes but this has been favorite for a couple of months now I really enjoy the rest is history as a podcast my favorite podcast yes I'm a Protestant along with all those of you who identify as atheist is doing a World Cup of the gods I think this is genius Tom Holland writes in his in his tweet excited to announce talking of the rest of history World Cups that the ancient gods World Cup will be kicking off in a fortnight's time fans of high octane adrenaline pumping elite sports should be no should on no account miss it and yeah I'm excited but now this will be great fun but it will obviously cause practicing Christians and other religious people to tremble and you know they when they talked about doing this in a previous podcast you know right away they realized that well this this can't just sort of be safely pushed back into the past what were these gods what are these gods you know and for those of you who say enjoy listening to a reliable evangelical like John Walton even though of course anything that any academic puts out will be debated quite a bit you know in many ways these these ancient world were functionaries and so in John Walton's lost world of Genesis one what's interesting about the Hebrew scriptures are that in the Genesis one account part of how it differs from the rest of the ancient world is that they're not gods but they're seemingly see now you just can't talk about this stuff without running across lines natural processes but that's not how they experience them in the ancient world and phenomenologically sort of in a Peugeotian sense that's not how we experience them we experience them as alive motivated and moved by something so what are these gods and and so you know Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook are gonna have a lot of fun with this and Christians are gonna start feeling uncomfortable are we are we violating one of the Ten Commandments how are we to think of these gods now every attentive lad or lass in Sunday school knows that there is God capital G and the gods lowercase G and part of yeah I can't just finish my sentences with these things because they get so horribly complicated so very quickly are there you shall have no other gods before me what gods are you talking about Moses or the Lord thundering from Sinai what other gods would we have before you and of course that gets into I forget his he works for logos and he's done a lot of writing about the the heavenly court and you know recognizing basically pulling back in the Bible the Bible project guys have done this sort of pulling back modernity to once again expose many of the subtextual layers in the biblical text where they've sort of been often covered up by contemporary translations that well why are we talking about these gods and and what is exactly happening in the book of the beginning of the book of Job where God is sort of holding court and who are these beings that come before him are we to you know recontextualize them as angels or how what framework do we fit these things in but you know one of the things that I noticed in Plato so again a number of years ago I was reading Dallas Willards the Divine Comedy because I was working on the Sermon on the Mount it's always working on the Sermon on the Mount it seems and you know he was getting into it was getting into dekaya Sunni and that conversation in the ancient world and so I decided I wanted to you know read some of Plato's Republic in Greek because I had always read English translations and you know my Greek isn't fabulous by any means but you know with a pony I can sort of make my way through and I'm reading along in Plato and realizing well of course I mean the Plato's Republic begins down at the down at the down at the port where they're having a celebration of the gods but every now and then Plato talks about God singular of course Sam Adams will jump in and say well that's the Godhead and of course Sam's Unitarian role that he's playing in the estuary is to sort of okay we're reliving late antiquity early Church Council conversations about what are these terms that we're using because if as Brett Sackold would note you Martin Luther goes after Aquinas and Aristotle in hopes of trying to somehow recapture what Aquinas and Aristotle were getting at but the but the philosophical underpinnings had all slipped and so he postures he postures Aquinas and Aristotle as his enemies and Brett Sackold comes along and says you know sorry Martin it's not really your fault the conversation had changed between you and Aristotle or between you and Aquinas and a lot of history had happened and you know it wasn't just a dark age where everything was static a great deal of stuff was happening during that period and you're you weren't reading you weren't reading Aquinas with proper eyes and so now Sackold comes back and says well Luther and Calvin are sort of trying to get back at what Aquinas talked about in transubstantiation hmm so as many of you know have been following this channel for a long time I don't even remember who recommended it but someone along the way recommended I could probably go back and find and if you want to produce yourself that's fine take credit for it recommended Christine Hayes's lecture two in her series that's on YouTube on the Hebrew Bible and brought in the Medi-Divine realm and brought in Kaufman and I you know I mentioned in my tweet I there weren't a lot of these books out there and I got an early one so I got it for seven or eight bucks probably but now the only ones you can find her for hundreds of dollars it's like oops sorry didn't mean to didn't mean to wreck the used book market in this book something's going on and something was going on deep beneath the imaginary of the Hebrews in the ancient world and all of our attempts to sort of get at it our our feeble attempts and you've got well what do we mean when we you have the gods World Cup there's there's a Medi-Divine realm and and it seemed well my YouTube Odyssey was jolted when a viewer of my videos asked if I'd ever watch this video this led to a number of things including wrecking the economy around a certain used book I'd already come up with my working boxes of God number one which is really Jordan Peterson's God and God number two the God of Sam Harris loves not believing in after listening to their first chat with Brett Weinstein what do you mean by God the Hebrews had their the Hebrews had their God capital G but it wasn't like the other people's gods the Hebrews never really disbelieved in the gods but they acted out their relationship with their God and the normal ravages of history seemed not to destroy their God unlike the gods of Babylon and all the other gods that the Roman gods the Greek gods the God of the Hebrews finally took them all out in a very Jordan Peterson esque Darwinian truth sort of way now they're still sort of beneath the surface the store still sort of lurking in the corners you know I read Gaiman's American gods found it to be a fascinating book the gods of the ancient world couldn't do anything and what I mean by that is not that they couldn't do anything but they couldn't do anything they were limited they were limited by their Medi-Divine realm and village atheists you know really it's really folk atheism you know you would ask questions like can God create a rock too big for even God to lift and you know this you know you get these things in grade school and you sit and you think about them and and they're always sort of dismissed with the left hand they're always sort of dismissed as well that it's you can't it's a logical inconsistency well then is God is God bound by the the laws of logic and if God is bound by the laws of logic then he's you know and that gets into all sorts of of ancient and medieval theological debates that most practical people just sort of push to the side because it becomes very clear that these debates aren't getting you anywhere but along of course comes verveky and the agent arena relationship and well you know what a question like can God create a rock too big for even God to lift is really an agent arena it exposes the ancient arena relationship and the reason the question just sort of seems to confuse us and juggle our categories and again there are lots of logical ways out of that question and go ahead and put them in the comments that's fine but it's a function of the agent and arena because the identity of God is a function of the arena which is why polytheists as we call them but the you know classical polytheism in many ways tried to somehow represent the the agentic aspect of the arena in a variety of ways and you know I didn't have time to go looking for it but you know it was one of Tom Holland's books that I think it was one of Tom Holland's books where he was talking about the fates and you know even the gods are sort of subject to the fates and you know so so in in pagan in pagan antiquity you have all of these ways of trying to represent the agentic aspect of the arena but these aren't gods they're sort of they're hard for us to represent because it's this it's this agent arena it's this agent arena relationship that we somehow have to represent in story and a narrative and it's true it's tremendously difficult because narrative is completely dependent upon agent arena relationships in that way the the author of the narrative creates the world in which the agents operate and that's you know I play that trick often when I ask can Tolkien be found in Middle-earth and this annoys people and delights other people and they right away start they don't quite know how to answer the question but they know that I'm playing a trick on them it's because Colt Tolkien has created the arena and the agents operate within the arena and Tolkien is everywhere in Middle-earth but but Tolkien again sees himself as a sub creator so even even he isn't fully in charge of the arena because in many ways whether or not these texts become living texts depends on whether Tolkien can actually plug into the he fit his sub creator arena within our arenas and storytellers are always working on this and we see this when a when when a narrative or a story or a movie or something comes out and it breaks something it breaks cannon because part of canon is in fact that whole agent arena relationship so the Hebrews managed to identify the arenic God which is what I call God number one as a character in the story that's a huge accomplishment there seems to be other attempts in other religions the fates for example but they never really there net they are never really like the Hebrew Lord that that problematic character of the Old Testament and and again if I just put the link here to that place where Sam Harris asked well what do you mean by God and Peterson basically lays out something of a god number one Christianity turns up the heat when it declares that a human being who was born lives dies rises and ascends into heaven within history is the God not a God because then we'd be back with the polytheist subject to their meta divine realm and so you know I you know it's it's both tremendously blessed and bothersome in our little estuary to have a sea monster like Sam Adams and his biblical Unitarian because you know a lot of the other Unitarians are sort of easy to dismiss because they're not they're not offering a crunchy religion the kind of crunchy religion that I need and some of you have sort of chuckle at the crunchy religion I get that from from Tim Keller who probably got it from somewhere else but but you get the sense of it right in the language pastors are are terrible word thieves we're always stealing words from each other and from you but but that's it's it's part of part of the part of the declaration of Christianity of at least Trinitarian Christianity that Jesus is God as the father is God and the spirit is God it is is sort of straddling this agent arena relationship and and you know it's just difficult for us to sort of comprehend this frames the the rest is history World Cup of Gods because as they say the house and I capitalized house intentionally the house always wins so someone left a comment see what they said dare you name there you name of this unnamed used book maybe I'll leave that as a little little something for someone to look for anyway so I've said many times when asked about God number one and God number two why don't I name them more properly well partly because there are sort of these boxes on my workbench and and Benjamin Boyce and I have a conversation scheduled for early next week before I go on vacation and he wants to talk about God number one and God number two and you know that I just sort of you know the God number one and God number two thing is a great example of my the productivity of my YouTube learning project because I say things and I don't know if these things have any value until you start spitting them back to me and in fact I'm it's partly a measure of their value by the earnestness with which you spit them back to me and God number one and God number two kept coming back up and you know attempts to map it on the Trinity and no it's not it's it's not an attempt to map it on the Trinity because quite properly in the Trinity the Father Son and Holy Spirit are all persons but they're not three gods but one God and and so this is this is the and perhaps that's a way to sort of think about the Trinity is the Agent Arena relationship I don't know it's just off the top of my head might be totally wrong and I might start an entire well it's a good thing my channel isn't too big because I'm not looking to start an entire school of heresy based from my YouTube channel although I recognize that that's certainly a a potentiality and a danger but but this gets into this this question of natural law now this Agent Arena relationship I think has a lot to do with natural law now again Carl who is famous in the comment section for first praising me then cursing me because I on one hand don't dismiss God number one which is sort of like natural law it's very much related to natural law the the Arenic God but Carl gets frustrated with my continual commitment to God number two the personal God God as person God as agent within the arena and so but but Bionic Mosquito who's a regular in the comment section too and writes you know really excellent comments Carl wrote excellent comments too I learned a lot a ton from Carl and didn't always behave himself well in the comment section but didn't always behave himself well in the comment section but I know that when Carl was sort of in his heyday in the comment section I got repeated requests back channel requests to ban him and I thought no you know in an estuary you need a few sea monsters and you know it see monsters evoke heroes that will rise to slay them so generally speaking leave the sea monsters alone and and in a way for me to ban Carl would have been using some of my Arenic powers to to eliminate his agency let's say so we'll play with that but I got a really nice email from from Bionic Mosquito who also wrote a blog post and so let's take a look at those and then I want to look at Andrea with the bangs and Richard Rowland's terrific conversation that Andrea just posted on her channel not too long ago with with only about 400 views so far I thought it was a tremendous conversation you know I'm becoming a big Richard Rowland fan so I'm gonna have to start listening to his podcast too as if I didn't have enough good stuff to listen to. Pastor Paul I found your discussion of natural law confusing I'm glad that you have at least touched on the topic but if you're going to pursue it I will encourage you to understand it better and to give it an appropriate treatment fair enough the foundation of and objective for natural law ethics is to be found in man's purpose man's purpose is beata beattitudo so that's beattitude all right happiness normally translated happiness but not the superficial meaning as we know from the term today better translated as fulfillment through other regarded action love it doesn't get more relational than that Jesus said the same thing than answering the question about the greatest commandment love now love part of what we're dealing with is some of the same stuff that Brett Sockle dealt with in his book Transubstantiation that the meanings of these words keep changing I just saw an interesting tweet this morning from Eric Weinstein about the money as instrument of exchange versus money as conservation a tool of conservation of value and he was thinking about that in terms of cryptocurrency which I think is a very interesting question I see Jonathan Peugeot just did a video on cryptocurrency the symbolism behind cryptocurrency which I'm definitely going to watch but words have the same thing words have the value question of value of exchange of knowledge versus preservation of knowledge and they're not perfect in either score but they're the best we've got I'll say it that way non-believers wouldn't put it this way yet he still is brought to tears a non-believer wouldn't put it this yeah yeah he still is brought to tears when stony Tony Stark snaps his fingers in end game how can this be the apostle Paul offers the answer Romans 2 14 indeed when gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required by law they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law they show that the requirements of the law were written in their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them now two words to watch in that verse are nature and law because whereas there's the both words retain a value of exchange between us and the apostle Paul what Paul meant by law I don't think we can just sort of imagine we know right off the bat and this is part of the issue that NT Wright wrestles with with the reformation and you know a new reading of Paul that has emerged over the last 20 or 30 years and and how are we to understand law and how are we to understand nature because I don't think we can read the word nature without passing through deism and the scientific revolution and modernity and for that reason we need to pay a lot more attention to the medievals and the classical authors and the same with law and I'm wrestling with that with my Pentecost sermon because in many ways you know what I'm doing a little anticipation for my rough draft for Sunday this week I've I've worked for the Acts 2 passage I've worked a variety I've worked in a variety of ways you know fire as in baptized with fire there's lots of there's lots of symbolic symbolic hyperlinks in Acts 2 with many high voltage carrying portions of scripture one that I have not worked yet in all of my years of preaching is really the relationship between Sinai and Pentecost and right there we have I think once I begin to see and work the connections between law at Sinai and law and Paul and law and spirit we begin to some things become illuminated when we set Exodus 19 and 20 alongside Acts 2 what happens when the spirit is given and how does that relate to the law now again this is an old and fierce debate within the Protestant Reformation it divides Calvinists from Lutherans and Calvinists and Lutherans from Anabaptists and Roman Catholics from Calvinists and Lutherans and Anabaptists it gets it's all the question how are we to regard the law and of course Luther well the law is done and Calvinists say no I think the law can be used as an as an expression of grateful obedience misery deliverance gratitude if you deny my Calvinism as many do because I don't identify I think I think the whole free will debate and Calvinism is also a function of the agent arena relationship distortion field it's just confusion field it's just difficult for us to figure it out again this is an excellent email keep reading law has written the net god has written the natural law on men's hearts okay now let's pay attention to just how symbolic and metaphorical that is because I get a sense of reading it and especially Protestant Reformational and even Roman Catholic post-reformation that it's very real to us and it doesn't feel terribly metaphorical even though at the outset we understand that what what writing is God doing on our hearts which are these organs we use to pump blood no no no that's not what I mean okay well let's figure out what we do mean because in terms of atheists there's a tremendous tremendous amount of skepticism in terms of of hearts and law and nature because nature's radically changed and and what law we're not really you know atheists will talk about laws of physics but you start talking about natural law which impinges on especially the context in which it's come up most lately which is human sexuality they get they throw it away so physical laws yes natural law no but wait a minute physics and nature they're sort of the same thing so just as I'm not satisfied with just continuing to spout reformational formulations neither am I satisfied just spouting you know modernist Roman Catholic formulations and and I've got a tremendous amount of concern just after reading Brett Sockle that well I'm gonna handle Aquinas with care because you know Luther and Calvin didn't do so well with with old Tom and they're a lot better read on him than I am so and I know there's a bunch of big Aquinas fans out there and some Aquinas channels but I'm limited by time and space too so you know use what you can from me with profit and mix it with them and make your own channel and contribute to the estuary that's that's part of why you know I'm just one creature in the estuary and and maybe I've established somewhat of an estuary arena here which to me is is the most satisfying part of it but I learned from you all and you learned from me and so you know Bionic Mosquito's email to me is you know a really helpful thing because I'm learning as I'm going see as Lewis develops this in the appendix to the abolition of man yeah and this is where things are going to get a little screwy because Lewis was very self-conscious when he'd use the word law and he was very and he wrote wrote about this quite a bit as if somehow suddenly the agent arena relationship kicks in when you use the word law it's a very arenic word and it puts us in a specific arena and some versions of the golden rule the attitude is found in every major religion let the non-believers believe whatever they want about why this is so we know it is so because God made man in his image and breathed into man giving him a soul again part of the reason non-believers don't believe that is because of the formulation and as an evangelist and as a Christian minister my job is to take a look and to try to capture the thing that our language captured very well in previous centuries but is no longer working today and part of the reason for a lot of atheists and non-believers that I sound so different is because what most Christians do Roman Catholics Orthodox Protestants alike is they just keep repeating the old words and now some people will take the lesson and absorb it but the majority will not and of the majority that will not the vast majority of those that will not are the little people the common people the people who ask dumb quote unquote dumb questions which is in my opinion dumb quote unquote dumb questions which is in my opinion why I think Andrea is you know if there's someone I want Jordan Peterson to talk to there's a lot of people it's a pretty big list but I think one of the best interviews interviewers for Jordan Peterson would be Andrea with the bangs why and some of you would be like that woman that you and Peugeot talked to and she called herself silly and Peugeot and I both said you're not silly you're you keep being you and I don't mean then this kind of modern self-expressive sense but because you know I wrote in the comment to the video that I'm about to play you know she's maybe the most honest woman on YouTube why she's not afraid to ask a question if she doesn't know something and she's an honest learner who's attentive to the conversation and she doesn't unlike many of us who spout off a lot on you know have some aspirations to being the smartest person on the internet that's what makes her interview so valuable her interview with David Fuller I thought was tremendous she asks honest questions and she's not afraid to be herself that's a rare commodity in a world which is death which is desperately trying to establish themselves via their own insecurities by trying to impress one another and you know when I think about certain interviews that I've given on my channel that's part of the reason I don't pursue high status people because it it it you know certain things inside of me that I don't like get triggered and I'm working to mortify some of those things anyway PBK what's the relationship of the law of the Lord has seen in Psalm 1 and natural law? God wrote it on man's hearts there's your there's your metaphor and it's a perfectly good metaphor and it's a biblical metaphor but say that to an atheist God is problematic writing is metaphorical hearts is sort of understandable it isn't going to it isn't going to win a day isn't going to win a day you need to figure out another way to say it how much closer a relationship can there be but this is where this is where you know this this deep conflict between karma and Job comes in because in a way natural religion is nested within this conceptualization which is far newer of natural law that do good things and good things happen do bad things and bad things happen and what that does is critique and beg for recalibration of all of our assumptions of what natural law is and our grasp on it that's exactly why we work on the things we do and and that's why I believe we have to it keeps theologians and pastors and evangelists in business because this is what we're always working on and why was it that Jordan Peterson could be a more effective evangelist than than Bishop Barron and Bishop Barron is a formidable impressive man I mean I wish I knew I mean he's forgotten way more theology than I ever knew it's just the reality of it PVK human rights aren't objective either you don't dig them up in the backyard and find human rights in the dirt human rights are objective you see now we're we're in this modern frame the frame is going away the frame is going away part of the reason part of the reason Christianity is losing influence it's because Christians found the magic words that used to work and they just keep repeating them and they're not working anymore well I'll tell you magic is a function of the meta divine realm magic borrows from the rules of the arena the magician is an agent in the arena and the magic words are not working we need new ones that's what this channel has always been all about because I don't have them and I'm looking for them and I don't want to no longer be a faithful witness I want to be a more effective witness and I completely understand that wandering from the tried and true magic words is tremendously dangerous but we must go out and leave the hobbit hole and go and find trolls and dragons and dwarves and orcs and elves and lake town the questions of owning slaves in ancient Rome versus owning slaves is interesting if natural law never changes why is it considered ethical to own slaves for sex on non-citizens etc perhaps it took the incarnation to make natural law visible and or knowledgeable I absolutely believe in that statement but I wouldn't use natural law as a way to express it in fact that is exactly what dominion that's the point of this book dominion that I keep pointing to because Jesus somehow makes Peugeot doesn't say natural law he says pattern pattern pattern pattern pattern and people who like the word natural law either because they're some kind of non-church going libertarian or because they're a roman catholic or because they're a fan of natural law in whatever place keep saying natural law natural law and Peugeot says pattern pattern pattern pattern and Peugeot gets a hearing and Peugeot is doing the work of evangelism because he's using pattern instead of natural law in many respects and some who are listening for natural law here pattern patterns like oh yeah natural law natural law but Peugeot's not using that word for a reason his audience excuse me his audience is teaching him Bionic Mosquito said be kind I hope I'm being kind I hope I'm being gentle even though I'm emphatic but I'm not doubting your natural law or the thing that you're expressing by using those words natural law I'm simply saying we need new words and Peugeot's already got pattern pattern pattern pattern down and I'm trying to figure out what he's saying too the question how do I live the answer is easy really it's not easy for me according to man's purpose a second question how do I find meaning well you should have asked another question how do I find man's purpose well I under you know the the this is a reformational conversation to know God and love him forever smaller Westminster confession it's right there what does that mean how can I know God God number one no natural law is in a way of saying God number one God number one but I relate to that God relationally as if God is a person or three God number two the agent arena relationship is a real relationship but in a sense it comes together in Christ and so a way that lots of people can understand is I follow the pattern of Christ but wait a minute I'm not a first century carpenter oh I know so you have to discern the pattern and it has to be translated into us here and now into a pastor on florin road in Sacramento into you know whatever whoever bionic mosquito is is why um how do I find meaning the answer is easy by living according to man's purpose what is man's purpose beatitude ah someone into beatitude there it is natural lots right there and the hebrews this is what we do and then the Babylonians come down and destroy the temple and Ezekiel is by the canal now we're thinking Ezekiel saw an extraterrestrial well sort of Jesus is an extraterrestrial in some ways he's also completely terrestrial heideberg catechism puts that together so what is man's purpose to know God and to love him forever and to love him forever what does that mean for me well that's that's what the Christian life is working out this is why the search for meaning must incorporate the importance of natural law ethic all right once you put ethic on it because in some ways natural law is somewhat analogous to the scientific method it's static it's law right but it has to be integrated into the manifest image that's where we have god number two so god number one scientific image god number two manifest image that's why i keep these two boxes box one and box two on my theological workbench because i keep putting stuff in now that doesn't quite fit put other things so you have transcendence imminent that kind of works and personal you know um general revelation special revelation that sort of maps and that's why i keep the boxes one and two out there and and i keep finding ways in which dualities that sort of work with it and and sort you know right now it's the agentic and the arenic it's kind of crowding out the other ones because it's providing knowledge it seems to me this is why the search for meaning must incorporate the importance importance of natural law ethic yeah but i'm not going to use those three words pizho is using pattern what is what is um you know peterson is sort of dead reckoning with meaning and saying well we've sort of seen the nations everybody in the world wants to live in and it is why i believe the discussion you and others are having must grapple with and incorporate an understanding of natural law yes but the thing behind those words and we're going to need new words now those words might continue to be used profitably within a whole variety of social and cultural and educational settings for a few more centuries but they're not working you know with with fans of how many youtubers on internet because nature has been completely reformulated and law in a religious context no thank you i want to do what's authentic so maybe we should use divine authenticity oh a lot of people would wake up when they'd hear divine authenticity you know john piper used um christian hedonism and you know sparked some good things with that i think now i've got my own critiques of john piper but that's the point of a pastor we use different words natural law as such if you have to as a pastor if you have to spend college courses explaining a word in order to sell the word it's not going to work as a pastor or as an evangelist divine authenticity maybe that's better i don't know i just threw it out just came up and that's why i'm using youtube we'll see if it comes back at me and people say oh and then i get a response and it's like oh it's it's sort of like you know thomas edison putting different filaments in for his in his little vacuum bulb and oh that one that one lasted okay let's try another one that's what i'm doing if you've gotten this far i will i will remind you of two names i suggested i suggested that would take for worthwhile conversation on this topic uh father dominic leg of the tomas institute or any of the friars that are versed in natural law and tom woods and again i'm not i'm not picking a fight with these gods with these guys gods guys with these guys at all and and i'm not denying this and now we're going to use this word order see i gotta use language but and and and and it could be that you know this because the way things the natural waves and the normal imaginary these things rise and fall and maybe their new day is coming but i but but you know my same response with the the wave into orthodoxy is on one hand praise god i'm i'm thrilled that the orthodox church is is i'm thrilled that the orthodox church is the kind of net that is taking in new fish from this chaotic religious see that we're working i wish more fish to enter their net but those fish will stretch and reshape the orthodox net and this is a natural and natural i use the word and good process that god is using and and this may the same be said of the tomists praise god may your nets be filled i want that these are good things you know luther luther erred when he too quickly dismissed tomism although tomism i'm sure gets some things wrong too i mean that's that's all of us the same for calvinism you know i i want god's kingdom to come his will to be done on earth as it is in heaven that's my job it's my goal it's my life it's what i'm about but these words are strands in the net they're worms on the hook and sometimes we got to find new ones because there's lots of different fish and god wants his banquet table to be filled with fish a mixed metaphor so then he um so then bionic mosquito put in a link to his blog and i'll put that link below in case any of you want to follow it and read it i skimmed it and i i think i know what you're talking about but i'm not going to use those words very much because i don't think they help me in my mission of catching fish remember freddy real little men so again here's a terrific interview with um andrea with the bangs and richard roland about love but again so aristotle has in a sense the world moving by love you know the divine mover all those layers all those spheres and so andrea had where's my copy andrea had richard in to talk about the discarded image which in the bridges of meaning discord server they did a book study on the discarded image and um let's listen to what he has to say about this book and the project so that's that's kind of how i got to doing that so basically what he's doing is he's proposing a model and we have a model that we we use to think about the world right now and the problem is of course that it's falling apart right that's that's basically the whole reason you have this channel and a lot of other people have channels where they have these wonderful fascinating discussions on youtube and elsewhere it's sense making so of course rebel wisdom has this whole conversation about sense making and what is sense making about it's about well our model is falling apart and we need a new model and we need a new model collectively the collective map that we all participate in and we need a new model individually and of course language is in many ways the connections between that i saw i saw some of uh uh russell branded a thing on ufos and so he's talking about consciousness and stuff well how how this mapping happens isn't that mysterious well in some ways it's deeply mysterious but it happens through language it happens through behavior it happens through drama we we don't have it mapped because it's too massive for us to map but we certainly know many of the elements by which this stuff maps and it's it becomes our culture how we act things out and this our current model is breaking down and so we're working on new ones and this is a great amount of the work of the estuary that we're working in it's because the model that we've all used up till this point is falling apart and we are in need of something to replace it with and so the question is what's going to step in and fill that void you are fast forwarding to my last question richard i'm sorry i'm sorry well i just wouldn't sort of like explain so what that old model is we'll talk about what's we'll talk about what might replace it later yes what that old model is the question yeah yeah so what that old model is is a uh you know not the medieval model but the the model that was kind of current at louis's time um is a way of uh basically something that starts with the enlightenment now now louis's time is the middle of the 20th century that's important it's with the idea of the whole idea even in christian circles of natural law and that is basically that there are these laws which govern the universe they make the universe knowable and understandable and if you violate these laws then things start to go sideways for you in one way or the other which is basically what bionic mosquito wrote this these are these laws now why is it that atheists keep wanting to talk about you know laws of science i mean this law formulation and of course louis every now and then sort of takes a jab at this and says you're sort of making the you know the the you're making this a citizen because it's obeying the law and that's a perfectly reasonable formulation and it's very useful in terms of today but that let's think about nation states let's think about tyranny i mean what what what realms of language are we using for this and is it the best one again it's perfectly serviceable and we're going to keep using it for centuries to come but i don't know that as a pastor and an evangelist it works for people who don't have all kinds of haven't spent all kinds of time in certain classrooms and in fact those have changed dramatically in the last decade okay now this uh this can apply to something like the law of gravity right but it can also apply to like the idea of moral law so when people make a case for instance uh in a case for like roman catholic social ethics uh theology of the body and that sort of thing all of that i that thinking is based on the idea of no gravity and no gravity idea of natural law so there there are these laws that should govern sexual behavior and there are these laws that should govern uh and once we have a divine law that governs sexual behavior well shouldn't our shouldn't our civil law reflect the divine law absolutely yes but we get a little nervous about that and see we're don't you notice that we're right back into the reformational questions and we've been basically adjudicating these things for the last 500 years and a lot of what happens is that things underneath change and the political structures are always that they only have plausibility and they only work in a citizenship and in a population for whom the religious battles have already been resolved i was listening to i haven't finished it yet but the rest is history on cromwell why why did monarchies collapse as they did and why did more democratic forms arise as they did and in many ways this this pattern of using natural law and its argument of having it being reflected in civil law is a remnant of that and again it's a it's an absolutely as a formulation it absolutely makes sense but yelling it again and again and again is no longer working it just isn't and so you say well we have to get well if you want to get ahead of it work in the area of religion not law because the civil law always follows the religion of the people now it's back and forth and it's and it's a tussle but and i don't mean that i mean that if you're actually going to if you're actually going to reformulate and have people act out what the thing behind natural law is you're going to have to reformulate the intermediate the the mediating language between that thing and the people and until you do so you're going to have chaos the way that parents raise their children things like this and that if you violate those laws then the the consequence of violating those laws is going to be it's going to be pain it's going to be sorrow it's going to be you know these various things are going to result and those are sort of just like natural consequences or natural uh you can almost say like punishment for for breaking the rule right right but it's it's immediate punishment it's not necessary so let's say the let's say in the united states we that they're still in the united states remains a stigma against cheating okay now people aren't even married but they still act out that whole cheating business you know he was going out and he did something with her that's cheating and so that still remains in our culture let's imagine the united states government decided to pass a law against cheating well that's been tried many times throughout history uh jesus and the woman caught in adultery i would imagine in the medieval period um they were significant laws against cheating or adultery let's say so but if it's mediated by the civil authority it's mediated and you would argue that there are many immediate penalties for adultery that play out in someone's life and that is the working again natural law you can use that formulation but most people today won't that won't jump to their mind in terms of natural law you might be able to sell natural law with an example like that you know it still has some it still has some traction i'm not going to deny that but a lot of the groups that are just out there banging on the natural law drum i don't see that as coming back again it doesn't mean it's it doesn't mean it's just like in a sense the flat earth you know the earth is flat especially here in the central valley of california that's how it appears but the flat earthers probably aren't going to have their day anytime soon because in our imaginary and that's you know he's so see this is so he prefers social imaginary to world view probably become because he himself and at some point i'll probably talk to richard roland i hope so um if he was a if he was a baptist minister he was probably downstream of the whole world view language craze that happened because of chuck colson and of course that got all the reformed people excited because we'd been using that world view language for a long time downstream from kaiper and bob inc and the dutch reformed world and so that then got popularized in the evangelical world for a hot minute but when he uses social imaginary he's now borrowing from charles taylor and and that's a word that's that's that seems to have better traction so again the thing that the thing the the pattern the pattern that the words natural law express i'm not challenging and peugeot doesn't challenge it every time he says it's not arbitrary he's the apostle of reason okay what language are we going to use that does a better job at at finding us together in agreement acting out the patterns to use peugeot's terms i i don't know that peugeot's terms will win none of us can know it takes decades and centuries for these things to finally emerge you know we participate in this stuff but we are tiny little nodes in the network cogs in the wheel if we want to go back to a mechanistic we're figuring out the language as it goes along now he's a philologist and so the thing he does is pay attention to these changes in language and so when he migrates from world view to social imaginary and at the end of this video when andrea says can i just say world view it's because it's already mapped on her and it's not going to change that quickly so so that that was the uh that was the the model of lewis's time and what lewis does it talks about in this book is how silly this sort of is uh not silly in that it's not useful obviously it's been useful for a whole lot of things uh but the idea that there's now part of the dynamic and i think it's a feature not a bug is conflict within tribes because this is sort of how we do our work and again i think you can see this in the protestant reformation martin luther sets out to reformed to reform the church that he loves and what takes place is a horrendous conflict which will lead to war and bloodshed and all sorts of suffering and you know the roman catholic church wants to burn luther as a stake as a heretics just like it did to jan hus okay in the end did luther reform the church yes strange way through the council of trent mission accomplished did luther did luther reform monasticism yes strange pathway this is how history works this is the pattern this is the pattern you know like a a law of gravity implies like there's a municipal physics court where if you know somebody will write you a ticket if you violate the law of gravity or something like that you know it's a metaphor and it's kind of a it's kind of a funny metaphor if you think about it for very long so the medieval model is different from this and he and this is key because what on earth is jonathan peugeot doing jonathan peugeot is sort of picking things up at the medieval model having passed through the protestant reformation and saying i think we need to go back and look at all these things but now again what peugeot is doing and what peterson is doing and what i'm doing and what roland is doing and what andrea is doing and what probably all of us are doing is we're picking up the project and we're saying we're going to use the tools of modernity but we have to figure out how to do this together so that's what we're doing he lays this out in primarily four works or four four authors calcidius macrobius pseudo dionysius or saint dionysius the areopagite depending on what you want to call them and then boletheus so these are the four authors of what four authors of what he calls the seminal period and basically these four authors together the intellectual mystical life built around the writings of these four authors really shapes the thinking of the middle ages and it shapes the way that the people time period sorry of these four authors they were it was the early medieval or even let's say let's say within the first five to six hundred years ad okay yeah um as far as like the like for instance the dionysian corpus um most people see that question that andrew just asked that is such an important question and of course what we too often do on youtube is we just sit here and you know i wonder when they were i'm not going to ask that because then then i'm not going to look very learned but she asked the question that's what makes her good at this people most scholars would say now it was written around uh the 500s but there are some people uh some people who would take a more conservative view there's actually much older than that but in any case it's certainly it's certainly a tradition that uh let's say solidifies around the 500s something like that so um and so basically these the works of these authors create a way of thinking about and interacting with the world that thinks of a world that's not held together by laws but a world that is held together by love right right now again be careful with that word love because see this is where the church and pastors are so important because what i have in my mind when you use that word are all of the people that assemble back here in this room and all the people i talk to because what he's thinking about as love what someone in late antiquity is thinking about as love what some guy if i grab him off the street and start talking about him as love oh a lot different stuff going on there baby why do rocks fall down when you drop them because they're trying to get back to earth right everything's sort of drawn uh chaucer's phrase for this is kindly inclining in other words moving towards the thing that you that is your kind right everything's trying to get sort of back to its now now right there a bunch of you are going to jump up and say hey wait a minute we've got the elements in there and rock falls to earth because it wants to be reunited with its kind that's not true that's that's rock falls to earth because of gravity okay explain gravity to me you might be you might have a really wonderful model for gravity but i don't know that you can explain it to me maybe because of my own dense nature but this is the issue to its origin point and so boethius then says and chaucer following him uh that because the soul comes from god the soul is made to make the ascent to god now if you say that to people well suddenly we're gonna get gnostic here that's probably where a lot of christians are going to go and so there's a lot going on here but again language is important right so this idea that everything's sort of trying to get back to its origin point um so it's a way of thinking about the world as being held together drawn together by not by law but by love and this makes it possible for somebody for instance like dante who is sort of the let's say the endpoint of the great medieval synthesis post dante things start to fall apart it's not really dante's fault it's just like he's a he's a convenient dividing line let's say okay uh now it's very interesting because things start to fall apart what is that going to mean in what way do they fall apart what do you mean by things start to fall apart and it's tough to put your finger on but it's a whole lot of discomfort um and uh so that makes it possible for dante when dante is talking about sin in purgatorio uh he he talks he gets he actually gives us two different views on sin in the divine comedy there's the view on sin that we get in inferno and then in purgatorio the view the view of sin that we get is that is that there are um um there are sins which are caused by a lack of love there are sins which and then there are sins which are caused by an excess of love in other words loving the loving good things to like more than they deserve right so this goes back to the idea um that um this is an aerostatal saint augustin talks about this the idea of the ordo amoris the ordering of the affections the ordering of the loves so the idea would be that you uh you can love uh food is a good example right um it's not wrong to love food right god god gave us food food is good it's not wrong to love food but if you love food too much then it becomes the sin of gluttony right gluttony has its own sort of natural consequences but the from the medieval perspective you wouldn't say oh don't eat too much or you'll become obese and get diabetes they would say i mean that might happen you know probably will yeah but what they would say is don't eat too much because you will deaden your soul to god there's an example of language which doesn't seem to work doesn't it and and so now what happened with gluttony in terms of well natural law means that if you love food too much you get fat and get diabetes well some people get fat and diabetes some people can eat everything they want they don't gain a pound oh but then there are now you see so what did we go into in the modern period a whole lot of mediation well what are those structures of mediation well it's really god number one but we didn't recognize that as god and actually again i like my metaphor that i used with rationality rules uh video where think about a puzzle on a table the god of the gaps well the gap is you're seeing through the table well where do the pieces come from the pieces come up from god right so that the more important thing the more thing yeah yeah so i mean um you know for instance uh saint seraphim of sarab now this is going east a little bit which uh i'm going to try not to do so much until until the end and in a little bit i'd like to talk about the the things that c.s luix gets wrong about the middle ages because i think that would be a fun conversation yeah i'm curious yeah we'll come back to that but um but saint seraphim of sarab who's a russian ascetic and mystic um he says it is impossible to comprehend the mysteries of god on a full stomach right which is a which is you know could seem like an extreme thing to say to a lot of people he is an ascetic so he is an ascetic yeah yeah but also i mean there's you know when we talk about comprehending the mysteries in the orthodox church we mean you know we mean eating you know so you know it's it's it's like oh we are bumping up into language hard right now the mystery right is communion it's the eucharist and so right so we go we go fasting to the mystery uh which is a nice phrase from lewis actually um so so anyway all that to say they would say don't eat too much not because you might get diabetes but they'll say don't eat too much because if you start turning your heart towards earthly pleasures um and that love for those earthly pleasures becomes disordered now you can already feel the tension this dude used to be a baptist minister and he's traveled a long ways from those days because you use this language in a baptist church how far is that going to go all this translating that has to happen because all this language is situated and james k smith has these liturgies and they're sort of liturgies of the ordinary and the vast majority of people are are embedded in these liturgies a little bit later in this video he'll talk about you know going to church daily and and and this is a little bit of a and this is where you know there there is in a sense with a lot of these conversations and i see it all the time in religious communities and it's completely understandable if only we could get back to the reformational period and so protestant scholars you know will study luther and calvin and meadow simons and you know lights of the reformational period you know obsessively and if we could only get back to geneva calvin's geneva or zwingli zurich or and you know sometimes we could only get back to the middle ages if we could only get back to the you know the renaissance in terms of if we could only get back to the classical periods where they where they carve the sculptures that we are digging up and and giving all of our attention to okay if we can only get back to the early church um you know bill heidel um bill ezekian willow creek we we want to have you know what what willow creek wanted to have was a new testament church in the northern suburbs of chicago and of course the orthodox weighed in say we look the closest like the new testament church maybe and you know there's some evidence for that but and now we're in the middle of it so natural law god number one god number two pattern pattern pattern pattern how can we put this stuff together all right i don't want to spoil this video because andrea can use the hits but i want to jump out to the end of it because i think he what he lays down here is is sort of a nice um a nice illustration of what i agree with you you're really trying to get to in terms of natural law and what i think in many ways jordan peterson is trying to get at in terms of the god even though jordan peterson is really stuck between god number one and god number two and i think the example that richard roland gives right here is really terrific um as far as what i think is coming next well as far as is it similar in the sense of like we like things ordered in the scientific space but then everyone everyone everyone like really done because it's just everything likes things order okay so let me give you two different pictures of order right okay um let's say that i i cut a branch off of a tree okay and i set that branch down on the table is that is that is that branch ordered like are the leaves ordered on that branch i mean i i yes they're they're in the place they grew into right they're in their proper place and and nature is is like fairly like on its own usually pretty beautiful right like if you don't monkey with it um so so if i if i take a branch and cut it off a tree and you know and i look at that branch i put it on the table of course the branch you know even just if you don't monkey with it what do we mean by that word so we have this idea that what a monkey does is but that's probably a monkey in a room of ours what do monkeys do out in branches and trees well they don't disrupt nature what do we mean by nature why even today do we still have this idea of natural global warming versus man-made global warming why do people go all over the place for natural food or organic food so again i i'm not saying that these words i think law is actually the most problematic of the two but i think nature is is deeply compromised because it's connected to all sorts of other things okay back to this really terrific illustration branches pretty beautiful right like and and nature is is like fairly like on its own usually pretty beautiful right like if you don't monkey with it so if i if i take a branch and cut it off a tree and you know and i look at that branch i put it on the table of course the branch is out of place but for my for my illustration it has to be on a table okay so i look at that branch and i look at that branch and i can see every leaf on this branch is in its proper place right so that's so we could say this this branch is ordered now if i straight so that's so we could say this this branch is ordered now if i strip every leaf off of that tree and i sort those leaves according to size shape and color and then i cut up that branch into twigs and i sort the the twigs according to length and thickness and i lay all that on the table is that ordered it's our modern version of ordered yeah it's very organized right so i've put everything in a place based on a category that i forced upon it but it's no longer a branch okay so that's the difference so so that is the like we like it ordered the same as the medievals like it liked it ordered but our versions of ordered is exceedingly different so natural law and ordered which is a better word how does natural law fit in with his branch illustration and i think actually his ordered illustration is better but this to me is an example of this is good teaching and it really works much better yes yeah so everyone wants to order things right but you can order things like in a in a natural way and that's what the whole idea of being a things in a natural way yet a storm comes through and branches are ripped down and we say well that's disordered the storm has disordered the tree here in northern california we might have a very bad fire season this year and how is that going to well what would be a very bad fire season mean it would mean that these you know many many square miles of beautiful forests that are surrounding this this bowl in which i live which is the central valley will burn because we've had a dry year and biologists will tell you that fire is a natural part of this ecosystem okay so is it ordered that these trees burn and our cloud our skies fill with smoke and then others will say well it's this this year of drought is part of it and i don't want to get into that whole thing but it gets very complicated okay where is natural law in this and and so i think you know this is part of my i'm going to let the tomists be the tomists i'm going to let let the natural law folks be the natural law and i completely understand why my god number one aligns up with natural law and why i think the god number one business is in fact the thing to point a light to in terms of the question of why jordan peterson is having the effect that he's having because what he is reintroducing to the west is god number one and the strange line where that jordan peterson seems to be hung up on is god number two and so he acts as if god is personal he sits at the edge of his bed and he prays and sam harris doesn't know either where that answer comes from where that answer comes from kindly inclining right in other words that's what the whole idea of being of things kindly inclining right in other words remember he just said that he says i prefer that language kindly inclining and i would suspect that many would too because the kindly incline is that something better expresses the spirit of finesse and a relational a relational posture all that nuance in that language which natural law is rather tyrannical things are doing what their nature makes them to do and they're they're they're you know being drawn together by love right that's one way of ordering i think that language will sell your world and if you try to order your life that way then what you will find is you'll fall into a certain kind of relationship with your husband a certain kind of relationship with your children a certain kind of relationship with god and the people around you and it'll be lovely and it'll be beautiful it won't be perfect because you're going to get things wrong but even when you get things wrong there's a there's an orderly way to fix them right but the other thing the old order chaos that's jordan peterson stuff that's working that's gaining traction with people you could do is to try to take some outside order that is not in accordance with your nature you know as a as a as a human being now your nature see again i think i think law is stuff is so hard as a woman as andrea um um if i was going to manchester den has a bunch of great characters in his books in his fiction that that that are good examples of this right uh but let's say let's say that i um i decide i'm going to live my life totally according to scientific principles right and i'm gonna just scientific principles well there's language that comes from someplace i'm gonna data monitor every aspect of my life and then i'm going to so i can find out like what's the optimum temperature for my coffee in the morning and what's interesting is that in many ways scientific principles is sort of the updating of application of natural law because natural law and science well they line up one place principles well that's the action that we live by and what's the optimal you know food pairings so that i have the right amount of energy and libido and uh you know and like i i fall asleep at the right time and don't get like and and just like order and and like hyper measure every one of these things and and and basically say basically say so an ideal human life is hitting these statistical averages so i'm going to make sure that all my measurements are within those statistical averages is that natural law natural law scientific principles right well it might work for a while but two things would end up happening one is that i would end up getting uh just totally burned out because you can't give that much attention to every part of your life right in fact it's wrong to give that much attention to every part of your life you really shouldn't give as much attention to your food as you give to your prayer if you do then your life is disordered right um you know ah but prayer now we're coming into god number two here you know so so one is one is i'm gonna i'm gonna burn out because i'm just giving too much attention to everything right and the other thing that's gonna happen is that other people are gonna look at me and be like actually richard's not a normal person like you shouldn't live like this because because normal norm well there's law there's there's a law but if you use normal and use law people hear it differently that's what they're going to see is like i'm so because i'm because my my attention is all going to be in the wrong place and and i'm going to i'm going to stop living according to love and now i'm i'm living according to trying to hit this hypothetical perfect statistical life right okay this is this is like on a micro scale that's what we're trying to do in our society right now um right but then there's things coming back that like you you kind of alluded to it so now we're kind of turning back and things things are margins are pushing into the center in ways that might not be the best but what do you do when you push them away and try to pretend like they don't exist and there's all these different versions of things happening outside of the order that that our parents and grandparents thought existed in society now parents and grandparents are really important to us because they're the ones that we remember they're the ones that we have a picture of that mapped onto us pretty directly but in terms of a sample of the the spans of time by which these things are being processed they're a very small sample so the things are coming back so can you are our parts of the medieval model coming back i guess is really that's how i'll form it in a question rather than a statement yeah um what i would say is that christ is always new but never novel um that's a great way to say it so christ has this capacity in his story in his person to renew everything like to constantly make things new right he has a way to integrate paganism right but he also has a he has a way to integrate the good things about modernism uh but he also has a he has a way to integrate the good things about modernism so as we as we start so again i don't have a beef with natural law i think in fact jordan peterson's god and the god that he is bringing back into the realm is a rebalancing of what has been imbalanced for a time which is why his conversations with sam harris was so important and that moment that happens about three quarters of the way into the conversation where sam harris finally says well tell me what you mean by god that jordan peterson takes god number one sort of to the limits of god number one natural law sorted to the limits of natural law and at some point you want to know is there a lawgiver because the law is a category of complexity lower significantly lower than the lawgiver and the the law given at sinai is an expression of the same god now i'm showing myself to be a calvinist and not a lutheran is an expression of the same god when the spirit comes and now the spirit enables the believers to fulfill the law and again i was dealing with my men's group last night we're in the sermon on the mount it's a tremendously complex thing to wrestle with and and so this is natural law fine but it's about the lawgiver and and the the lawgiver that the the author that gives us the arena and then the arena itself is agentic in many ways but then he goes forward to place himself within the arena and bang that's why christ fills it up as pageau says from top to bottom that's why christ as as as abram kiper says says there's not one square inch here that i can't claim that's why christ separates sheeps and goats that's why i mean that's why christ and why christ is worshiped as god not as a god although no as god that's why this works that's why we're seeing what's happening happening and again i i have no i i don't want to i don't want to spend my time fighting about natural law because that's sort of an intramural christian thing just like i don't want to spend my time fighting about you know re fighting the calvinist arminian feud i think that's a i think that's an agent arena fight that we're not going to resolve just you know here we've got romans 9 through 11 here we've got the beginning of ephesians here we have joseph saying you meant it for evil but god meant it for good you know i'm not as interested in fighting those i'm interested in the frontier of where we're at now and finding new language and new formulations and and and continuing the very long project of what we've been at all along and so i don't think it's a mystery that the orthodox come and say you know we had a bunch of stuff buried in the basement and i think this stuff might help people looking around saying you know it that might be of some help but i'm still yeah because we've all got our internal mappings all set and so what we're doing is a and again i count the atheists in the west as protestants that's why i put them in into his team protestant and and so when when sam harris looks at jordan peterson and says that's not god well that's because sam harris only recognizes god number two and jordan peterson has discovered the god number one but is still a little reluctant about god number two but this christ figure is interesting and a peugeot is pushing at him so to me that's that's why all this and and tom holland is finding you know god through history and and so yeah natural law go ahead and use that language but i don't know that the formulation will work with ordinary people now so that's why i'm looking at other words so i again i hope i hope bionic mosquito i wasn't i hope i was kind because again i i think there's a ton of use in thomas and natural law and you know he's quoting chesterton i mean talk about talk about teen catholic i've read what chesterton writes about calvinists and richard rollin will make a comment he's he seems to be a nice calvinist but um you know i'll go back to lewis's mere christianity and the orthodox and the catholics and the calvinists and um you know we're on team christian and now we've got you know monster sam in the estuary who's who's who's saying well what about that trinity now you can ban him from the estuary they will have you must be trinitarians what's that going to do with the atheists you know they don't believe you know neil planning his definition of a unitarian was they believe in one god at most now sam is a he's a crunchy unitarian let's say but this is what we're doing here and so and i i realize all the various different tribes it's just natural of your tribe is that as is you're so passionate about your tribe that we want everyone around and you know that's a part of the jordan peterson dynamic we get excited when he seems to say things that our tribes have said we feel validation that's just how human beings are wired together it's how we're always working on our mutual maps but i think you know i think this is the moment that we're at and so order some of these words are are showing traction and like i said i'm i'm interested in like freddy said reel them in so anyway go ahead and push back i love it that's what an estuary is for thanks for watching leave a comment
