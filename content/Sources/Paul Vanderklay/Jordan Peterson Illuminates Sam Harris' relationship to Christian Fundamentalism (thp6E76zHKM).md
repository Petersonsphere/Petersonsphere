 Hi, this is Paul and I know I said what I said yesterday about going on vacation and I was only gonna do rough draft for Sunday, but Here's the thing and what I said about patreon. I mean the truth is I pay to do this stuff I mean I buy the equipment and if only one person watched this it would be it would be good enough for me to do it because I was listening to the this morning I was listening to the Dublin talk the bootleg version of the Dublin talk that you can find on YouTube and I I just can't help myself. I've got to make a video. I've got to talk about this because I've just got to talk about this. So the Dublin talk reality representation and revelation so about 30 or so minutes into this 30 35 minutes Sam Harris brings up Don Hoffman and those of you have been watching my channel for a while know that I've spoken quite a bit about Don Hoffman and If you look at Don Hoffman's TED talk, you'll see where he talks about the fact that evolution in terms of evolution he asserts that we We have tricks and hacks. We don't actually engage with reality itself and that Evolution does not actually adapt for truth It adapts for survival and this in in some ways Undercuts the entire argument of de la hunty and Harris and many others who have said evolution gives us adaptation for reality for truth and therefore we can get from from facts to values and we can get from Facts, you know, this is this in a sense bulwarks their argument and Don Hoffman really kicks the legs From under it and Sam Harris brings this up in the talk Which right away really got my attention and I know a number of you are very much hoping that Jordan Peterson will have a conversation with Don Hoffman and I'd like to see that too But now what was interesting is how Sam Harris seemed to interpret it again. I don't want to be I Don't want to set up a straw man here, but what I heard sounded something like this He gets Don Hoffman right and that tricks and hacks outperform truth Does he get Don Hoffman wrong in assuming that now through science we see truth I'm not sure that's what Don Hoffman is saying Maybe he is but I would take it a step further and challenge if Don Hoffman is saying that I would challenge him on that Because I think the takeaway from what Don Hoffman Says is that what we deal with as human beings are What we do is we create functional representations and models and schemas and narratives and tools that engage with reality I'm not saying reality isn't there. I'm not saying that We don't interact with reality What I am saying is that our capacity to colonize or govern reality is always limited By us that's the heart of this video and that's the heart of what I'm going to be Pulling out in this video and I'm going to connect it to Revelation which is of course what Sam Harris is allergic to Now what's interesting is that You know, I mentioned this Neil deGrasse Tyson video yet yesterday in the little vacation video I did which obviously is I'm still doing videos and a number of you very kindly said yeah Don't make videos on your vacation if I make videos on my vacation The only way I'll make it is if I don't violate my vacation because again the truth of all of this stuff Is that this is just fun for me. I Again if probably if no one watched this I would still I would still do these videos just because Doing the videos for me has been so helpful In articulating it sounds it would be a little crazy for me to sit in my office and talk to no one Which is why I started my blog back years ago Because even if nobody read it at least I would have it would be it's Jordan Peterson religion It would be as if someone would read this and so I make my videos as if someone will watch this and The truth is I listen to this stuff all the time I'm very interested in it and when I go on vacation I will continue to listen to this stuff. I will continue to think about this stuff and if if I can do it in a way that doesn't tick off my wife or Violate family time. I'll make a video just because Once I get this on my mind I know well enough that I need to make a video soon Otherwise, I lose it and move on and so for me making a video is Basically putting a stake in the ground and saying go ahead and make a video And then I can go back to it and refer to it later, which is again why I started blogging But it but if you listen to how Tyson starts this video, it was very interesting now remember, okay question is people there's He heard something he talked about God on CBS television and he's had he's thinking about near-death experiences And he wonders whether these deep mysteries are And again, this is Robert Crowe, which I'm going to refer to him a little bit later with radio labs And I see that radio lab podcast now has stuff on YouTube too So you can go back and listen to some of these really excellent radio lab programs on YouTube interesting to you okay, so One of the things we know from research and psychology as well as just Practical matters in the community Of scientific experiments is that one of the lowest forms of evidence you could possibly invoke Is eyewitness testimony? Which is odd because it's one of the highest forms of evidence in the court of law which disturbs me greatly Okay. Now we need to pause here because what he said is true but what I often find people fail to realize is how eyewitness testimony and eyewitness perception Is a fundamental building block for everything else? He's about to talk about so pay attention to this as he begins to develop a chain of rationality So if you cut if you come from a lab to assign a Science conference and say this is true. We say how do you know this because I saw it Everyone who goes to a science conference from a lab says this is true Because I saw it but now there's another step that they take that keeps them from getting the reaction He's about to mention. Well, that's really the end of your talk and you just leave And then we say come back when you have a science conference Recorder or you have to just give me something that does not have to flow through your senses Right and wrong because The chart recorder will flow through all of the senses of the people there. In other words, this story Should not dismiss the reliability Of people there. So if you're going to go to a science conference Should not dismiss the reliability Of testimony what it does is it reinforces the reliability of replication Duplication and multiple witnesses because every single scientist that might say oh you saw it But then they then see it but they then can duplicate it all of that is built upon Eyewitness first-person testimony. So you're not really Discrediting eyewitness first-person testimony. What you're saying is that there is a limitation to that now C.S. Lewis talks about this a fair amount In a lot of his books and lie in the witch in the wardrobe For example, lucy goes into the wardrobe and she comes back and she comes back with a story That says I went through the wardrobe and I went into a wood and I found a fawn named mr Tumnus and I had a lovely tea with him and then it came back through the wardrobe and time didn't really seem to move very much in our world And and then lucy tells her brothers and sisters about this and her brothers and sisters scoff at her And then they go tell the old professor whose house they are living in during the blitz of london And the professor to the shock of Of the oldest brother, why can't I remember his name? Gosh, I must be going senile already. Um edmund and peter peter, of course The professor says to peter well What do you know of your sister? And he says well, my sister is very reliable. It's not my sister's way to lie It's not my sister's way to make up stories And then the professor says well, then maybe you should believe her now you qualify this because there are other There are other possibilities that lucy was dreaming or lucy was deceived. But here's the difficulty that Lucy knows when she's dreaming even as a child and lucy There would be other signs that lucy is deceived a certain amount of skepticism with respect to another world on the other side of The wardrobe is warranted Yet first-person testimony is valued in court. Why? Because it is not completely unreliable nor And often it isn't the only kind of testimony available It is the only kind of evidence available because history is a certain way now Maybe i'll jump back in and and we'll see where neil degrasse tyson goes with this I don't remember the next line necessarily because your senses is some of the worst data taking devices that exist Okay, and this is an this is an um You know, this is someone who works in astronomy who looks through telescopes who uses his senses all the time Who is using his senses right now and he is not in any way denying his senses So in other words that sentence is true But that sentence has to be understood within a much larger context and what I think happens when we hear people Frame it this way and I hear this all the time being framed this way Is is that they are not taking into account how often they simply rely on their senses and when we get into Sam harris or phenomenology we talk about Consciousness as being the one thing we cannot doubt so i'll take Neil degrasse tyson's point to a point But let's just realize that this is in fact All that we are assuming. Oh my wife is calling. I always answer when my wife calls. So hold on so so what we might say about first witness testimony is that it lines up in a hierarchy of evidence or a hierarchy of See i'm working towards a hierarchy of reality at some point but a hierarchy of evidence that We we understand first person testimony and we understand it contextually But we ought not to so quickly and easily dismiss it Because after all all of us live with this all the time and depend on it for our very lives Reproduce almost all the time. So on one hand to say There's a degree of skepticism that we can bring to first person testimony and i'm totally there and I completely agree And we understand that in the what's called a game of science We ask Scientists within the realm of what they are doing to be able to reproduce things but But Now, let's see, let's let's maybe be done with this and let's go back to the slides but We never avoid first person testimony we we use it every day all the time when you drive Okay, you place your life in your own hands behind the steering wheel And the same function that you have just denigrated is the function that you are relying on to get you from point a to point b Safely, and if it were so unreliable You wouldn't trust it in order to drive but you drive and it's the same thing when you get on an air airliner You trust the first person testimony of the pilot To take you at 600 miles per hour through the air And you trust the first person testimony of all the air traffic controllers and you trust the first person testimony of the mechanics who? Who maintain the aircraft so His the point he makes at the beginning is a valid point But it has to be understood within context and what we're really talking about here are our multiple witnesses as hedge against bias And we're talking about reproducibility And and with that we contextualize and locate what we call science and technology And we're going to talk quite a bit more about that in this video as we progress A lot if not most of what is important History, for example past events is not reproducible Okay, let that sink in So this is why First person testimony is so valued in a court of law because most of what courts deal with Is history and most of the time there That's all they have to deal with but you say but sometimes there's other evidence Okay But now we're going to get into this later in this video, too all of the evidence That we have is apprehended by us via first person testimony now, maybe multiple people can do it And that adds credence to it But again first person testimony of the jury seeing the evidence The jury listening to the lawyer that's all first person testimony. This is in fact What we all commonly live our lives in and on and trust our lives, too And so even when there is material evidence What the lawyers do? Is the lawyers? Interpret the evidence this gets into the next point that all of these facts out there In order for them to have meaning in order for them to be evaluated In order for us to get this imaginary picture about what happened in the past All of this requires interpretation these This evidence in a court case Is not real to the jury without interpretation and we understand this which is why we have lawyers and why we have multiple jurors Deciding something and they and we have a very high standard in our country where they all have to agree on a guilty verdict If the person is to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, okay so Again, neil degrasse tyson starts his talk this way But there's I think we ought to pause which is exactly what i'm doing and say true but And this is where we get into the the philosopher's armchair versus as thomas reed um A video I mentioned quite a while ago Thomas reed the armchair philosopher that has all the skepticism about the world and the same philosopher when he goes into the marketplace And and thomas reed mentions that if that philosopher used the same standard in the marketplace as he does from his armchair His friends would take possession of him and probably haven't committed And this is something to keep in mind with a conversation like this Now cs lewis actually gets into this in his book on miracles and I think quite well You see the probability argument is limited has limited value when applying to history because Most of history is unique history is a near infinite number of aspects We could write about the history of my office for the last 21 years And it would be a rather dull history But all of the books have changed dust has accumulated my wife has been scolding me for my appearance on my videos and the amount of dust in my office and So she says, you know if you if you don't want people to think you're a crazy man Maybe you shouldn't look like a crazy man so point taken honey But the probability argument has limited value in applying to history because by definition most of history has only happened once Because it's contextualized within a near infinite Context of variables that cannot be reproduced nor can they be known And so what we're always trying to do is sift through the variables variables to find which variables are pertinent with respect to truth And if you listen to everything that jordan peterson has been working on and if you'll say listen to verkike who talks to Jonathan peugeot and he's got some of his own lectures out there verkike's working on this question of interest because now we're going to get into rationality in terms of rationality a function of the The conscious part of the brain or rationality is a function of the rest of the brain What interest does is that our brains and jordan peterson will say 3.5 million years have been attuned? To be interested in that which is pertinent for survival So if something comes whizzing after my head my conscious mind My conscious mind My brain doesn't even give my conscious mind first take at this and tells me to duck or to flinch And we used to play this college used to play this flinching game in college and we'd be playing with With each other the the whole time with these mechanisms in our brains And so so the conscious brain the elephant you know doesn't really this is this is where the jonathan hite stuff comes into play because basically what jonathan hite is saying is that the conscious brain looks or that the unconscious brain looks at the conscious brain as a Someone that's not entirely trustworthy Someone that's not entirely trustworthy with respect to the facts needed for survival and and this is probably part of the reason in don hoffman's scheme that it is You know, it is not truth. It's not our conscious brain That is adapted to survival. It is the elephant and the elephant is in some ways way smarter than the conscious brain now Bear in mind as mcgillquist notes This rationality that sam harris is talking about This is this is a function of the conscious brain and when when sam harris and matt delahunty talk about reason this this Fine tool that we're going to use to construct to to reconstruct this this utopian world this perfect ability of humanity By reason that's only residing in the conscious brain and the rest of the brain has been keeping us alive And in fact the rest of the brain will say i'm not gonna let you Mr conscious brain Keep the heart beating or or look out for flying objects or in many cases even drive Okay, because what we do when we learn to drive is we the conscious brain works really hard and the elephant watches the conscious brain And kind of picks it up and says oh, yeah, I can manage this the the elephant has a massively parallel capacity for processing information and the conscious brain has a particularly limited singular Focal capacity for processing information and that's why the elephant says to the conscious brain Yeah, you know, I like keeping keeping you around you you're you're helping me in some ways But for the most part, I don't really trust you and this is the this is the reason that the the one guy the objectivist You know was so the why what he said to jordan peterson about his perception of who he was was in my opinion so Completely naive and remember i'm not a psychologist. I'm a pastor I just watch people for a living and I listen to them and I I hear them talk about morality in their lives and all of this and I listen and I think you're not in control of yourself And I have this very often when someone will come to my church and they'll say pastor I just loved your sermon. I'm going to come to this church every week And almost everyone who says that They'll never be there the next week. Why? because They don't know themselves well enough to know That there's a whole lot more variables that are controlling them Than the intentionality and desire that they are experiencing in their little conscious self at that moment so Cs lewis makes the point in in miracles That these probability arguments really don't work very well with history and we see this played out in our jurisprudence There are too many factors context for reproduction and you can't rewind the tape so your analysis of probability Is based on your experience now again when you hear people say well miracles can't happen because Science has disproved them. We'll see us lewis walks through that so science has proven none of the none of the sort if let's say we took a 49er from the gold fields of california in 1849 or 1850 and plopped them into 2018 san francisco and first of all they they might die of shock But then they would say yeah, I was just in new york this morning that 49er would say liar No one can be in new york in the morning and eat dinner in san francisco at night That's impossible that violates science Well, you might say well, yeah and not too many years they're going to be able to make the trip not in three months but in two weeks via train and that two week Number will continue to go down and down and down and pretty soon they'll be able to make it by car and in a few days and they'll be able to make it by airplane in a few hours, but The 49er knows nothing of this and and so when we say miracles never happened Well, you don't know that miracles never happened. You're just Hypothesizing from your own bias and in fact all of your probability Estimates are based on your experience and The assumptions of the bubble of the group you're living in That's what it is That's really what it is and and those people who are more honest will fess up to that and those people who are more naive or less honest will will basically Fight you on it. So so what is don hoffman's insight really? Well, this is the same point neil degrasse tyson is making we are limited by the tools that we as humans have developed Science and technology try to extend our tools. And if you listen to the whole miguel christ lecture, you'll notice that He really takes a swipe at this idea this metaphor That we are machines now again one of the things that's that's golden in that video This is the last video I did referencing that miguel christ video on vimeo We like to use metaphors because the only way we can understand Is by metaphor we are associating one thing to another so there's a thing we have a great deal of Tactile physical three-dimensional four-dimensional world experience in and to the degree that we take Something else which we cannot perceive directly and again c.s. Lewis goes into all of this too Take take something indirectly We have to map it onto this world of experience this tactile physical world And so c.s. Lewis makes the point that okay, you don't believe in an old man in the sky Well, then you say well the force and what c.s. Lewis says is well, you've just turned god from being a more anthropocentric Anthropo Anthropocene you know what I mean into Now he's like a liquid now. He's like a gas Now he's like an electrical charge. And so when you watch star wars and you say oh, that's much more of an enlightened approach It's not more enlightened. You've just swapped metaphors. Well, I want to see god without metaphors You're not going to be able to talk about him You might have this memory of an experience in your mind But you're not going to be able to convey that to anyone else why and this is where peterson gets it dead right in that objectivist video because what narrative does and what story does is take this immensely Complicated world governed by our interest and again peterson in the eighth video shows you how you know that doesn't You know how in how interest in what we're looking for shapes what we see so it takes this immensely complicated world governed by interest boils it down into a story well, why a story because That is how we experience life. Remember my videos where I've talked about I am in many ways more a story than this Physical object in some ways via the fourth dimension Because my story is going through time in a way that my body is not my body is going through time But it's it was small and it's growing larger and larger and larger now it's going older and older and older and my hair is abandoning me and And I have to see the doctor regularly whereas I could avoid the doctor for years and I was young and my body is decaying But my story which is not subject to decay it may be subject to memory loss But it's not subject to decay in the same way my body is now we're getting to a little bit of platanism it My story continues and of course christianity Says well stories heaven and earth can pass away But well, but what well it depends if if someone can know that story and someone can recreate that story and someone can Interact with that story and this isn't actually very far from some of what the greeks thought about story. But anyway This is what we are and and we are limited by our tools to apprehend the physical world, but in order to In order to engage with this world. We have to use our tools. And so in a sense this reality about story is connected with don hoffman's observation because We can only interact and engage with the world's world with the tools we have which is why Story is so potent and powerful in putting this together. We can only see the world with the eyes We've got now pay attention The world see and eyes are all in a certain degree metaphorical because we use that metaphorical to talk about Something quite larger and via narrative and story and language I am able to communicate with you this with you and I trust if you're still watching this video You are having the experience of meaning as you are listening to me. And so we're putting all of this together. Okay, and but still What we're doing is apprehending it and it has to be Apprehended by this structure and in our case the structure is narrative So it's it's being apprehended by this narrative structure and we're putting it together And this is how we're able to function with each other in the world. We're able to create community We're able to understand one another we're able to cooperate as well as compete as mcgill crissette On and on and on and on and on and on and on this is how we work in the world I'm gonna pause and take a drink You might say now okay, but with science we see directly Really what makes you think so? Isn't science just an extension? We're just adding we're Okay, so science is a tool And via science we can see things we can't see with our naked eye like a microscope like a telescope We're extending our sight But again to get back to the beginning of neil degrasse tyson's we're not eliminating sight from the chain We're not eliminating first-person testimony from the chain We are not leaving it by itself for the sake of certain conversations and certain games that we play together But we are not eliminating from the chain. In fact, I don't think we will ever eliminate it from the chain It is it is simply too close to Who we are and how we are made? All right So and these are the two things that we say well I'd say we still see through our eyes, but we have the paradigm that we're seeing through So not only are the science give us tools with which to see but science and philosophy offer us paradigms And so these are Are they facts? This is a big debate in that talk between peterson and harris are our paradigms facts And I would say if sam harris says yes, then he's fudging on that word Because I wouldn't say a paradigm is a fact i'd say a paradigm is a tool a paradigm is a conceptual tool Through which we as a community have agreed to process certain amounts of data But pay attention to the ways that we apprehend our data as well and we know the ways that data Is also determined by interest. So this gets back to peterson's point There's no pulling this apart to your clean room of amazon boxes untouched by human perception We we don't have access to that. So So, okay, so I think we're going to have to look at the Paradigm Paradigms are our concepts that we see through and read thomas kuhn if you've never read him the the the history of scientific Revolutions, I believe that's the title of the book. I read that book in college. I read that book and it blew my mind It was amazing We see data through eyes, too Now science expands our eyes And offers us paradigms or systems in order to know interact Have knowledge with the world it does this okay? and That's a good thing. That's a wonderful thing. I'm down for science Now the way we hedge skepticism, however, is we say well we can know When we can predict things and there's a lot of truth to that Demonstrating predictability has a high value With us and that's not only true of stock markets. It's not only true of economists. It was also true of Prophets and revelation in the bible and if you read deuteronomy 18 You have the judge of a prophet and it was a little stricter than the judge of an economist because if a prophet Dared so much to predict the future and if the prediction didn't come true you killed the prophet And I never saw how lindsey from the 1980 countdown to armageddon and late great planet earth fame Offering himself up to death for getting his prophecies wrong. So I guess how lindsey for all his biblical literalism Neve Actually applied deuteronomy 18 and i'm sure he had a a lovely theological Justification for saying he shouldn't be killed for failing to predict correctly what he said was based on his biblical revelation We're going to talk about revelation later Now my wife's calling me again, this is the problem with being an impulsive youtuber because I want to just get this sucker done, but I I want to just get this sucker done, but I want to just get this sucker done So Predictability is a powerful thing and we all recognize this religious and irreligious people We know technology we can control and ensure outcomes. There's a lot of truth to that too That's powerful for us. And again the same thing with prophets and miracles if if You know if if the bambino points to a place out there and hits the home run everybody remembers And they don't hit a home run and everybody forgets So, you know, it's about control and it's about predictability and about reliability and the degree to which you can duplicate the outcome And this is in some ways what cs lewis calls colonization or another word we could use for it governance And this hedges our skepticism and this this helps us know that we're not just all completely diluted that we are productively engaging in a reality that is bigger Than ourselves and now again when I talk about this hierarchy of reality as i'm continuing to develop that scheme or that language to talk about it The grand canyon is older than I am and so The one way of talking about it is the grand canyon is more real But our capacity to destroy the grand canyon with earth movers and dynamite and nuclear weapons Might say that in another way our powers are more real than the grand canyon and this isn't exactly jordan peterson's truth in terms of Of existence this is a different way of talking about reality And we're already into that when we say well, we're this is metaphorical truth or metaphorical reality I think we are the the tools we're bringing to that conversation are not particularly good And so part of what i'm trying to work through is our better language to figure that out So predictability and the ability to ensure or control outcomes is powerful and This gets into miracles for example when Joseph knew very well how babies were made which is why he sought to divorce or when mary comes up pregnant and then an angel shows Up and tells him so on and so forth. It isn't the case that Everybody in in the olden days just thought miracles happened all the time. No The point of miracles and the point of being excited enough to write them down and assert them At the risk of your own credibility notice thomas who is known for doubting is that You actually believe them now again One people are a group of people actually believing something doesn't mean it happened but it is evidence and it is something that we take into account and Here we have this strange case of human beings where we all ourselves sort of judge Ourselves, okay Now we have a big reality and we are limited people Is what we are doing that different from pre-science adaptations or what we are doing that different from what don Hoffman is trying to get at through his studies. We've expanded our ways to see We've expanded our tools to use both physical tools and conceptual tools and we are always What we are doing now with these conversations is we are testing these tools We are working on these tools. We are trying to get better at our tools It is not hopefully just an ego game Although ego is part of it because we're in these hierarchies and these hierarchies are governed governing You know for all we know there may be people out there who know way More and are way smarter and are way more articulate than jordan peterson and sam harris And and their conversation which may even be happening could be way more Illuminating than the conversations with jordan peterson and sam harris, but we don't know about them because they're not on a hierarchy Okay, and that's where all of this stuff is incredibly huge And and we don't know it all but we're expanding our tools to use it We have no reason to believe that all of this isn't just more tricks and hacks And that we're seeing Base reality as elon musk calls it We don't know that we're still limited By our tools and our capacity to see And I think actually in in tyson's video he illustrates some reason to assume the world is larger and stranger than Some of our conversations dare to admit And and this is where pragmatism is helpful because it says The stuff we're using is good enough to get the outcomes and peterson in that video will in that in that the recording of it We'll say the axe only need to be as sharp as to cut down the tree. You don't need a surgical scalpel To cut down a tree. In fact, there are many cases in which something could be too sharp And so it's good enough. It's close enough. It'll get the job done and that's a reality we live with and if we scale that out We could say probably everything we're using is like that But that's also the reason for the frontiers of our knowledge and the gaps of our control And it's also the reason why We can make ice And mix it with water and create stainless steel and I have an insulated water bottle that I buy at costco 28 bucks for two of these good deal and we we can do this very predictably but There's hosts of things namely ourselves That are less predictable and controllable You know, I can more we can more reliably do this than probably any of the designers and Factory workers can control their own behavior when it comes to diet or sex or their tongue That's reality we know that Why? Is that the case? Well? Maybe we're a lot more complicated. Maybe we're further up the reality and again, I I haven't really Cracked the language for this stuff in some ways. We're further up the reality hierarchy than stainless steel And ice and water Is that the case? Yet I rely on them to get me through these hot sacramento summers Well, what about revelation? Oh now it's going to get interesting we've got to keep moving because craig's list is coming craig's list is calling Sam harris shares a type of modernity with certain fundamentalists. I made this point on twitter yesterday When I listen to sam harris, I think about A lot of theology that I read coming up Where people would take the bible and they would break the bible down into propositions and they would say Because the bible is true This is the same game that's how the game goes We know the bible is true because god gives it to us and because the bible is true we can take out these Propositions and principles and we know they are true and we can build those things up Well, this is exactly the same game as san harris, these are bricks these are amazon boxes these are building blocks So we take revelation from above found in the bible and then we break it out into propositions and then we Reconstruct life on those propositions and this is the basis. This is how Theology has been done Since about the time of darwin. Okay now Now I've got to be careful here because Theology has always worked in a way like this But not to this degree and not to this extreme And people have always worked with reality in a way like this But not quite in this way and the reason I nuance this is for this Because since the modernist fundamentalist divide Everyone wants to put you in an either or camp and this is at heart what makes Sam harris nervous about jordan peterson because he's not playing the either or game that sam harris wants to play and that ken ham who built his arc entertainment thing in kennessee and a lot of Oh, this gets tricky because I i'm i'm dealing with I'm dealing with Christian populations where there's a whole range of nuance that we apply to understanding the bible Now the christian reform church in the mid 70s tried to get at this and we used the language And i'm going to use that as my cover here of event character It is not that the bible It is not that the bible does not reveal history We've known for a long time the bible reveals history. The question is how does the bible reveal history and How do our perceptions of history and assumptions about history when they meet the Perceptions and assumptions of how the biblical authors conveyed history How do those two things match up and it's in that moment someone asked me a question about bard ermine It's these conversations that get very complicated because we can't think with the minds of the ancients and we have filters that we Have not actually explored in our own minds and yet we're having to make this connection and it's really hard and there's an unbelievable Where two christian scholars debate the gospel of john on this and they're saying you were too loose. No, I don't think I was and Christians have these kinds of debates christian Interpreters and academics have these kinds of debates all the time because It's very clear if you read enough ancient history that the ancients dealt with history With different filters than we do now and to apply our filters to the ancients just corrupts Just corrupts the conversation and so we spend a lot of time trying to figure out and debating how the ancients dealt with history But we have two problems number one the amount of history that remains from the ancient world is a tiny fraction Of what they actually wrote and number two we don't have that much commentary on the ancients and so this is why Before you go off and yell about history in the bible read some other ancient historians read livi You know look at how read julius caesar look at how the ancients wrote history did they have their biases? Yeah, they were human beings but This is this is what we deal with in biblical interpretation all the time Now what happened in the modernist fundamentalist? divide is that polarization happened and so what happened was that They reduced they tried to reduce the bible to true propositions to complete with to compete with Scientific facts and this pit facts from science against facts from the bible and this then yielded Creation science and set up the modernist excuse me the modernist fundamentalist feud And and so what happened in the 19th and 20th century up until the end of the cold war was that a compromise developed And it was a broad compromise in the the mainline churches. They said basically the bible gives us values science and history gives us facts and and so in some ways now someone sent me a really smart email about You know christopher lash and the age of narcissism and there's a book I really have to read and try to integrate because it's an important book You know this person basically argues that what jordan peterson is trying to do is maintain a certain late stage liberalism And I think that's true. He's he's saying we're we're in a late stage liberalism and it's slipping away And we've got to keep it because this works really well And I think that's a fair reading of what jordan peterson is trying to do and now he's employing he's binging bringing back some older things Dyslexia, ah, I don't want my right my left are always a mess ever since forever But he's he's trying to pull this together And and to preserve this late stage liberalism. He says i'm a classic liberal And so the compromise that said was the bible gives us value and science and history gives us facts and to a degree Jordan peterson who again grew up in the united church of canada, which is a mainline church More towards the left end but he grew up in the 60s and 70s When you know that hadn't reached the stage that the mainline is in now with their social justice warrior Stuff going on in the mainline church right now so And this is this is akin to positivism and and what we see is that sam harris and the fundamentalists They're they're they're basically mirror images of each other and in my tweet. I said, you know when I listen to sam harris He's in some ways a bizarro That's not my wife. So i'm not going to answer he's a bizarro he's a bizarro copy of the fundamentalists and And so what happens is jordan peterson walks in and sam harris has difficulty Comprehending jordan peterson because he's locked into this positivistic Fundamentalistic frame of the world and this is what I hear again and again and again in the celebrity atheists, and this is why Others like mcgillchrist and jonathan height and jordan peterson and many many others are basically saying You know sam it's not so much the religion it's the philosophy That's outdated right here. You're you're you're reading religion and christianity through this Philosophy and the philosophy is distorting it and that's why you can't understand Many of the christians that don't hold that philosophical position some christians do Nor can you understand many of the other atheists that also don't hold it and they're saying That way to approach the world doesn't work and at heart That's what's at play between Sam harris and and jordan peterson in these debates Now if you're this kind of positivist revelation is your trump card if you're a fundamentalist because implicit in both the fundamentalists and sam harris Is this imagined fricsin thing? This imagined fricsin frictionless recipients of facts and if you listen to sam harris talk to ben Shapiro this becomes evident in that conversation sam harris pretty much comes out and says it that sam harris imagines now he's appropriating a narrative here he imagines a story whereby the Rationalist sits down with the religionist and puts forward a series of arguments that destroys the religionist and now the religionist says poop God is gone for me. I'm ready to construct our brave new world of rationality It's a nice mental idea It's a fantasy really because it almost never happens But the mental minions do talk and people do flip they tend to flip both ways But it imagines this friction that we as human beings are frictionless recipients of facts either from science or revelation if you're a if you're a sam harris person we're frictionless recipients of facts through science and rationality and by rationality we will construct our brave new world and if we are fundamentalists we are frictionless recipients of facts of revelation and Well, just read the bible and those facts will come in and you'll construct it now this happens all the time Many people follow sam harris many people go into a fundamentalist church and they read it Um, the bible says it I believe it that settles it you can find that on a bumper sticker That's not and then people say well, that's a religious argument It's really a philosophical argument. It's really There's really an an Anthropology and an epistemology behind it that says this is how human beings work Now are there human beings that work this way? Probably Are there a whole bunch of human beings that imagine they work this way via the history of philosophy and culture? Yes Is this the best way for us to think about how human beings work? I would argue no and That shapes a number of you have commented about boy. You're a different kind of pastor Well, if you've only seen the one kind of pastor you think that's what pastors are There are a lot of pastors like me. So watch my video with sid. Helema Sid helema is like me. We come from the dutch reform tradition now you can find dutch reform tradition pastors like that other thing too But this there are a lot of pastors like me Well, does that mean you don't really believe the bible now? Some people will listen to my videos and have concerns about my theology and how I what my thoughts about the bible and history Do I think the bible is historical? Yes Is the bible often validated via archaeology? Yes The tricky part comes into how did the ancients? Convey history through writing a narrative and how do we read history through writing a narrative? That's where the difficulties lie But i'm not with bart ermine that just throws my hand up to skepticism I'm this is why i'm in a conservative denomination and happily so I believe jesus rose from the dead Physically and and at some point as I continue to make this as my language and my Philosophy and as I continue to try to integrate all this stuff That is i'm going to hopefully be able to Articulate this in better and better terms that are more and more easily easily understood and actually can Compete and be found compelling in the marketplace of ideas Hence all the emotion laid in frustration and admonitions on both sides Oh, just see the facts. Oh just see the facts and I watched them go through this and I think I think People don't work this way and christians have known this For a long time when we have all these christians love kitschy sayings No one cares how much you um know until they know how much you love There's a kitschy if you want to read if you want to read the album of kitschy christian sayings read I'm going to get into trouble for this too read. Um, and I like um, I like rick warren But his purpose-driven life I read that and I thought This is just about every this is this is an anthology of christian cliches and it's one of the most People love it people find it helpful Clichés are memorable and work They just do but Some of us see them and say Maybe it's a culture thing. I don't know. So not my cup of tea. I'm dutch reformed. I do what I do Love me hate me Support me unsubscribe whatever you need to do. It's fine And so again What I hear from sam harris and the fundamentalists and saying we are passive in the receipt The refusal to succumb is a moral failure and so for The celebrity atheists those darn christians and so we need to get we need to get rid of them because it's a moral failure well And if on the christian side You know, it's at least on the christian side. You got some pretty significant consequences. It's a moral failure That you may pay hell for now I could do some more videos on because again Here's here's an interesting aspect about almost every passage in the new testament when it talks about eternal condemnation People are judged according to what they do this gets into my My hierarchy of reality that i'm trying to work on because the and I think peterson is right on this our deepest level The best expression of who we are tends to be what we do And and I I I realize the fact that this Assumes that there's a certain disconnecting Disconnection between us and ourselves and i'm willing to grant that so So now jordan peterson content psychology weigh in here We are not passive receptions of frictionless facts Okay con't A structure is required to perceive Psychology a structure is required to apprehend and integrate jordan b peterson The power to perceive apprehend integrate and interact has been developed over 3.5 billion years And this is I would argue practically the contemporary definition of what a living thing is Okay And and so what peterson is saying is that? Sam harris has it all wrong and I think sam harris as i'm listening to these things I can't help but feel sam harris is backing up peterson's peterson's arguments now, maybe a sam harris fan would say sam harris destroyed jordan peterson and maybe say that But when I listen to this what I hear is sam harris is backing up. He's backing up You know, he had to at some point he had to give room for consciousness and so he talks about evolving and growing in that and you know, i'm not trying to frame this in a win-lose thing, but Peterson's arguments are too good. I and and in the dublin Early on in the dublin lecture when I heard peterson start to walk through these things i'm thinking It this is solid this is this is a solid case now, is it right that's Big thing. It's a solid case and it's it's a more solid case than sam harris. But again, i'm listening to my filters I i'm more i'm more disposed to To Apprehend and integrate a jordan peterson argument than a sam harris argument or we've got hierarchies We've got we're located in context context all of these things are at play Let's talk about revelation There is an there is an act event or word of revelation let's call revelation On our side of the line, which is which is apprehension comprehension integration and interaction in other words Harris and the fundamentalists have an anthropology that says we are friction refrictionless recipients of facts and any failure to Yeah, I had some thoughts maybe I shouldn't frame it that way any frail any any Any failure to lay down and To lay down on our backs To these frictionless facts is a moral failure. That's how the game is framed by the fundamentalists and the celebrity atheists And i'm thinking about my cat and my dog and they get down and they show you their belly It's like, you know, okay, then this is this is in a sense what they're saying This is how it should be. This is how we work This is how we work. No, this isn't how we work and this isn't how we work with revelation And I would assert Let's think about the sinai revelation. What happens at the sinai revelation? moses and the children of israel they fence off the mountains They're all gathered out there and god is going to speak directly to them And so god comes down on the mountain. He speaks directly to them and again and again and again I hear people say I wish god would talk to me and I think Have you read your bible? You don't really want god to talk to you You don't really want god to show up in that way Because you know why? Because pretty much every time god shows up and even when he just sends a messenger People wish they were dead. Okay, they fall on their fates and they say get away from me and and I had this conversation at my meetup in terms of You know facing god. Well, why can't we see god? Well, it will destroy us Well, what does that mean and I can tell stories again in a don hoffman sort of way I can tell stories that try to communicate to you Possibly in a way we can apprehend of how this Truth, okay. Now there's a propositional truth in there, too. I'm not giving up on that entirely I'm not saying there's no such thing as propositional truth. It's that propositional truths are one element in a very large universe Okay, so when god shows up on sinai Israel you put a fence around it Well, you didn't need the fence because when god showed up they kind of ran the other way and they pleaded with moses make him stop you go talk to him and We'll wait for what you have to say and we'll say whatever you will do whatever you say Yeah, right. The whole story is that they don't do whatever he says. That's the point of the story but Here's the point. Well, how could moses go up? What is the one defining characteristic of moses now we're going to get into the jordan peterson thing We're going to get into the meek thing Moses is meek Moses is humble. What does that have to do with seeing god? the death we experience the terror we have in god is that When we see god we see Ourself in the light of god and we see all our rebellion against god and we see our hopelessness And our ugliness and we see our limitedness and we see all of the ways that we don't measure up and our egos Are completely crushed By the presence of god And so only the humble only the meek Only the pure in heart. Why? Well, what does that mean? Does that mean that they're perfect? No It means that they know they are sinners. It means that when they approach God they cannot come to god with justifications of how he's been treating them wrong They cannot come to god with justifications about All of the assets they are bringing to the negotiation with god They come to god and say I am ugly. I am stupid. I don't know anything I am morally bankrupt and I have lived my life in possibly the worst way possible. So what I what you owe to what I what I am owed from you is destruction and obliteration and eternal Condemnation, but I am going to bank on your mercy and absolutely nothing else If you listen to tim keller Tim keller in some places will say basically what damns us self-righteousness why Because we can have none of that when we face god and that's why the children of israel seeing god on sinai run Okay revelation. Here's an event Well, it's an event how are you gonna know it you're gonna go to you're gonna well first of all, we don't even know the mountain you're gonna look for charcoal Well How about the burning bush? Let's dial it down some moses sees a burning bush It has his attention why interest, you know moses was a shepherd in the desert saw lots of Thunder strikes and and brush fires and if you've ever seen a brush fire You obviously don't have never seen a brush fire. I probably don't live in california where we have them all the time And Brushfires swoop through brush and they the brush is consumed rapidly the flames get huge everything's dry They just go whoosh, but then behind it is just char You got a bush and it's burning and the bush isn't consumed interest for kike moses stops What's that walks over to it? Take off your shoes. You're on holy ground. Boom. We've got culture. We've got language. We've got all of these things coming into this moment And then what happens after that is a relationship an interaction begins and well did this happen Well, I Do you have a reason why it didn't happen? Do you know where moses was? Do you know where the bush was? Can you say that? Well, I don't think moses. Well, okay, you don't know but You don't not know You can't really tell me it didn't happen. So why not why not Why not err on the side of believing this book? All right, i'll do that Sam harris doesn't really know enough theology and this is forgivable and we should help him See the belgian confession basically articulates I think this is pretty much the the late medieval position of two books god reveals himself in nature As its author and god reveals himself in special revelation So we can learn about god through science if you go back in my conversations you find a conversation with with john vinsloten And here go john if you ride this if you watch this John vinsloten is a crc minister who's writing books? And every job a parable. What's john's schtick john's schtick is God reveals himself through jobs And if you look at his chapter Um all work matters imaging god and your whole being learning into um Learning into god's signature moves noticing god's unnoticed presence. And so john is trying john is looking for god in general revelation. That is what john is doing and john's a canadian And he's a friend and he's a he's a he's a lovely lovely man So I I recommend john vinsloten's books God reveals himself in nature, but he also reveals himself in special revelation and christians assert that this is coming through a book But now again for sam harris Because if he understands facts that that we basically lay down to frictionless facts Well, this is terribly offensive to him And he looks around says that's a bunch of crap. I don't believe any of it. Okay But sam you don't really understand what christians mean by revelation because Christians are saying we're surrounded by revelation and the science you're doing is a revelation and you know This is christians are doing this too now Again, let's talk about theophanies and there's a long tradition of explaining now there's explaining and there's explaining away Was the sinai event a volcano I read it in exodus 19 kind of sounds like a volcano Did everyone there hear a voice through it? You see and this is the difficulty is that You don't really have to choose But Explaining and explaining away are two different things and i'm not making the argument so the christians hear me well I'm not making the argument that it was just a volcano I'm not even making the argument that it was a volcano Okay, i'm just saying Revelation always requires interpretation They say yeah, well that's true of general revelation. You know what it's true of special revelation, too And well, well, yeah, what does john calvin say? Well, john calvin said well We need the holy spirit to interpret Well, does that give us truth? Yes, but truth and reality are on hierarchies and This truth is complicated and reality is complicated and so Part of the problem That sam harris and this conversation has about revelation Is a philosophical problem about trying to understand the truth Problem about trying to understand what revelation is and you might say well, how can you as a pastor get this? Well, I understand what salm what the psalmist says that the heavens declare the glory of god and what isaiah 6 says that um Holy, holy, holy is the lord god almighty. He is holy. Holy. Holy. He is he is he is So far away from us The whole earth is full of his glory he reveals himself through the earth and through his glory we have two books And you have to keep both of them and this is part of the reason I like the christian reform church and I like calvin college because You don't we don't always get this right, but we're trying to keep both books And we do this confessionally And we do this within the history of the church and keeping two books is hard because well There's disagreements and you might say yeah what there's disagreements within both books, too Now i'm not saying the bible isn't the inspired word of god. Okay i'm saying is that We all our apprehension of both books always requires interpretation and those interpretations are limited and biased And hurt by our sinful natures i'm putting that in christian language Okay And you can put it in neil degrasse tyson language. You can put it in jordan peterson language but sam harris's fundamental problem is this imaginary of frictionless facts Making us lay down on our backs. Oh, this is Yeah, yeah The history of israel well, what are the sini's a chain of natural disasters? I've heard that put forward jesus dying on a cross The romans crucified thousands of people, okay Is that theophany jesus dying on the cross the new testament wants you to think so is it supernatural jesus dying on the cross? Depends what you mean by supernatural it looked natural to everyone's eyes Except perhaps the centurion that in one of the gospels says I think it was luke says surely this man was the son of god Well, what would a centurion mean by the son of god? This is the kind of things that keep pastors and New testament scholars and christian theologians christian theologians in work The history of israel the bible narrates events It's there in the midst of the way that the ancient hebrew scribes did narrative. There's commentary There's conversation there's disputes This is this is what's in the canon. This is how the bible is constructed Now this is Confessionally what I would assert is revelation. It's theophany Stretching the word theophany because that has a technical meaning but it's revelation It requires interpretation John calvin says the holy spirit guides us to interpret the text christian foreign ministers following john calvin When they prepare their sermons, they pray they ask the holy spirit to guide them in their interpretation Does that mean christian reform pastors never get anything wrong in their sermons? No Is it this gets complicated in christian reform terminology and More than willing to have those conversations, but most of you aren't in those conversations. So I won't go there but This is what religious people do And and what I would assert is most wrong is this view of of people laying down for frictionless facts That is not how people work and I think it's Pretty obvious that that's not how people work or even the outcomes of these Conversations between jordan peterson same harris would look very different. We're far more complicated with that Now what about seeing the supernatural and i've been wanting to talk about this more and i'm not going to go into this fully here But can we see the supernatural? Jesus dying on the cross. What did that look like? Jesus the son of god, what did that look like? See it's the same eyes that we see the natural with And vision happens in conscious and even visions have a division happens in consciousness Can you induce that kind of stuff with drugs probably? What does it mean in terms of revelation? Well even sam harris? Well because again, this is where philosophy governs Because of his materialist bent will say I can have a wild revelation by doing psychedelics in my head Or or being a disciplined Being disciplined in meditation. I can see things but sam harris will say those things are just products of my brain See, and this is where philosophy matters because others might say we don't know that those are just products of your brain Consciousness is very strange. We don't know that we're sharing consciousness and then you have the union's come in and talk about the collective a collective consciousness, so This gets very this gets very Very interesting and haitians I used to work with well dreams dreams were how god revealed things to them Well, why did they believe that? Well, this is a common belief throughout Traditional belief throughout the world nebuchadnezzar believed it. It's there in the bible. Does can god reveal things through dreams? I've had some dreams that I wonder if they were revelatory I wonder but now i'm impacted by modernism and i'm impacted by secularity And all of those things bring certain kinds of doubts upon me My guess is that human beings often have doubts just by the Charles taylor's word the cross pressures of whatever cultural situation they're in because none of our none of our None of we're not in a clean room. Okay so Can we see the supernatural what when we what we see often is a break or a surprise an expected pattern All right, and and again lewis goes into this in miracles that there are patterns that we see and patterns get used to and these laws of physics that matt delahunty wants to construct his brave new world upon all they are are Patterns in behavior things keep falling and they fall with such regularity That we bank on it and we measure it and we use it in terms of our science and technology And then rupert shell drake will say yeah, but these things are always moving a little bit. Why is that? It's not quite as fixed as we imagine it is the pragmatist can wait and say it's it's fixed good enough And and so we can bank on it and our cell phones mostly work and our cars mostly work And and certain simple medicines mostly work, but as gilchrist notes We're not really fixing the bot the body often, you know the crude ways that we replace joints or bones we're usually helping the body to fix itself because the body is not a machine because Science cannot tell us what the body is for and this is where we get into the meaning question and when I get into the The the marriage debate I will usually begin by saying tell me what marriage is for And if you tell me what marriage is for I can probably predict How you what you think about certain? controversies about marriage Because what is governing is what you believe marriage is for and it's the same thing with human bodies It's the same with thing with societies. It's the same thing with communities Societies socius lewis tells a ghost story in miracles And i've related before if you watch the e3 podcast Jordan peterson tells two ghost stories and I I know someone that was with jordan peterson in one of those ghost stories And it's a pretty darn good ghost story And the other person in this ghost story is a materialist and he doesn't believe in ghosts But then I had to ask him what opened the drawer and he said weird stuff happens. This is how we work Well, there's a glitch it was its interpretation the the The person that doesn't believe in the ghost Doesn't deny the drawer opened What's the supernatural thing that happened in that room with jordan peterson and in this other person in nashville? Not memphis according to this other person and First person testimony jordan peterson, I believe said it happened in In memphis and this other person said no jordan remembered wrong. It happened in nashville I think I have that right. I might have it wrong memory is faulty But I can go back and check because i've got it written down from this other person and i've got it On the video the e3 podcast from jordan peterson. So Well, well, which is it? Well, it was one of those two cities probably And neither of them are denying that the drawer was open when he and jordan were sitting in this room talking What opened the drawer they tested the drawer it wasn't a truck roaming by that the drawer wriggled open what opened the drawer? its interpretation Now if you come to the story as a naturalist You might say well Things that we can measure in physics open the drawer Okay, the only problem you have is you have no idea what that is and it seems terribly unlikely by virtue of the elements of the story A supernaturalist will say maybe it was a being on another plane or dimension or Someone's messing with you, babe But something opened the drawer the fact that the drawer opened is not denied And jordan peterson has no reason to lie. This other person really has no reason reason to lie Something opened the drawer I see it with my natural eyes. It's a question of interpretation It's what you bring to the experience not The experience that governs That's what's happening here jordan peterson It's probably more likely to believe in ghosts than this other individual this other individual says I can't explain it I'm not giving up my worldview jordan peterson says He's an open agnostic could be could be maybe God opened the drawer so that paul vanderkley could create this illustration So that some of you could come to christ. Yeah, there's interpretation for you True not true not going to figure that out Another text from my wife. Ah hate craigslist. I like craigslist, but I hate craigslist craigslist people are flaky So in summary, oh I may finish this that'd be good Um, we only see what we are capable of seeing okay, this is Neil degrasse tyson's point. We only see what we're capable of seeing we we are apprehensive our apprehension Structure and biases govern We we are bad at knowing But we're good enough in some ways And i'll take that now. How about in a christian frame? I think that's true Why because I see it confirmed in reality other people out there say human beings are basically good I'm skeptical about that one. I'm a calvinist You and I won't see enough or know enough to govern everything Get a dog You know, I'm a calvinist I'm a calvinist I'm a calvinist Everything get a dog get a cat get a plant get married have children have a neighbor C.s. Lewis in his book the great divorce describes hell As a place where you can have anything you want just by thinking of it You might say boy that sounds like heaven i can have anything I want just by thinking of it And so people there are building incredible mansions and they're filling them with furniture and and and everything their hearts desire But the city is an ever-growing city because the one thing they can't have Is governance over each other Now we're knocking on the door of western civilization now we're knocking on the door of human rights now We're knocking on the door of this entire legal system that says we place a very high value on the rights of other people Well, why well did we just develop this rationally because we the way we don't like to be treated. Well, there's part of that Or is it revelation Is it revelation that this is what god inspired moses to write It's christian I say the holy spirit Divide the holy spirit inspired organic Inspiration or what does organic mean it meant that In terms of the authors of the bible There are it's full of organic sources Unlike the mormons unlike the muslims My christian theology says god inspires authors through history the bible grows from the bottom up Does that mean that it isn't also? divine revelation That's one way to language it do I believe it's true. Yes But we're talking about language and apprehension and structures and all of this stuff now again Sam harris runs away from revelation because he believes that facts are these frictionless things that we have to lay down for And I said, that's not how people work If that was how people work I could take a bible and go bang and and there you'd go Say i'm gonna get you with this thing and i'm gonna in fact I knew a haitian pastor that when folks would fall asleep in church. He'd come at him with their bible bible and bang Yeah, they woke up But that's how not that's how this doesn't work now, is it also true that sometimes people read this book and they are And again, i'm going to adopt some christian language here. The holy spirit would move their hearts and they would begin to believe It's one way of articulating it. What's another way of articulating it They read it and they they thought about it and it made sense to them and they decided to join a church There's more of a phenomenon phenomenological approach to it So you can language these things in different ways and each of these languages constructs whole worlds And sam harris because of his philosophy is allergic to certain kinds of worlds And he and jordan peterson makes him nervous and jordan peterson says sam. You don't have to be so nervous relax a little You're a little wrong on how people work But you don't have to be afraid You don't have to be afraid of Do you have to be afraid of god? Yes and no Yes Because but also Yes, because of who he is in god. No, because he's a loving god And if I nail the grass tyson take that on because nature is so dangerous. Well, why is nature so dangerous to us? Well now we're into the christian story Now we're into the book of genesis. Why is nature so dangerous? well Who's more dangerous? us to nature or nature to us Or getting to the point that we seem more dangerous than nature To nature than us but we're dependent upon nature. So we're stuck so we we we strangle nature at our own peril So you and I don't see enough to know enough to govern everything. We're we're limited human beings. We only see so much There's a hierarchy of realities And a hierarchy of knowledge and a hierarchy of values and again, i'm not sure Hierarchy is exactly the right word for realities. I'm still trying to get a mental map on it But again to get back to gilchrist in order to understand I have to get it into a metaphor that gets tangible enough for us three-dimensional four-dimensional creatures to Apprehend and take it in and get it in story wise and manipulate it and engage and communicate and all of those things Is religion and revelation really that hard to believe not for me? And in fact, I think not for most people So I'd say it's more about trust and in fact if you look at the sam harris jordan peterson thing They're talking because sam ha Jordan peterson makes sam harris and many others like including brett weinstein that came out in the joe rogan story He makes them nervous now This is where the human factor gets involved because the more Chance that sam harris and jordan peterson sit down and talk that trust factor will Sam harris will trust him more. Well, is he trusting him on the basis of reason on the basis of facts? He is trusting him more on the basis of personal experience, but that's a different kind of experience He's seeing that jordan peterson is a nice guy and he's he's not an ego maniac And this is why I said if jordan if if sam harris was my next door neighbor i'd leave I'd leave my house keys with him and have him take in the mail and maybe have him watch my dog or Babysit my kids because i'm older than sam harrison. My kids are older. So I would trust sam harris celebrity atheist to babysit my kids. Why? Even just on the little basis that i've seen of him. He seems like a great guy He's a guy i'd like to I don't drink beer But i'd sit down and have dinner with sam harrison who'd have a wonderful conversation and we could be friends Now some of you might say yeah call paul because you could be friends with anybody I'm pretty sure of it and there's a certain amount of truth to that. I I like pretty much everybody.
