 Hi, this is Paul and on Mondays I usually run through a bunch of things that I found last week over the weekend Jordan Peters in front there was a piece in Politico Politico magazine which I thought was a fairly fair representation of Peterson Someone actually in my church picked this up and sent it to me and I thought that was interesting because Part of this whole journey is gauging what? normal Regular people see and so it's not only interesting what people find but who finds it and what they're reading and what they're thinking Also, there was a piece in the Catholic Register that was also quite Quite in favor of Peterson. I had my Conversation with Peterson last week and he made a comment about you know getting some rough treatment from the church and I think that's true It's it's uneven because there are also a fair number of people in church that are excited about what's going on with him and And this was a was this was a rather pro Peterson article I've spoken prophets churches ally and it's fairly brief piece but but quite Quite positive towards him Alan Jacobs whose book I'm reading right now How to think Wrote a very interesting piece Compatible ism where he mentions Jordan Peterson and then he links also to this much longer piece By again Alistair Roberts who had written quite a significant piece last week and he's obviously following Peterson closely and again, this was a fairly long and Media engagement with with Peterson and I think Peterson tweeted this so that was that was certainly well worth Well worth taking a look at also this morning Peterson tweeted a piece on His reading in the Bible, which I thought was was was quite even-handed and and fairly nuanced Which was which was also a pretty good pretty good piece pretty good conversation Then then of course there was this piece in the New York Times, which was funny because I have a I have a brother-in-law who was From Manitoba and so I sent it to him and and he didn't like it at all And then the next day or so Peterson tweeted it and he didn't like it at all and I thought yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's I'm not I'm not at all surprised. I'm not at all surprised So but that's so funny because sometimes when I listen to Peterson, I think about my brother-in-law and I think about You know, we have so many layers and you know, we have these personalities and cultures And you know, we we I'm from I'm from New Jersey I'm from the East and there's sometimes that my East Coast Patterson nature comes out and but you know, I've got My parents grew up in different places. And so elements of those come through were such complex interwoven complicated creatures in terms of culture and temperament and and experiences and Theological confessions philosophical Philosophical positions, so this was a that was kind of an interesting interesting piece This was something that someone had sent to me well Well, Jordan Peterson lead people to God or seduce them with a substitute and I said well, you know Do you think Jordan Peterson is is you know, is he pot to heroin Jesus or is he just methadone? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know I don't know And this this of course as I as I commented with Peterson This is and in some sense the the central fascination I have with with what's going on is how is he going to intersect with the The Large religious conversations and why are our people coming people coming to Peterson last night? I went to a meetup in in Berkeley of a group of people who got together Via reddit. They didn't have an official meetup like on meetup.com like i'm using for mine, but just a fascinating conversation. I love The conversation I love the conversation The conversation is with the people who are coming to me and it's just a very interesting conversation And I'm going to go to meetup.com like i'm using for mine, but just a fascinating conversation. I love Figuring out how Peterson is changing their lives how he's he's changing their lives religiously to a certain degree how he's changing their lives politically And and what where they're going with it how that's working for them you know the the interesting relationship between Peterson's work and the orthodox larjo the orthodox Community of churches greek orthodox russian orthodox antioch and and of course jonathan peugeot is is at the center of this And and doing some thinking about that i'll get into that a little bit later with with the ron dart conversation, but I think when you're looking at the mythological and the symbolism it's always fun going to these meetups because I I like to hear what people have to say and And and what they catch because so often You know, I think Peterson has taught me a ton about this so often It's what gets caught in our filters We know how what our filters are doing by what's getting caught in them and so You know, obviously people are listening to hours and hours and hours of Peterson videos But what certain things catch in their filters that get their attention? I pay very close attention to those things because that can tell me what their filters are and that'll give me a little better understanding of Of kind of what's happening in the zeitgeist in the in the larger conversations with our culture And and one of the things that that got mentioned is jonathan peugeot's Statement about you know, he doesn't read any young he just reads church fathers and so, okay What's the relationship between young and the church fathers and and this is getting into my You know one of the hypotheses that i'm kind of quietly working in my head, which is the implicit Implicit the implicit language of symbolism and this very much gets into the question of Okay, so peter so peterson via young see these archetypes these this These these structural things built unbuilt into us, especially now with peterson with respect to evolution These structural things built into us through evolution, you know, we're afraid of spiders and snakes And so our chimps and And so there's all this stuff and this in a sense kind of like jonathan hates heights project This builds in us, you know jonathan height likes to use Moral taste buds with with jordan peterson. We're getting more into mythology and structures And so this builds into us this in a sense symbolic language that that perhaps is a pre-language that that is Cultural to a great degree that is that cuts across the language barriers. It's in a sense then Biblically speaking or mythologically biblically speaking it's pre Tower of babel and so, you know jonathan is working very much in the symbolic world that's been his focus and and peterson in a sense is Is seeing trying to see through the bible To these symbolic roots and whereas biblical scholars for a hundred years have been working What's called source criticism where they look at, you know, the the the yahuas the priestly um the deuteranot the deuteronomists they look at all of these pre Canonical layers to try and find out well, what's the source of the bible? Where's this coming from now again that project is rooted in post-enlightenment thinking that looks to validate Truth in a historic slash materialist layer Peterson in a sense is in a sense trying to mine the bible and and not necessarily get at the documentary sources of the text but he's trying to get at the Evolutionary sources of the text and and that's in a sense where you know young obviously was at a similar project but in a sense the The symbolic The symbolic Exegetical layer that jonathan pageau is mining is isn't in that sense much closer to peterson's So then it's been very very interesting to me how many people who are So they they they were at an atheist position and now they're looking back into christianity and they're Probably partly because due to jonathan pageau partly due to peterson, but I think because of this attempting to get at this pre language symbolic framework That that carries meaning um a lot of interest in the orthodox church again large o orthodox Family of churches i've talked a little bit about with jonathan pageau about how these fragmented orthodox churches when they come to america in in a sense you get this hybrid of There there there's a strange orthodox ecumenism that's developing which in some ways is related to this protestant market-based ecumenism which is really Evangelicalism because that's I think the best Explanation for what evangelicalism is and if you read a scholar such as mark knoll He wrote a very interesting piece and and by a logos a number of years ago. He talked about how Especially when churches moved out of the original 13 colonies into the frontier states, you know very early you know pushing past the appellations and then Into the louisiana purges and then over the mississippi into the west they left those european churches behind And so these churches needed to find a new language By which to connect each other there they're past the the confessional fights of the europe that they left And so that's when you get all this language about bible believing church and the text itself in american church history then takes on the The role that a confession had made in the historic european confessional protestant churches and so when the when the large o orthodox churches move into the united states and they find themselves in a sea of mainline and all these protestants and you know in the 20th century this ever growing larger Catholic presence, but the the catholic church in america also is is undergoing these weird these weird complexes where The stuff of europe gets gets filtered out. And so this I don't want to call it an evangelicalization it's really an Americanization of churches that happens to the protestant confessional churches to the roman catholic church and is now because the orthodox church is Is in some ways so late in coming especially so late in coming out west they too are experiencing this this strange working of We're in some ways. We're seeing the rise of the american orthodox church I was having a conversation with with some friends. One of my friends is a good friend of a Of an orthodox priest that is that is in the area and they had an open forum and they were talking about, you know evangelization of of unchurched people and the The priest said well, we're hardly ready to evangelize. We haven't we haven't set up our we haven't built our churches And we haven't set up our monasteries and we can't really do that until we do those things and and again this this presented such a different focus from From evangelicalism and the group I met with last night one person had just recently been baptized Just like that and another two are you know in the process of of either having a part of or seeking Orthodox catechesis, which is going to be a long path Which is now this gets into some interesting christian reform church history, but it's this americanization of the church now Now peterson is in this somehow and i'm trying to figure out where this all fits together And I think a lot of it has to do again with this He's doing source criticism of the text, but it's not Documentary source criticism. He's working this this symbolism symbolism as language layer of the text and he's connecting that with evolutionary roots and and using Evolutionary psychology and some of these other things to come at it from above and again This is the larger attempt by peterson to try to put the world back together now part of what happens when Roman catholics orthodox evangelicals of various stripes take a look at peterson They have a filter and and as you know when I get into to ron dart or some of ron dart's videos You know dart notes that People come at peterson with their own objections and say well, here's my confessional Here's my theological confessional filter you fail to hit that filter. Therefore the filter blocks out peterson Another comes at peterson from perhaps their literalistic Evangelical bible believing filter and say no, you know darwinism. You're not going to get past my filter. I'm going to reject you and so then when Pieces get written. How should christians regard jordan peterson? Usually the different groups put up their filters now Those who really pertain to the church of um the church of Liberal Political liberal Ideological orthodoxy when jordan peterson refuses to use pronouns or when jordan peterson denounces things like white privilege or um or gender equality, um, Gender identity. Well, that's their filter. So then they block him there and and as as ron dart again I've mentioned him a few times should pull him up um some of the videos that i'm most enjoying that don't seem to be Watched by a lot of people are these ron dart commentaries that are on brad jurcik's YouTube channel and ron dart is a Not sure what he's a professor of but he's a canadian He's a canadian professor and and he has some of these kind of slow Um Unlike Loud and boisterous me impulsive. He's just kind of walking through the Walking through jordan peterson and all the various issues and and he just does it He just does it so well And in this one he's he's talking about he's talking about how jordan peterson treats the bible and again the whole video Is worth listening to but just here at the conclusion, you know He puts together some things that that I hadn't really thought of And so people like gregory amnese and there's many others will look at the whole mythic element of the exodus And this is the second book obviously of the hebrew can or the x out of hodas the way So what is the way out of our internal bondage psychologically and spiritually into the promise in which we recover our image and likeness? Well, you can see that this spiritual reading of the text when a person goes beyond simply the the literal the moral The typological the anagogical he's going through there in the in the middle ages Medieval church fathers read the text in in four layers And and that's kind of how they understood the text now what happens? In the protestant reformation In this whole long cultural philosophical movement that takes place in europe and then the turn away from the text that i've talked about in some of my previous videos um the protestant reformers Want to in a sense on protestant Reading you'll you'll you'll often just kind of leave the text with two levels the the the literal level and then what you know is often called the The typological level and that's that's as close as In traditions like my own that's as close as people will get to this symbolic layer That that jonathan péjot is working especially with respect to the church fathers And so what ron dard is doing here is he's he's mapping out the layers and he's basically saying, you know People are coming at jordan peterson and they're they're knocking him because he's not bowing to any particular layer And that's really that's really not fair because that's not peterson's project if you want to engage with peterson look at his project Evaluate him within the project now if you want to say well peterson doesn't take the bible literally literally then i'm not going to listen to him Well, fine. Don't listen to him If you want to say well peterson doesn't bow his knee at the altar of of social justice warriorism I'm not going to listen to him. Well, then fine. Don't listen to him now And now what peterson will say is yeah, if you keep playing this game at some point You who are in the political? Who are in the political high ground? You might decide you want to imprison me or kill me because i'm not bowing my knee to your to your Temple. Well, then let's face a few facts here about what the larger political game is and so Rondart is running through some of those layers and this is where he this is where he goes to Uh into the anthropological mystical has a lot of affinities with the mythical and so when Peterson is turning to the mythical There's an amazing portal between the mythical and the mystical And I think if people follow where peterson is going in terms of his deeper Mythical read of the text or the existential read or the psychological read because it's a close connection between the psyche and the pnuma In terms of self-understanding and and so this is where probably peterson more than any other person at the present time Is drawing people into a deeper read of the text which then can open if properly understood To the mystical or the spiritual reading of the text itself and with the great interest in today and the contemplative the mystical the spiritual theology It is not much of it It's not much of a step to go from the mythical to the mystical or to the spiritual reading the spiritual reading of the text and Anyone who reads any of the the mothers and fathers of the church and those continued that six-fold understanding of how you read the text We'll see Peterson takes them beyond the literal The historical the grant without denying it. It's it's not a matter of one or the other of six It's a bit like a theological clown keeping many balls in the air and these different exegetical means It's some people juxtapose in the early church anti-ock and alexandria, which is quite unfair because alexandria from origin Onward, I mean the first great, you know christian university was in alexandria and origins set in place drawing from a much older tradition These layered levels of reading the text and you look at his his approach And so it's it's a very easy step to move from jordan peterson's mythical existential psychological right into origin in alexandria and then you just follow that whole alexandrian tradition up through Vagri's ponticus gragery of nissa any of these you skip the same thing in western exegetes As well, so I think the key thing to note and i'll conclude here is that If one is going to get focused on peterson's approach to the bible and Obviously, he could be tracked in many other ways But if many people come from a christian background are obviously quite interested in peterson Is not to dismiss him as being pelagian or because he's interested in young young as gnostic It's certainly not a literalist certainly respect for evolution and trying to understand how the bible And particularly its great mythic structures reflect and actually can co-inhered with an evolutionary understanding of the bible So it doesn't have to be either or Theology bible or science in fact, he's very interested in synthesizing And his particular mythical approach to the text anyone who's followed the multiple lectures he's given in toronto and then and then his Big early magnum opus on maps of meaning the 12 rules for life Uh can see how he again again uses the bible and then and then if you follow peterson further It's a very easy pathway to take from a mythical Psychological read of the text into a mystical spiritual reading of the text It's just a few more steps a few more steps down there It'll be interesting to see where peterson goes with that. So i'll conclude with that then so jordan peterson in the bible Trying to get a good understanding what is myth Myth is not separate from history Myth just deepens our understanding of history And anyone who can reflect even on their own journey why they enjoy fairy stories or why lord of the rings is popular harry potter Or star wars these are great myths And how the bible In many ways the great themes of the bible can easily be seen in those great mythic works We've all grown up on fairy stories, which are secular myths Because myths tend to have much more deeper sacred context And so but there is this real close affinity again between between myth and fairy tale but it's It isn't too far a journey in many ways from myth fairy tale to spiritual reading of of the bible if people can see Uh, you can see where in fact the pathway peterson is on There can be actually some excellent work done on on on myth and mysticism as exegetical reads or psychological reads and spiritual reading of the text so for those who are interested in peterson in the bible be careful of Not reducing him to simplistic Approaches he's extremely nimble and at this point he's extremely open and maybe just one point Underneath although what he does is the notion of the eternal logos ever living ever breathing So the myth points the way to the living logos the transformative logos and this is important where in fact he His engagement with frederick niches martin heidegger is very important the living logos of of Pre-socratic thoughts so it's not a matter of just paradigms and images and myths Is what do they mean as people are open to the engaging living logos or what in the creeds would be called Believe in the holy spirit the lord the giver of life So logos and numa is very important all this so there's this in In peterson constant this notion that history is open And it's open everything hinges on human choice and so myth and history in that sense are deeply connected for For peterson just a spiritual reading attack is deeply connected to history itself And boy, there's just a there's a ton there There's a ton there Can't go into all of that. I want I don't want this to be a long treatment of let's say this video but That'll give you a taste into how lucid and Perceptive and balanced and fair Ron dart is in in kind of figuring out peterson now in that last section. I might have some Conversation with him, but I think if you watch this series, this is the third of the series that That this individual is putting up of of ron dart's musing on peterson. This is this is some of the best most succinct clearest most balanced Analysis of peterson that i've found on youtube so it's it's well it's well worth It's well worth checking out and that's on Brad jurcik's channel and i'll put a link into the notes and and then just um then just this the the integral life people Uh, someone sent me these these links and had a couple of videos um Overall, I thought there were some good takeaways from this. I think the Like just like when I talked about with filters the integral life people have their filter. Everyone has a filter Um in a sense as they deal with peterson you begin to see the filter most clearly that they have and they've got a they've got a fairly they've got a fairly rigid view of warrior traditional modern post-modern and then their system, which is integral life is against the next evolution and that's That's in a sense always the always the schtick And and I don't I don't want to I don't want to deal with that unfairly but if if if there's And I want to be careful with this because I think christianity is finally a progressivistic religion But if your basic orientation is a progressivism Then then you almost can't but identify yourself as with the latest evolution And and once you identify yourself as the latest evolution well, then And since it's a sense the game over um, and so and this is and this is the problem where again if we get back into say the The set the what I call the iron box of secularism part of how god functions In the life of someone who is a significant theist let's say Okay And and maybe even for someone who's whose theism is a little bit more is a little thinner let's say at least if you have a really good functioning idea of god that you always you always keep the I don't want to say archetypal, but that's not quite the right word. You always keep the top of the hierarchies just outside of reach of humanity Um, and now the the the integral life people they say well, it's probably going to evolve beyond us Yeah, but but you're you're the most evolved person, you know and if we begin the conversation that way and on one hand we all think we're all the most evolved person or the most balanced person or You know, my favorite people are some of the people who know they're not the most balanced people but it's it's Part of what's handy about there being a god is it can limit your idolatries Because what I doubt what idolatry is is that you you take anything within the system and make that an ultimate Well, once the ultimate is within Within your system not above it The the person who controls the idol then becomes the ultimate because and this is I think part of the reason why Part of the reason why people are so drawn to impersonal Impersonal frameworks for the universe and you see this let's say in star wars the force the forces is impersonal or pantheism Pantheism is is impersonal the reason we really like impersonal frameworks is because We as personal beings can exert will upon the impersonal and when that happens We then become the god and this is exactly why if you look at my sermon yesterday We see tools. We love to see tools and and why in in christianity and i think judaism Which is why you're not to make an image of the god because once you make that image of the god even even mentally It's really hard. How are you gonna have a how are you gonna worship this god that you really can't make an image of and definitely Don't make an image in concrete things because once you make an image of that god You can now manipulate this god and and you yourself become god and this is the great This is the great trap that we fall into because once I am god I suddenly have a significantly lesser god than I need because most of my problems are not necessarily out there With social justice warriors or heretics or people of other religions or people of no religion Most of my real problems are right here in me and and once I make myself the god Games up, there's no escaping my problems. So There's a little there's a little thing at the end of the video Anyway, this was just kind of some of the stuff I found this this weekend And again, if you want to look for some of the best treatment or i'd say summary Balanced clearest succinct Fair of peterson just in terms of analyzing him and describing him check out some of ron darts videos
