 Just wanted to drop a quick note that tonight April 24 at 7 p.m. At Livingstone CRC 1390 Florin Road, Sacramento We're going to have our I think this is our fourth Jordan Peterson meetup right now We've got 20 people signed up on meetup.com There's always a few who don't make it and there's always a few who come and haven't signed up So if you're in Sacramento or the Sacramento area last Last month we had some come in from the Bay Area to Come on down and we'll get together and we'll talk about all sorts of Jordan Peterson things and This is kind of a rough agenda for tonight. What's your name? How did you first learn about Jordan Peterson? Why do you think Jordan Peterson is important and why has listening to Jordan Peterson changed your life? Why how what aspect of Jordan Peterson's work? Do you want to talk about tonight now if we have 20 people that we might split up into two or three groups? And I'm kind of thinking I've got a lot of space in the sanctuary We've got movable chairs so you can you can if you want to bring some food some food to share You can do that, but we'll we'll just we'll just talk about a bunch of things We'll hang out and and actually I've seen in other meetings where we've last meeting we had about 14-15 13 14 people we're all in one group and it gets a little bit hard to have a Have a conversation all in one group So we might we might split up and then people can kind of freely jump in and jump out of conversations in different place and my experience the a lot of the excitement is talking about what's going on I think probably the Bill Maher Appearance will will be talked about tonight and there's usually some aspects and some ideas that people have that they'll bring up I'm also considering going to maybe two meetups a month maybe one on a weekend night and one on a weekday night, I'm Thinking about that. I'll get some input in that from the group that meets tonight again If you're in Sacramento and you want to come on down come on down if you're in the Bay Area Maybe carpool we had somebody drive up from Palo Alto last month and one drive in from Berkeley So let me know and hopefully see you tonight
