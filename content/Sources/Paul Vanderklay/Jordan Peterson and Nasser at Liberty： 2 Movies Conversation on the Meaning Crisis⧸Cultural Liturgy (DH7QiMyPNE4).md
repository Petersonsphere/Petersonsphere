 Hi, this is Paul. I want to follow up on the Jordan Peterson visiting Liberty University. I did a two and a half long two and a half hour long video the other day Incorporating some of the stuff from Rod Dreher. I'm gonna have some comments from his website on that on Dreher's write-up of that event a little bit on the Bruce Ashford piece in the Gospel Coalition website The on David Nassar and to get background on him It's really helpful to read the testimony that he has in Christianity today Leslie Nubigen who I think is tremendously helpful today in terms of Just about everything he's written the gospel in the pluralistic society and Another favorite author of mine Frederick Buechner and his book of Beb which I think nicely locates some of the the mockery against the kinds of religion that That sometimes deservedly people love to hate and and Buechner in a way sort of locates it and Helps us, you know, it's it's always it's always fun to to mock someone else Not always fun, but it's often fun to mock someone else but the the real important work is to look at ourselves and find where we fall short and respond accordingly We're going to be looking at the the one last question video that followed up just broke a couple of days ago and When you watch that video you have the sense of what Scott Adams calls two movies And so I'm going to call this a two movie conversation and and we have a lot of two movie conversations in our world when People of different religions speak with each other people of different political assumptions that tends to be what what Scott Adams focuses on people of different worldviews and and looking for common ground either to have our worldview win in a sense in the competition of worldviews or to make our point or What have you and and so this this conversation between Peterson and Nassar is very much a a two movie conversation Now this this was born out I think in one of the one of the comments left in the first rear piece on the Liberty U Event which which he picked up from from Esther's blog and on April 1, California says, okay Just watch the whole event the part of the the part with the kid brought me brought me to tears What I cannot understand however is why anyone else is on stage with Peterson This is kind of funny because usually Peterson's on stage by himself because in some ways Peterson is such a difficult guy to To have a conversation with even though he's a tremendous Conversationalist when he when he gets going as you can see in the first Ben Shapiro Sunday show Ben Ben has Peterson and and Ben Shapiro both of them, you know famous motor mouths Vying to to get in a word edgewise you can also see this in Peterson's conversation with verveky from from 2015 Peterson I mean he acknowledges this himself. That's that's just the way he is and I tend to be like this myself And it's a it's a difficulty but you know, why is anybody else on stage with Peterson? Well Obviously Liberty University wouldn't have it any other way and in fact Liberty University had four three other handlers as such on stage Obviously got Gary Habermas to engage in the resurrection conversation, which they never got to on stage the president of the of the university because he's the president of the university and David Nasser who was responsible for the most part for For managing the conversation but but the question I understand why this question gets asked It's obviously he can carry one of these talks on his own does Liberty require a mediator Well, there's a two-movie conversation and and in a sense what what often happens with these two-movie conversations is one Group is attempting to colonize the other It feels like Liberty you representatives are the thought police up there trying to control the conversation Not to mention bringing the subject back to themselves in other words with a two-movie conversation you're always trying to in a sense colonize the other movie and and Subsume the other movie and make make your movie dominant and one might say well, that's exactly what I do with my channel Fair enough. I'd say this is exactly what human beings almost always do and often when people say they're not doing it Well, they're really doing it. It's just we get a little offended by it. So we say we're not really doing it It feels like it Liberty you representatives are thought police up there trying to control the conversation not to mention Mention ever bringing the subject back to themselves when Peterson speaks about himself It's always it's actually to get a bigger idea the number of times he makes the mistake of of making a small pause and gets cut off before he can finish his sentences because his Co-inhabitors of the stage aren't even listening to him should make everyone associated with Liberty cringe now There are many points like that in that video, but in all fairness to Liberty Peterson is used to going on stage for an hour an hour and a half even two hours plus with his biblical series and Just talking and so if you've Want to get your program down into 30 minutes? Well, you're going to be handling Peterson but I think that the commenter here on on Drears website is making a fair point the Liberty very much wants to take Peterson and and put him in a mold they'd like to colonize and appropriate Peterson and his fame and Use that for their own agenda and again one might argue. This is exactly what I do This is exactly this is how we appropriate people Peterson does the same thing with you know Nietzsche Dostoevsky postmodern neo-marxism C-sec in fact almost every time I mean part of the YouTube game in terms of building your platform is Is that you look for bigger and bigger people higher up the status? Hierarchy on you to have a conversation with so that you can sort of Leverage their status and you can kind of move your way up the status hierarchy. That's how the hierarchy games are played It's also how religious conversion is played It's also how philosophical conversion is played or worldview conversion is played It's it's how all of these games are put together. So in fairness to California. Yes, that's right in fairness to Liberty University Yeah, that's why you invite someone and and so what conversations really are One might argue that every conversation is a two-movie conversations because you've got two distinct individuals But but there's this there's this subtle exchange that's going on, you know, why does Peterson go to Liberty University and not some other? Christian college well probably one of the big draws for Peterson was the size of the venue and and clearly Peterson is focused on getting his message out to as many people as possible and that's he Continually reminds us how many people he's talked to on the book tour and how many cities he's been to and again I don't think any of this thing any of this is wrong. It just identifies Part of what his agenda is He is he is looking to help individuals and part of helping individuals means getting his story out there Via videos via books and so he's he's doing all of this now Liberty also has an agenda for bringing him in on these apparently these convocations are not once-a-year things They do multiple of these I'm going to talk about that a little bit later when we get into Cultural liturgies secular liturgies Christian liturgies, but there's everybody's got an agenda and I know to a degree we like to imagine that well, I don't have an agenda I just want to be a I Just want to be a consumer of the truth But another part of me doesn't really buy it because I think everybody has an agenda to to want is to have an agenda to desire is to have an agenda and So I think we make our peace with this and we say well Liberty's trying to use Peterson and Peterson's trying to use Liberty and that's that's an element of the conversation But as I think it is in all conversations, but at the same time there's a there's a respect There's a there are there are there are rules to this game that if followed you are allowed to Be you are invited into other games and obviously if you've watched enough Peterson, you know exactly what I'm talking about California continues I've taught a couple of university classes and the thing about young people today is The second they sense that they're that you're trying to force your point of view on them. They just shut down Yeah, that's true. And so what the culture does is gets increasingly subtle about it, but We keep making this that we keep doing the same thing. You can't help but do that thing They stop listening entirely I have a very strong opinion about the subject that I teach and I have to be very Weberian about it what Peterson says about being a sovereign individual in different contexts is what makes him so powerful He really believes that we each have a spark of divinity in us and therefore Though we are all destined to get a lot of a lot wrong in life We all have the potential for great truths and I think that's exactly right. That's a huge part of Peterson's popularity the conviction and Persuasion that he brings to that message We can only get to that truth if we respect the spark the sovereignty of each person Falwell at all have none of that the future belongs to JBP That was a good letter but it but it highlights Some of what's going on on this stage now let's dig a little bit deeper with this trailer because something like a trailer is is Very much if you're doing a video your trailer you try to okay. Here's the point of the video Okay, what's the takeaway from this conversation that that Liberty and Nasser think this is the in a sense What is Liberty looking for in this probably to a degree a? Validation from Peterson now his presence there offers some validation that these comments which get selected out of the conversation are in a sense the vast Getting closest to the validation that Liberty is looking for in terms of their worldview and and so this is what they highlight in the teaser and Let's let's play it. We'll have a relationship with the transcendent like we're remarkable creatures And I think for us to call on that relationship in times of dire need is perfectly appropriate And and you're providing people with the language for doing that Okay There's so much there Let's let's listen to it again. We're actually not gonna get into this too much in this video In the next video we'll get more into the content of this but also notice the music in the background Okay, and what's what's so funny? California's comments are exactly right. There's a We all like to imagine in this culture that that we are sophisticated and urbane and not subject to the manipulations of The world and and especially young people don't don't preach to me don't shove anything down my throat don't think you can get over on me by convincing me of something I don't want to be convinced by but but again even the The teaser at the beginning of the video. This is this is a cultural literacy I'm gonna explain that term a little bit later the teaser at the beginning of the video I'm gonna pause I got a something to deal with here So so what you do obviously is you play the music underneath You've got the particular thing that Peterson is saying that for Liberty in this to movie Conversation gets closest to what they want him to say that will validate their worldview and their agenda We'll have a relationship with the transcendent Okay, the relationship with the transcendent now if you remember my god number one and god number two God number one is the imminent god. God number two is the transcendent god the conscious active agent People have a relationship with the transcendent. Okay, so now he's Does Jordan Peterson really in this moment go all the way full-blown to god number two? Well, we'll we'll get into that question It's like we're remarkable creatures and I think for us to call on that relationship For us to call on that relationship. Okay another relational word This is for us to call on god number two the the relational god the the god who hears prayer the god who Responds to prayer the god who can act in history This is this is the this is in many ways the climax for liberty of what Jordan Peterson offers them It's perfectly appropriate now That's a huge thing because when we get into the question of the coming of the secular age a lot of secularity and the dismissal of god number two is is all about It's really about social status and again Dallas Willard brings this out beautifully and that one Veritas form video that I pointed out if two people are walking Walking along and someone says well God did this in my life another person deeply secular eyes will say Should we talk like that and You know, I've you you might you might hear in some of the conversations that I do with individuals I often make the point that I think Pentecostalism isn't actually so much a theological Tradition as it is a cultural slide. It's an anti secular cultural slide That's that's what I think Pentecostalism really is it's a pushback Which is part of the reason it is so the Pentecostal Church has has grown like wildfire in the in the at the so-called developing world because it's a resistance movement to secularism and it's part of the reason that you know many people who are deeply secular will look at churches in the developing world and Call them Pentecostal even if those churches don't necessarily Embrace a label like that because what they are embracing is an Anti-secular frame which wholeheartedly embraces God number two And you're providing people with the language for doing that and you're providing people with the language for doing that. So in other words It's it's a language game now now Remember as Jordan Peterson keeps reminding us he chooses his words very carefully. He's chosen these words very carefully and If you read maps of meaning if you read, you know these everything every word that Jordan Peterson said there was intentionally chosen and But this is as close as Liberty gets to something that okay, this is to our agenda So let's let's fold. Let's put this in the in the preview with the nice, you know guitar underneath and And Get the video because it's a two-camera video here get the video of Nasser shaking his head I mean all of this is in there even if we're it's going back. It's going by so fast We're we're not paying a lot of attention to it. But just like just like Just like mr. Plinkett says you might not know it your little conscious self, but your brain sees it Let someone know that there's more That they can call on that they may then they may have yet called on I think can be extraordinarily useful Okay, but they can call on that they may as yet called on Wow now what follows is Liturgy and again this for many of you might just have been the throwaway part of the video But this is not throwaway. This is We are always all expressing ourselves in even the detail of what we're doing if you if you watch a movie and There's there's stuff in the background in the decor how people are dressed all those items are Communicating to our brains and that's why mr. Plinkett says you might not have seen it, but your brain did so All of this is happening. Okay, and and so you might look that's I mean even this little beginning section is I mean, this is boilerplate. They probably begin lots of their movies with this little montage But what is this montage saying and see I would assert that this montage is cultural Liturgy and I'll explain that in a little bit with a little bit from one of Jamie Smith's book So let's just just just watch the montage a little bit Okay, so What's going on there? Well? Let's Let's next frame this a little bit Okay, so I think this is I don't know all these people and I'm not gonna bother looking I think this is is this Jeff Foxworthy and I know in the comment section, you'll clean this up Conservative comedian who's known for some of his conservative comments Obviously at one of the convocations. Well, why? Does is he a Christian I don't know maybe as a Christian but but also again you have the words in the world and And I don't know who this vocalist is but Those of you who pay attention to church cultures will say okay, this is a certain kind of church This is a certain kind of church that really got It was it was really you could find it on TV before the seeker movement But but Willow Creek and this and Saddleback and many other churches in the seeker movement really popularized it Oops And So, you know here here her arms are out. It's expressive This is this is not an Eastern Orthodox Church. This is not a Roman Catholic Church This is not a Roman Catholic Church I had a when I had to talk with the the pastor of the Anglican parish where we did the the conference in in Melbourne the You know many of that many of the Anglican churches are going to this style of worship some are some aren't Here's another kid. This is the this is the the cable guy, right? This is the cable guy and he's got the Liberty University hat on But he's got the cutoff sleeves and he's in the south and so he's doing his stick but again, this is this is all liturgy and I don't know who these people are but I bet you they're famous. I Don't know who he is, but he's got to be famous obviously a famous vocalist a famous guitarist He's singing and and Liberty and is in a sense saying this is this is what we want to be associated with I don't know who this guy is I don't know who this guy is Hey Here's the guard for the the Golden State Warriors, you know, Freddie if Freddie was on stage at that moment He'd be you know, he'd be he'd be terribly excited and this guy is an outspoken Christian and he and his wife Do a make a lot of Christian method messages and oh, there's David Nassar over there in the corner Well, what does and you've got the Liberty logo in the background? What is going on with this what what what is all of this business about well, this is all about Association and creating relationships and and And we stand with Stefan Curry. That's his name. I think it could be the wrong boy if I get it wrong Freddie's gonna be upset You know, he's he's one of us and and we got Jordan Peterson here on stage And so he's one of us and you know, mr California says yeah should have left Peterson on stage alone now, you're not gonna do that because this is all about Association with each other and Bernie Sanders and again somebody in the comment section made a comment about political that then and I very much understood this comment that well In terms of the value hierarchy Liberty puts their conservative politics above their Christianity I don't think it's that simple. It's much more like this and and I think it's actually to Liberty Liberty's credit and they might say ah, but that But they brought Bernie Sanders in and they gave him a platform and they let him speak and make his points and you know Again in all fairness when you talk about free speech. Isn't this what a university is for? Yeah, we're looking at you Cambridge This is what a university is for to to invite your rivals and Adversaries and have them make their best points So kudos to you Liberty when you bring someone on stage that is very much not in line With your president giving thumbs up with Donald Trump. So good for you, but but all of this is part of this liturgy. Oh NFL quarterback can't think of is Michael Got in trouble for dogfighting and here he's talking to David Nassar and probably a bit of confession And talks about how he did wrong and what he learned after he went to you know Was convicted for dogfighting and repented and that's very much a Christian story And so you've got your chaplain on stage working through that story with him and that's compelling Okay, all of this is liturgy And here's your pastor David Nassar And here's your pastor David Nassar and I don't know who this guy is and I know who this guy is he's the president of the university and Inspiring now we pull back and now we're getting into some other cultural literatures liturgies because we have a Venue here that is sort of like a modern stadium and you've got the big screens up top and we've got the arena below and here You've got probably some famous band singing with a packed house all of this communicates to us and it communicates validation authenticity and and Mr. California says well young people don't want anything shoved down their mouth Ah, so what we do is we build it into the liturgy and oh, no, nobody's nobody's convincing us of anything Oh, yes, they are everything communicates to us That the architecture of the building the art on the wall the number of people The the trailer to the video all of the little pieces are telling us who we are and what we are And and even the fact, you know, here's this is a Liberty University convocation This might be opening worship, but but again if you're if you're a pastor, you know All this stuff is this is this Orthodox worship is this Roman Catholic worship is this Anglican worship? This is all liturgy but now tending to be in in low church like Liberty University's liturgical tradition This is the the liturgy is implicit And I don't know who she is and Hey, John McEnroe bad boy of tennis if you're old enough to remember him and here he's here He's doing something. But again, this is oh, this is celebrity culture bring in the celebrities these this is what? Celebrity is for so that you can you know Pay him a fee and bring him in and identify with him and and so on and so forth And I don't know who this guy is. I don't know who this guy is Is this are these? There I think I know who he is Maybe I don't but obviously singer. I don't know who this guy is. I think that's I think that's the Duck Dynasty daughter Kind of looks like her and again culture celebrity all of this comes together motivational so so the dog fighting quarterback in you know, that's Inspirational how he had a change in life and you've got your you've got your pastor up there to you know to facilitate that Conversion conversation and now you've got I think it's the Duck Dynasty girl and she's gonna talk about how Jesus is important But the fact that Duck Dynasty has its own TV show again That's that's validation in our culture and we're going to talk a little bit about the way the monarchical vision and crowd sourcing and validation all in fact works together and And again back to now again now now with all the identity stuff race is really important You want to make sure you got enough black folks on stage and and David Nassar is a person of color And that's really important for a school like a school like Liberty to well They're not going to play that identity game But I'll tell you when you do your hiring if you can get a your chaplain as a as a person of color Well that helps out in that in that right Wheaton So Tim's my friend, but it's just true It's just true and and so okay. Let's put people up a color on stage and that way we'll we'll clothe ourselves and an anti-racism thing and and that's in a sense the the the facile simplistic ways that institutions Institutions navigate our our current identity culture laden conversations And what do we have here? Well if you go if you go all the way back to The piece that drear made young benedict and basketball jesus well I don't want to lose my slide plays too much Well now we're going to have a wrestling ring and we're going to have wrestlers here That's going to be convocation and And you know, we're going to play this liturgy, but we're going to bring this into a jesus-y thing Okay, and Evangelicalism is huge on this. This is in a sense The the christ and culture move that evangelicals make about this kind of thing is is enormous and and drear Writing as an orthodox christian now someone who is now in the orthodox church finds this repulsive evangelicals call this evangelism and Well, I think that in itself isn't an enormous an enormous conversation And uh franches chan, you know big big character in evangelicalism You know, he's a he's a celebrity pastor. That's very well known and I don't know who this guy is and up Is that there you've got and with the president and his wife, you know blunt some of the misogyny charges against evangelicals So You know that's that's always important to keep talking about the wife keep her present and and again i'm not i'm not saying that this is All manipulative or wrong. I'm just saying that these are the cultural liturgies that get embedded And in fact we respond to them And and we work with them. This is the this is the basic material that we use to communicate Unicate and and now the end of the montage we the champions And I don't know who this is this could be david nasser, but the the theater the lights now again You wouldn't see this in a roman catholic or an orthodox setting. I mean you wouldn't you wouldn't forefront the the um The the speakers that are you know, those speakers are there pointing to the person on stage so the person on stage can actually hear How they're sounding the the drum kit that Some people talk about you know, the the you put your drummer in an aquarium and and this has become this has become liturgy This has become Synonymous you've got the you've got the lights. I mean, this is theater. This is um stage This has become liturgy For much of the church in north america now and again i'm not making a i'm not making a value judgment about that There's plenty that can be said about that But I want to point out the liturgy because it is functioning within this entire conversation all right, and And there's the One last question presented by liberty university. Okay And and I want to contrast this with let's say jonathan peugeot's liturgy which so jonathan just did a video on on mass shootings and jonathan begins with an opening montage with a little bit about little introduction to the video i'm gonna this is the old saw with Talking i'm gonna tell you what i'm gonna say i'm gonna say it and then i'm gonna tell you what I said It's kind of this old way of framing The presentation but so so jonathan begins with his little teaser up front and then Da da da da and he has the music This is the symbolic world and he's got you know, you come into it This is again i'm not making a judgment on any of this but but all of this is liturgy And and even though we're not paying attention to it It is forming us it is creating us. It is it is getting us Ready, that's that's what liturgies do You Now now i'm going to read a little bit from james k smith. He's a philosopher at calvin college. He's He's been doing what what he and baker books call a cultural a cultural liturgies Series and and james k smith talks about this with respect to world view and christian education And cultural formation and and he begins this book with a with a little imaginary story about martian anthropologists And he says basically what if some martian anthropologists would come to earth? We turn the camera gaze and let it hang now again. We're using a movie liturgy even into this thing We turn the camera we turn that camera gaze and let it hang somewhere you see all the time But perhaps without seeing it So you might imagine that we are martian anthropologists who have come to the strange world of 21st century north america In order to gather data on rituals and religious habits of its inhabitants. Okay, what is religion? You know that which is axiomatic that the deepest desires um of our heart Having having made our way from mars equipped with the tools of An ethnograph description we are going to mention to one of the culture's most common religious sites and observe it with eyes that are focused On the religious aspects of its ritual. So join me today as we approach the site Now the big thing is we're not going to a cathedral. We're not going to a church We're not even going to a christian college. We're going to a shopping mall And those of you who are familiar with calvin college know that this is Calvin has been working this Area for quite a number of years which makes jamie smith really fit in there The layout of this temple has architectural echoes that hark back to medieval cathedrals Mammoth religious spaces that can absorb all kinds of different religious activities all at one time So one might say that this religious building has a winding labyrinth for contemplation Alongside which are innumerable chapels devoted to various saints as we wander the labyrinth in contemplation preparing to enter one of the chapels We're struck by the rich iconography iconography Sorry, sorry jonathan iconography That lines the walls and interior spaces unlike the flattened descriptions of saints one might find in stained glass windows Here and an array of three-dimensional icons adorned in garb that as with all iconography inspires us to be imitators of these exemplars One of them would be the apple store the cult of apple These statues and icons embody for us the concrete images of the good life Here is a religious proclamation that does not traffic and abstracted ideals or rules or doctrines But rather offers to the imagination pictures and statues and moving images while other religions are promising salvation Through the thin dry media of books and messages This new global religion is offering embodied pictures Of the redeemed that invite us to imagine ourselves in their shoes quite often literally shoes To imagine ourselves otherwise and thus willingly submit to the disciplines that produce the saints evoked in the icons This is liturgy and so there's liturgy in the mall and it's all formation Here again, we need to appreciate the catholicity Of this iconography these same icons of the good life are found in such temples across the country and around the world The symbols and colors and images associated with their religious life are readily recognized the world over branders Icons of brands in fact that circle is target dick sporting goods You don't even need to be able to read the letters often to know Best buy the yellow tag the colors that the the logo for apple. It's all iconography You see through it to the good life that it is pretending now now mr California is right young people don't like to think that stuff is being shoved down their mouth shoved down their throats, but Marketers are shoving it down their throats all the time or rather just with a spoonful of sugar or maybe a constant Drip drip drip drip drip. This is all forming us all the time Wide circulation of these icons through various mediums even outside the sanctuary invites us to make the pilgrimage in the first place This temple like countless others now emerging around the world offers a rich embodied visual mode of Evangelism that attracts us. This is a gospel whose power is beauty Which speaks to our deepest desires and compels us to come not with dire moralisms But rather with a winsome invitation to share in this envisioned good life Yet one should note that it has its own modes of exclusivity, too Because of its overwhelming success in converting the nations. It is increasingly difficult to be an infidel There's lots of exclusivity because of course The higher the price the more exclusive and that's what exclusive costly brands are about and that's what we're talking about The more expensive costly brands are about and that's what if you go to a concert or if you go to a jordan peterson event you want access to the vip Reception and i'll be talking about that actually because there's a private event coming up in san francisco that i'm going to mention in an upcoming video but So there's a teaser so i'm doing it too. In fact, we're all doing it We can't help but do it we do it all the time and that in fact sets up the multiple movies we're living within All right, let me finish the the highlighting and it is a mode of evangelism buoyed by a trans Transnational network of evangelists and outreach all speaking a kind of unified message that puts other fractured religions to shame and on it goes but this is the The liturgy of the suburban mall and it's multinational when I was just in australia I'm often interested to see The the impacts of americanization Around the world and instead of burger king you have hungry jack then there's mcdonald's everywhere and if you I went into costco in in melbourne and Wasn't it interesting? Wasn't it interesting? now Well, let's let's go back to the let's go back to the video Hey, so we just came off the convocation stage with dr peterson. Thank you so much for being here What an against nassar is a very gracious host an honor Uh, we have 88 convocations a year and see if the convocations aren't exactly what I thought it was But okay, if you once or twice, uh does uh our entire audience all 10 000 students find themselves giving a unanimous standing ovation and that's not to say that the other guests aren't phenomenal, but I think you really connected with them today, sir, and um, it was great to see not so much now that Again, we're talking about liturgies this unanimous standing ovation This is part of the reason that's built into their liturgies So you've got star promotion and again The reason we call them stars is because we navigate by them in our religious cultural liturgies That's why we call them stars and and because we look up to the heavens and in a sense Celebrity astrology we look to the heavens and this is how we guide our lives if you're a fashion designer get the get the Get the women Wearing your dress on the red carpet so they can act like a star that we navigate by And make our decisions because just like with astrology we see the future in the stars. Well You see the future in the stars even in hollywood Now renee gyrard comes into the conversation here because of the whole idea of memetic desire that when When everyone is paying attention to jordan peterson Well, I should pay attention to jordan peterson and and again this is i'm not saying this is a bad thing Because we have our kind of pushback from it. No, I don't want to i'm going to be a contrarian I'm not going to pay attention to what everyone is and that then itself becomes a liturgy But but part of the reason we pay attention to what everyone is paying attention to is because again Jonathan height we are deeply heard animals and and the elephants are are You know, the riders are up there chattering and the elephants are down there They're always watching each other in their peripheral vision. And if they all look, you know, you watch the prairie dogs You know look look look one dog starts yapping. We all start yapping. This is this is how we work and and there's validation then with crowd sourcing and and in fact I've talked spoken before about this monarchical vision, which is this the solitary vision of the world of objects well, it's also the the imagination of objectivity and because we can't actually do objectivity because our Consciousness is by nature subjective We we try to approximate objectivity with multiplication So if we have we we can't obviously We can't obviously observe every interchange or causal relationship in the world so we sample enough of them by statistics and read the um Read the book on pragmatism that peterson keeps promoting and um and charles Forget his name The the great pragmatist who came up with statistics We crowd source and that's that's how we that's how we create a good enough facsimile Of the monarchical vision in order to produce our science upon it We we don't live long enough to see all the patterns So we watch each other and we borrow the pattern recognition from each other And that's how we direct our gaze and that's why celebrity and popularity and validation And star power that's why that all works and that's why we use it and and again To explain to make it flat. I'm i'm not saying i'm not trying to dismiss it but it's helpful to recognize what we're doing because When you get into the realm of things that don't fit the patterns Well as jordan peterson says that's where you should pay attention but but also our easy dismissive Posture of things which don't fit the patterns that we're accustomed to we live very short lifespans We we live for a certain amount of time and we don't have enough time to experience everything So we look at each other and we learn from each other and we adopt those assumptions of each other All of this is going on in this process Okay In your words, but the spirit by which you delivered them the humility that you had And then okay, you'll you'll hear david nasser again and again go back to peterson's authenticity And and the humility now again if you read read some of the comments in drear This is this is a really big thing that is happening And and and well, why is that important for us? Why is us? Why is it important actually? I play these same games too. I'm a pastor I work in this stuff. I I work in convincing people and one of the things that you learn implicitly as a pastor and then at some degree you learn explicitly and again we we sometimes get concerned when people are learning this stuff Explicitly because somehow if it's explicit we say well, that's not authentic But the pastor who's using their intuitions to know just at the timing to make the pitch and tell the emotional story Am I being manipulated? Well Do you care whether you're being manipulated by someone's Implicit instincts or their explicit instincts Well, you do care Well, why well think about that? It's really important. So so as a pastor you learn the timing And you learn to control the voice And you move into the camera And you slow it down And you deepen it and See now you can do this and there's that famous moment when when bill clinton is is, you know Shedding a tear on stage and he walks off the stage and then people say aha inauthentic and so we look to emotions as authentic partly because Again, if you look at the body language people a lot of this stuff that we're doing is in fact, we're not real good at doing it Intentionally, I think all this stuff is laden. We're not real good at doing it intentionally And so we're actually very good observers of each other's eyes And and so what what moves nasser is he looks at peterson and he notices Peterson is being authentic and and that's why again and again people come up and say ah peterson's a charlatan If he's a charlatan, he's one of the best i've ever seen because I I don't get the sense that he's Deceiving us or lying to us or being inauthentic. I think this is exactly who he is and he's telling us Exactly. What's what's going on? So What was not on our schedule Uh to have a student who was there not a liberty student But a friend of a liberty student was there a college-aged young man who unexpectedly jumped on stage? And and you know cried out for help to you dramatic embodiment of the problem. Yes. Okay Okay What was not on our schedule and again someone someone else writing in from dreer Um on my part. I love this man's compassion and empathy that christians find so exceptional and moving is not a christian Someone again writing to dreer's first first blog post on this I mean, correct me if i'm wrong But it would seem that christian that christians are actually drawn to the wisdom empathy and compassion of this non-christian. They are here's one They can only just barely believe that he's not a believer read that all the time in the facebook comments I really think he's a believer. He's just hiding it because this way he has reach of his atheist audience First of all, we're not that simple second of all, I think he's being totally honest about what he believes I mean, is that even possible? No, no, he's probably secretly or latently a christian Peterson is on a mission from god. He just doesn't know it yet He just doesn't know it yet you hear this all the time in the peterson conversations and then it'll come up in the because just again This is two movie conversations here. Okay, two movie conversations. We're all at least two We're all coming at it with our own point of view. That's called projection Oh now we're bringing a sciency word into it now. We're bringing a psychological word into it. Is it projection? Maybe As for the young man who interrupted the event I have a little experience with such and with such disruptions This is a point I made in my last video having grown up evangelical in four square churches Rare was the sunday when something like this didn't happen in liberty-esque mill you Such as happening is derrigger Peterson's obvious unfamiliarity with the culture sufficiently explains his reaction Evangelicals probably experience acute distress and other emotional stress And emotional difficulties at about the same rate as other humans But the but the culture encourages the very public airing of said distress and difficulties. That's true Now What how do you want to evaluate that? Is is that? Authenticity is that in authenticity once it becomes a liturgy within the context then can we dismiss it as inauthentic? see none of this is as easy or as simple as the liturgies we propose because I personally think that's a good thing and You might say well the cultural litters liturgy of a therapist's office Is that in fact you do disclose it is the whole thing is set up for it. The door is closed It's just you and the counselor the guy is legally required to keep your secrets and the courts validate that I remember one time that in in our church and we We've done this once or twice in the 20 years i've been here I I had some people share their stories and and it was really powerful sunday and some of the people who shared their stories were quite Appreciative of the opportunity to share their story because sometimes there's tremendous power in disclosing something that had been hidden But I remember one person from the congregation who afterwards I didn't hear it directly because she was very polite and didn't want to say this and you know, this would be this would be conceived as criticism, but Person basically said, you know save this for the therapist's office. This doesn't belong in a public realm ah Public private All of these issues are at play here And it's not acute Evangelicals probably experience acute distress and other emotional difficulties at about the same rate as other humans But the culture encourages the very public airing of said distress and difficulties And if it's not acute distress interrupting sunday worship it's speaking in tongues or some kind of emergency spiritual intervention Let's just say that public high drama is a feature not a bug of these big evangelical gatherings And this is what you hear with David nasser. This is this is god's appointment for this right? This is this is the liturgy of that Situation it's it's also sort of a liturgy in a peterson thing. But again peterson's Liturgy for his events are not anywhere near as well developed and and peterson is in many ways A bit of a neophyte when it comes to the religious and and this is part of that reality in in some sense Gives him an authenticity But it also makes him vulnerable. And so if jordan peterson had bought a church He he would have had to get up to speed on all of these kinds of things now tomorrow i'm gonna post a Conversation that I did with with cassidy again and this time instead of talking about tipless restaurants. She wants to talk about Jordan peterson, which was cool. And so we talked about jordan peterson. She's like what about women and jordan peterson, you know, because These dudes are just really hung up on him and and i'm not quite so taken by him And so we talked about that and and she's also Some of the things we'll talk about here. She's also got more of a foundationalist Assumption about the way her epistemology works more than jordan peterson does actually more than I do too, but So there's a lot going on with all of this stuff and it's all built in and so in many ways if you slow it down Tease out the multiple screens as as scott adams often Encourages us to do and pay attention to the multiple movies Well in your little conscious self you can learn something What are you going to do with that power? Let's just say that the public high drama is a feature not a bug of these big evangelical gatherings in my humbling humble opinion Because it keeps the narrative going. We're all broken. It's exactly right. It keeps it's part of the liturgy. I mean I mean look how ready for it the church staff was exactly. They're very ready now drear um, i'd be worried about not reading too much into it now drear kind of comes back on this And come on. Are you sure that you're not projecting your skepticism and hostility of christianity onto this situation now? He might know this particular commenter I don't that happens when you've got a blog and regular commenters or youtube and regular regular people in the comments section What can I tell most christians are surprised by how much the unbelieving clinical psychologist has to say favorably about the faith Even though he doesn't share it and our surprise that his compassion is not a matter of wow a non-christian is compassionate. No Non-christians are compassionate. They have motor neurons and hearts and feelings just like everybody else, right? They do It's more a matter of being startled by how genuine his compassion for strangers seems to be And that's important because the liturgy of vulnerability that you would find in a church like this is in contrast to the the non-breakable liturgies in many other churches And again, i'm not drawing a value judgment between them But they're because there's power in both and and in fact, there's almost always power in the exception to the rule So if in a christian reform church the the the congregation of the frozen chosen at least more than it was 20 30 years ago It's quite a bit more evangelicalized now in many many places But 20 30 years ago if someone would raise their hand by being moved by a song That's that's your well, what's the liturgy it's conformity it's we're all doing the same thing boy. There's power in that So say we all Do but the breaking the pattern well, there's power in that too. It's it's liturgy and The more you move around these communities the more familiar you are with these liturgies but now the the breaking up and I completely liberty didn't stage this guy doing it, but they're ready for it because And now it might not hardly ever happen because liberty's got a big crew and when you have a big crew you have less Room for spontaneity because it's a spontaneity of 12 000 people can't be had within a half hour Okay, so you have time and you have all those things but you know, there's a lot going on here um There's an uh, I was emailed I was emailed with a reader last night about peterson and why he's uncanny effort on people I mentioned that there's a certain urgency about him that seems real. Yeah, there it is authenticity And then peterson the dramatic embodiment of the problem. Well, what problem? Ah, what problem? the meaning crisis Could be that's now we're getting into the idw separate, you know alternate meaning You know, this is eric weinstein's an alternate meaning system Well, what is that about? Well now we're looking at two movies. We're looking at multiple movies Well the current mall Anthropology that satisfaction of our material needs and wants is sufficient to bring in the kingdom That's the assumption of a materialist frame. That's the assumption in fact of in many ways a marxist frame Because the the worker is alienated from the product of their labor In other words the product of their labor and their Reunion with the product of their labor with that material with that economic satisfaction Ought to bring in fact the kingdom ought to be on top of the city of god That's what the summa bonum the greatest good that's where we're going So so current mall Anthropology the current mall liturgy is supposed to make us happy and in fact the entire world has been swept up in this liturgy and We're wealthier than we've ever been we're more secure than we've ever been We're healthier than we've ever been and if you listen to sam harris or steven pinker It's just going to continue and get better and better and better Or maybe it won't if we all cook ourselves to death with co2 or whatever but The alligator I remember I visited an alligator park in in florida And noticed all these alligators just sitting in the warm water and I asked you know Do they get bored because you know i've got a cat and a dog in the house right now and they get bored and so They spar and they come on us and they do all these things because they've got more developed animals and people have bigger brains He says ah the alligator has a really small brain put him in some warm water throw him some chicken They just sit there and they stay fat and happy And that gets into the materials conception well with these people with these large brains and these large brains causes a problem because Not only do we want just not only we're not just satisfied with with food and sex and all that But we want to get rid of all these things we want more and this of course sets up tolstoy's confessions It's a great little book if you've never read it. I should probably do more of it in my videos But it's a it's a tremendous little book. So This is the heart of the meaning crisis when why is it that that people like san jose high school had a For a while a very high suicide rate These are the people at the top of what high school kids should have their parents are committed their parents are well informed They're affluent their parents can give them anything they anything they could want except perhaps a two biological parent household because You know, they couldn't make the marriage work But but what is it about us in this meaning crisis? This is the heart and in many ways a version of this is what launched peterson the cold war You've got the united states and the soviet union and they're going to destroy each other over what? ideology You know the soviets that's supposed to be closer to the kingdom than those capitalist americans by virtue of marxist ideology, but Didn't work out that way so So so what is it with us that the story verse matters so much and meaning we're we're willing to suffer We're willing to endure pain for the sake of meaning the mother, you know, just think about this in the 50s and 60s Oh, we have all these powerful drugs now women no longer have to Suffer with childbirth you can do an epidural and they won't feel a thing Yeah, but what what do many of the moms opt for? natural childbirth Well, no, we can do the epidural and it'll be really it'll really be safe. Well, but it's not natural. It's not Meaningful so in a weird inversion of genesis 3 we we women have pain in childbirth for meaning because Like the old don mcclain song The more you pay The more it's worth So what we're looking at here in the meaning crisis is a deep crisis of secular theological anthropology Well, let's let's dig into the meaning crisis a little bit and of course john vervecki who Videos i've been following quite closely and I want to continue to do some videos on them and at some point john And I are going to have a conversation but I wanted to get further into his videos to Because he's teaching me a whole ton of stuff I didn't know anything about and and I need to assimilate it so that I you know, hopefully we can have the best conversation we can at least Initially, but but but what is the meaning crisis and I think of some of the more recent videos he's laid it out nicely The properties of these higher states of consciousness we Welcome back. I should point out, notice the liturgy, the music, the art, the symbolism. I mean, this is all put together. And again, I'm not, I'm not saying it's inauthentic. I'm not criticizing it in any way. I'm just saying these are the liturgies we adopt. And in fact, every time I begin a video and say, hi, this is Paul, there's a liturgy. Welcome back to awakening from the meaning crisis. So we have been engaged in a very long discussion because we're talking about a topic that is central about the possibility of enlightenment and to try and make. Now pay attention to that word. We're going to come back to it again and again, enlightenment. And he actually makes the point in one of these videos that this, this is deeply connected with Christianity and glory, the cavode, the, the, the, the pillar of fire by, by night, the, the, the Shekinah glory of the Lord that fills the temple and lightening glory. This is where we're looking for the city of God here. And we associate it with light and light. Now, when you say enlightenment in, let's say a Buddhist context, you mean one thing when you talk about the enlightenment in the Western context, you're talking about another thing, and actually there is a connection between these two things that we're going to have to point out that something plausibly accessible to us, rather than something wrapped and shrouded in read CS Lewis's till we have faces. Why are dark places, holy places? Instead, we've been trying to understand this from a cognitive science perspective that could tell us why these higher states of consciousness might in fact provide a means for the radical self transformation. Now, part of the reason I'm going to back this up here, cause this is really important. Why do we want to study this scientifically? Well, because science has provided for us outcomes that we have enjoyed. And if you read Harari, we are no longer subject to disease or war or these, or these other things that have plagued humanity and science has provided this. So we have an association of trust in science that, well, if we can, but it's important to recognize what science does and its relationship with technology. If we can understand it, then we can employ it. Then we can achieve the outcomes we desire. Where do the outcomes we desire come from though? They're coming from us too. So, what are the outcomes that science provides? These higher states of consciousness might in fact provide a means for the radical self transformation, self transcendence. Self transcendence. So transcendence is where we, we get above and we look down. Self transcendence, we get above ourself and we can actually look at ourself and understand ourself. So, what is this? This is the idea of God. And you have to ask yourself, well, who, who, who's, who's looking down at ourself? And, and now we get later into this video. I'm not going to have time to get into this today. We get later into this video. It's going to be, well, that's God. Well, what, what, what is God? Well, God's this idea. God is, is God then this projection? Firebuck? Freud? Is there actually a consciousness that is looking down? What do you mean by actually? And actually Alvin Plante and Gui who I'll go to towards the end of this video. Doesn't talk about it in this book, but I'm going to talk about this book a little bit. I'm going to have to get to this book at some point. That's where we're going to go. Enhanced inner peace and connectedness to reality that are the central legacy of the Axial Age, the descendants. Enhanced inner peace and connectedness to reality that are the central legacy of the Axial Age revolution and that are still needed today, even if we no longer believe in the mythology of the Axial Age religions. Now, right there is Verbecky's thesis. And so we, life is suffering. Peterson's basic thing. Verbecky, we employed Axial Age technologies, mythologies in order to transcend the suffering with meaning. And that's what these Axial Age religions and worldviews that we inhabited, that we embodied, that was built into our architecture, that was built into how we spend our time and we were surrounded ourselves with liturgies of the Axial Age. And we lived embodied in this community. And whenever something bad happened, we said, well, in Christian places, well, the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. All the way back to Job. Job's very early. And so we employed these Axial Age technologies to not only survive, but thrive in a world of suffering. But now we can no longer believe in these Axial Age mythologies. And this is in a sense, sort of where Peterson and Verbecky differ because Verbecky in a sense, buys the premise and says, well, let's see what we can salvage from Axial Age technologies and bring through cognitive science and correct me if I'm wrong, John, bring me through, bring through cognitive science and therefore redeem via science as acceptable in the world now. Peterson is sort of in there. It's unclear. But the effect that Peterson is having is turning people back towards and saying, denying Verbecky's premise and saying, I think we can still hold Axial Age worldviews. And that's it. So if you look at Peugeot, the Orthodox, which is the oldest of the Christian traditions, that's if Pentecostalism is a denial of secularity on a cultural front, Orthodoxy is an all out rebellion against it. And Jonathan Peugeot's channel and what he's doing with symbolism, he's welcome to the symbolic world. He is welcoming you in. That's the liturgy. And churches do the same thing. I'm a Christian pastor. You know, when someone writes me and says they've converted to Christianity, it isn't like Jordan Peterson says to James at the signing thing and that video that James Fox Higgins puts there. Peterson's like, oh no. And he says, you know, converted from nihilism. And Peterson says, well, that's an upgrade, you know, but someone says to me I've converted to Christianity. I celebrate. Well, why do I celebrate? Because I'm part of that Axial Age religion. But Verbecky's got a point here because, and this is what Christian theologians and pastors have been working on for the last number of hundred years to say, well, how do we negotiate these discordant factors going on? Can I still believe in God when I read Genesis one and it's a flat earth and a dome and a temple on top? Yeah. Apollo goes all the way to the moon and round. How do those two worlds fit together? And so in that sense, Peugeot and Peterson and myself and Verbecky, we've all got similar projects and we're all doing it in different ways. And so is Liberty University. So two movies, at least two movies, and we're all figuring out where this conversation lies. Let's see. Let's look on the second one because. People have an alternative state of consciousness. Welcome back to Awakening from the Meaning Crisis. Last time we were discussing the Axial Age within ancient India and we were focusing in on a pivotal figure of Sattartha Gautama, the Buddha. And now the Buddha is an interesting, I think I've got my Karen Armstrong book. No, that's Longing for Holiness. Where is that book? I should really be ready for my videos. Oh, here it is. Right next to Houston Smith on Islam. I'm going to make myself bigger. Karen Armstrong on the Buddha. This was a, I read this book a number of years ago. It was very helpful for me to understand Buddhism because I live in California and I have all these secular Buddhists around me and it's like, well, I, being a sneaky pastor, I want to know more about their religion than they know, which in Northern California isn't actually that hard because people don't read books. Anyway, the story of Sattartha Gautama. Well, here's a man who, in a sense, is living in a secular frame. His father doesn't want him to see death. His father doesn't want him to suffer. And because his father has all of this wealth, he prevents that until he sees the sick person, the old person, learns about death, and then he goes on the religious quest. And you can see why, well, yes, this people read this story and that's our story, but, but you no longer have to be a king. Well, we live in this with helicopter parents in a bubble-wrapped world and we don't want our children to know anything bad. We're going to create safe spaces for them. It's the story of the Buddha all over again. And, you know, so, so follow the story. Well, how does this work? Where we, what are the strategies? What are the, what are the outcomes? We had been talking about his particular story. We talked about the two modes of being that were being represented in his story of leaving the palace, the having mode and the being mode. And we talked about modal confusion and about overcoming it. We followed him to where he's sitting under the Bodhi tree and he achieves a deep kind of realization, a deep state of enlightenment. He receives enlightenment. Now, again, but if you understand anything about Buddhism, what is that enlightenment? Well, it's an axial age technology. He is, there's a, you're answering questions about what is real. Well, if you're within that framework, well, what is real? Well, you realize, listen to the, my favorite band as a teenager was Kansas, Dust in the Wind. All we are is dust in the wind. It's very Buddhist. Along the way, we had discussed what mindfulness is, how mindfulness operates through attentional scaling and how it can increase your cognitive flexibility, your capacity for insight. And then we were trying to draw this all together with some cognitive science, a discussion of what is it to experience enlightenment? Now, what is it to experience enlightenment? I'm not offering right now a complete account or anything like a comprehensive theory of enlightenment. We're going to be slowly working towards that as we move through this lecture series. But I do want to get into and continue the discussion of these higher states of consciousness. So if you remember, they're very problematic, but that they're at the core of many of the axial age. Why are they problematic? They're problematic in the secular frame, world religions and foundational philosophies. This is the idea that people have an alternative state of consciousness that they regard as somehow more real than their everyday state of consciousness. And now that's going to be key in terms of watching this video between Nassar and Peterson, because really what's at at heart of the two movies that they're trying to work through is the question, what is more real? Well, what is real? And that's problematic precisely because we tend to judge realness by how well we get an overall coherence in our intelligibility. How we're making sense of things. And problematic precisely because we tend to judge realness by how well we get an overall coherence in our intelligibility, how we're making sense of things. We get realness, the overall, it's a coherence, you know, and this is where you get into Ian McGill, Kristen, the question of what is rationality? Is it in fact a coherence function that we use in our minds? And this is where you get into the monarchical vision and crowdsourcing the patterns. Reality is coherence with the majority of patterns that we see, but now not just majority, because we're not impartial observers, as Peterson continued to beat Sam Harris over the head with in their talks. There's an a priori structure that in fact, once the patterns develop, they bind and blind. And then all we see is the patterns and then we commit to the pattern. We commit to the ideology, we commit to the worldview, and therefore we see other worldviews as a threat because nobody likes being poked in their axioms. And so that's why you've got Peterson and Nassar and, in one sense, they're having a wonderfully congenial conversation. On another hand, they're navigating, they're navigating, they're using each other, Liberty offered Peterson a big stage. Liberty is, Peterson has a big crowd, that's why they invited Peterson. And you'd hear Jerry Falwell Jr. say, well, you got all these followers on social media and are just really, but Jerry Falwell Jr., he's not going to buy any of this. He's got his own status, remember, status binds and blinds. But what is most real? It's that which fits my patterns. Watch rationality rules. He's got this coherence thing that he works on, but he's got his frame and he's trying to, he's trying to see how it coheres to his frame. You're going to hear Nassar do exactly the same thing in this video because it's the word of God. That's his frame. How do, how does this data cohere to his frame? This is what, in fact, reality is. Now, worldviews, the most real world, worldviews are the frames in which we evaluate reality and these determine places and value hierarchies. Okay. That's what worldviews do. They govern these hierarchies and they are made up of these hierarchies. Conflicting worldviews will lead to differing expectations. And you see this in the David Rushing, you see this in the David Rushing, the stage episode because, well, look at Nassar's, something predestined by God for David's good and the edification of the community. That's Nassar's point of view. That's how he's reading it in his movie. For Peterson, it's an embarrassment, pretty hard on David. That's right. An embarrassment that for the sake of dignity and David is an individual, something to be edited out and pretty hard on David, but also notice Liberty's cameras cut it. This was unexpected. They weren't sure what to make of this, but then, you know, Nassar, he's the leader, he's the pastor, just like the person who wrote into Drernos, he puts it together. So, boy, God's a tricky character. Peterson says, you can say that again. Look at what happened here. But there's two views of it. Well, what's happening? Now, they both say, well, this is the meaning crisis. Liberty will say, yeah, you secularists have given up on God. Peterson will say, well, you know, none of that is justifiable. Maybe. He's an open agnostic, but I'm going to work God 1.0. I'm going to reestablish God number one, and I'm going to keep creeping up God 1.1, God 1.2, God 1.3, and I'm going to build as much of God as I can because we need that God. Go all the way to the teaser. We need to be able to call to the transcendence in order to address the meaning crisis. And in a sense, Peterson is working exactly the same problem as Vervecky, but coming at it from a different place. Listen to Vervecky on Rebel Medium. I thought that was a great interview, and I hope they do more of it. So, you know, we're all working on the same things here, boys and girls. We're differing worldviews. But what works? Now, pay attention to all the times you hear Peterson say in this video, does it work? Because what works is always dependent upon the frame, because it works for something towards an end. There's an implicit limit. This is actually an implicit limit of pragmatism in that often the telos, the star that you're trying to align with is implicit. And the implicit, if you listen to the 2015, if the 2015 transliminal interview, that it's his pragmatism, because that's how he's built on Darwin, that which promotes survival. But you've always got the question, to promote survival of what? The descendants of any life, the descendants of bipeds? What if as we, you know, get smartphones in us, we become these increasing cyborgs? Good for what? Pragmatism says it's the best we've got, but it has an implicit telos. It does. And Jordan Peterson's pragmatism is based on survival, that which helps us to survive. But then you have to ask the question, what is us? But you've got evangelical pragmatism. That's based on their movie. And evaluate an event based on how well it pursues their particular good, which is getting saved, spending eternity with God. This is a narrative. Their narrative is implicit as well. And those who are skeptical, anti-Christian, anti-theist, or just non-believing, say, I don't buy that skepticism. And again, this has changed rapidly. Not long ago, I can find over in the church library, D. James Kennedy evangelism explosion. It was based on a technique, a liturgy, where you knock on a door, and you ask the person, if you were to die tonight, what would you say to God to let him into your heaven? That was a very effective, and still is in some cultural context, a very effective evangelism technique, because it was already built into the cultural liturgy, that when we die, there's a judgment day, and God will judge us on our actions. It's an axial age context. And that's the widespread deployment and success of an axial age technology. If I try that in Northern California, it'll work pretty well in a black community, because that culture is still in the black community. But the white folks, not so much. Someone who is into Buddhism, different. Someone who's a Muslim, they'll say, you're asking me that question? How have you been with the rules? Now, what's so interesting is Nassar comes out of that. There's so much interesting to this conversation and where this is going. But in the Christian movie, if you will, the obvious axial age narrative that it's built upon, but that is in fact what secularism has been moving against and moving successfully against for a while. The difficulty is that these things happen very slowly. And again, as I've said many times, Sam Harris's wave peaked before Sam was born. These things move very slowly. Now, evangelical liturgy is pragmatic. You employ your contemporary liturgies in order to achieve the religious outcome you're looking for. That would be having someone pray the sinner's prayer, inviting Christ into your heart. And notice all of the evangelical talk in the event. And notice the two movies. And so when Nassar evokes the Christian language, non-Christian, hear it and are turned off by it, others are engaged by it. I'm getting saved. Never un-conflicted, even at the height of Christendom. Oh, that's true because there are always questions of, well, only at the height of Christendom when basically the pope s-communicated the emperor and the emperor came begging and pleading to get in. That might mark the height of Christendom, right there. Because the narrative was dominating so thoroughly that, you know, to have the pope ex-communicate you, bad deal. Well, if you're in the Orthodox Church, you were all ex-communicated by the pope about a thousand years ago. If you're in the Protestant Church, you're all ex-communicated by the pope about 500 years ago. Although there have been, you know, popes have been making softening statements, making some Roman Catholics upset, other Roman Catholics cheer. You've got C.S. Lewis and his mere Christianity. What worldview, what frame? Do I have a frame? Absolutely. You might say, yeah, but, and this is where explanations get tricky. Yeah, but once you put your frame out there, what? Then I have the emotional response to it that, why are holy places dark places? Why do we want that mystery around them? There's some cognitive science in there. There's some psychology in there. There's a lot of liturgy in there. Now we've got directly embattled post-enlightenment. Well, so the enlightenment that the Buddha, the enlightenment that the Buddha achieves is what? Well, I can see through, listen to Kansas songs. Now I can see through the veil and I know the truth. Well, Sam Harris sees through too, right? I can see through all that religious chicanery, all that charlatanism, and I see the truth. This is the move we keep making. Let's see, C.S. Lewis made the point that, the point of seeing through is to actually see something. Well, what is the thing? There's your religion, baby. There's your worldview. And we all got one and we all speak out of it and we all, we all tend to, even if you're playing the game of saying, well, I don't impose my religion on anyone else, there's part of your religion that you don't impose it on anyone else. I mean, it's the entire postmodern game. I don't believe in any meta narratives, except that there are no meta narratives. There's your meta narrative. You've always got one. You can't act. This is again, back to World of Objects, form for action. It's a form for action. If you act in the world, you act out a religion. You act out a worldview. You act out your axioms. You're religious in some way. And the religion that you have was formed in you even before you were born. Now we get back into Peterson and Sam Harris on the stage. And Sam Harris not seeming to understand anything. About the, this, this a priori structure that we have in order to manage this enormously complex world. So what you've got is a two movies conversation. And Jordan Peterson said is, is going to deliver David from the meaning crisis. That's why he ran on stage. It's the meaning crisis. And David Nasser, well, he ran on stage to get saved. Well, saved from what? Well, now saved from a lot. Because, well, there's a lot going on here. And in Christianity, even as gnostic as certain traditions of Christianity can become disconnected from this world. And again, it's, it's, it's not an accident that Peterson came to prominence via pronouns about the question of how connected and determined are we by the presence of testosterone that has formed our genitals. And how that should reign in the story verse. This stuff is not disconnected. This is Christianity, no matter how gnostic has always had concerns in this world. Why did Christians start hospitals? Even at the height of Christendom? Why did they care even in the early stages for the sick? You might say, well, that was a, that was lag of mirror, mirror neurons that are naturally embedded care for and to alleviate suffering. Yeah. But why did it get built into this? But why did it get built into the tradition? And why when, when, when, you know, the, the council in Jerusalem in the book of Acts is a little bit worried about the apostle Paul and the apostle Paul reassures them that, you know, he does care for the poor. Well, why? Well, now, this is the work of theology. Heaven and earth. How to keep it connected. So, so Jordan and David are going to talk about alcoholism. And they both can agree that alcoholism is bad. And well, how to cure it? Well, a religious transformation, Peterson will say. Peterson wants to deliver David from the meaning crisis and, and, and they'll do a lot of talk about preventing suicide. And they both very much on the same page, even with their two movies, there's a lot of overlap here. And Peterson basically say mythology helps. And so, in a sense, Peterson is saying in the verve, in the context of the meaning crisis in the axial age, Peterson is basically saying we can still employ technology. And so, in that sense, what Peterson is doing when he does his biblical lectures is he is employing the axial age technology of mythology to give meaning to people, to deliver them from depression, to deliver them from nihilism. And they go into it. But the difficulty that Peterson has is he offers them a book and offers them videos. And why people get drawn into church is because it's not enough. I don't just need a hit. We're addicts for meaning and just one little sip won't do. I need to live in it. So I need to go to Star Wars and I need to watch Avengers. But and when I go to Star Wars, I'm going to dress up as Luke or Leia or something. I need to embody. I need to have it. And then suddenly you get the mother of all stories, the Bible and the cosplay of all cosplays, the church and where we now live into it in real life. Axial age technology, baby. Can we justify it? David, Reverend Nasser wants David to get saved, to inhabit that story. But will Nasser have the language game sufficient to cross the axial divide? That's a good question. He doesn't he doesn't talk about this stuff. And David Nasser and I, it's he's so thoroughly embedded in his worldview. I don't know if he's familiar with any of this stuff. And for me to have a conversation with about it would probably require him watching. Tens of hours of videos and he's a busy man and so he won't. So it's just simply more profitable for him to keep working within the garden that he's working with him. Now, but then why talk together? Well, we're looking for for common ground and we find that in the physical, in the emotional, in the phenomenological. Another letter from Drears Post by Eric. The other Sarah's comment hit the nail on the head. Peterson is wrestling with God for the world to see and people are taking notice. Well, what do you mean by God? I've taken to heart Jordan Peterson's urging to take up one's cross after several pitfalls. I'm about to re-enter my autistic teenage son's life as a sole caregiver. Wow. You're gonna need serious technology. You're gonna need serious psychotechnology to be fruitful on that. You're gonna need a church. You're gonna need a community. You're gonna need people around you and that's exactly where this conversation, I don't have time to play it now because I've got a one o'clock appointment, but that's exact, but I'll play it in future videos. That's exactly where this conversation goes. You're gonna need that. The alcoholic needs a community around him. He needs a higher power to get free and as Jordan Peterson says, the 12 steps have employed that. Like many others, I too have perceived the cross Peterson bears as a weighty one. Lately, he seemed virtually spent at times, slower in delivery, struggling to pull the right words from the air and frequently on the verge of tears. I know of some of his family's challenges and the enmity which he bravely confronts and my heart goes out to him. A lot of disaffected men and women have found not just purpose but God through him despite, this guy obviously doesn't like Jung, despite Jungian approach to scripture. He's not just a lightning rod, he's a conduit for higher truth and a signpost to a better future. Say a little prayer for Jordan Peterson when you get the chance. We need him to remain in fighting shape. We do. I worry about his beef. Jordan, take care of yourself, please. We need you, baby. And have patience. His pathway to the Lord might just be inexorable. Rodriere likes this comment. I was just at the hospital visiting a sick relative and ran into an old friend in the hallway. He said that he noticed on my blog that I had started listening to Jordan Peterson. He told me he had discovered Peterson a year or so ago and the man's lectures had made a big difference in his life. My friend has had to carry some heavy burdens. I know. I was so happy to hear that Peterson's words had made positive difference in him. My friend said that he had recently shared the lecture with his adult son who's struggling with depression and just lifting and just drifting through life. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Peterson seems to be employing the axial age stuff with a new twist. But, but, yeah, fascinating. Now, as they go into this, Peterson will talk about depression. He'd say, they might actually be something wrong with him. Actually? What do you mean by that word? Implicit hierarchy causation priority to the physical. There it is right there. There's the secular age coming right into the conversation. And Nassar is conversant with it too. Gets priority if there's a physical, chemical remedy we can explain. Now, now, now we're, what stalking is, and stalking us then is the dread of the case in which no power we employ because Peterson will also say suicide is permanent. And this is part of my longer term project and my longer term goal because at some point we have to figure out how this all gets together. How the patterns get, you know, the formal cause. And again, Vervecki's lectures from his earlier lectures were really good on that. The formal cause and how this all gets put together and what this all is and what life really is. And so, and so what then the purpose is this physical layer. And I think in some ways the physical layer is sort of like a common tongue by which all the worldviews can work on their stuff. And that, within that idea, science makes sense. But, but, you know, with phenomenologically and with worldviews and with these other higher states of consciousness, if your rationality rules are Sam Harris, you say, I, only the physical layer is real. I just don't buy it because it doesn't govern and nobody can actually live this way. And this is exactly Jordan Peterson's point that only the physical layer is real. Now, these higher states of technology, they're problematic in the secular frame because what we've done as the secular frame is saying this is the lowest common denominator, this thing here. But here's the question. The implicit within the secular frame is that materiality governs. But as I would say, materiality isn't governing my fingers now, or is it? It's a philosophical question. It's not really a medical question. Because we don't know what mind is. That's why it's a hard problem. That's why Reveke is wrestling through it. And then later on, see, I don't have time to go through this because I got the one, maybe he's running late. Hang on. Let me take a look at the, running late. Can we do 115? There you go, Kevin. Just, just bought a reprieve to the good folks out in YouTube land of a few more minutes. I don't have to rush quite so much. That's bigger than you, but it's not bigger than God. Axial age technology, axial age language that that Nasser employs. Full blown God number two. Okay? And in a sense, what happened in the subversion of God number one and the compensating expansion of God number two via providential deism, that's an important line. Providential deism. That's an important level in this story that that Charles Taylor brings through that. Now God number two is big and large and in charge, as Freddie would say. And boom, that may be bigger than you, but it's not bigger than God. Boom. Meaning, boom, emotions. Now I can imagine, I can imagine Jesus on the shore of Gethsemane, or the shore of Gethsemane, the shore of the sea of Galilee, not the lake. And everyone is bringing their sick and their demon possessed and he's blowing them all away. Yeah, baby. I feel meaning. Adrenaline's flowing. That story, I want to inhabit it. And so I want to go to a church where demons are cast out and people are released from alcohol and they're released from bondages of various kinds and they're freed from themselves. And Nassar will get to that point in this video that I won't have time to play in this video that is already longer than I had imagined it would be, but that should be no surprise to anyone who listens to my video. This is God number two, his availability and interest relationally in his personal need. This is the secular age battleground. This is the Western enlightenment sought to deliver predictable desired outcomes to the battlefield. And this is in contrast in a sense with Buddhism where enlightenment is, well, controlling desire. Well, you're an alcoholic because you desire something. Now I'm not going to talk too much about this because of, for fear of revealing all of the vast ignorance I have about Buddhism. But you can see that Buddhism and Christianity work the suffering puzzle in different ways. And again, I like Peter Kreif's The Dark Side and you can find that on the web. Buddhism and Christianity work the suffering angle in different ways. If suffering is built on desire or even ego or self, experience of the self. And if the experience of the self is an illusion that can be done away with via meditation or psychedelics, you can eliminate suffering by digging underneath it and collapsing it. And if there's no self to suffer, you have no suffering. Christianity approaches suffering in a very different way. Christianity approaches suffering with all out meaning and hope of redemption. That's how Christianity does it. And Christianity does it by not just saying that the physical world around us is illusory, but that in fact the physical world around us is subject to God. And if you listen to my sermon, I'll do the rough draft on my channel. The physical world around us, nature as C.S. Lewis says in Miracles, nature is our sister. Nature is in a fight with us because we are in a fight with God. And what happens in redemption is that peace is now restored to the kingdom. Does it work? So they have this lovely interchange. I might have time to find that. I'll try. Kevin's extra 15 minutes bought us a little bit of video time. Here we go. So can I ask you as a pastor, what I... Again, the two movies. We've got the pastor and the psychologist. That's one way to frame two movies here. Say to a student who is overwhelmed when they see a giant that's bigger than them, instead of saying, oh, it's not a giant, you know, instead of discounting the pain or minimizing, I go, you know what? That's bigger than you, but it's not bigger than God. And I know it sounds like a cliche sermon little zinger. He's well cross-pressured by the secular age because... But we just say, yeah, I don't even pretend that you have the power on your own to slay this Goliath in your life. But we believe that, you know, God hasn't left you. As a matter of fact, in this very dark hour, that's when he's closest to you. And so we're not looking for you to do this in your power, but we're looking for you to do this, you know, and the power of the one who died on the cross for you. Axial age technology, baby. Are we giving people false hope? Ah, we're cross-pressured. Are we giving people false hope? Is this legitimate for us to say? Now, this is a question, but this is also an invitation. Because again, remember the two sets of agendas going on here. Peterson's going to have to dance carefully. Not going to come up to God number two. But when we do that as Christian counselors, are we... As Christian counselors? Ooh, ooh, because now we've got some overlapping magisteria going on here. Oh, it does. Did it work? Did you hear him say it? As a matter of fact, in this very dark hour, that's when he's closest to you. And so we're not looking for you to do this in your power, but we're looking for you to do this, you know, and the power of the one who died on the cross for you. Are we giving people false hope when we do that as Christian counselors? Does it work? Does it work? Oh, he's a pragmatist. Does it work? Are you giving people false hope? Does it work? Apply the scientific method. God number one of revelation. Can we deliver? And here's the thing. Go to a pastor and say, pastor, if you pray for me, will my trouble go away? Most honest pastors will say, I don't know. But we will say, God has the power to do it. I don't. Axial H framing. Science comes along. You go, counselor, I have this problem. Can we fix it? Most good counselors will say, well, I don't know. We'll give it a try. Now, what does Nasser say? Oh, he does. It doesn't work all the time. Right. And again, I think you're right. Sometimes and right there. See, then you say, aha, gotcha. Oh, there's no gotcha there. Christians know this. Well, why? Well, God number two. Well, God number two chooses. God number two is relational. Tim Keller has a line that. That when God answers prayer, he gives us exactly what we would want if we knew everything he does. Every time Tim Keller says that, I just think, oh, that's a gutsy thing to say. That's so gutsy. Is it true? Wow. It does sometimes. But then watch where this goes. Sometimes I'm talking to someone who literally needs because of a chemical imbalance needs medic. Ah, back to the physical. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now we've got some common ground here. Not as hey, here's sermon and then they're good. And it's chiropractic. And not here sermon and they're good. Practic, too. What I mean by that is you don't adjust and then it's fine. You have to adjust again and adjust again. That they keep continuing to go to counseling and continue to get help. It's a dance. It's two steps forward. Most people have a relationship with the transcendent. There it is. Remarkable creatures. And I think for us to call on that relationship in times of dire need is perfectly appropriate. And you're providing people with the language for doing that. Axial H technology. But in the torment of the insufficiency of everything attainable, we come to understand that here in this life, all symphonies remain unfinished. It's chiropractic. Let's fudge a little Greek here. Chiro means hand in Greek. Greek has two words for time. Chiros and Kronos. Chiros is the moment. Kronos is the running of moments. The time running this way. The singular moment versus this flowing moment. And so here, it's chiropractic. And this is where time and a little bit later in this video, when they get into the question, this so hard question of God's agency or ours, because actually, in many ways, that's exactly where Sam Harris doesn't know it because Sam Harris keeps looking at ontology. But Sam Harris keeps talking agency. And that's the heart of God number two. Reverend Nassar says time and time, you know, through process. And Peterson's like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, we've got some overlapping magisteria here. But is that God working? Is that us working? Well, we don't, we're not really sure about a whole lot of things. People have a relationship with the transcendentism. People have a relationship with the transcendent to call on that relationship. We're getting into God 1.5 in a sense, acting as if we can justifiably believe in God 2.0. But that puts us out on a social, secular age, epistemological limb. And we're afraid what our friends will think about us. The elephants, the secular elephants get nervous, which is why, again, Christian conversion is not so much convincing a rider. It's the elephant falling in love. Which is why it's so hard to be a Christian outside of a church because you've got to be with all the rest of the elephants. But you've got two movie epistemologies going here. If religious language will get people sober, then you should work it, regardless of the epistemological hazards. And quite frankly, again, if you're a materialist, that's a point I keep coming down to. People are like, you know, the real reason not to believe in God is your pride and your social status with the other atheists. And it's like, really? That's the reason? My pride? It's powerful. Don't get me wrong. Status motivates all kinds of things. But that's really the reason they got. It's not justifiable is the language, but Nasser's going to play another game of justification. Outcomes are validation of the metaphysical ontological truth of what the religious language is pointing to. You keep going in this and actually Nasser is going to play a foundationalist game. And because later in the videos he's going to say, well, I compare it to the word of God. Now, this is a philosophical move called foundationalism. And it's very modernistic. And it's a modernistic approach to justifiable belief. And this is actually itself part of the Enlightenment. Because a big part of the Enlightenment was to create a tower of knowledge. You have base knowledge and you build upon it with this sequence of syllogisms as such. And therefore, you can justify belief. And you see this from Descartes forward. Okay, now I think therefore I am, there's me. And then, of course, he sneaks in God by saying, well, God won't let me be fooled. And then poof, there's the world. Well, so you've got a great deal of skepticism, using skepticism to try to find knowledge. I mean, this whole philosophical tradition that I've talked about in many hours of past videos. But what occurs, what develops is this foundationalism. And what you see is that Sam Harris is using a foundationalism. And William Lane Craig is using a foundationalism. And that's a foundationalist game they're playing. And now Nasser, I don't know how philosophically self-conscious he is with his language. But he's using foundationalist talk. And I would imagine he probably picked it up just by osmosis in that community. Because that type of community is very foundationalist. And in fact, that type of community is very modernistic in its philosophy. Modernistic approach to justifiable belief. And now Nasser, because he talks about him versus the AA guy, his beliefs are founded on the word of God. Whereas the AA guy's beliefs are founded on the confession that within the AA doctrinal system, he is an alcoholic. Hi, my name is blank and I'm an alcoholic. That's the foundation of their epistemological truth. I'm running out of time again. This actually comes out of the modernist fundamentalist fight. That all comes out of the same modernist approach. And the Bible is no longer a foundation for God number one. Pragmatism is a way around it. Because we say, well, we might not be able to have our foundations. But we'll find things that are good enough. Now, when you listen to this tape, when you listen to this video, it's formed in me. Let's listen to the video tape. When you listen to this video, listen to how often Nasser goes to foundationalist language. Now, Esther might well fill up the comment section on this video because now she knows why. To movie epistemology, that's what we've got here. And well, I'll express my own tribe. And because I think there are questions about the foundationalist moves too. And I don't know if they're always the right one. And if you listen to Philip Carey's philosophy and religion in the West, the last chapter, he gets into reformed epistemology. Alvin Plantinga being one of the chief people in that. Alvin Plantinga and Nick Waltersdorf. And Nick Waltersdorf came back to Calvin College when I was there to teach a course. And well, sometimes you get a chance to teach a course with it. Learn to take a course with a great professor. You jump at it. So I was like, I don't care what he's teaching. I'm going to take it. And this was our textbook written by Plantinga and Waltersdorf. And it's a critique of foundationalism. Well, now how do we know what we know? There'll be more video to come, but I'm about out of time. Got a lot more to cover. But again, to sum up, there's two movies going on in this conversation. There's two epistemologies at play. There's two systems of validation at play. And then someone's going to say, well, which one is true? Well, I've certainly got my opinion. I'm not a foundationalist like Nassar, but I am a Christian. And I do believe what people ask about God number one and God number two. The Christian God is both. OK? The Christian God is God number one and God number two. They get split. And it's in some ways connected to heaven and earth. Some of that splitting winds itself in interesting alignments. But if you're going to watch the movie, she's going to watch the movie. If you're going to watch the, let's go all the way to the beginning. If you're going to watch the one last question video. I have it actually on the last line. Oops. Oops. Running out of time and here I. Anyway, if we're going to watch the one last question video, keep the two movies in mind. And and and keep these ideas in mind. And and that will help you sort out the conversation between Peterson and Nasser. Now I am out of time, so there it is.
