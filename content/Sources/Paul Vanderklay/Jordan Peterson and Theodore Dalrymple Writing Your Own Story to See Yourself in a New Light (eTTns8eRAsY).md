 Hi, this is Paul. I know I haven't done the Ian McGilchrist commentary yet. Some of you know I've got some vacation coming up and so I don't know when I'm gonna get to it. I really want to get to it and I haven't I really haven't had the chance to listen to that one carefully. The McGilchrist conversation is a pretty intense conversation. There's a lot going on there and so that's one that I I don't really want to sort of off the cuff. Now Peterson has been putting out a ton of really good stuff lately and when I saw that he talked to Theodore Dalrymple I was tremendously excited because for me part of the aspect of Peterson's biography that most interested me early on was his experience as a clinical psychologist and in his classroom lectures and in his biblical series he would regularly tell stories from his practice. He also had a significant background studying alcohol and sobriety from alcoholism and you know these aspects of Peterson's biography and of his resume for me were far more interesting than the entanglement that he got in the the culture war stuff. Now Dalrymple is a similar guy. He was a I first heard about him I something came on my something came across my feeds that he had written and I grabbed onto it right away because it was it connected so deeply with me because I have spent my life therapists to do this. My first conversation with Sevilla King we talked about it. Doctors have this you know my conversation with the doctor from the CRC that I talked to a while ago I can't think of his name right now but but people who work in helping professions often both have one leg in sort of the middle class upper class let's call it the world of whiteness shall we? This very Western very scientific very enlightenment culture that in many ways does not understand the cultures around them especially cultures of poverty. I think about Chris Arnade's book Dignity I think about JD Vance Hillbilly Elegy we've had a number of books written about this but what so amazes me is that of course it's not just white folks but that many of the differences that separate people in our country are in fact they're sort of like class they often have a lot to do with wealth but you can find some wealthy people who in fact know the underclass quite well and people from helping professions like doctors therapists some pastors like myself so the Christian Reformed Church in its 150 years of immigrant history has thrived and and so by the time I come on the scene ordained in 1991 the Christian Reformed Church is a solidly middle upper middle class congregation with some blue-collar community still often in rural areas but many of the urban centers are are much more white-collar now of course my father's ministry was in an African-American congregation in a struggling community all of my ministry experience has been in similar to communities so when I listen to Jordan Peterson talk about his experience as a clinical psychologist and when I listen to Theodore Dalrymple that's his pen name talk about his experiences in a prison hospital yeah yeah and and so I listen to these guys and I very much resonate with them and so I listen to this I listen to this whole conversation loved it all knew I wasn't gonna do a commentary on it because the whole commentary would be yes yes and that I'd be tempted to tell stories similar to their stories because this has been the life I've lived and in many ways what is so frustrating about the current culture war is that this one side that loves to profess about whiteness is the whitest whiteness you can have because it's all of this middle and upper middle class know-it-all ism and that's why you know my friend Hank is doing is doing you'll you'll notice Hank Cruz in the comment section and we're we're trolling each other in the comments section quite regularly because Hank is actually a friend of another guy went to college with and I met Hank through this and I love talking to Hank Hank is Hank is one of these guys who has been successful in life but he's from the wrong side of Chicago and he still knows it and he still can talk to people who don't have college degrees and people on the street so if I'm gonna walk around a rough area town you know I I like doing that like Chris Arnotti like a Dal Ripple Dal Ripple talks about this you know this part of his story that's this is these I I listen to these guys talk like this and I think these are my people people with one foot in both ends and and it's that way that's so often so many of these high-minded well-meaning ideas that come out of the university to try to help people and so often infantilize people I find so offensive and so obnoxious and so ridiculous which meant that I loved this video because it was just it was just a feast of those kinds of things but then he got to the end and he talked about a program that really got my attention and so I am gonna play a little bit of the conversation just at the end. How did you handle this emotionally? Now earlier in the conversation Dal Ripple had made the point that when he took this job the guy who was working with him basically became an alcoholic and you know my my my first my first ministry out of seminary was in the Dominican Republic and you know well something that stalks missionaries who work with with people who you know you're trying to help people and their situation is is so desperate you see this is this is where I'm you know in the middle of in the middle of this culture war the woke and the anti woke I'm not a I don't I don't have any I don't have any misunderstanding how in our culture in many places not everywhere in many places in our culture it's easier to be white it's easier to be educated and in many places in the third world you know I go to the Dominican Republic and by virtue of my nationality my passport my wealth in some ways it's easier to be there but the world is complex in other ways it isn't and so he's working in this prison and you know the stories he tells of just how many suicides you know there's a friend of mine that I want to bring on the channel his wife's been his wife's been part of a panel discussion and he works you know he's a therapist and he works with a population with tremendously high suicide rates and you know government tries to government just hands out money trying to fix things and it's a disaster because you don't fix human beings by just giving them money now sometimes money is very helpful and they they need money and it's an underclass and they're struggling and I loved how how Dow Ripple made the point that yeah for middle class and upper class people money covers up a lot of this stuff and I see the same thing in ministry that you know if you're doing ministry in a middle class or an affluent community there's plenty of ministry to do because the money's sort of covering things up and in some ways ministry is harder in communities like that and poor communities sometimes ministry is easier because people can't fake it they it's they're just it's just reality they hit bottom faster they get into a 12-step program they get into a church that they have time to they have time to straighten up because they don't have to keep up appearances they don't have to play games but then you get a population in prison and they got time and they're gonna work on stuff and so some well-meaning person and again God bless these well-meaning people they you know and this is why I'm not gonna be anti-woke either because they might be they might be really simplistic with their ideas but some of them at least have a heart others of them are just just using this stuff for virtue signaling and they're not gonna help anybody and you know for all of that for the drama surrounding all of these well-meaning ideas and I've seen this happen all my life nothing happens in these deeply distressed and difficult communities and so he's working with a population in prison and so someone comes along and well and so he comes along and he's got to deal with this how do you deal with it now I think part of it is similar to Chris Arnotti where he's got a spirit of adventure and so he he gets into this and he's gonna engage in it and so there's a degree of there's a degree of ambition that you go into this for and you know I could you know I don't know if I could because I don't know if I could take a nice suburban church I don't know if I'd like it I know if I had endure I probably wouldn't last because I've get I get fed up with game playing and I I tell someone exactly what's on my mind instead of what the nice pastor should say and probably have to take the kind of struggling church that I'm in now a church with fewer options in terms of what they could get as a pastor so that doesn't say anything against the wonderful people at Living Stones I just I just would I just would rather do ministry among a population like I have to engage but it can be really hard on you especially in a situation like this and so Peterson quite rightly asks how did you cope with the stress? Which well the endless onslaught of misery amongst your amongst your clientele. I mean one way of dealing with it of course was writing about it. And and I thought exactly exactly and you know I've I've worked the same thing now I didn't write books and probably to ADHD to ever get a book out of me but you know I blogged and you know here in my YouTube channel so I'm not writing I'm talking at you because it's it's fairly easy for me to do but part of the reason I talk at you is because I got to talk these things out and you get to be the ones I get to talk to. Because I've what I found is that when you write about an experience even an unpleasant experience it distances you from that experience so you you not only having the... Okay now pay attention here it distances you and we're going to we're going to have this and what he's about to talk about but that distance is really important because we need the distance. Now if you read the the body keeps the score anything about trauma people who suffer trauma there's disassociation they they distance themselves from the trauma and that's a coping mechanism that we have built into us to sort of deal with the trauma and of course even though he's he's not in trauma like the people who have suffered from trauma the constant exposure to it sort of some of the trauma gets transferred and you have to do something with it so writing about it distance it and we're gonna we're gonna talk about you know logos language eternity putting things into language putting things into story representing things a little ways away from it us begins to help us process it now we can have a conversation with it now we can engage with it now it's not all up on us or in us or on top of us or beating us it's okay now we'll start to work with it we put things in front of ourselves so we can see it so we can begin to process it in a different way because we need distance from it and we've got to deal with it. Experience you're observing distance about an experience even an unpleasant experience it distances you from that experience so you you not only having the experience you're observing having the experience I was once arrested in Albania and and the mildly if say mildly beast with a truncheon by a by policeman and actually as he was hitting me I wasn't thinking this is painful I was thinking how am I going to describe this subsequently? Disassociation I mean he takes himself out of it and he sees him through this eye and because he likes to write because he has this passion he's managing it in this way and then you know he's kind of doing it automatically and I'm sure Peterson can relate because poor Jordan Peterson has taken one heck of a beating in the last three years. So that being able to describe it or having the intention of describing it actually distances yourself in a good way I think from from your experience. Well you draw the conclusions that way and I mean you're the purpose of your memory in some sense is to draw the appropriate conclusions from your experience to guide you into the future. Now when Jordan describes it that way he's not yet necessarily talking about religion but I think this is a this is a huge element of what religion does and I think this is a big piece of why what even in the secular world we look at religion why religion flourishes in people who are suffering and and why again I'm a Christian minister so you know one of the most remarkable things about the story of African slavery in North America is that the Africans took in Christianity from their slave owners which is a remarkable thing because with the way that population is treating you you'd think that that the last thing you would want to do is be associated with their religion but they took in that religion and they changed it and made it their own and you know they took the songs these these these Negro spirituals would would always have two meanings and and so you know there you can see this happen what this is this is why it's the old saying there's no atheist and foxholes goes a lot deeper than that that somehow this this process that you're undergoing I think in many ways is the seedbed of religion you have to take this suffering and put it into stories and put it outside of you and and especially put it into writing so I had a friend who a good friend who had been in 12-step programs for years and so by the time he came to this church even before I got here you know so many of those so many of those 12-step tricks and hacks were were so much a part of him and so one of the things that he would know he had his worry book and so one of the things he would do is he would write down his worries why get them away from you you get some distance and you know he wasn't a trained psychologist or anything but you know through a all of these wisdoms develop and so just here over the last hundred years we have this new science of psychology that learns a bunch of these things but human beings with ritual and prayer and religion and and writing and storytelling and I mean we've been practicing these things for a very long time and religions are full of them and so I have a series of writing exercises online at a place called self authoring dot-com that steps people through writing a biography more Jesus smuggling and it highlights experiences that were emotionally extreme and because there is plenty of evidence that writing them out they have to be somewhat distant from you you know yes you can't do it the next day yes exactly because you're just re traumatizing yourself in some sense but and you know why why is PVK bingo have Patterson and Dominican Republic and you know homeless people and stories and all of this because you know this is this is how I process it this is how I process and you know I'm you know I haven't suffered like these people but being close to them and loving them I take into me some of their suffering and I want good things for them and you know when when well-meaning people come along with simplistic ideas that I look at with suspicion because you're not going to live with these people you're not you don't really love these people there's kinds of other games that are being played and then people know that people know when you care about them the politics sort of gets pushed to the wayside the evidence is quite strong I would say that doing that well you're transforming the emotion into words and replacing in some sense the emotion by the words you're making sense of it um yeah there was a very interesting experience I had an interesting experience with that in that regard in the prison we had a writer who would come in and teach writing creative writing if you like to interested prisoners and they now what's so interesting is that and this is why you know don't don't don't too quickly pigeonhole your political or social or educational adversaries because that might sound like some highfalutin airy fairy pointless thing but it isn't and you know frankly we see this all the time in public education where the first things to get caught are sports and music and writing and play and recess and it's like no especially for for children from the rougher areas of town these are the most important things they need they need to and they're they're all indirect you know sit down and sit down and tell me about your trauma they can't do it draw a picture I mean psychologists have known this stuff and what amazes me about so much of this this woke ism is it's like you spent a hundred years developing psychology you're just gonna throw it away because you're afraid to look bad well that's like human beings or his status is a very big deal but so so somebody comes in and they want to do writing and I'm sure some people are thinking well that sounds that sounds insane but okay give it a try see it so often in difficult communities we have no idea what to do or will make things better so just just try something and watch and see if it helps and then often you'll be surprised that the best the ideas that you think are best don't do anything and the ideas that are like I got nothing else work and try this and it's like well something good happened we had a writer who would come in and teach writing creative writing if you like to interested prisoners and they were of course of selected group and so on and the writer told he came to me because of course the the there wasn't really any evidence that he was doing any good yeah but when are they looking again and this is always the thing about religion I prayed and nothing happened well you wanted it now you know you might as well say I went to school for a day and I didn't learn anything oh no you learned a lot you learned a lot I mean just have a kid come home from school what did you learn today nothing no it's human beings we work on on very slow clocks at least the deep things and and it's very true of religious things they take time you have to you have to move into it from the inside it requires repetition it's it requires discipline for it to take hold I went to church I prayed and nothing happened and you know it's it's a testament to the you know the speed of some of the things that we're doing but you know earlier in the thing too we talked about you know giving out meds and he's like you know very skeptical of that and again you know talked to my friend who's working in a similar thing and you know says the same things and you know that's when you look at my you know I'm obviously high in openness but but also just having listened to people like this you learn things you know gosh you learn what don't you learn when you listen and the writer he came to me because of course the the there wasn't really any evidence that he was doing any good because of course that such evidence would be almost impossible to gather right but and so of course the prison authorities are constantly trying to cut down costs so they wanted to get rid of them so he and again if you've ever worked for a big institution you know the insanity of these things he wanted me to write in his favor which I did which of course sealed his fate but I love this guy look at him laugh and this is just it you work in places like this and again the people like him who survive and in my my conversation with Chris Arnotti too was just a joy because I mean why do I do the Freddie and Paul show think about it I love it are there elements of people's lives around me that are just soul-crushing in terms of hopelessness yeah what do you do with that if you don't believe in the gospel if you're gonna be a nihilist you probably got drinking or suicide ahead of you if you believe that this world isn't all that these people poor people get religion religion just suffering is the seedbed of religion it always is and there's you know all of these processes that are that are likely part of it but anyway he told me something very interesting all the people who wrote wrote autobiographically as you would expect and and think about what they're doing they're putting it away from themselves just like he did and now they can see it if it's up too close you can't see it this is why talking with people about ourselves is so important because they reflect back to us ourselves and we we get data about ourselves and good and bad data and we figure it out he told me something very interesting all the wrote wrote autobiographically as you would expect and they would they would come to a point in their lives when they had to stop when they found it extremely difficult to go on because actually what it did this was the first time in their lives they really ever thought biographically or perhaps even thought well I mean I really mean that it's like you know that people think they think but what happens is thoughts appear in their head that's way different than sitting down programmatically and voluntarily going over your life and trying to make anyway they came they came to a point where they couldn't go on at least for quite a long time why in some ways they saw God boy that sounds sacrilegious pastor you shouldn't say things like that but that's not a crazy thing that I just said why they saw themselves through what a lens that is above them they took their life and they kind of put it up there and they had to look at it now this again is what religion do this is what churches do this is what religious organizations do this is what morality codes do this is what all of this mechanism you know moral law this is what all of this mechanism does is it takes our life and it says okay in an organized way and now and I don't necessarily like what I see and and you know especially people like this have been people have been reflecting negative things back on them and and in that way it's easy to deflect to deflect because the guards hate me because of racism because they're guards because of poverty because of you know you can you can engineer a million defensive excuses for that but when you write it yourself and you see it now that's hard and that point was when they realized that all that they'd been telling themselves about their own behavior was actually false and so I came to the conclusion that this actually now whether it changed their behavior subsequently I can't tell you I don't know and but you know for in Christian ministry these are the points these are inflection points where people begin to turn and say I'm not a good manager of my life I need someone else Jesus take the wheel they use these little Christian cliches they're not they're not dumb they arrive out of they arise out of things like this but you get it's hitting rock bottom it's it's saying okay and and prison does that I mean especially if they're held long enough and they a little later he talks about you know a certain age Peterson talks about that especially if you're a man who 90% of the people in prison are men you know testosterone is no longer surging through you and you've had 10 to 20 years to cool off and you know you've you've you've destroyed your relationships with people outside and and inside as hell but you've been institutionalized and and and and something needs to change so it's time to get serious and then what you need is a program what is that you need you need others around you who are going to help you make progress in the ways you need to make progress in any way well you know you probably need to marry that with a plan and and this is you know in a lot of ways when I saw Peterson doing what he was doing I mean when I started the meetups and I haven't had a meetup for a while because of COVID and after vacation I think I'm gonna restart the meetup here and I'm gonna change some things and I might make it a little bit more programmatic than the first effort because you know I know I knew when Peterson was this is what Peterson was provoking in people's lives and where are they gonna go now a bunch of them have found church and that's the point you you you autobiography and you compare it with Jesus biography or you convey it with a moral law or you compare it to the performance of a community and then suddenly you can begin to get some change in your life that's what happens in churches so yeah you know like the problem is is that if you if you realize that what you're doing is wrong but it's habitual and you don't know what else to do you're going to do what you know because and you need a group of people around you and and and it needs to be you need a plan you need a program and it needs to be patient what else are you going to do you don't know it yeah I mean one thing about the statistics in an enumeration Britain are quite clear that people stop coming into prison on new offenses I mean overwhelmingly not not absolutely a hundred percent but overwhelmingly for offenses like burglary and violence they stop after the age of 39 and and their rate of conviction goes down in the 30s so there is a kind of spontaneous change now whether this would accelerate I mean what you would want to do is accelerate that change so that they they didn't have to reach the age of 39 before they stopped committing those crimes and my guess was that this did actually have an effect but I have no proof of that I have no proof that this you know yeah I don't know of any and it wasn't wedded to you know but again sort of what happens and there's a lot of prison ministry my brother-in-law did prison ministry for a while what happens this is this is this is why so many people find God in prison son of Sam they look at his story I haven't watched the Netflix thing on him yet but stop think begin to look at yourself say if I want a different life something has to change and you're gonna need other people around you to figure out how to make the change happen studies that look at autobiographical writing and recidivism it will be very difficult because it will be very difficult very I mean it would be difficult to find the control group and so on so but I mean instinctively I felt that this was a good thing to be doing well in so far as thought is useful and verbal thought is high-quality thought you'd hope that it would be helpful okay so how did your conclusions change your clinical practice for the better let's say in your opinion and what about social policy suggestions well the first clinical practice it made me very wary of medicalization of misery that's the first thing so that I spent far more time persuading people not to take medication that take it in fact there's a kind of law in prison if if people want medicine they don't need it and if they won't take it they do need it but that's true outside prison too as far as social policy is concerned I'm very very wary of making and perhaps this is very cowardly of me very wary of making any suggestions because if anyone were to take me seriously and the results would work catastrophic I feel very bad so well it's an actually I'm I'm I think also that actually what we need is a cultural change and I'm not sure how much government can bring about a cultural change it's the wrong tool so I was trying to in my way trying to persuade people particularly the the intellect maybe this is grandiose but I was trying to persuade intellectuals that a lot of their world outlook was was bad and was doing harm rather than good they won't change they're throwing some of the least resistant change because they've got high status if you've got high status if you're successful why should I change and it's the people that are in prison who they they're sitting and they're looking at walls and they're saying where am I going well you're gonna sit and wait for the government to save you that's the thing that most annoys me about a lot of the critical race stuff because on one hand it says well well you're here because of whitey and on the other hand it says you gotta wait here until whitey saves you and it's like wait a minute he's the reason I'm here it just makes no sense it just makes no sense so anyway you know I mentioned that when they write out their story and when they look at it and when they begin to see themselves at a distance in some ways it's it's sort of like it's sort of like seeing God and and I was thinking about that a little bit I'm recording this on Friday I think I'll release this on Monday the the bridge is a meaning question answer this week I'm not gonna do the question and answer for the next two weeks I think Joey's gonna cook something up and we'll post something on the channel but I'm anxious to see what they cook up it'll be fun it'll be fun that one of the questions in this week's was you know what's what am I most pleased about in terms of what I've learned over the last few years and not really so much what I've learned but what I've seen other people do has has really been the cool thing and the discord server and a lot of what people have taken up anyway when we see ourselves in the light of a perfect God it's crushing but it can be a productive crushing and and so I loved what they said here and but but it's but God isn't just a a judgmental father his son comes along and and in the gospel of John I preached on it not too long ago you know you were my servants or my slaves now you are my friends for the Son of God to be our brother to be our friend to be our advocate now there's a reason Christianity has done so well and then of course forgiveness there are there talked about that quite a bit too in the in the question and answer this week and someone quite considerably made the little timestamps of when the things came up because it's two plus hours and that's I ramble and you know it's a mess Ray's outside my door smoking pot coughing Ray's a homeless guy he's one of these homeless guys that you can't even have a conversation with and he's I'm sure he's been in and out of jail countless times and I don't know I don't know a lot of ways to help Ray so I pray but forgiveness so necessary so key for self-help for self-health forgiving others receiving God's forgiveness if others are are willing to forgive you you know many people in jail they've just many homeless people they've just just burned through the relationships of their lives and and in a sense you know they they see God and okay it's crushing and Jesus comes along and says I'm here to help Jesus take the wheel funny names with that and again there's so much reminded me of Chris Arnotti's and my conversation with Chris Arnotti and you can find that on my channel lovely book why religion is so helpful for helping people do difficult basic things required by life and you know it's not at all like I've said before I can't ever recall meeting an atheist homeless person they're all quite religious and you might say well how good is religion and it's not working for them well like with the writing exercise I don't really I can't really say it's not working for them it's functioning in them it's sort of like the evolutionary psychology argument about religion it's adaptive how exactly is it helping and we might not know but it probably wouldn't be there if it wasn't helping you know is there is there self-deceit in it could very well be are they using it to justify things that they shouldn't probably I mean but that's we use it we embrace it because because we need it you know and I loved what what Dalrymple said about you know wealth in terms of the wealthy in the middle class and the state offer money as sort of an opiate and I'm not against I'm not against state programs to help it's just they help and they harm sometimes knowing you know when I left the you know in the Dominican Republic one of the things that I learned there is it's so difficult to actually help people and it's often people need help but they also have to help themselves it's a it's a both and thing and so it's so difficult often is finding the right ways to help and not disable them and there's been a lot of books written about this over the years and instead what we've got is a you know people with a shallow education into stupidity and chaos so yeah just just had some thoughts about that conversation and wanted to get them down and like I said I'll be on vacation coming up so the pace of videos could change I've scheduled some some more randos convos for this week so hopefully I'll get a few in the can so there'll probably be a few randos convos coming through while I'm on vacation and Joey and Rick are gonna do something with bridges of meaning to to replace my usual Friday question and answer so we'll see we'll see what comes kind of exciting see see new things so thanks for watching I should say like and subscribe because if you like the channel you want others to see it if you like a video that signals YouTube that it's a video of value and so more people will like it and subscribe it's the same thing but again my my goal here isn't to run up big numbers my goal is to is to do what we're doing so thanks for watching
