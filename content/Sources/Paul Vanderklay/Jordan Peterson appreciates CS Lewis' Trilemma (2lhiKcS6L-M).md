 So I was at the VIP part of Peterson's performance or his event and I was sitting in the front row during the VIP Q&A and there's this guy next to me and he was he shot his hand up right when they asked her questions like immediately. He was ready to go. He had his question baby. This is my shot. Yeah and he said who is Jesus who he said he is. He just put it like that. No beating around the bush setting it up so Peterson can't be like well you know psychologically death and resurrection. So he asked the question then Peterson I was shocked. I was so shocked and so was he after because Peterson's usually been rather evasive and answering that question but this time he said to paraphrase I was reading C.S. Lewis when I was in Europe talking to people about the collapse of Christian morality in the West and I came to agree with Lewis's conclusion that it would be it would make more sense for Christ to be who he said he was than for him to not be who he said he was. So right there Peterson says he's reading C.S. Lewis. Yes read the trilemma. He's probably reading near Christianity. He read the trilemma and he agreed with it.
