 Hi, this is Paul. I've gotten a number of comments a lot of Sam Harris complaints too much Sam Harris too much Sam Harris Well in line with I won't actually do much with CS Lewis's abolition of man, but this is very much in alignment with it. I Want Sam to move over a little bit and I want to look at Alastair McGrath Alastair McGrath is a teacher at Gresham College in Oxford he Began his life as a Christian gave up Christianity because of science eventually got a looks like a Oxford Doctor of Philosophy in his research in molecular biophysics in 1977 and Became a Christian and if you want to hear about how he became a Christian unbelievable From its archives did a thing on him. You can just look Alastair McGrath unbelievable So he's a scientist became a theologian has written a ton a ton of theological books. I Became first I've read three of his books. I've read his his biography of CS Lewis That was actually a third book. I read the first book of his that I read was his book heresy, which I thought was quite good There's his book heresy He also wrote a good book on Christianity's dangerous idea on Martin Luther and if you go to his Amazon page You can find book after book after book after book that he's written. He writes a fair amount on religion and science Again because he's you know, he's got a PhD and he's got a PhD in biophysics and he's got the PhD in theology So he's a he's a really wonderful resource One of the things that I've been thinking about lately is that Jordan Peterson needs some new better conversation partners Now I did a short video Sunday morning on what really is his agenda and I had written this I'd written most of this PowerPoint before then what really is this project? What's he what is he doing for others giving him meaning? He wants to make individual lives better. He's done a self-help book. He's done the doctor odds celebrity appearance He's doing his traveling sort yourself out show and and that's a big That's a very meaningful thing for Jordan Peterson quite obviously and it's a big part of how he sees his calling his vocation his mission He's making the world a better place by helping people sort themselves out But what's he trying to sort out himself? And again, I think what he's really trying to sort out himself is natural theology He's trying to figure out how the world works and what we saw in the Sam Harris conversations Was he's looking for a partner to help him work on that Sam Harris is not a good partner for that Sam Harris's agenda is mostly just trying to kick down and debunk Christianity you'll notice that word comes up a lot in the abolition of man debunk Christianity and But one of the interesting things is that the IDW seems pretty allergic to talk to Christians they'll talk to a An observant I'm observant Jewish believer like See believer now we're getting into Christian catchphrases He'll talk to an observant Jew like Ben Shapiro But they they're not talking to a lot of Christians and I know he had that conversation in which William Lane Craig Participated in but I don't think Craig is a good partner for him because in some ways Craig is kind of the counterpart of Sam Harris his Tribal agenda tends to be the dominant agenda For what he's doing now, maybe I'm wrong with William Lane Craig He's not been an apologist that I've followed much or paid much attention to I know There's some big William Lane Craig fans out there and I'm not trying to knock the guy But I didn't find him an especially helpful conversation partner for Jordan Peterson partly because the difficulty if you're going to have a Productive and fruitful conversation with Jordan Peterson is you're going to have to know what he's talking about and that means a serious investment of time in Jordan Peterson's work and so he needs some better conversation partners who actually have an understanding of what Jordan Peterson is coming from because otherwise what we usually do is we have a Very low resolution person of the other person a picture of the other person This is what Jordan Peterson has done to to a certain degree It can't be helped because this is how human beings are You have a low resolution picture of a person say oh, he's a Christian or he's an atheist or he's not a Christian And he believes certain things and so with that very low resolution Picture all you wind up doing is arguing against I hate to use this language but arguing against a straw man or arguing against a Cardboard cut out of the other person because you don't really have a high resolution picture of what the other person believes Jordan Peterson is such a unique and interesting Thinker in my opinion that And and he has such a huge following of people who are incredibly interested and knowledgeable in his thought that he needs conversation partners that actually have a detailed understanding of what Peterson is Talking about and promoting and that's very difficult partly because Peterson is so Interdisciplinary in his approach he he's he brings so many disciplines together that it's It's not easy to have a partner who can kind of keep up with him in all these other different areas But also bring enough difference to it and again my point that what Peterson I think is really doing is natural theology It's a it's a search for God from below Now There are dual problems that come up in this debate and one one of the problems coming from the world as space for objects Which you know, this is Sam Harris's perspective This is the perspective of of the materialist naturalists and and this just gets distilled into what I call a monarchical vision And it's a timeless. It's a timeless static clean room accessible by science Which has removed the subjective and Peterson talks about this quite a bit. It's true for all time. It's true for any time It's true for anyone. It's the world of nouns The difficulty that you have with this monarchical vision is We can't touch it And in fact Peterson's point in his conversations with Sam Harris about the a priori filter is that we can't even access it Because we can't see into the clean room. We really can't We really can't engage We cannot monkey with the objects within that space without sullying them with our subjectivity Now what's interesting is you have a very similar issue that comes up with the kind of language surrounding the Bible That grew out of the modernist fundamentalist debate and Bible as Word of God Now I'm not challenging Bible as Word of God But if you understand Word of God to be something like Sam Harris's monarchical vision of a world as space for objects The Bible you put any high Description on the Bible that you will inerrant infallible without you know, inerrant is is basically the top one being used by The debate since the modernist fundamentalist debate Since the modernist fundamentalist fight The Bible may be inerrant, but your eyes for reading it aren't and your mind for interpretation interpreting it isn't and this is actually part of what happened with Martin Luther Martin Luther had for all of his brilliance a perspective an assumption that if you would just read the Bible and Apply reason to it now many contemporaries will say if you just read the Bible and take the plain sense of it Then you too will be without error and this is exactly the same mistake that Sam Harris makes with respect to his vision of the world as a world of nouns that that somehow if you just grab onto that world Then you too will be as pristine and without error as the factual world that he is trying to grasp What he doesn't understand is that he has dirty hands He has his own motivation and actually Christians have have known this with respect to the Bible it can tend to It can tend to dissolve in endless interpretive debates about the Bible But again, that's in many ways parallel to the endless interpretive debates about rationality and this world of nouns You know if the Bible is a clean room for divine truths. Well You have dirty hands and you have Eyes that don't see properly and and this doesn't mean that just as with this world of facts It is unimportant Or or not a really helpful reference for us to have a window onto existence or being or reality whichever word you put at the top of your hierarchy So also with the Bible and this is why in the protestant tradition We come up with ideas we come up with our own Heuristics we come up with our own theologies and we always test them against the Bible But but the reason and this is very similar to what Jordan Peterson said about why can't you tell a purely archetypal story? Your your story must itself be clothed in subjectivity and this isn't I don't think Very different from the word becoming flesh in the gospel of john chapter 1 and this isn't very different from Sam harris, okay, you've got reason you've got your world of objects out there You have to do something with it, but you cannot interact with it. You cannot touch it without losing that Subjectivity with you which you stripped out in order to have that world now and that What that what that means is that that world of pure facts and reason and objects Are is fundamentally an imaginative world We can only and this is why we have this monarchical vision and we actually use our imagination to see it But again, once you employ your imagination to see it The clean room is corrupted the the the time enters into the timeless That now this isn't Trans-temporal let's say which is the eternal but this is timeless. This is static It's a clean room. And so once in fact you imagine you see it your your Your apprehension of it Distorts the thing itself. You can't get there because you are a subjective human being And and we have the same struggles with the bible The bible is the word of god once you appropriate it You corrupt it and this is why for example in christian theology and in the theology of john calvin the The work of the holy spirit is so critical In terms of our ability to interact with the bible and interpret the bible So you can see how how these things sort of work together Together now jordan peterson in his conversation with sam harris was working on the a priori structures And and this is a motivational structure what this means is that It that relies on sorting that we can see and provides motivation so we can act so this a priori structure We are faced with a near infinite number of facts around us and Because we are limited creatures we can't Comprehend we can't even see all these facts at once our our minds are too limited for that So what we tend to do is we have to sort them out and this is what this is what jordan peterson You know, this is what jordan peterson the point what he points out to to sam harris is okay sam harris You have this monarchical vision of your world of facts, but you don't even know which fact You see first and your subjectivity Determines which fact you see first you because you can't see the whole world of facts at once and again I think in in some ways this is analogous to god and time God can see all time at once in the sense in the same way we can see history But even when we're seeing history when we can let's say all the facts Let's use facts All the facts that we can apprehend In the past well, there are many many facts, but via consciousness this cloud of seeing and Apprehending that we use we can in fact only apprehend One fact at a time and so here again. We are limited by this cloud of consciousness. We are limited by time but according to You know the history of of theology and philosophy god can see all history at once You can see all time at once you can see all facts at once And and we as human beings are simply far too limited to do that and the way So so in other words according to peterson The way we can apprehend anything is with is through this a priori structure that that lines up as a hierarchy So we see what to us is the most important fact first now now imagine you're You're suspecting that your spouse or your lover is cheating on you and you burst into the hotel room What do you look for first you look for the the the cheater to be caught in the act? You don't burst through the hotel room and say oh wow, the wall is yellow You don't look at the wall there's a hierarchy of values and this is again jordan peterson's whole project that he develops Through maps of meaning you live in a world of values and that value structure Dictates that which you see and and sets up those values So that which you apprehend first if you're going into your office looking for a book and you open the door and there's a cobra A king cobra on the floor of your office You don't just stroll in and grab the book and say oh, yeah, I saw a cobra in there, too No, you pay attention to the cobra why? And in fact, I was thinking about the the celebrity atheists in this, you know One way to illustrate that is they're all sitting nice and calm on the stage But if if someone in the audience would pull out a gun Everyone in the room would pay attention to the gun. Why is the gun just one fact among many? No all of your Valuative hierarchies subject that you have in subjectivity Make you see the gun first because for your creature The gun is the most important thing and and this is again why we can't apprehend This world of facts as one thing and we are not impartial observers of this world We come in with dirty hands. We come in with motivated eyes And and this is the only way we can apprehend the world So this limits what we see this distorts what we see. There's no clean room. There's no pristine vision This holds equally for a space for objects as we approach the bible again That's what I said in the last slide We christians have exactly the same issue that they deal with in the bible And if you go through the jordan peterson sam and i'm talking more about sam harris the jordan peterson sam harris thing Sam harris keeps talking about this world and then he complains about how christians interpret the bible And jordan peterson comes back at him and says but sam it's the same problem in both sides Christians have an interpretive problem Rationalists in a world full of objects have the same interpretive problem We come to the we come to this world with dirty hands We come to this world with motivated eyes and we see that which is important And we process it within our cloud of consciousness and in fact beyond our consciousness with our brain But all the rest all all that too is motivated. And so in many ways as jordan peterson says many times To a high degree and I know people hear a lot of woo in this but it's not woo. It's science we in a sense To a fair degree not completely it's within bounds But the world that we see is a world that we create now that is different from saying we Create the objective world that isn't to get rid of the objective world But our picture of the objective world is a world that we create and it's motivated and I think this aligns nicely with what don hoffman is doing with respect to You know saying that you know darwinian truth doesn't actually see truth It's tricks and hacks because it's motivated and this makes perfect sense again if you look at What jordan peterson I think has been And I don't know who else has had this stuff But I think that the the great contribution that jordan peterson has made to me and I think to a number of others Is that it has opened up this learning? in a popular way in an accessible way And and it's nicely integrated in terms of in terms of all of this and so again I Jordan peterson has done me a tremendous Service in opening this up to me and forcing me to think through these things and those of you have been watching my channel for a Long time you're incredibly patient because all my channel has been is learning and thinking through these things and Trying to apprehend them and trying to get my mind around them and and over the last year I think I have grown and learned and and changed dramatically now moments like this I'm tempted to take down all my old Videos, but I think no this it's If in fact i'm doing anything worthwhile Shirts all wrinkled. Yeah, i'm a slob. Okay. I'm a if you haven't figured that out about me. I am a slob I shouldn't be a pastor because pastors should be better put together than this. But yeah, here I am in my wrinkly shirt I thought I took it out of the dryer in time. But anyway You didn't watch my video to see my to hear my laundry tales But but the thing I owe the debt about jordan peterson what my videos have done is is if you want to see The steps of my learning well, you can now i've got videos. I started making about the end of november beginning of december last year Come end of november december this year. I'll be a year doing videos on jordan peterson and you can watch hopefully the progress of my learning Over the course of this year, but but all of this stuff about apprehension About thinking about this world of facts. I was just listening to note in a network and he's reading carl ratzinger And I was thinking I I made a comment about transubstantiation in a previous video that I have to apologize for and I think I I think my understanding of transubstantiation was in error and I didn't faithfully Reflect the teaching of the roman catholic church and a listener wrote me a very kind but straightforward letter Walking me through some things pointing me to some resources and I stand corrected and actually listening to Some of what bishop barron said about transubstantiation I I think actually in many ways there's a fair amount of And i'm not i'm not an expert in the calvinist perspective versus the roman catholic perspective I'll probably I should probably read calvin more on that question is What bishop barron talked about in terms of some aspects of the lord's supper I thought this sounds a lot like calvinists perspective on the lord's supper, so That was really helpful and i'll probably I should probably do some more reading in that But it's also probably true that calvin was reacting to things that he saw in his time and you know We're all working on this this question of substances is tremendously difficult and strewn strewn cummings is is the noun and verb guy strewn And I want i'm here I've had a number of conversations with strewn and I think he's a brilliant guy and I want his His work to get out there, but he's a little shy So i'm continuing to work with him on his shyness and encourage him that his his work has real value But you know the noun and verb stuff and where was I going? Oh substance substance in trinity I mean these these ancient categories are deep in all this now. Sorry for the rabbit trail, but where was I? Yeah, so this whole jordan peterson journey that i've been on has been just tremendously helpful and now i'm actually going back and listening to The course maps of meaning again and realizing how much more I know now than what I knew in the summer of 2017 When I was first listening to maps of meaning Alex rosenberg has a book the atheist guide to reality now I I found this via alistair mcgrath whose video a video of whose i'm going to play Hopefully, you know, we'll see how the content goes with that But alistair rosenberg wrote a book the atheist guide to reality enjoying life without illusions And he these are these are quotes from his book which alistair mcgrath puts up on On a couple of his videos. Is there a god? No What is the nature of reality? What physics says it is? What is the purpose in the universe? There is none What is the meaning of life ditto? No meaning in life. No purpose in the universe What is the difference between right and wrong good and bad? There is no moral difference between them and Alistair mcgrath in the video i'm about to play. I think does a fair job i'm tempted to pick up the book, but i'm always tempted to i'm always a little reluctant to pick up a book that I don't know if If i'll necessarily I I don't like picking up a book because already I know i'll disagree with it. And so You know, I spend the ten dollars or so on this book if i'm basically reading it and being tempted to strawman something But this seems to be alex rosenberg's position and and I think quite actually Given what I understand his now again, I have a low resolution picture of him Given what I understand his assumptions to be his answers to these questions make sense from a particular perspective on the universe I have real doubts if from below how far you can get and this gets into this question of kirkegard because within the christian camp and There's the if a number of people have pointed out the michael russ john lennix conversation and unbelievable and what's really interesting about that is Lennox is the evidentialist and in a sense russ is the fetist and If one of these days I should probably have a conversation with esther o'reilly Some of you might enjoy that because i'm more on the fetious side my My reformed calvinism is more on the fetious side and and I think esther is more on the evidentialist side of the argument and and so that's when See stephen evans does his talk on kirkegard which someone else said people have sent me a lot of terrific videos links to a lot of terrific videos See stephen evans writing about kirkegard sees kirkegard again much more as a fetist the faith You need that leap of faith john lennix is much more of an evidentialist Here's all the evidence and and the evidentialists have a little bit more Have a little bit more trust in the project of natural theology We can build that tower to get if not all the way there mostly there and then most of the most christian Evidentialists finally come to a point of saying there is a there is a gap you need god to come down and meet you Um, they don't really build the tower of babel all the way up. I think They know their bible better than that But the christian fetus have look at the leap as a bigger leap and they they're less They're less confident how high you can build that tower of of natural theology But now alex rosenberg says you can't start the project at all Now I've made this i'm going to keep you're probably going to keep seeing this diagram for a while This is meaning purpose requires telos goals ends. Well what I see jordan peterson doing is trying to And we're going to talk about this a little bit later Are trying to finish the square here. So we've got reason from above you've got experience from below You've got the past and and history is and again an nt writes uh gifford lectures he goes he has one video that he he He dedicates fully to the question of history because history is this really big question to what degree are the facts of history? Apprehendable to us and this gets into exactly the same problem as we have with this clean room of facts from the monarchical vision that Okay, so there's these facts out there. You can't get at them. That's in a sense what don hoffman says Well, well history is full of facts to what degree can you get at the facts of history? The facts of history This is one of the big points that c.s. Lewis makes in his book miracles because he says You know people want to use hume to say whether or not miracles can happen The problem you have with history is that by definition everything in history happens only once and so your your Probability which really implicitly looks into the future when applied to the past doesn't really hold because all history is full of unique Incidences and even from a materialist perspective you can never You know apart from these tiny little scientific experiments that we do you can never Recreate anything out there in the wild in history. You can imaginatively Ask yourself what if caesar didn't cross the rubicon? I mean you can you can do those kinds of things but but history isn't accessible in that way But but none Nevertheless, we want to complete the square here because what we're really longing for when it comes to meaning is telos Which is the greek for end or to telestize what what jesus says on the cross when he dies You know, it is finished But it also means meaning and purpose and goal and future and the future is a very big deal with jordan peterson when he talks about sacrifice and how that works You might notice I use different headphones at work now when i'm in my office I use these little ones because You have these little ones in your ear for a while. They tend to itch so Now let's let's jump into alistair mcgrath and a really cool video that he did And i'll put the link to it in the in the notes and I don't know what kind of I don't know what kind of uh Copyright gresham college puts on their youtube videos, but i'll find out when I post this Post this but I I think this is a really helpful section and the whole video is worthwhile And again a listener sent me this video and I really appreciate it and I I can't always Remember which listener sends me what because I get so much email and so many messages But this center section of the video is really important and and here alistair mcgrath is continuing to process Alex rosenberg's book and then he jumps to another atheist iris murdoch. So let's let's listen to how Alistair processes this Put this in and now now My big project is really integrative i'm trying to integrate all of these things now alistair mcgrath Has a phd in biophysics He's got I don't know how many phds in theology and history He's written over 100 books it looks like I mean The guy is just he teaches at oxford the dude is flat out a genius And I don't know how these kinds of people I mean these this is exactly the kind of person that jordan peterson talks about these these Uberproductive people this tiny percentage of people and he writes another one like that that they produce I just can't comprehend how much stuff they produce But but mcgrath here, you know McGrath is no peterson. What do I mean by that? Well peterson is fun to watch. He's quirky. He's he's got his little northern Canada sayings. He's you know, I don't know. I just I just find peterson lovable. It's just fun McGrath is drier and you know it's just the way it is but What I really like about McGrath is when he puts up these quotes from these books I just think wow, he picked exactly the right quote and and so again we have this We have this We need subjectivity we can't apprehend the world without it We need this cloud of consciousness and and then we act within this cloud of consciousness and we bring our personalities in it and McGrath isn't as fun as peterson. So don't hold that against him but but see if you can kind of get through the What may feel like to you dryness? And and listen to what he's saying because this is this is some really pretty amazing stuff So here we go. No, I put in i'll read this too. He writes there is strong evidence That natural selection this is this is alex. Um, this is alex rozenberg produces lots of false But useful beliefs i'll read that again There is strong evidence that natural selection Provides sorry produces lots of false but useful beliefs And his argument here is very very interesting He says that one of these false but useful beliefs Is that actually we think real thoughts about a real world? whereas in effect That that you know in that sense alex rozenberg is tracking with don hoffman that that are Our We we our thoughts are we we can't penetrate the clean room we sully it and In a sense, there is no clean room. Obviously the clean room is imaginative that the world is dirty But we are dirty and and we can't We can't grab the world with our hands Without making it in some way our own and that falsifies the world But yet not so much that we lose touch with the world and it's it's that dirty space Between this imagined monarchical clean room vision and complete subjectivity that that and all this Dirty space in the middle that we actually do real work This is simply us believing something that may not be true. Have a look at this quote To plant a leaf is that actually we think real thoughts about a real world whereas in effect This is simply us believing something that may not be true. Have a look at this quote ultimately science and Scientism are going to make us give up as a loser The very thing conscious experience screams out at us largest and longest The notion that when we think Our thoughts are about anything at all inside or outside of our minds Now if you follow that through in the book, which I would encourage you to do if you have time You see that rosenberg is slightly uneasy about this but nevertheless is saying this is where the science seems to take me My my feeling about this is this that you know, this is a now don't forget McGrath is not only a theologian. He's also a scientist and again these these kind of crazy outlier smart people like McGrath You know, it's how on earth do you manage to get an advanced degree in? Biophysics and then go on to get advanced degrees in theology I mean, I I just can't comprehend how people can do that. But that's what this guy does an idea And in reflecting on the idea you and I have to decide whether it's right or wrong Or whether the tools we're using to try and answer that question actually work And really there seems to be a sort of circularity about this actually in effect Reason which is the tool we have at our disposal to try and engage these questions Is almost being dismissed as something that is prone to give false results and so I find myself and and that I think is key right there because And that I think is the appropriate understanding of reason In terms of what we do with reason again when we when we grab reason with our hands We sully it and so you can use reason reason isn't a Somehow a magic wand to give you truth Reason is this Process by which we construct upon a foundation But if the foundation is wrong, then the construction is wrong reason as as mcgillchrist notes is kind of a Is kind of a correlative tracking device that we can kind of track all together as we construct this tower Or build this chain of wondering what tools I have at my disposal to kind of check this particular approach out So I've given you Rosenberg as an example simply to open up one way of looking at this I have to say it's not an approach I find entirely persuasive But it is a very clear very coherent very well defined approach And for that reason I'm going to contrast it with iris murdoch who I find Much more interesting in many ways And murdoch I think is a name many of you will know and i'm sure many of you have read her What I like about murdoch in particular is that although she does write works of pure philosophy She also wrote novels And very often she used those novels to to open up in the in the form of a narrative Some of the big philosophical and moral questions of her day And struan you should be interested in that Where in effect we we see these things enacted in people's lives not simply as patterns of abstract thoughts Thought and murdoch was very very clear that morality was very very important and it involved Challenging ourselves involved in effect Confronting what we want with a vision of what we ought to want And and that's key and again you can't This is one of the great things about augustin as augustin says you can't have any of these conversations without this question of desire And what we want and you see we don't We don't even fully understand where that comes from but but that is more Foundational than just about anything else in us and that's really augustin's key insight In other words, it's not so much saying morality is what we naturally desire. It's about there being something that forces us to To interrogate or critique those natural ideas and ask us whether they're reliable and right And not only reliable and right but the whole conversation between weinstein and harris with respect to assassin You know genetic code that leads us astray morality of chimps We we transcend this supposedly coded Morality that we have to a higher one Well, where are you getting that higher one? And this is the question again of c.s. Lewis and the abolition of man and the dao One of the main problems of moral philosophy she writes might be formulated thus Are there any techniques for the purification and reorientation? Of an energy which is naturally selfish in such a way that when moments of choice arrive We shall be sure of acting Right there's If you want to take the at least the two vancouver lectures with brett weinstein There's the question right there in one one sentence. Yep. It's one sentence There's the question in one sentence and and this is what they are striving at now Now harris, i'm gonna keep talking about harris. This is the context of this conversation harris keeps saying yeah, it's easy It's just reason weinstein is a little more skeptical and says Um, I don't know and he's skeptical of peterson's project pulling in all of this mythology He's skeptical about that. So he's kind of this person in the middle. And of course peterson is saying well We have to we have to mine the depths and the riches of mythology In order to actually get here because and and again just in terms of I think a rational Evidentialist argument there are there's potential for gold in them thar hills in the mythology Even from a Scientistic basis which I think is peterson's strength and sam harris just doesn't see it But here iris iris murdoch says well, here's the question. Can we transcend chimp morality? Can we do something other than tear apart? Invading chimps from another tribe and have warfare and we say well human beings have done this We've managed to group ourselves in far larger groups than chimps have been able to group themselves Okay, but but we're still not very good at and and we don't even know You know, we've got some indications from biology and sociology about what has helped us adapt to that and it's these multiple hierarchies And I think peterson is right But but we still don't have a very good sense of of how you can orient Reality how you can orient morality and I think part of that is again because of this because you cannot orient morality Unless you have a telos and you unless you have an end It's it's like trying to shoot without a target. It's like trying to shoot into a cloud Of smoke or of dust or of or of water vapor Unless you can pinpoint the target your morality might be well, it's sort of in that direction But you can't identify it because your telos isn't and again, we're going to a little bit later get into peterson's telos, which is again in fact Which is which is in fact darwinistic. So Let's keep going Now murdoch's answer to that question is well, yes But it's a complicated answer And what she's trying to do is to say that to make this work We have to recognize there is something beyond us which Challenges or informs us so in effect our natural or innate ideas are subject to Scrutiny and challenge by something that's not subjective but is outside us That is the question of Of objective morality That is the question of moral knowledge and murdoch is saying we can only engage in this project of critiquing chimp morality of critiquing the code given us Within ourselves as assassin robots if we have another objective standard outside of ourselves To which we appeal and which we use to critique That which we are trying to transcend And our argument basically is that there has to be a transcendent Ideal which is capable of capturing both our minds and our imaginations which in effect Presents us with this vision of what is good and once that captures our imagination It motivates our conduct And and again, this is this is what? Harris and peterson and Weinstein are really reaching towards and when you bring doug Murray into the conversation Murray Murray is in some sense that the longing romantic skeptic that says, you know I had to throw this stuff out But in a sense he's he's wistfully looking in his garbage can and he's saying do I really want to get rid of that? Do I really want to send that to the dump that's been so beautiful and so useful, but I just don't believe it anymore And she sets out this in a number of writings. Um, here is one She's quoting from the book of common prayer 1662 in this little passage But she's trying to say that we need something beyond us To think about what is right Talking about the term good the proper seriousness of the term refers us to a perfection which is perhaps never Exemplified in the world. We know There is no good in this That's from the book of common prayer. It's Calvinism But which carries with it the idea of Transcendence and that really is the key theme for murdoch We need there to be something beyond us which in effect challenged us and informs us and Redirects those selfish thoughts which we so easily have in helpful and good direction And and this is what? Yeah, a lot of sam harris here. So sorry This is what sam harris says reason can do for him This is what dilla hunty says reason can do for him and and peterson keeps saying well show me Well, it's obvious It's not obvious to me And and and if it was so obvious then the the church of reason should be You know every street corner should have a church of reason on it You can barely keep one open in a major city. Never mind populate them through all the little All the little bergs over north america like we find churches, why is that? So you can see the Murdoch is moving in a direction which you and I will probably loosely describe as platonic or perhaps platanus In other words, there is there is this transcendent world beyond us Which is in some way? able to impact on our world giving us a vision of something Beyond this world which nevertheless shapes the way we think and behave in this world Murdoch uses this language of Transcendence a lot in her writings now. Let me emphasize. She's an atheist But she feels she has to have this notion of some kind of transcendent reality to give stability to the idea of moral notions here she is The good is transcendent reality. That means that virtue is the attempt Notice again, she needs this idea for stability and and this again is is part of what we deal with with respect to time You can have this monarchical vision in the space for objects But again part of what sullies it is we we can't we ourselves as human beings who live in consciousness and and cannot Process this world without time Time is such a complicated thing We cannot process this world without time what we bring time into it and and and then we bring decay Into it and and so and so for for murdoch she says well, we need something out there Which is good to give us stability because in the moment I think Eating that donut is a good thing and my body loves the fat my body loves the sugar but 50 years of eating donuts the doctor says not a good thing your life would have been better without the donut so then you weigh the Joy, I had in eating the donut versus the clogged cholesterol and whatever the the heck sugar is doing to my body so to be of some kind of Transcendent reality to give stability to the idea of moral notions here. She is The Good is transcendent reality. That means that virtue is the attempt to pierce the veil of selfish consciousness And join the world as it really is It's an empirical fact about human nature. This attempt cannot be entirely successful Okay good as a transcendent reality. So in a sense via good we can See, I think peterson is right with form for action is a better concept because I I don't think you can actually have good within this clean room monarchical vision space for objects there's no such thing as good because good is more Verb like and again in struan's thinking good is more verb like good has to do with action Um This gets into genesis and it is good it is good But but again, that's not that's a dynamic world that god creates in genesis one and calls it good And and so it's it's actually via the good that we can interact with this world As it's as it is designed to do and so I think again implicit. This is where christianity is so underneath Almost anything you find in the west that there's this Optimism about the nature of the world and about the created order that it is good and this again This is part of the reason people enjoy Calvinism creation fall redemption restoration You say well, that's not calvinism. That's the bible. Yeah, that's the point of calvinism We say that it that's that's the bible But a confessional layer says, you know puts their cards on the table and says this is what we think the bible is saying We do not believe that the world is just a A disposable thing on the way to a disembodied heaven that in my opinion opinion is more more gnosticism and this is where Huge swaths of american evangelicalism are more gnostic than christian in my opinion But well, I'll get in trouble for that too write it in the comment section And you can see the point she's she's really grasping at here That in effect, um, we need something To illuminate us to redirect us and that's not something within us But something beyond us Now many of you all know that murdoch was writing these and that again is is c.s. Lewis in the dow It is something beyond us. It's you know It's out there. It's as objective as this world of facts Thoughts back in the 1960s and early 1970s And at that time murdoch was based at oxford and at oxford at that time Any notion of transcendence was regarded with a certain degree of ridicule in the professional Philosophical circles in which she worked Yet murdoch insisted that we need some idea like this If we're going to make sense of human experience in general and moral experience in particular So one of murdoch's core insights there is that we have to act within this world within an empirical reality, but that In itself and of itself isn't good enough to enable or sustain our moral vision And murdoch is basically saying look the sciences are are wonderful, but they just cannot deliver this Transcendent vision that we need to inform and empower our moral vision This is peterson's point Okay, and he keeps making it you're not going to get there sam you need something more And iris murdoch another atheist Comes to the same point and says but then then you have the problem. Well, how can we get there? In form i've talked about that already Empower that means excite us motivate us make us want to feel we're part of something bigger and become part of this moral vision So if we were to set murdoch and rosenberg side by side They're both philosophers. They're both atheists, but you can see they are coming at this from very different angles indeed I think you'll probably have gathered that my own sympathies are much more with murdoch and indeed i'll be exploring her a little bit more in a moment but this this debate or discussion between murdoch and Rosenberg I think illustrates very well the key questions that lie behind this lecture Can science help us here? And if it can't well, where do we go? So it's a very interesting question. I think to raise What murdoch is saying is that we need something beyond science if morality is to be stabilized and liberated from changing fashions and moods So if murdoch is right that as moral beings we're immersed in the reality Which transcends us then where does that kind of thinking take us? Now up to this point I kind of way indicate I quite like the way in which murdoch is going But I'm going now to just to raise a question. It seems to me to cause her difficulty And it's this here is the question. I would ask of murdoch If she is right and there's this transcendent thing called the good one of the very famous lecture The sovereignty of good where she talks about this this radiant vision of goodness which energize and motivates us. Well If she is right How do we how do we actually know what it's like? Where do we see this? If you like Enacted in other words, is this just some sort of abstract idea which each of us understands in our own way? Or is this some way in which this transcendent idea is? Is disclosed or embodied so we can actually see what's like And now this here is a question of revelation. Okay now again Murdoch is an atheist. She's she's going to practice the contemporary bias of excluding any type of traditional idea of christian revelation, but she makes the point that For human beings to interact with it. They're going to have to see it. It's going to have to be disclosed It's going to have to be out there in the world so that people can see it interact with it Desire it pick it up and do it themselves And murdoch actually in her novels is very very good about this. She she presents characters who exemplify In their lives the kind of moral virtues she's talking about Which is why she writes fiction makes sense, but for me the Achilles heel of murdoch's moral vision is that um We how do we actually See what this is like. It's very it very easily becomes simply an abstract idea beyond us rather than something that we can somehow Relate to and it gives us excitement. How do we give substance to this ideal? And that for me is an issue that seems to me to be important here If I could use a theological word to try and put my finger on what I think is the problem here I think that we need goodness to be Incarnated in the words to take some sort of form in our own world So we can see it and say that gives an idea about what it is and motivates us to want to be like it Now there's in a sense where you get jordan peterson's john one Logos the word becomes flesh and dwells within us and again now for peterson He's doing natural theology. And so he is trying to say well The logos which is we have developed over 3.5 billion years of watching each other then comes into So in a sense the the whole ecosystem with peterson because again, he's trying to maintain that bias of excluding revelation Because that's that's what his audience demands. That's what the academy demands That's what the the public sphere the public realm demands. He's trying to maintain that otherwise His argument is going to be discredited and he gets so close to it that that sam harris gets the jitters But but peterson said well, that's the logos. That's the word becoming flesh and dwelling amongst us. That's the disclosure that's the the revelation and so Of course, um mcgrath will use theological language because he's he because he's a christian He says I am not going to necessarily For the sake of conversation I can play within this frame that you demand of me But I myself don't actually buy the frame and its limitations and its biases So if we use classic platonic imagery the kind that murdoch is clearly interested in We would need to talk about how we have access to the ideal of the good How can we mediate between this transcendent world of goodness and our own world And that to me is a problem that I think murdoch has If I were now to just begin to approach this from a more christian angle I would really want to pick up on this theme of incarnation namely that the transcendent actually enters into and becomes present within and embodied within our own human history In other words if I could just use classical theological language we could say that truth beauty and goodness those three words are very often linked together as the so-called Teutonic triad truth beauty and goodness Can be seen in christ incarnated within the actualities of life Now there's a lot more I need to say here, but I think some of you were saying well look This is quite interesting but but persuade us that this notion of a transcendent good Actually really matters And I think that's a fair question So i'm going to do this by giving you a historical example, which I think might be helpful here we're going to look at a situation that arose in Nazi Germany in the late 1930s And we're looking at a man called hangrich roman And not a name I would expect any of you to know it is quite obscure But he wrote a little book called the eternal return of natural law Let me tell you why he wrote it and and I think once you see that maybe this will become a lot clearer And maybe a lot more interesting as well the problem was that Adolf hitler came to par Yeah, really by 1934 german he was in the process of being nazified including its legal frameworks And the real issue was if you define goodness in terms of doing what the law said And the law books have been rewritten to reflect a nazi perspective Then in effect you were locked into a sort of legal positivism which could only have one outcome and hangrich roman was a Lawyer who just said look this is terrible. There has to be something beyond law By which law is to be judged I think many of you will recognize that sentiment very very easily that in fact there are our own human laws but these could easily be hijacked by Political pressure groups or by particular in groups. We need something beyond law And in many ways what roman is saying is we need some understanding of natural law whereby there is some Transcendent idea of goodness or justice over which we have no control Which in effect must inform what we think about goodness and justice Otherwise those who are in power are simply going to invent ideas which suit their own particular agendas and concerns and it's interesting here that this is exactly the the the position At which we meet jordan peterson in that There's a process c16 thing There's a process of law by which law is supposed to be reformed Well, how do you how do you consider a change in law to be reform? Or corruption well whether or not it pursues a standard now now also notice what mcgrath here says beyond our control Now now this gets this gets very interesting because on one hand we always reach for the elements of the things within the monarchical vision in order to control them but we also know that Law has to in some ways be outside of our control because we don't trust each other and for good reason And and this is something that I think is is deeply built into the idea of god because without a god All we are left with is each other or darwinistic selection and and darwinistic selection by that definition is Is not just or unjust it's simply outside of justice that which dies So that there is no justice in darwin and you can have um, you can hear harari say that there is no justice in darwin um Don hoffman says that darwin, you know darwinian selection isn't selecting the right It is selecting the strong or the adaptive or the the thing that will succeed and this is where we're going to get into critiquing Jordan peterson's goal, but but peterson comes into the comes into our screen over c16 because part of his political agenda is There is a group, you know, there are groups going what's got what's happening in our society right now is a religious movement It's a new civil religion That that says well, we have to reform our laws to pursue a particular idea of justice But it doesn't actually defend that idea of justice it doesn't actually say this is why This is just and and this is unjust Because and what's happening is that we've got this implicit realm within our heads of that Which we think is just now in a little bit I'm going to play a little bit more of mcgrath where he's going to get into rorty Who's a pragmatist and we're going to we're going to deal with that end of it But but how do you reform a law what is your goal for your world view nazis? saw racial progress progressive evolution to what you imagine to be the pinnacle of the race and then they had this, you know there wasn't blonde but supposedly blonde hair blue-eyed were the the the supermen of the race and well, they they kind of got this from a From a a scientific approach where you said well dark You know gorillas are dark and hairy and so if you get all the way to blonde hair blue-eyed That must be the that must be the other end of the spectrum and so via science They concoct this spectrum of racial superiority And you know off we go with that Marxists, of course had material and social equality this this imagined progressive evolution beyond the social structures that we see that are oppressive today and And so we're going to be on that now every attempt to reform a law implicitly appeals to something in the reformers mind and and very seldom to the reformers are the reformers actually asked to come out and say What exactly is the law that you are trying to shape our individual laws? Towards we'll say fairness. Okay. Well fairness is Well, you know when you when you sat with your brothers and sisters and your mother gave you a piece of cake and said split It and the rule of fairness was one cuts the other picks. Okay. Well, that's kind of fair It doesn't really necessarily mean they both get equal amounts of cake. It in a sense means they both get what they want Okay Well now we're now we're starting to get a little bit deeper below the surface And and get a little deeper below the surface of that which is in our culture what we define as just and and in a sense Culturally we have defined as just to get what you want well, what happens when you actually say you want something and then you get it and you realize that Your your wanting mechanism wasn't real good You really wanted that Yugo and if you're old enough to remember this car that came from yugoslavia You you really wanted that yugo or you really wanted those remember hundi first came to america. The cars were cheap And oh, I really want that Well, and then you had a hundi or you had a yugo and you had it for a few years and soon You didn't want it. And and so what in a sense we do is we enshrine our desires and we say You want it? Here you go but but It was that person back then that wanted it and the person today has second thoughts about that choice And so were all those the same person must I be held to the? Wantings of myself in the past or can I now this gets into a lot of contemporary conversations Can I reconstruct myself in the now? Against myself in the past and so there you see right away how time Figures into this great equation So so in the west today, what is that implicit standard that we have? That we are trying to change the laws towards that that which defines what we call Progress or that which discriminate differentiates between reform and corruption That's and what murdoch is saying is that we've always got an idea up there There but how do we know that that's a good idea because the nazis Thought race was the thing to watch and again back to the back to the question of that which our hierarchy selects What racism basically says is racial distinctions are the most important thing in the room That is the gun in the crowd or the snake in the office that when you come up to someone you look at their race and that's the most important thing thing to think about part of my my difficulty with what I see happening to the the racial conversation today is in the name of Anti-racism they are putting race back at the top of the hierarchy and it's like All you're going to do is have everybody focus on that And and that is against what we thought was the focus should be in the 50s and 60s When martin luther king jr. In his dream speech said we won't be judged by the color of our skin Because race is a bad thing to have at the top of your hierarchy and I think The history of the 20th century has made it abundantly clear and it's been Validated by various ways of looking at it that race is a bad thing to have the top of your attention hierarchy So don't have it there, but that's what the nazis had put race at the top now now marx comes along and says economics Social class this is what you should look at So in other words before you listen to what a person has to say You should take a peek into their bank account You should take a peek into their their privileged suitcase before you hear anything out of their mouth You should take a peek at that because that will then determine the quality of what comes out of their mouth And I think peterson is exactly right that that's another bad thing to have at the top of your hierarchy But but what's happening in terms of social as we say reform? Well when we put that at the top of the hierarchy, then our laws will be more just well what you've just basically done is saying This is your god This is the axiom you're working out now. You might not even be able to Articulate the thing that's out there the standard that we are pursuing But it is still functioning within you and functioning within your community and functioning within the society And this is the crazy thing about us as human beings and another reason that i'm skeptical of this rationalistic Um utopianism Because we're not that rational we we all Why is it all the kids come to class thinking the same fashions are? Cool because they've been formed and because their watchers have been watching tv and because Either kanya with his little red hat on is really cool or he's not really cool or I mean And these things are always working in our heads and they're not conscious to us, but they get played out in consciousness And and so what you know actually how rationality can serve is to say pull these things out and say well Let's examine them because again as mcgill criss says Rationality is a consistency tool. Is this consistent? Can we weigh between these things? Can we differentiate and get beyond our biases and our subjective things? Well, but then the first question is going to be what is at the top of your hierarchy? Is it race? Is it class? And I think in the west what we've come to see is again. It's hard to see It's always harder to see our own this happiness equality This and I think that's what sam harris means by well-being Um, no sufferer left behind and and and this goes to animals, too You know increasingly we're probably going to see in our food industrial complex How much did the cow suffer? That offered me the beef for this burger Now now again, that's not a bad question and and c.s. Louis actually was if you read his stuff He was very conscious of animal rights and part of that because he loved animals And was his love of animals romantic or or was it you know, did he just simply project it from from story or? I won't go down that rabbit trail, but you know you might before you buy hamburger you know the cow suffered at a level of 10 for this and maybe Maybe maybe 10 is good Okay, let's let's set the metric that way 10 is good And so that that was one of california's supposedly happy cows Which whenever I used to see those ads I used to laugh because if you look at dairies in california, they're muddy smelly huge um dairy yards And the happy cow commercials had these cows out there on these pristine Green fields of cut grass and it's like that isn't even natural But but that's the you know, and this is just simply human projection what a we take a human We take a what we would imagine would be a nice place for us and we drop a cow on it Well, how do you know what a cow wants? Well someone who really knows cows. Well, maybe when I talk to john van donk i'll have that conversation Because dutchmen know cows pretty well because they live with them How do you know what makes a happy cow? Um, is it is it what makes a happy person if you put a cow in my living room and have him live in here? Well, this make the cow happy I doubt it what makes a happy cow. I don't know I you know, even in my life. I have a little dog. He's Sleeping behind me, you know What makes the dog happy? Well, i've got a better sense of that because I live with the dog But I can't really know because I can't climb into the dog's head But this isn't a sense what we're doing in our culture. We want we want progressive egalitarian Egalitarian Happiness all around and no no sufferer left behind and if if someone is suffering Well, then they you know, they should have the right to kill themselves But this is again where jordan peterson comes in because peterson comes in and says but you know what? We often trade exchange You know We we will take suffering in the name of meaning and we will suffer greatly For for the sake of meaning and out of gaining meaning so so really what if you want something that's Probably better at the top of your hierarchy. You maybe should pick meaning Rather than suffering and say is is the cow having a meaningful life? You're going to have the same problem is if you thought figuring out what made the cow happy was difficult Try and figure out if if the cow even experiences meaning the cow might not have enough consciousness to experience Meaning but then again, we don't we have very little idea what what how much consciousness a cow has so This is you know, this is where this is where we go with this And and this is in a sense where we bump into jordan peterson's telos and and what jordan peterson within his With his within his secular box says well the best Telos we can have is darwinian truth and darwinian ends that which promotes survival and he appeals then to the 19th century Pragmatists, but there are real problems with this exactly what species survival or thriving or self-actualization? Are you imagining now? I think it was harari in one of his books mentioned, you know, it's a pretty good time for cows and you might say well How do you know? It's a good time for cows There sure are way way more cows and they have they're given antibiotics and they're given free health care and they're giving free food and Is that is that cow goodness is that cow? Well-being but then again, we kill the cows and we eat them, you know it's kind of the question of Of the of the happy turkey is is the turkey that is out there living in the wild at least in California in our neighborhoods, you know trying to avoid cars and And pit bulls and you know Is that turkey happy or how about the turkey? That's living in a pen full of other turkeys and they're getting fattened up and seems like turkey utopia until easter comes not easter Turkey utopia until thanksgiving comes along is is is that the end of the goal the telos of turkey? Uh, and and so you have to begin to ask with darwin well Is mere propagation of a code of dna Sufficient is is that in fact the telos is that the goal because darwinian evolution is full of dead ends darwinian dead ends are part of the broken eggs Um on the way to the omelet stalin's omelet, but it doesn't help you figure out what kind of omelet is good Or or what an omelet is at all and again if you read the metaphysical club part of the You know part of what darwin points out is that well the question isn't Which finch will survive the question is what is finch? and and as we're talking about human beings remaking themselves with ai and And you know bio link and you know all these things that we look about and that we look at in science fiction What is a human being and you've got rogan and musk saying well, maybe Us in the meat space are bootloaders for our ai children's successors or subsumers Is that what we are and see darwin can't answer that question There may be more cows on earth right now than there have ever been in all of humanity But does that make this cow utopia? does does october In the turkey yard make it turkey Utopia or turkey holocaust. I don't think darwin can give us that answer and you can you can very quickly see that in terms of the american ethos of happiness and darwin of survival even those are at odds and so then the question is well what What exactly is? Revealing us because we are all functioning with this imagined good the nazis had one the marxists have one And americans have one in fact, they have competing ones. Well, well, how do we know which one is good? Well, weinstein and harris have exactly the same problem But they're less aware of the problem than peterson as it appears They just glibly recognize problems in chip morality or assassin robot coding and assume a standard Well, okay How do you come up with a standard? alex rosenberg says give it up We we can't do it within the limitations of the secular box If you say physics must determine this is a project we simply can't do so all of this pretense of morality And meaning it's all foolishness and maybe I should pick up rosenberg's book because I would dare bet Now it's unfair to say this but I would dare bet He is going to go to the freedom from religion route and say I can have experiences of meaning I can have experiences of happiness I can have experiences of justice and that's the best we can do I I understand his point. I see his rationale I can see the power and how his argument is on one level compelling and satisfying Given the fact that when we see this square we really like tidy things and say yep that fits I'll be that heroic person that But as I get into later, that's exactly where it falls short Because meaning this is where the ontological argument comes in because meaning which I know is merely illusory Is less than meaning that I imagine is ontological and So let's jump back into McGrath where he talks about rorty We need something if I put it like this by which what we think is right can be Interrogate are you really sure about this or are you simply locked into? conventional ways of thinking And this is this again when at the beginning of vancouver one When when peterson is agreeing with harris and Weinstein we want objective morality We want something that You know, well, why why don't we want relativism because then you're just wind up saying the holocaust There's no way of saying the whole what happened in in germany in the 40s Or what happened in the soviet union in the 30s to the 70s? and 80s Or you have no way of actually saying one is better than the other So how can we get there? Well, let's try pragmatism Now it's not an abstract question. I'm afraid many of you will have read the philosopher richard rorty r-o-r-t-y A very interesting american pragmatist philosopher who I think has written some of the most interesting works of philosophy recently And rorty takes the view that actually what we perceive to be just or right Is largely the outcome of social conventions and This is where he talks about this in this book the consequences of pragmatism. Some of you will know this book If not, it's a very interesting book and rorty here is simply making the point that In effect, we decide what is right. It's a matter of social convention And there is no need to invoke anything transcendent. We decide for ourselves Which has he concludes one important implication and it's this There is nothing deep down inside us Except what we put there ourselves No criterion that we have not created in the course of creating a practice no standard of rationality It's not an appeal such a criterion no rigorous Argumentation that is not obedience to our own conventions That's quite a long sentence. But the gist of it is look we have this This is what we call the group thinker a way of thinking which becomes settled and crystallized And once that's happened, you can't get outside it Everything is in effect shaped by the settled understanding of what things are it cannot be challenged It cannot be interrogated And a lot of cultural commentators would say that rorty is describing Very well the problem in effect those in cultural power very often Just get locked into certain ways of thinking But rorty doesn't help us ask what might be done to break free from this In fact rorty himself was very very clear that actually this was a real problem And this is one of the most famous sentences from this book where rorty in effect is saying look There is a problem with what i'm thinking, but I can't see a way around it. This is reflections on the implications Of his viewpoint. He believes it to be right to be better than alternatives. But nonetheless there is this Niggling concern that just isn't going to go away and it's this When the secret police come when the torturers violently innocent There is nothing to be said of them in the form There is something within you which you are betraying though. You embody the practices of a totalitarian society Which will endure forever. There is something Beyond those practices which condemns you Now it's an interesting quote again rorty doesn't solve this problem But he does give us this very very Interesting insight that there's something not quite right Yes, there is this we do have this tendency as human beings to get locked into certain ways of thinking and we need something beyond those practices But how does that break in? And again, this is why I think peterson needs better conversation partners because when you look at how People have been dealing with these questions. You recognize that so much of what we see with the celebrity atheists You know, I appreciate the interdisciplinary approach that peterson is trying to bring to this but You have some really Smart people out there articulate people that have been Wrestling with these issues and they're writing books about them now. None of us are have enough time To read all the books and this again is why? What a good culture does for us is affords us wisdom that we ourselves Don't have time to develop ourselves. That's what a culture does and this is this is you know, potentially in terms of human beings The thing that has made us so amazingly Dispominant on the planet because this is what we can do We can be raised within a culture to have wisdom that we have not earned And I I you know again i'm thinking about young's quote that peterson often uses but there's two sides to that quote That that we all benefit when we have a culture that bequeaths us ideas and practices and habits and norms and laws That we in our tiny little 80-year lifespan have not had time to develop ourselves The problem the problem that happens when what so what happens in culture now if there is in fact this objective standard out there And the culture loses sight of it This of kennan is part of peterson's conservative ethos the culture loses sight of it Then what happens is that the culture loses that knowledge? And the people suffer and you know some of what we've been seeing happen with respect to The age of my children now puts me again in terms of my hierarchy I pay attention to what's happening with 20 and 30 somethings in terms of the quest of finding A lifelong partner for family and children and now you might say well all that is in the past. Okay. Well Do you have something more To defend that rationally than just some Progressivistic idea that you don't need marriage to have children do children really thrive and see part of the difficulty is that we enter into these social experiments Making snap judgments ourselves based on low resolution, which we it's the only way we can do it but you don't really know the Consequence of the social experiment even within one lifetime again as i'm working through these things I think it takes two or three or four generations before you actually know the consequence of an imagined reform that you put into law and And this is why having a clear vision of a true objective morality is so vital 360 degrees in terms of life in terms of well-being in terms of happiness But not making happiness the thing at the top of the hierarchy not making survival the thing at the top of the hierarchy Not making you know race or social class the thing at the top of the hierarchy and they say well What should be at the top of the hierarchy? Well now we're Treading in the paths that religions tread So I have this paradox of belief you suspect you believe something deep down you suspect you know What the what the objective morality is you suspect that you understand the way that the laws need to be reformed and so you have political ideas and you have political notions and political feelings and moral feelings and Moral ideas and you have all of this and you're you're advocating for them and good This is this is part of what I think western society has done Well in which we give people freedom of speech the ability to advocate for something But then they go out into the public sphere and we work on them together and we evaluate them and we've got our biases And we've got our yeah, buts and we've got our no ways and all of these things But you're always not sure because there are multiple members even within your own internal consciousness committee Your beliefs are not subject to your immediate will and that's a funny thing you can't help but believe something because you are brought up in it and And that's not entirely a bad thing again You've inherited wisdom that you wouldn't have had time in your tiny little life to accumulate yourself And in a sense all of the 16 or 20 year olds out there who are you know calling for something? Well to a degree they can be forgiven because this is stuff that they've inherited and this is stuff They've grabbed on too quickly, but they haven't really had time to work through and make their own This is in a sense why we have voting age and people want to keep dropping it it's like You're in a sense just giving votes to other dominant voices in their worlds because Many who are at a certain age just can't help but but but work on these things But but your beliefs are not subject to your immediate will you can't often and people will write me and say well You know I hear a lot of what you're saying and it's attractive, but I just can't believe in God And I understand that you don't just sit down one day and say I'm gonna believe in God and then you do it No, it's just like Peterson said you've just changed something at the surface of you and for it to get all the way down Well, well, how do you do that? Well you do that by actually? Shaping the elephant and changing things in your life and going to church and being around believers and singing songs and reading books and working through liturgy and You know the elephant changes slowly, and that's a good thing So the question then is what is in your box what what if this is your box? You know reason from above Experience from below past its record history, but but what is your telos? What is your end is it your personal well-being well This is where you get into the the Piaget equilibrated self well if it's if it's good for you You know it should be good for your neighbors if it's good for your neighbors It's probably good for you, too And and out you go from there through time and through society, but but many people just wander around with Whatever thing that they've they've inherited and they don't even know they have it so sit down and think what what is at the top of? my hierarchy What do I think should be the the the thing out there towards which we? reform our laws it's not an easy thing and And there are just really a number of options, but they are limited. There's Alex Rosenberg's nihilism What are you afraid of you know be an elist but but Nietzsche's questions Then then really come to the fore in that are you subject to Nietzsche's criticism that your morality is simply your care for status among the other elephants that you are good because because of your mirror your mirror neurons and because your your internal wiring and again Peterson has done a good job of Illuminating that your internal wiring is built for status and and are you good because you want to climb to the hierarchy? And are you just simply parroting what the people around you are saying in order to get to the top of that hierarchy? And to be liked by them and to be esteemed by them and to be rewarded by them It's a rather postmodern cynical view, but there's truth to it And and we are that way that does that is what motivates us and when you see people that are in very much alignment with their community That's almost always a part of it, but it's not always the part of it And this is why outliers are so important because outliers Seem to have at least the capacity for changing the conversation Because they are not being completely subject to what everyone else is being subject to You're not transcending the natural elephant in this way you You see enough to imagine that Transcendence and hope it can be done But you can't on this basis say you should or should not do and in that sense Rosenberg is consistent with his Scientism and with his secular box Then you have crowd-sourced social morality and this is I think something similar to Rorty's perspective And and this is what Weinstein and Harris are doing with some vague notion of socially inherited with some Eschatological belief that someday you will discover its foundation in reason or something justifying the conclusions You've already come to and now Sam Harris thinks he's found it Weinstein seems to be kind of on the edge and Peterson is looking for it And and that's the project. That's what make the conversation interesting But but this is in many ways. I think subject to Peterson's critique that this is just secularized Christianity and and in fact their Eschatological belief that someday reason will win is really no different than waiting for Jesus second coming. It's it's it's simply I'm not saying this is true of Jesus second coming lest someone bring me up on charges in the Christian Reformed Church, but Functionally, it's the same thing because on what basis do you imagine reason will win? Christians believe in the second coming of Jesus because he said so and And they trust him and so that's why the Theology of the second coming has continued to endure in the church and now it's sorely tested 2,000 years and still a no-show. So is he coming? Is it coming in my life? What will the coming be so on and so forth, but Everybody's got an eschatology and and you know Weinstein and Harris imagining that someday we'll get there or maybe not Well, that's eschatological Now you've got Jordan Peterson's quest for natural theology and really natural law and he's still clinging to Darwinian notions of progress because that's all he's got but you know if if if our if What we give birth to is AI and it destroys us Well, there you go Darwinian truth, but maybe we're the bootloader for the the AR Subsumers who are going to take our place Hoping that the old books but Peterson is hoping that in the old books there might be whispers of something else But he's hesitant to give himself to it and again all these rumors about Jordan Peterson looking at CS Lewis's trilemma and and You know Sam Harris wants to say, you know, Jesus rose probably not let's let's social pressure Peterson into saying probably Peterson into saying probably not on stage so we can keep him in our tribe and Nietzsche just smirks at something like that says see Jordan don't want to lose your status with Sam don't want to lose your status with Brett and Eric We're all subject to these statuses But when I you know, so why am I still a Christian still oh this progressivism is hard to weed out Why am I a Christian because I look at all these schemes and say you have no secular ought You know if it's nihilism, well, then I and if it's if Nietzsche is right, it's a will to power Well, then I can will to believe in Jesus Secularity can't find a more compelling tell us I don't think Darwin gives us a better tell us than the glory of the kingdom of God Because the because of the two I'm beyond the two options on the ground I want from Nietzsche to nihilism That's pretty basic in us Remnants of my genetic code must be passed along even in a subsume even in subsumed by a race even if in even if subsumed by a race as Removed from me as I am from the other mammals whose code I have subsumed That's an ought that's a tell us that's a vision I'll keep the Christian vision. Thank you Why not believe in a better story? so there's a little hour and a half for a Monday morning and Let me know what you think
