 Hi, this is Paul and I wanted to do a little bit of a video on Jordan Peterson was on real time with Bill Maher last night and I've been a fan of Bill Maher for a lot of years I used to I was a very faithful watcher of his show politically incorrect what I really appreciated about Bill Maher was that he had a lot of honesty and a lot of opposing points of view and he wasn't afraid to talk about it and You know Bill Maher is is rather famously anti-religious Which hey, that's his thing you know if if you only if you only watch people who agree with you you make yourself weaker and you make yourself dumber and So I I really appreciate Bill Maher I've always I've always enjoyed him and I know a lot of people might not like that I enjoy him but hey I do so he had Jordan Peterson on last night Which was quite interesting and he had he had him on with the governor of the state of Washington that for our Canadian friends is on the American political spectrum Pretty as far to the left as as you can get He had Alex Wagner who I hadn't heard of her at all before a CBS commentator Something like that and Frank Bruni who is a columnist at the at the New York Times. I read his columns Semi-regularly he too is is is over to the left and Sometimes I I get annoyed at his column. Sometimes I like his columns that's kind of the that's kind of the purpose of an opinion columnist and so the the discussion also had the lawyer for Stormy Daniels on and talked about that and Bill Maher is Bill Maher. He does he does his shtick and he does his comedy and But then he had Jordan Peterson on and he was he seemed pretty he seemed to be a fan He said he'd watched quite a few of his videos, which I found really interesting Not totally surprising because you know, what what tends to happen is we tend to see things on this political spectrum and And we tend to isolate things on that political spectrum and and people have way more layers than that Bill Maher is kind of a libertarian and And has some of those Some of those traits that libertarians have where they're they're over on different sides of the issue He had a lot of things on the show about pot and and 420 and his Belief that that pot should be legalized Throughout the states so it was an interesting show and they needed Jordan Peterson on and the Jordan Peterson segment for many Jordan Peterson fans You'd hear a lot of the stuff you usually hear about Jordan Peterson. It was it was worth watching I'm not gonna play that segment. I'm gonna play the overtime segment Because the I thought there were some really interesting things in the overtime segment and it was also curious to see how Peterson was going to be on that show and and you know because often when Peterson is dead on right in terms of hierarchies and their status and status impacts conversations and part of Part of what made the channel for interviews so important was there was a lot of status going on in that conversation And Peterson didn't back down and in fact Bill Maher let off the introduction to Peterson with a little bit of the Kathy Newman interview, which I thought was was noteworthy too But then Maher has kind of the regular show which goes for an hour and then he has an overtime segment which goes right up on YouTube Generally speaking if you look on Bill Maher's YouTube channel, I'll put it I'll put it in the I'll put it in the notes If you look on Bill Maher's YouTube channel often bit by bit the show will come out And so I'm sure you'll be able to see the Jordan Peterson segment even if you don't have HBO But the the overtime segment I thought was very interesting during the program there was a The Alex Alex Wagner was that it she and she kind of took on Peterson which was interesting to watch and Peterson was As I would expect he was civil and polite also again there's there's a lot of status in this room and and whereas you know if Peterson is Is has his own stage he is in that sense that you know He's the top banana or these that he's the he's the guy in charge in a room like this This is Bill Maher show and Bill Maher keeps it his show and so Bill Maher That's again. That's who Bill Maher is and that's his shtick So as I did with because this is a relatively short video I'm gonna play it through once because I think most of you probably haven't seen it and then I'll go back over it and I'll And I'll jump in at some different points You First thing before we get to the questions you want to respond to what I just said about marijuana Well as we talked about Starbucks We talked about our great voter rights bill We talked about our efforts to be climate change, but for you bill I can honestly say we got the best weed in the United States I Say going in this well regulate it is well regular that's right by the way They humble County would give you a run for your money. They are but but they're putting a little pressure on us we've heard from the Attorney General in Seattle actually and we didn't make sure that they back off and Wouldn't it be wonderful if the first time Donald Trump said something that was actually true if he said he'd leave us alone on our marijuana Decriminalization yeah, I hope that that will okay Well yes Jeff Sessions has said good people don't smoke marijuana. Yeah, so Thank you, I don't not good people here, okay Michael Will you ever release the contents of the warning shot disk of evidence you tweeted about oh, yeah? Possibly it depends on how the case progresses. I mean you know we we what's on it well We You know we took that picture And we we tweeted it out And it was exactly that it was a warning shot to Michael Cohen the president that if they Tried to claim that my client was a liar after 60 minutes there was going to be Consequences and it worked and it worked perfectly because we heard nothing from them So we have the DVD and we're going to release it when and if it's necessary, and we're going to see what happens with the case But but but make but make no mistake about it. It's locked and loaded Yes, I mean I've been listening to yeah all of this about Trump and watching how this conversations go in the US And I have one question about it I mean There's all these people in the US who are on the conservative side who are aligned with Trump for all sorts of reasons There's all this tension around his presidency and attempts to pull him out of his office for various reasons and like What what do you think will happen if that comes to pass? What what do you think will happen to these people that have identified with Trump and like how is it that? That Democratic types for example are holding out their hand to say to these conservative types sort of like welcome back into the fold Because it looks to me from an out for an outsider's perspective that Your country is polarizing in a way that's not good and that you know people are going after Trump and I understand that it's not Like I don't understand that but there's all these people that elected him and that are identified with him and they're they're not taking this Well, you know and so well, they're not they're not it's not and you know you might not think they're very bright and all of that and and you know, they're backwards and and and all of those things but But you but you know You need to have respect for the rest of your citizens And if you're if your country isn't gonna pull itself apart Then I really see this happening from an outsider's perspective when I come down here and I lived in the States for a while It wasn't like this before if he if he was just a regular Republican president with Republican policies I would say you'd have a point But what what is so alarming is the assault on Democratic norms what we were talking about here today Things like threatening to put people in jail threatening to put journalists in jail wanting military parades praising dictators Wanting to be a dictator. I mean we are at a moment here This is I try to impress on this on the people who are too young to remember a lot of presidents and a lot of elections How incredibly different this is than anything that ever came before? I never much like the other Republicans who were in office, but I have a renewed respect for them George George Bush admit Romney would not have tried to pull this shit. They just wouldn't what about Nixon Nixon got caught And he gave himself up basically well, although although this president makes the Watergate burglars look brilliant We can we can be as tough as we're being on the president I think we should for all the reasons you just said bill without telling his supporters that they're stupid without saying that of deplorables if We want to bring them around to what I would say is a more enlightened kind of thinking And we want them to see Donald Trump as someone who's turned the presidency into one long infomercial for Mar-a-Lago You know we can do that without saying to them you've been duped to your chumps. You're dumb You're deplorable and I think we need to talk to them with more generosity than we do Thesis that the left is too preoccupied with being non confrontational Right my left is too well just that we are All right, that's a good question the idea that that liberals especially Intellectuals are preoccupied with politically correct speech that they're all I see I see and and yet no they're too preoccupied with with identity politics by a large margin and they tend to categorize everyone by their ethnicity and their sex and their Gender and I think all that does is turn people into Tribal actors and that the end result of that is catastrophe weren't you also saying though that that the left is too worried about offending people I Think that that goes along I will yes But then on the other hand When the left for example offends people in the political sphere you're questioning whether that's Somehow bad for society writ large well, I'm concerned about I don't I think that's a good question I don't I think that those two issues are I think that those two issues are somewhat separate. I'm concerned about The the dialogue in the United States around the presidency Pulling people people farther and farther apart. It has nothing to do with the behavior of Trump I think this is an independent issue you can you can say Positive or negative things about my supportive you see I know that's the thing is it's but that's the issue That's that's the issue is they did support him and without the circus. He's just a lonely clown Yeah, but he has these these people in Congress who are enablers and this base that it is a cult of personality Not unlike dictatorships. We've seen in the past. I mean he said once famously I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any fans Mm-hmm. Yes, and he has proved that to be almost true I mean we cannot imagine what he would do where they were turning them because I don't know what that would be I don't think it's anything because whatever it was he would just say well. It's fake news But okay, so imagine he's impeached just for the sake of argument impeacher convicted Okay, either of those, but it seems to me that matters one. He has to leave Yeah, I know it's not it's not an unimportant detail But it still seems to me that it leaves you with the problem of what do you do with the? Disaffected 40% that are going to be very unhappy about this independent of Trump's behavior Kind of like the Sunnis after we kicked over Saddam. Well, that's that's a hell of a sight. Yes, right Yes, right, that's what I worry about This is an argument looking for an argument rather than a solution. We're not waiting for impeachment We're making sure that people understand Donald Trump cannot stop us today Donald Trump could not stop me from the first net neutrality bill to make sure people have access to the Internet He could not stop us from doing that. He cannot stop us He cannot stop us from acting on climate change with all this bloviating saying it's just a hoax He can't stop us from fighting climate change. He can't stop us from having the best paid family leave and sick leave policy He can't stop us when we demonstrate people progress in our state Stopping us from protecting the environment. He has signed executive orders, right? The first thing he did in office would yes was to sign an order that said hey You want to dump your coal sludge in the streams go right ahead the head of the EPA is Scott Pruitt he's reversed all of no, he just changed it to the environmental pollutant pollutants I know but but to say he can't stop us and he's changed the tax landscape everywhere Absolutely, you can't do anything in your state and he's appointed. He's appointing crazy judges left and right So here's a good changing things as we speak. We don't cover it because of Stormy Daniels, but all of this is going on I Can I say get used to it? Okay All right, we didn't get to any questions, but it was a wonderful path okay, let's let's go back and Rewatch it and add some commentary First thing before we get to the questions you want to respond to what I just said about marijuana Well as we talked about Starbucks, we talked about our great voter rights bill We talked about our efforts to beat climate change, but for you bill I can honestly say we got the best weed in the United States and this has been interesting he's promoted his state which is the job of a governor, but There's governors have a lot of jobs and I don't know I'd be interested to hear how some of you who live in the state of Washington feel about your governor although that probably just falls out along party lines, which isn't terribly interesting to me, but I Would say growing in this well regulated is well regular regular that's right By the way, they humble County would give you a run for your money They are but but they're putting a little pressure on us. We've heard from me and I don't think he means humble County I think he means the federal government and Jeff Sessions attorney general in Seattle actually and we need to make sure that they back off and Wouldn't it be wonderful if the first time Donald Trump said something that was actually true if he said he'd leave us alone on a Marijuana decriminalization. Yeah, I hope that that will look good Well, yes, Jeff Sessions has said good people don't smoke marijuana. Yeah Thank you Okay, Michael, will you ever release the contents of the warning shot disk of evidence you tweeted about? Oh, yeah Possibly it depends on how the case progresses. I mean, you know, we we what's on it. Well Nice move Bill Yeah We you know We took that picture and we we tweeted it out and it was exactly that it was a warning shot to Michael Cohen the president that if they tried to claim that my client was a liar after 60 minutes There was gonna be consequences and it worked and it worked perfectly because we heard nothing from them So we have the DVD and we're gonna release it when and if it's necessary and we're gonna see what happens with the case And Smart lawyer And now Peterson's coming into the conversation and again, I I wondered if he was gonna come in at all on pot and Partly because of his his history of doing alcohol You know his work in alcoholism his work in substance abuse He mentions he mentions pot a little bit in 12 rules for life, but he hasn't really come out and so, you know He's being he's being well socialized. This isn't his stage. This is Bill Marsh show He's being polite and I really wondered how how long he was gonna, you know when he was gonna come into this this after segment I've never watched one of these Overtimes I'm probably gonna keep watching them now though It's but but he jumps in and this I guess is a time for questions and he's gonna he's gonna come in with his questions So, you know, I just played this before so you've all seen it now once but here we go Yes, I mean I've been listening to yeah all of this about Trump and watching how this conversations go in the US And I have one question about it I mean There's all these people in the US who are on the conservative side who are aligned with Trump for all sorts of reasons And there's all this tension around his presidency and attempts to pull him out of his office for various reasons And I what what do you think will happen if that comes to pass? What do you think will happen to these people that have identified with Trump and like how is it that? That that Democratic types for example are holding out their hand to say to these conservative types sort of like welcome back into the fold And you know if he's gonna ask a question I think that was about one of the best questions to ask to interject because In the food fight that is American politics right now Both sides are losing have lost perspectives on the fact that this is this is one country we have to live together and You know, even even those who say consider themselves ardent humanists well, you know what your political enemies are human beings and You know from a humanist perspective you have to learn to respect them from a Christian perspective You have to learn to love them You have to learn to love them and so this question is is tremendously germane because what happens with polarization is that? each side justifies their actions because of the behavior of the other and and so what happens that polarization is both sides getting behave in behave Both sides break the rules that are supposed to the process which again as I've mentioned another Videos before in a secular government in a sense you you divinize a process you make the process sacred you always need for human beings to to To to have productive conflict there needs to be something both sides hold in common and and so there must be a mutual goal Maybe that's preventing civil war But there must be something above both sides that both sides respect and and then that tension then holds it Together and so Peterson is saying okay. Hey, so let's say let's say you impeach and convict Trump Which we'll get into a second you impeach and convict Trump. What's gonna happen to that 40% of the people that is? How come that question is not being asked on how many news shows either on Fox or MSNBC It's all the food fight about my enemies How come this question is not being asked when we're talking identity politics, which we're gonna get into a little bit. So If he's gonna jump in I'm glad he didn't jump in and pot save your powder look for this question Because it looks to me from an out from an outsider's perspective that Your country is polarizing in a way that's not good and that you know people are going after Trump and I understand that It's not like I don't understand that but There's all these people that elected him and that are identified with him and they're they're not taking this well, you know And so well, they're not they're not it's not and you know you might not think they're very bright and all of that and and you know, they're backwards and and and all of those things but but you but you know You need to have respect for the rest of your citizens And if you're if your country isn't gonna pull itself apart And I really see this happening from an outsider's perspective when I come down here and I lived in the States for a while It wasn't like this before if he if he was just a regular Republican president with Republican policies I would say you'd have a point now again. This is the process of polarization where both sides justify More increasing extreme action and rhetoric on the basis of the other side and if you've ever been in a relational conflict a marital conflict Sit down with an unhappy couple sometime and this is what you'll hear again and again and it just keeps pushing it out and And it may very well be that the other side is Violating the sacred norm that's supposed to hold the whole thing together It may very well be that the other side is breaking rules and has ambitions And and so Okay, but Be careful the justifications you produce But what what is so alarming is the assault on democratic norms what we were talking about here today Okay, and so the the asset that that Trump is undermining the democratic institutions that we rely upon to Be able to have productive conflict and and again, I think Bill Maher is right This is a good point now if you get into this in the political sphere The other side will say well Obama undermined those and and so Obama had all of these executive orders and so that then Trump justifies Trump coming into office having all of these executive orders and You know this gets into then in terms of US politics the increasing power of the presidency because Congress continues to abdicate leadership and responsibility and Congress is not Independent enough of the political food fight you know, so it's to to to take action against the president whether that be Obama or Individual congresspeople don't have the ability to take action or speak out and criticize their own party So so all of these tensions make up a political process and if a political process is functioning Well, all of these tensions are kind of held in Balance so that you can have productive conflict and out of the the conflicted process Good things will come and the fear is that well Now that the other side is in power They are giving up the game and and this in a sense is you know to throw my Christian hat on again this is part of the reason God is so handy in a process like this because God is in a sense above the food fight now now everyone's trying to bring God down and Abraham Lincoln in his second inaugural Matt, you know puts this out nicely that you know Is whose side has got on in the Civil War? Now what we have currently with a secular side is they'll say, you know, they won't just say God is on our side They'll attack God and say God is a fiction so on and so forth But this is you know there's always something above if you're going to have a Container that makes conflict productive and doesn't just simply lead to killing your enemies Things like threatening to put people in jail threatening to put journalists in jail wanting military parades praising dick Okay, the threatening to put people in jail threatening to jail political enemies is is definitely something worth worth naming in this Military parade I find that distasteful. I find it Contrary to our culture. I think it's actions that That undermine our institution of keeping military power used outside of our borders and not within our borders these are important parts of the fact that we haven't had as You have and say Pakistan or Egypt or other countries in the world where you have a military coup where the military takes over the government And I know back in the Nixon days, you know when Alexander Haig pops up and says don't worry. I'm in charge here He wasn't speaking as a sitting general with troops at his back Okay, so so these are these are really important things and so in the United States We're having some pretty substantive and foundational conversations now Wherever you stand with respect to Trump or Obama Here's here's a good side of something that's happening now we are having conversations again That hopefully a younger generation will listen to and learn from and say these are the practices Remember first we have to act stuff out before we can articulate them and represent them So we're going to act out the important things of our presidency and one of the critical things of this country that has kept it Has been presidents obey the law when your when your term is done you leave the White House You know things like this and so, you know before Obama's term was done. I was reading speculation Obama's not gonna leave the White House Obama's gonna declare national law Obama's gonna, you know, nope, he didn't and And whatever you felt about Obama. He didn't do it now at some point Trump will leave office And the question will be how will he leave office well, he's he's been showing us by his behavior who he is You might like that behavior. You might find that behavior representable. You might find that re behavior counterproductive But he will show us what he's made of and these things are important taters Wanting to be a dictator. I mean we are at a moment in time where we're at a point where we're at a point where we're at a point where we're at a point Taters wanting to be a dictator. I mean we are at a moment here This is I try to and now and now wanting to be a dictator. Okay now we're crossing a line and we're expressing motivation Now you may feel that your assumption here is justified I think everybody probably wants to be a dictator and in in their heads But the question is what will they act out this on the people who are too young to remember a lot of presidents and a lot Of elections how incredibly different this is than anything that ever came before I never much like the other Republicans who were in office, but I have a renewed respect for them George George Bush and Mitt Romney would not have tried to pull this shit. They just wouldn't Okay, and now let's see if we remember this the next time we have a so-called regular Republican I was listening to and I'm thinking about doing a video with a conversation with Ben with Glenn Lowry and John McWhorter and There's my son he's saying hi he just came home He's my youngest son youngest of five Where was I Oh John McWhorter on a video? See then came in and I forgot I forgot what I was gonna say I better go back to the video What about Nixon Nixon got caught and he gave himself up basically Well, although although this president makes the Watergate burglars look brilliant And and now in all fairness and and I have my political opinions that I'm not you know You suss them out. You can find them out. It's no great mystery what they are, but but at some point we have to At some point we have to speak with fairness and whereas You know, I will enjoy political comedy to my taste as much as anyone Calling the other side dumb Publicly on a show like this Does not help Because this this gets back to Peterson's question 40% of the country Supported this man for whatever reasons they had This is this is the game that we're playing when we're when we're working with politics We can we can be as tough as we're being on the president I think we should for all the reasons you just said bill without telling his supporters that they're stupid without saying that of deplorables if we want to bring them around to what I would say is a more enlightened kind of Good for Bruni good for Bruni. I'm glad Bruni stuck up here Stuck up for this and I'm glad he said that I think that shows maturity he is he is acting out the kind of political maturity and adulthood we need in this country and he is he's making the right sounds now Thinking and we want them to see Donald Trump as someone who's turned the presidency into one long infomercial for Mar-a-Lago You know we can and and now you know those on the right will hear the condescension that's he's and And in a speech like this he's he's being very careful because when he is when he is when he is speaking a certain way he people His allies on the left are gonna start getting nervous Are you are you betraying our side and so then he he balances it with a little bit of condescension which which settles down his base Okay, Frank still one of us he's just he's just playing this game and again This is how the game is played can do that without saying to them You've been duped to your chumps. You're dumb You're deplorable and I think we need to talk to them with more generosity than we do And I was I was glad to hear Frank Bruni say that now Alex Wagner is gonna jump in Thesis now again as I mentioned earlier in the show if you get a chance to watch the show Wagner took on Peterson like nobody else here the governor of Washington's sat sat there and Frank Bruni sat there now now It's important when you look at a question like this I mean who's gonna take him on one of the things you always have to ask is who has the most to lose The each of the people there has their own little cloud of witnesses in there They've all got their watchers in there and they're all you know quietly you know having their little cabinet meeting in terms of how we should act how we should act of The three of Frank Bruni and then the governor of Washington She's probably got the least to lose plus she's a woman so she can address him I mean, there's there's just so many layers in in here in terms of in terms of what's happening So she's now gonna come at Peterson with a with a really strong question And I think actually a very good question that the left is too preoccupied with being non confrontational Right my left is too We are All right, that's a good question the idea that and now pay attention here. I mean you've got to appreciate Peterson's You got to appreciate this whole scene not from watching here like we are but from Peterson's point of view He's traveled to Los Angeles. He's he's this is a this is a major thing for Peterson. This is another major piece of him visibility in terms of his overall agenda and This is Bill Maher's show Bill Maher has been saying nice things to him Bill Maher seems to be at some level of fan But again with a with a show host like this You don't really have any way to gauge that again with a bunch of high-status people these people are not like some of us sitting around watching hours of YouTube a day because we're we're low-status people and So on and so forth so so So understanding exactly where this woman is coming from is tricky and I should add Having a conversation you have a productive conversation between people that don't know each other very well is is not an easy thing to do And so, you know first she throws the question out Peterson doesn't quite understand it Maher steps in and says no That's a really good question He probably is better attuned to her and understand the point she's making and the point she's making is a very good one because on one hand You're complaining you're complaining about the speech of someone else and you're at the same time saying free speech is important That's one of the layers to this there. They're actually a number of layers to this question that that liberals especially Intellectuals are preoccupied with politically correct speech that they're I see I see And and yet no they're pre to preoccupied with its identity politics by a large margin and this is the first mention of identity politics on the show and And so so so now they're starting to have a conversation which is good And you can see it on her. She's she wants to jump back into the fray Everyone by their ethnicity and their sex and their gender and I think all that does is turn people into Tribal actors and that the end result of that is catastrophe Weren't you also saying though that that the left is too worried about offending people. I think that that goes and and and okay, so now That's an excellent question because okay, so so where do the identity politics and So if you're if you're telling someone you're playing identity politics you should stop and that playing identity politics will in fact lead to the kinds of Extremely destructive behaviors that we saw in Nazi Germany or in the the Soviet Bloc in the 20th century Where does speech lie now now to me again this this this gets into my my Christian background because in a sense what What God does and what a belief in God's sovereignty and a belief in Providence does is is sandbox the conversation because one of the one of the One of the difficulties of having a purely secular conversation in this is that the Only adults in charge are human beings and now you might say well, that's it That's a con to imagine that there is a divine adult in charge who is going to keep things within bounds I can I can appreciate that I can appreciate that criticism Because yeah, we came disastrously close to to nuking each other in the Cold War and And came to that precipice a number of times whether or not we knew it during the Cuban Missile Crisis These are really big issues and so you could say no, you know, where was God? Well, you might say well we didn't nuke each other World War two did end Germany didn't win the Cold War did end without a nuclear war Russia didn't win the communists Didn't win and and so now you might say well, that's a A Biology one or that the you know, what's been encoded with us the kinds of things that Jordan Peterson has been working on this has been Encoded into us. So so when it's in a sense Our survival instincts one and and one out over these others and this to this we can attribute some of the blessings that we've seen In liberal democracies so on and so forth But we can attribute some of the blessings that we've seen in liberal democracies So on and so forth but The same the same goes if if you know, in fact you say well there is a god and this god is an author of history and I'm probably gonna have to pay more attention and quote Miroslav's volts comments because both who? Was teaching at least at Yale Divinity School for a while Came out of the the the destruction of former Yugoslavia noted that secular people Have a need to correct all injustices within this time frame and religious people have a belief that there is a god who will in fact do justice and And all injustices will be addressed outside of this of this age And this is why you have Judgment Day at the end of history And now obviously if you say well, I don't believe that a god is ever going to bring justice out of the human story Well, then you will be tempted to take justice into your own hands and if there's something we know about human beings We we're not really good at it you say well, yeah, but me and my tribe We would be better at it and all the other tribes say no because I don't trust you and that's where we are in this human food fight I will yes But then on the other hand When the left for example offends people in the political arena You're questioning whether that's Somehow bad for society writ large. Well, I'm concerned about I don't I think that those two issues are So in other words can If Jordan Peterson is annoyed at the left for being offensive How does he justify being offensive himself because as as more points out here Peterson has the Has the talent and the propensity to be offensive? Has the talent and the propensity to annoy a lot of people and And as if you go earlier in the show when he was talking to Bill Maher He made the point that you're probably not going to do anything substantive if you don't offend people at least to a degree and and in order to be productive you are going to have to be Offensive to one degree or another and the trick is to be offensive at in the right way To the right degree to keep the game going and again if you've listened to a lot of Peters and stuff You'll understand this game talk your goal is to be invited to play again and again and again And so far if we're trying to figure out Jordan Peterson's climb up the hierarchy he keeps being invited to new tables to play the game and I'm not surprised if if Bill Maher is you know to the degree that Bill Maher is watching Jordan Peterson that Bill Maher is Interested in Peterson. I'm not surprised given all the years. I've been watching Maher and and Bill Maher is not afraid of Offending people and Bill Maher offends people on a regular basis and sometimes he has to he has to apologize for it but he's still on HBO and he's been on TV and Yeah, he's he's anti-religious and he's the again the thing I like about Bill Maher is he's not afraid to criticize both sides and and and sometimes he does so in a Slightly immature fashion in my opinion, but he does it as an adult and when he does it He takes responsibility for it and he plays the game which is why Maher continues to be Invited back to play the game and and this is exactly what we see happening with Peterson. So So now he's good. Now he's gonna have to he's gonna have to he's gonna have to introduce something which has become anathema in our 24-hour cable news cycle social media Political environment which is nuance. I Think that those two issues are somewhat separate. I'm concerned about the the dialogue in the United States around the presidency Pulling people people farther and farther apart. It has nothing to do with the behavior of Trump I think this is an independent issue. You can you can say positive or negative But he's only there because they support him. You see I know that's the thing is it's that's the issue That's the that's the issue is they did support him and without the circus. He's just a lonely clown Yeah, but he has these this people in Congress who are in ablers and this base that it is a cult of personality Not unlike dictatorships. We've seen in the past Now in all fairness many presidents have cults of personality Was Obama cult of personality? I Voted for Obama twice so hate me if you want to There there is a there's a dear there's a dear lovely woman in my church who has Obama on her Bible cover Obama as a black man being elected president meant a lot in the black community and And I think those of you who hate Obama. I think most of you can understand that if if if someone from a tribe that you identify with is Wherever they stand with respect to your politics now in the Christian Reformed Church if if someone from the Christian Reformed Church was elected president to the United States from either party Both sides would feel a sense of pride. That's that's how hierarchies work and how and some of the complexities of hierarchies So I mean he said once famously I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose any fans And he has proved that to be almost true I mean we cannot imagine what he would do where they were turning them because I don't know what that would be I don't think it's anything and I think also here in terms of this polarization justification There's always the sense that you exaggerate the power of your of your rival In order to make your point and I think Marr is I think Marr is exaggerating Here Trump is pretty popular with a certain number of people His his popularity ratings his favorability ratings generally go don't go above 40% It's a it's a segment of the country But again, this is pretty normal because what happens if you push people Towards try it certain kinds of tribalism They will act in a certain way and You know once we get our egos involved once we once we get going we will we will dig in and And and and Peterson's trying to nuance this and look at the body language Peterson's listening. He's he's being the good therapist He's also a little nervous. He's playing with his you know He's playing with his wedding ring, which is something he often does when he's nervous And you'll often see him do finger things when he's nervous, but I hate to be bombard here and And look at all the body language, but yeah, this is personas are on full effect here People are paying a lot of attention and working hard at this because whatever it was he would just say well, it's fake news But okay, so imagine he's impeached just for the sake of argument impeacher convicted. Okay, either of those both Because he's only out if they're both happen not just one or the other it doesn't happen once Because he's only out if they're both happen not just one or the other it doesn't happen one or the other it's a sequence just A little political note for our Canadian viewers to leave. Yeah, I know it's not it's not an unimportant detail But it still seems to me that it leaves you with the problem of what do you do with the disaffected? 40% that are going to be very unhappy about this independent of Trump's behavior, right? And that is the question What what are you going to do? And this is always the question again, I finished reading how to think by Alan Jacobs, which was a wonderful book and I highly recommend it What are you going to do with the repugnant other the the the rival the enemy the the person that the the outgroup The people whose views are in your mind reprehensible. Are you going to kill them? Are you going to put them in concentration camps? Are you going to try to silence them? And if you don't do these things go back to the sermon that I'm working on for this week You're going to have to increase your capacity for suffering and and if we go all the way back to the earlier conversation that Peterson had with Bill Maher in the show where he's talking about safe spaces and universities and all of the stuff that has been pretty up on this entire conversation If people If you're going to behave well in political or religious or any any situation of interpersonal conflict, you have to increase your capacity to endure suffering And actually this is exactly where religion comes into play because if the religion offers a variety of means to increase your capacity to suffer on behalf of some other good that you want And this is part of the reason that religious people are so successful in the world so often as compared to some Non religious people because what religions actually train you to do throughout your life is to endure suffering for a greater goal And whether you want to compete in the Olympics or whether you want to be successful in marriage or whether you want to be successful in school A lot of this is training in terms of how to suffer. Can I suffer today for a good tomorrow? And this gets into Jordan Peterson's talk about sacrifice So this is this is all very germane into all the stuff that Jordan Peterson has been talking about Well, that's that's a hell of a and and often the little the little statements that get stepped on are important and Bill Maher here says well remember when we kicked over Saddam the Sunnis rose up And Peterson says it's a hell of an example because that is a great example of what do you do you in the United States want to fight a war over Donald Trump and both sides have to ask that question Do you want to fight a civil war? Remember what the last civil war was like and that had a fairly homogeneous border You know, you look at a you look at an American Civil War. You've got the two the two coasts against the middle Not a good not a good thing and yeah, I said site. Yes, right. That's what I worry about Yes, this is an argument looking for an argument rather than a solution. We're not waiting for impeachment We're making sure that people understand Donald Trump cannot stop us today Now this speech by the governor is very interesting because a lot depends on what he means by us because if he is saying The president of the United States cannot overstep his bounds and violate the the very significant institutions that were created by the Constitution's that have developed over the history of the United States That keeps the keeps the president within bounds. That's an important conversation. But now listen to him talk because us will very quickly become the agenda for his tribe And and once the language slips in that direction. Well, now we're back into the tribal game. Now you're saying back what was said earlier in the program You know history is on our side. This is our long arc of justice and and Donald Trump can't stop us. And now I remember after his election Someone wrote a someone wrote what he's telling his daughter said, oh, Donald Trump might win now, but he'll be the last of them because we'll all this all this long arc of history inevitability This is religious language. This is eschatology. And and and it's it's and this gets into the point that I've been making throughout my points that what we're really seeing in the United States is a civil war within Christendom This is a civil war within the broad Christian conversation of the West and the American left has now adopted their own religion Now it's a secularized religion. They don't necessarily have a God, but it's got all the elements of religion, including eschatology. And now listen to this governor start talking more like a preacher And using what is fundamentally eschatological language. Donald Trump could not stop me from the first net neutrality bill to make sure people have access to the Internet. Okay, so now the Democrats are playing the state's rights card. Now who's us? He cannot stop us. He cannot stop us. And he's got the crowd behind him. So now he's coming into preacher mode. Now remember politicians are are there they're somewhere on the line in terms of wonkish or or people leaders. So they've got their own preacher modes. And he's putting his little digs there. He can't stop us from fighting climate change. He can't stop us from having the best paid family leave and sick leave policy. He can't stop us when we demonstrate. And now Bill Maher, the anti-religionist is going to jump in and say, ah, let's dial back some of your religious rhetoric. Progress in our state. Washington state. You can't stop us from promoting Washington state. So then she, you know, interesting deflection here. She kind of derails, which he has to agree on that. Okay, you're you're you slipped into preacher mode and she kind of highlights. Okay, now you're now you're you put on a persona and now you're you know, which mask are you wearing governor? Are you the promoter of the great state of Washington or are you a preacher of the great state of Washington? And Bill Maher is an honest guy. He's a smart guy and he pays attention and he listens to conversations. I think this part of the reason Bill Maher has endured even despite some of his significant stumbles over the past and getting into trouble for some of the things that he's done. And Bill Maher is an honest guy. He's a smart guy and he pays attention and he listens to conversations. I think this part of the reason Bill Maher has endured even despite some of his significant stumbles over the past and getting into trouble for some of his jokes. I think if you're a comedian and if you're not getting into trouble for some of your jokes, you're probably not being a good comedian. That said, hey, you want to dump your coal sludge in the streams go right ahead. The head of the EPA is Scott Pruitt. He's reversed all of. No, he just changed it to the environmental pollutant pollutants. I know. Okay, now we're going to do some more dates. He can't stop us. He's changed the tax landscape everywhere. Absolutely. You can't do anything in your state. And he's appointing he's appointing crazy judges left and right. So here's the changing things as we speak. And of course, you know, for There was a significant meeting at Wheaton College about evangelicals that I've been debating whether or not to talk about because the conversation about evangelicals in politics is so complicated in terms of how to identify people, how to number people, where race comes into this conversation, how politics intersects. That's a huge thing. Judges are for many conservatives, one of the real issues, and it's an issue on both sides. And part of this is natural because of course judiciary is supposed to be impartial. In Christianity, you have prophet, priest and king. Well, is the executive the king? Well, kind of, but in some ways the judiciary is the king because the judiciary is supposed to be above politics and this whole James Comey thing is supposed to be about above politics. And so I'm getting more into politics in this video than I usually like to get into any video. But you cannot escape politics and live in this world. And I made a video a little bit earlier in the week about, you know, whether your preacher should tell you how to vote. So, you know, I'm not going to avoid politics. I think we have to talk about politics. I think how we talk about politics is important. We don't cover it because of Stormy Daniels, but all of this is going on. And Peterson was not and you could see him there. What can I say? He's okay. Get used to it. Okay. All right. We didn't get to any questions, but it was a wonderful panel. Thank you, everybody. Happy Thursday. And overall, very interesting, very interesting over time with Bill Maher. Go through his YouTube channel. You can probably catch the other Peterson bits in it. But I think it was a good outing for Peterson. And we'll see what comes of it.
