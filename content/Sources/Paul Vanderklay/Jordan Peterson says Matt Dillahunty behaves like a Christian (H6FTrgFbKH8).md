 Okay, I want to continue the commentary or the twitching as I kind of call it on Peterson and De La Honte after the first 30 minutes. There's kind of, I did a framing video which I'll put in the comments. I'll put, I did part one which I'll put in the comments and now this will be part two. And what happens here is there's kind of a breath in the conversation and Peterson began, as you'll see in part one, with trying to frame the phenomenology and his approach which is different from De La Honte's kind of materialistic objectivism and the question is there a God wondering about this ontology of God. Now De La Honte says now we can't really know this but, and this is where I think that position kind of creeps into pragmatism because they say well we can't know if there's a God out there because he's buffered from us, it's a separated from us, but what that means is he isn't functional, that you don't need this supernatural to actually have the world work. Our explanations for how the world work within a materialistic image is sufficient to understand how the world works and Peterson disagrees. Peterson basically says I don't think that perspective is sufficient and so now there's kind of a breath in the conversation and Peterson's gonna take another run at it and so here we go. Let me ask you something about consciousness. You tell me what you think about this. Okay. Alright so this is how it looks to me. And and now this isn't this isn't keeping with phenomenology because basically one of the critiques of materialism that phenomenology brings is that materialism is inadequate to explain consciousness. It can't explain our consciousness and as I said in the last video materialism can't really dispel the threat to it that the consciousness we are experiencing is illusory as compared to the story we're telling about it. In other words, Dillehonte wants to see God as an object and we're having the debate whether or not you can have knowledge of that object and the materialist basically says no we're cut off from the possibility of that and in a sense what phenomenology says is that you're not only cut off from that you're cut off from you know little heart-shaped candies and you're cut off from books and you're you're cut off from cell phones and you're you're cut off from lobsters and that you can't you can't really know these things and you can't really know all that you purport to know and so that's why Peterson is is coming in here on consciousness. There's lots of thinking about how people interact with the world but I think this is how we treat ourselves and other people as we see them acting in the world and so I would say it's indicative of our deepest belief because I think belief is associated with action. So that's that's pretty much standard pragmatism. So the way consciousness appears to me is that... Well before we get there and again if you look at the materialist conception you know and I think Dilahanty is being honest he's saying okay if there's a supernatural we can't we don't have any evidence for it. Now again I'm thinking about doing another video which would ask the question well what kind of evidence could you have for the supernatural? I mean even that is difficult to conceive of because you know a little bit later Dilahanty is gonna say well the laws of physics well if you go back over the history of the laws of physics what we find is that we have these laws of physics and then we find things that don't fit so we update our laws of physics and so you have to begin to ask the question well what does that mean? And Dilahanty a little bit later will say things like well that you know my way of thinking updates itself. Okay fair enough but so does the Latter-day Saints Church and so do many churches. Churches are always updating themselves. Updating yourself is not necessarily a validation that you're on the right path. Sometimes when we update ourselves we discover later that the update was a bad idea and then we go back to what we had before and so there's always that dynamic. So Peterson is basically saying the materialist conception of the world does not adequately take into account consciousness and the reason we know that is because materialists will say well maybe there is a God out there but we can't know it and we don't act we don't need to act as if there is. In fact acting as if there is a God out there puts us on the wrong track. That's the materialist assertion. Now Peterson will come back and say okay well isn't the the best indication of our beliefs our actions? And again this is a common thing for preachers to say. Preachers will often tell their congregations you're not acting as if you're Christian. You're not acting as if Jesus rose from the dead. You're not acting as if the Holy Spirit has come on you. You're not acting as if you have been saved in every way you can be saved by your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. You are saying those things but your life betrays something different and you can in fact find criticisms like this throughout the Bible and so what Peterson is saying a la pragmatism is that we act out our deepest beliefs and if you want the truest indication of what someone believes look at how they behave. In other words actions express belief more truly than our words do. This is also in line with Jonathan Heights talk about the elephant and the rider that essentially the elephant is what's guiding most of our actions that's our unconscious self and the rider on top is our our public relations person who's creating ad hoc rationalizations and justifications about what the elephant has already decided to do and if you read Jonathan Heights happiness hypothesis or his later book I forget the I forget the title of it but the moral the moral roots of right and wrong I forget what it is but I've read them both they're both good books they're both very well worth reading but that's basically Heights argument and Peterson falls into that and says if you want to know what the person which is the composite of the elephant and the rider if you want to know what the person actually believes watch the elephant don't listen to the rider and I think right now in terms of if you listen to Scott Adams for example with respect to Donald Trump Scott Adams will say you know Donald Trump is a persuader he's talking talking talking before the elections he said you know we're gonna we're gonna all of those 11 million people here who are here illegally they've got to go they've got to go now have we seen any action to round up 11 million people have we seen any attempts to to ask Congress for the resources sufficient to to kick out 11 million people so Scott Adams would say well that's just Donald Trump talking you've got to watch the elephant and that's in a sense what Peterson is saying here you've got to watch the behavior it's a faculty let's say that let's back it up a little bit belief is associated with action so the way consciousness appears to me is that it's a faculty let's say that confronts possibility we call that possibility well sometimes possibility potential like your potential sometimes we call it the future so I don't see us as driven deterministically like clocks which is apparently I think although I've been accused of misunderstanding Sam now before we get into the determinism again these are the two frames Dillahunty says we are we are objects in space that's what we are Peterson says we are beings faced with potentiality and its action that creates that potentiality and drives us into the future again these are the two frames and my argument about what this what this conversation degenerated into is that they're not talking to each other and again I think I think Peterson sees Dillahunty's frame but here's the fact about human beings there's a lot going on on this stage I we have our presuppositions we frame the ways people don't ditch their frame quickly or willingly or easily usually usually ditching your frame involves something as dramatic as a religious conversion or a deconversion because the thing is when you these frames impact how you live your lives and so you've got a lot invested in your frame and so now Peterson is going to take another attempt to basically say I think my frame tells a more accurate story about the world based on all the evidence not not just evidence of seeing objects but evidence how we actually live I'm Harris before but I think that's the that's the argument that he makes I see us instead as agents confronting a landscape of possibility there it is right there agents confronting a landscape of possibility that is Peterson's basic frame and that what consciousness does is enable us to shape that possibility into actuality now I've been talking about CS Lewis's miracles okay consciousness allows us to shape this possibility into actuality it's going to be interesting to see what the relationship of that is to say CS Lewis's reason because what phenomenology does if you go back and look at mark I forget his names videos about phenomenology phenomenology is a lot about trying to articulate what reason is and the the relationship between phenomenology and mathematics Husserl was a mathematician is very tight and I've mentioned Dallas Willard's work I looked up Dallas Willard's kind of his main the book that he spent his professional career on not his career as a as a Christian thinker but it was on logic and Husserl it gets very deep into this idea of reason now again if we look at CS Lewis and reason and miracles CS Lewis will argue that it is in fact reason that is the most intimate connection to the supernatural that we have it is by reason that we transcend the natural it's by reason that this computer is sitting in front of me and I'm talking into it and we have this thing called the internet it's by reason that I'm not just sitting naked in the woods it's by reason that we have constructed this entire world which we implicitly describe as being unnatural and that we act as if it is not natural in terms of how many different things about our diet how many different things about our actions if we would say to someone why don't you be natural and by meaning that tell them to take off all their clothes and go live naked on the Serengeti and not with the cameras of naked and alone looking at you we would say I don't want to do this I want to live in the world of civilization and at the basis of civilization is this activity that we perform that we call reason and in fact the consequences of this reason are co2 buildup in the atmosphere are the agricultural revolution are the scientific revolution and and all of this that has happened and so that's where Peterson that's not too far from Peterson's we we look at a realm of turning possibility into actuality and we do that with whatever it is that allows us to make decisions I think that our legal system is basically predicated on the idea that that's true I think that if you treat yourself that way that works I think if you treat other people as if that's their basic characteristic and perhaps their value that you get along with them and I think that if you organize your society on that presupposition it appears to be functional so so what do you think about the idea of consciousness is confronting a landscape of possibility or okay so a couple of things what is Peterson doing here he is he is saying my framing of reality is bigger and deeper and further than yours now now let's understand Dilla hunty's calling in life Dilla hunty is a rationalist materialist apologist and and his he makes videos and he does a TV show or whatever he does it again I've got some links I haven't had a chance to watch them yet but he tries to convince everyone that his picture of the world is right now okay now what's the motivation behind this picture what's the eschatological vision behind this picture his idea is that if everyone will just see the world as I see it then well then what well then we won't have religion that we stumble over or religion that we fight over then now now we can't help but suspect that behind this there's a political motivation because as we saw in Richard Dawkins on unbelievable with Justin Briarley was that when Richard Dawkins was there Richard Dawkins didn't mind the evangelical and the Jewish guy that were before him because he said to them well you're reasonable not like those people in Kansas who want to get evolution out of the textbooks and and and get rid of abortion so on and so forth so so even I would suspect that even lurking behind Dilla hunty's calling in life is an eschatological vision of the world that that he sees as being related to his vision of objects in space and cutting off any acting as if the supernatural is real that somehow if this is adopted then the world will straighten out now Peterson in a sense cutting ahead of him and saying well that's okay you've got your your vision and all of this but but let's talk to how we actually behave in the world because how we actually behave in the world isn't really a lot like this this modernistic frame that you're talking about because people just simply ignore you and and and one of the points that even the atheists make is whether they believe in God or don't believe in God that they keep acting the same way and so in a sense what Peterson is saying is that how we really act is a lot more like my frame of the world than your frame of the word so he's just articulated this and kind of given it and now given it to Dilla hunty and saying here's my picture what do you think of this now now on one can that's that's that's really cool and really generous again this is this is Peterson's picture of the world that okay here's the materialist they see objects and Peterson say they're Newtonian and when I talk about my natural supernatural video I'm probably gonna use you know get a little bit into quantum you know what quantum theory talks about in terms of what is real but but Peterson says but you know the materialists are living a fiction and the fiction they're living is is pretty much as much of a fiction as the religious people and Peterson says quite rightly earlier the fundamentalists and the atheists are really cousins in this they are just articulating two sides of the same frame and Peterson say here is this bigger frame and my biggest frame I think better understands and better articulates how we all actually behave and your little frame over here of working on your materialist world is really in many ways inconsequential well let's see what Dilla hunty has to say potential is that is there something so I I don't know that I have that much of an issue with anything in particular that you've said there's a number of different ways to frame these things so that people can have a better grasp on it one of the things I know people strong now that's an interesting response because I don't know if Dilla hunty actually understands what Peterson is trying to do here now that's normal in a conversation we often don't understand where the other person is coming from and this is made tremendously more difficult because again let's let us not forget another frame that's here that these two people are sitting on stage in front of video cameras before an audience that very much has their own biases and wants winners and losers and that that very much impacts our ability to use reason to discern between these two people struggle with is and we may have to get back to this in a minute I don't necessarily want to get on it just a second but I would love to talk about it this idea that absent to God there's no moral authority this is a fear that many people have see and I think Dill Hunter is back to his frame and that's why again they're both and someone in the comment section from the previous video said well I can't Peterson just talk about it like two frames I don't know if he sees it this way I think he does I got my take on Peterson from Peterson but you know in a way probably I would if I were gonna talk to Dilla hunty I would I would come with a little diagram and say hey here's two views of the world I think you're talking this one and I think Peterson's talking this one how could the two of you what kind of conversation could the two of you have to try to concern to try to discern what you would like out of the conversation and when you're talking about viewing consciousness as the way the way you describe consciousness is what I would probably call our agency okay and while I don't think that we have libertarian free will I'm on record as being a compatibilist along with Dan Dennett but I also had a read of another okay so so so here we're trying to move towards each other so so let's let's imagine one view of the materialist conception is that we're we're looking at objects in space okay that view emphasizes seeing more than doing so now Dill Hunt is saying okay well let's let's talk about doing well one of the one of the real issues with doing in a materialist world is well if if everything weird if everything is determined by the big show that I am simply working out the physics that was launched in the Big Bang and that's basic determinism and and one of the one of the one of the difficulties of determinism is we don't live this way we don't think this way determinism itself is this is another strange story over here that when we look at it we say oh if you go back to Thomas Nagel so in past videos have brought up Thomas Nagel and you can find a nice summary of this at the weekly standard written a while ago from his book mine and cosmos which is a very worthwhile book to read Thomas Nagel basically says this this conception of the world is so far and from us it doesn't really it doesn't really work for us clarify because that discussion I'm fine with the idea that we have a will that we have desires that we have that we are an agent that is also capable of self-reflection to see what are the consequences of my action moving forward to me it does not matter if that is ultimately deterministic like clockwork or if there was some something that could trump determinism oh I shouldn't have said Trump I'm so sorry if there was something that could actually overcome the deterministic view that doesn't change to me the fact that you would be the agent responsible for your actions now what's interesting in this argument is any conversation about determinism should also include discern determinism of thought and deserve determinism of position and so in a sense what we're okay so we're responsible for it so you want to be a compatibilist okay with respect to this so we're responsible for it we're not going to get rid of that but it's also a little bit ironic to to sit here and say well I'm going to try to argue with these people because I want them to see the world as I see it and but they're they're they're predetermined to to believe or not believe this isn't this isn't very different from many conversations within Calvinism about determinism and predestination and belief and election and you know there have been times when missionaries have gone overseas and other Calvinists have said hey if God wants to convert those people he doesn't need you and so this can go down all kind determine us the thinking gets very weird very fast and and very much apart from how we normally behave now when my when my lawnmower acts up I will sometimes anthropomorphically it's hard to get rid of those vestiges of religious behavior yeah it is touche I mean although at least I got rid of them I haven't seen you interact with your lawnmower yet and this is gonna be a big deal because Peterson's thesis is basically no use you act like the God has been so deeply embedded into the the the ways that you act out if we if your actions show what you believe then you believe in God but at the end I recognize that the lawnmower is not a thinking agent that is not making decisions and so that difference between there is where I would inject the sort of ideas about moral responsibility the salmon I had a the difficulty the difficulty with the conversation about the lawnmower and thinking agents is that in a sense what materialism says is that we are finally no different from the lawnmower now we are more complicated but we have this illusion that we are thinking agents but we're not really thinking agents that I and the lawnmower are only separated by a degree of complexity but not separated by a degree of kind and and that is what is at the root of CS Lewis's book miracles because if I and the lawnmower are basically the same thing and and we are only separated by a degree of complexity and we are not separated by a degree of kind why should I treat the other person sitting on the stage as if they are a conscious being and again this gets back to Peterson's argument Peterson is saying your system breaks down your you are the lawnmower you're just a more complex lawnmower and you're under the delusion that you have things like free will and agency but but you are fundamentally no different from the lawnmower that I think is the materialist position and this is why Peterson is attacking Dilla hunt day and will attack Sam Harris and will attack all of them and say you don't believe in the world you say you believe this is exactly why what CS Lewis wrote in the book miracles and many many others have had this critique of materialism that you don't actually believe this world that you see this world that you describe because all of your actions betray it there it is that's what's at the heart of this Sam Harris and I had an argument in Chicago about free will and I was pointing out that he could walk over and step off the end of the stage or I could pick him up and carry him and drop him off the stage and at the end the the effect would essentially be the same but the conflict between those two is everything that I describe as will whether you want to call it free or not I think that's what that's what we value that's what we care about but again okay so Sam Harris walking off the stage or Dilla hunty carrying him off the stage either of them is the basic mechanics of a lawnmower within the whole show and and you say will well so which part of the lawnmower has will the part that is you know guiding one element of the of the system or another let's look at my dog I play fetch with my little dog and I throw something down the hall and play fetch with the dog you know how this goes they grab them they grab whatever it is you through they bring it back to you they get almost to you and then they stop and right there they're thinking should I give him the should I give him the ball but I don't want to give him the ball so okay there is will to whatever degree we call it free but mechanistically we would have to say within this worldview well it's it's just a computer program and and and but it but it's it's far more complex because it's between elements and it's between people so again this is why Peterson is saying your picture of the world you can't live in your picture of the world so you should get rid of it and you should instead look at my picture of the world that being understanding it through the lens of consciousness being is a is a forum where agents bring potential into possibility I would be responsible for that action I would be acting in opposition to what the other agent wanted and I don't know that you have to and there would be something hypothetically wrong about that yes okay right there Peterson has jumped in because what's Peterson thinking why did he bring in the ought because another problematic element of the materialist conception of the universe is ought because on one hand ought always implies eschatology it always implies a telos it always implies in a sense a mind and the problem with materialism is that there is no mind there's the illusion of mind there's the experience of mind but without mind you can't have ought because ought involves will and telos and eschatology and again Peterson would say even what we're doing right now here on this stage is so deeply embedded in ought and will and eschatology that your system cannot account for you should give your system up but you won't okay okay good so that's cool we can we can get to the morality thing I think then the next question I had unless you wanted to follow up on that is a lot of you know like I was saying earlier it seems that you're talking a lot about you haven't addressed the issue and I'm not going to push back on it because I want to move on to some other stuff of whether or not there is good reason to believe there actually is a God as opposed to whether there are good reasons for people to believe that there actually is a God damn again de la honte this is his agenda this is his frame it's a it's a it's a it's space and objects and if there is an object called God that's what he wants to know and and again Peterson is like doesn't make any difference if you don't act on it and in a sense de la honte says well that's right I don't want people who believe in God to act on it so I think I'm going to change their behaviors by getting them to no longer believe in this God and that would be an upgrade okay and then Peterson would say well an upgrade in what way well because I think this ought to be the case and then Peter will Peterson will say aha ought where do you get ought from and then it describes you know there are people who believe and then there are people who believe and believe that there's value and and from what you said here and in some other country now this actually is getting closer to Peterson because again as I laid out in the framing video Peterson's God I gave the example of the mistress there's or the there's a woman who believes her husband is having an affair she reads his texts and let's say from a certain woman and imagines that her husband is sleeping with this woman and on the basis of this she kills herself okay um now let's suppose the husband did not sleep with this woman well the mistress was real enough to prompt her to kill herself now we're getting into these two definitions of real and again I went all through this in the first framing video comments which I'm not going to sound to you with I'm curious and so Dilla Huntie wants to know okay Peterson this is a good question is this an ontological God the kind that I want to have the conversation about this or is this merely a functional God that helps people believe better because and this is an interesting thing to think why he thinks this differentiation is important because again if you go back and you look at the heretic piece what if Christians are better behaved people if they believe there is a God and this gets into the metaphorical truth that Brett Weinstein was talking about in the Joe Rogan with the porcupine what if people are safer imagining that porcupines can throw their quills um are you better to allow that erroneous but metaphorical truth is the world better but now again when you enter into that question you're asking a for better and now Peterson will say but underneath that is the assumption that better means people live longer or better means more people live that's your that's your assumption you're sneaking in irrespective of whether there's a God mm-hmm what is it that you fear we would lose if people stopped believing that there was a God or believing there was value in believe and that's a good question because again a lot of Peterson's mission is to say we will lose western civilization if we try to rip God out of it we'd lose we'd lose the metaphoric substrate of our ethos but he says it in a pretty abstract way we lose the metaphysical substrate of our ethos okay metaphysical what is metaphysical that's beyond physics substrate what is that that's the foundation of our ethos what is that our ethics that which motivates us to behave properly we would lose so again Peterson is laying his cards on the table and rather abstract language he's saying here we would lose this thing that we possess which is metaphysical these thoughts that we have that are the foundation for how we behave and again this is the argument he's making that Matt Dillahunty Sam Harris this is so built into how we act at a level far deeper than we can articulate that if we continue to try to rip this out we will cut the branch off that we're sitting on we will poison the well that we're drinking from we will destroy this amazing society that we possess that's his answer now you might well why did you say that Paul well I'm a pastor what do pastors do we take this we take this crazy book and we try to break it down to people and explain it in simple terms so I'm a sheep dog and we'd be lost and so I'm uh I think an uneducated so I really want to know and I'm not I'm not yeah being a dick I want to know what you mean by metaphorical substrate now what's also interesting is that if you look at this video even from a position of watching body language from tone of voice you can hear in this moment and we all pick up on it we might not be conscious of it but our watchers know it and we feel it because our watchers are also sending us messages through our feelings we're saying here is a moment where the two are connecting and this is true here is a moment where these two are connecting because saying we're going to lose it so there's there's the idea when I ask what do you think we're going to lose there's two things one is there's something that you and I would both agree we should try to keep yeah and there are other things that you and I might disagree on whether or not we should keep it because when people say to me oh you know if we go down the road with doskavsky that you know if there is no god everything's permissible first of all I don't think that's remotely true because I have he makes a pretty vicious case for it beyond good and evil so so here's the difference peterson agrees with dostoevsky that if we lose god even just the metaphysical substrate of our ethos even if ontologically peterson can't say that god is real if we lose this god dostoevsky's right and that things will devolve into anarchy and so del honte says I don't think so and peterson says I think he's right and despite the fact that it sounds monumentally arrogant I think I can demolish that case in about two minutes with his secular morality lecture but well I think the first part of that statement is right but not the second one so there's some status going here and they're playing a game and they're enjoying the game and we can find out but but and you can tell by their body language they're smiling again all of this is built in the thing is there would be two categories of things that you and others might be fearful we would lose some of which I might agree we should definitely not lose these things yeah others I might be absolutely fine with like it that it's wrong to throw sam harris off a stage yeah I I don't plan on doing that but we both agree that that was probably wrong yes okay so that's good and again why the humor why are we joking we are signal they are signaling back and forth here that okay we've got a difference but the difference is okay we can talk about this difference we can we can live on the stage together and neither one is going to throw the other person off the stage nobody's going to take a knife out and stab the other person nobody's going to threaten somebody's family we are nested within these rules and in many ways peterson is saying Christianity is built into these rules this is the metaphysical substrate of our ethos probably yeah and Dillahunty is saying no I can arrive at these rules without god and peterson's skeptical of it see I'm a situational ethicist and so there might be situations if the stage were on fire throwing sam off would be the best thing I could do for him so what do you think what do you think we're likely to lose what bothers you when you say metaphor metaphorical substrate I'm probably just monumentally ignorant but I know now again this is again part of the frame because what you and I are doing right now is we pause it and we slow down again if you read Alan Jacobs how to think he gets it from other people thinking fast and slow slow thinking is better thinking reason takes time our watchers need a little time and so these two don't have the benefit of the time like we have right now but this is what we're doing I really don't think I have a good understanding of what you mean well there's levels of thought I mean every thought structure let's say every belief structure is multi-level like a piece of music and and there's the there's the word in a phrase and then there's the phrase and then there's the sentence and then there's the paragraph and then there's the sequence of paragraphs within which the paragraphs are uttered and then there's a broader context of interpretation within which all of that is inter and now if I have a conversation with Jordan Peterson about with the word meek I'd probably give this little this little lecture he's given right here and then there's our emotional and motivational similarity and then there's our embodiment in the world and all of those things are operative at all times when we're understanding one another and as you move outside the realm of the linguistic like the paragraph level let's say into the realm of the emotional and motivational and embodiment and embodied you also move into the metaphorical and the metaphorical is structured in a particular way and this is quite well documented by okay you move into the metaphorical why because CS Lewis points this out too when you go from saying imagining God as an old man to God as a force you're just using another metaphor um force your force is a force is a metaphor from physics what was I what was I read oh I was reading I was reading so I'm reading this book on Jung which is an introduction to his work and I was struck by how much of Jung's talk about the the self mapping the self is just pure metaphor and it's just one metaphor after another and well why well because this is the way we can come into contact with things you know if we say something is solid if we say something is vacuous if we say something is has positive energy you know it's it's all metaphor and so what Peterson is saying is that as we talk about this stuff we we get to the metaphor and and the larger the complexity the bigger the metaphor and again this gets back into the the Peterson stuff about we act it out then we see each other acting then we represent it with our bodies and then we represent it in language and so on and so forth by the way I mean if you look at how the hemispheres interact so the left hemisphere broadly speaking broadly speaking and I'm not oversimplifying this except that we don't have much time is linguistic but the linguistic utterances are understood in the context provided more by the right hemisphere which is non-verbal and which attends to things like the music of language and so at the bottom of a linguistic structure there's something that's extra linguistic and it tends to take form in metaphor and narrative and drama and that sort of thing and the religious landscape is the narrative metaphor drama landscape and if you disrupt it then you blow apart the widest possible context within which the specific utterances are rendered comprehensible now again it's important to sit down and think that through now what did he just say well this is we we live we live within these stories now again the two frames for de la honte and peterson they're both living within two stories and I would assert that de la honte story is people sitting in a movie theater looking at objects in space jordan peterson's frame is people in a field of potentiality where action um where action creates actuality um and and peterson is saying we live within these frames and these frames give meaning and these frames give ought and when you lose these frames you you lose you lose the civilization because it's all built up on these stories okay so I this hasn't helped followed all that shockingly um anytime you were talking about science and hemispheres and all this stuff so when you're talking about the broader context if we lose belief in a god we lose that metaphorical substrate that is the broader context in which we evaluate these narratives yeah that really that really grinds them into our bodies that makes them things we believe rather than just sure but let that one sink in because it's really important so you didn't what is it about the narrative you didn't just think that it was wrong to throw sam off the off the off the uh god sam's gonna be pissed when he hears yeah well and this gets into peterson's talk about um post-traumatic stress in soldiers it's not what soldiers see that causes them stress it's what soldiers do that's evil now why is that well because it's it's one thing to look upon others as evil it's a different thing to realize my capacity for evil and that's why again if you listen to a lot of peterson you know he talks about when you go to auschwitz the predominant thing should not be those evil people killed the jews the predominant thing should be i could have been the one to kill the jews that's what we should leave thinking that's that's the lesson to be learned i i sent out a tweet the other day where where i said you know i said what do you think of people who are always pointing out other people's sins now when i use the word sin i i locate that in a religious atmosphere and and well how do people feel about that well you have the church lady right the church lady sits there and points out everybody's sins and and we don't like her says well how do you feel about people who are always pointing out racism and sexism well in my christian worldview racism and sexism are sins there are a particular category of sins well we cheer people who point out racism and sexism oh so how does that work well here's here's a here's what you learn if you spend enough time in a christian community hopefully um and here's what i appreciate about calvinism that we like to play a trick that other people are sinners and i am less of a sinner or i am not a sinner and what calvinism says is that is a deeply dangerous game if there is a sinner i have to start with me and paul models this in the new testament by saying i am the chief of all sinners and and each of us should take that upon ourselves now this runs counter to the contemporary upon ourselves now this runs counter to the contemporary narrative which we say no i don't want to feel bad about myself listen to tim keller tim keller would say basically your liberty is involved feeling bad about yourself in just the right way we have to feel bad about ourselves to actually feel okay about ourselves but it has to happen in just the right way so this is this is where this is this is going yeah yeah yeah well that's okay well so see there's a difference between thinking something and believing it because to believe it it has to be thought incarnated in sure for me now again remember peterson's standard answer do you believe in god it depends what you mean by believe and it depends what you mean by god before we've been talking about god now we're talking about belief when i talk about it belief is the state of being convinced that a proposition is true or likely true it's that is this more objective watching a movie theater looking at objects in space is a proposition true now peterson's going to say that is nowhere near as relevant as what i act out everything that i try to do i tend to view in the form of propositional reasoning so when we talk about the narrative yeah that's a problem by the way okay yeah well it's you can't reduce the world to set of propositions why not oh see again this is this is peterson peterson is saying we are every day we are acting out things on the stage let's take the example of he and and dillahanty sitting on the stage dillahanty is saying i can reduce everything we are doing right now to a list of propositions and i think peterson would say first of all you don't have enough time in your lifetime to list all the propositions that not only that we are acting out but that we are nested within just in this moment sitting on the stage plus the fact that you will miss whole other ones you would in fact need a team of really perceptive people tollstoy's you know look at the size books toll story writes are all he's observing everything well that's part of the thing about toll story and these russian novelists they're so observant well and and so this is why peterson blows them off but i think peterson would have been better to give him an example that we could spend you can't spend your life listening everything that this moment is nested within that's how powerful actions are that's why we have this little aphorism actions speak louder than words look show me something that is no problem in the world that is not a proposition that you cannot put in the stateable proposition something that is demonstrably true that i could not put in a proposition okay put in or reduce to are two different things oh that's that's easy okay you want to go there i'm not afraid of anything okay okay if i'm wrong i want to know i'm wrong but i i'm trying to for years i had this thing going where people would say oh and this is kind of what we're getting at from a different angle i would say they would be afraid of what we would lose if we lost religion and i basically said demonstrate to me any benefit oh you'd lose art and poetry and drama one thing you learn as a preacher is it's that the throw away things on the side are really dangerous because you send things down rabbit holes so now we're going down a rabbit hole because but but now pay attention to what dilahanty's motivation is i can reduce things to propositions now i hear this from christians too you know often christians want to take the bible and reduce it to rules or reduce it to propositions or reduce it to systematic theology now systematic theology is tremendously helpful why is it helpful if you reduce things to propositions you in a sense abstract them and then you can manipulate them and and that's a really helpful thing you can learn a lot through that but you always have to bear in mind that it's a reduction and that there are always elements to it that are that resist reduction because none of us are smart enough to see all of the elements involved which is why we act it out and now this is why peterson is going over into art because he says basically what there is in a piece of art this is what one of my interns once gave me and so here's a picture of jesus and made up by you know a bunch of different individuals and so now could you redo could you describe this piece of art in a sentence sure could you reduce this well you could probably and i know some of you are looking at this right now and thinking this is this is heresy this should be destroyed not only by virtue of the different individuals that are in it and here the um um here here on the back is all the individuals who are in it but this is this is evil and you could write a tremendous book about why this is evil or why this should not be or why this should not be on my wall um and the fact that this is on my wall if someone would come into my office and look around you could tell a tremendous amount about me a picture is worth a thousand words i mean we have all kinds of knowledge about this and so peterson is saying that you reduce it to propositions you lose everything why because reality is so much richer than your list of propositions now that isn't to say propositions aren't helpful and good and important but they're insufficient narrative are there are there no godless artists and poets there are artists and now they're talking past each other again and poets who think they're godless peterson is saying this is this is the argument underneath the whole thing again peterson is saying yeah but but it's embedded in them and they don't realize it because again you've got the elephant and the rider you've got the the conscious self and all of the watchers beneath you've got the embodied self what does it mean to buy believe by believe believe means you embody the thing and the audience is incredulous so okay the frame reemerges so we might have crossed over into a problem area yeah i don't actually i can't draw for crap although i do draw during the show but one of the individuals who came to the show the other night handed me something she had spent a great deal of time drawing she's a wonderful artist i'm very grateful to get it and you know while i pretend to read minds on stage i i constant and here again is the frame i don't pretend to read minds what are beliefs for dilahante he's a modernist in that sense he's a materialist beliefs are propositions that i subscribe to and again i hear christians make these arguments all the time beliefs are propositions i subscribe to and peterson says along with jonathan height that's the chattering rider a human being is the rider and the elephant and the rider doesn't know what's in the mind of the elephant now you want to get into young young's project was tried to get into the mind of the elephant and that's where you get into this very weird union space this is the this is the conversation we're having knowledge that i can't actually read mine so i can't tell you whether or not she actually believes in a god actually believes in a god but i can tell you that i actually don't believe in a god and i could write poetry but you act like you do okay here it is here it is again and again and again and if you understand the frames you can understand this entire conversation but you act like you do that's why you didn't i act like sam off the stage no now you're making a claim okay and and again dila honte does not see what peterson is saying so i'm telling you i don't believe there's a god and your response to that is i really do because i have a moral sense but my moral sense is utterly without any appeal to a god explicitly explicitly again this again once you see this this entire conversation is transparent it's in fact predictable or implicitly maybe the that's not so obvious okay it's really because you regard you regard sam harris as an implicitly valuable entity because otherwise you'd just throw him off the stage and then the question is well just exactly why is he an implicitly valuable entity i don't think metaphysics of that i don't think he's implicitly valuable in the sense and now again peterson is saying it was a very long time okay so let's imagine um and i use the illustration of the um jim elliott story jim elliott is a missionary he is trying to reach this group of this indigenous tribe that's been living in the woods and the thing about this tribe is that they kill everyone that they that's not in their tribe that comes up to them well where has this morality arisen has it has this morality arisen through rationality and peterson is saying well again where does he get christianity it comes in from below and it reaches a stage of articulation found in these stories that we have in this book and these stories get expressed in our culture so if you lose the metaphysical substrate you lose the ethos and dillahunty is saying no i have i i i got to this point and i constructed my morality and i just kind of did a little transition and i replaced it now with my atheist morality and peterson says no you need a clean room you need a clean room yeah you need a clean room and you got to go all the way back at least to lobsters if you really want to be without this or at some point you're going to have to stop and say okay we didn't believe in god here and but the thing is you'll never find that space i don't think he's i don't think he's implicitly valuable in the sense that the universe has in implied that there's something explicit about it for me morality is is far simpler than some wait you sounded doubtful about that you know that maybe you're the one and with peaches and it just kept his mouth shut i'd like kind of like to hear what dillahunty wants to say well you well maybe because you've already you've already suggested that despite me sitting here and having talked about this for decades uh that i don't believe in god that i actually do because i have a moral code but my moral code which i've well i was more specific it's not that we have because you have a moral code it's because god is built into your moral code in ways that you can't obviously rip out because it's more complex than the set of propositions that you can just delete a few of them i said it was because you didn't want to throw sam off the stage yes but you didn't you didn't remote you didn't even attempt to ask me why i didn't throw sam off the stage instead you went to why do you think has sam has implicit value because he didn't ask him why he didn't throw sam off the stage because he can't talk to the elephant and he's already talking to the chattering rider okay so in your narrative i'm willing that's the only justification well maybe you were afraid of being punished i think you know oh i think you can have a perfectly acceptable foundation for secular morality even if it fundamentally centers around selfishness i'd rather not be thrown off the stage it's in my best interest to encourage that sort of understanding and others and therefore i will not throw him off the stage i would rather not have my stuff stolen and it's in my best interest to encourage others not to do that so i will not steal stuff and i will work with others to ensure that the people who steal stuff are punished it is in a virtually pragmatic uh moral system okay well and that's a nice argument and there's certainly validity to that argument but the question is is that really what's at work or is that a post-hock rationalization by the rider of the elephant rather than what's really motivating the elephant why do you think it's not in your best interest to have stuff stolen from you or to be thrown off the stage why is it not in my best interest yeah no no you know you don't you don't get to think oh that's self-evident it's like nothing self-evident to the skeptic let's keep that in mind then again peterson's do a little talking down here which is interesting and dilahante picks up on it right away now we're changing the game we're not joking we're not laughing peterson just got a little bit talking down and dilahante's kind of like oh well we're changing the rules well so uh and he's smiling he's got the crowd behind him we're in peterson's town but dilahante's got the crowd because if we're going to get skeptical here we might as well go all the way to the bottom first and skeptical all the way to the bottom what bottom is peterson peterson talking about well he's going back in time sam and i the foundations and we're not the only ones but i tend to reference sam just because if i say this then somebody will say well it's exactly what sam harris says except that you know i was given this lecture before he wrote his book but a little bit more status uh but his book is better than my lecture so read his book and some you know and some humility which is also good when i talk about this i'm talking about well-being is the language that sam uses i don't i don't i don't care whether or not somebody else considers that morality it i would think at a minimum would you and i agree that that whole well-being thing man as a basis for a metaphysics that's just a we're not basing metaphysics on it sam is no he's not yes he is because he's out to maximize well you can take it up with sam well okay sorry do you think you think i'm wrong about that claim i that's what i understood i don't think sam saying anything metaphysical about it i think so here's the thing we are physical beings his fundamental claim so it's sort of at the basis of his ethic and so he says well we should work to maximize people's well-being or at least to more he does a bit more than that it's not we should minimize our suffering he's not maximize minimize in this sense of simple consequentialism let me do this okay we're physical beings in a physical universe and the laws okay right here we're gonna have them roll out we're physical beings in a physical universe we're objects in space that dictate how things work in the universe laws of physics dictate how how things work are these laws eternal they are the ultimate arbiters of what is or isn't in our best interest whether we know it or not how is a law an arbiter when you're talking about this so for example so far as i can tell then why do you need free will i don't i don't think why do you believe in them why do you why do you attribute agency to things if the laws of the universe can get to that one point well but there was a contradiction that was confusing me free will isn't relevant to this why isn't free will relevant to this because again his frame these are objects in space these are objects in space and they function by the laws of physics free will isn't relevant because i'm sitting in a movie theater and i'm watching it i'm watching this movie and this is what's reality and my basic question is i want to know if there's an object called god an object called god that's his question oh why is that his question because well why are you so concerned about this object you're not concerned if there's an object called brak's tiny conversation hearts i should probably open this box it is if the laws of the universe are what are dictating what's good for us no because if you chop off my head that is clearly not good for me and it doesn't matter whether it was an act of free will or if it was my lawnmower it's clearly not good for you because you think you're valuable and worth preserving yes okay that's mind okay again we are the lawnmower okay we that everything the the universe works like a lawnmower according to these newtonian laws of physics that's his world and then he introduces care concern mind ethics ought peterson jumps in and says right there that's not in your world your world should look more like this is what your world looks like but you're not accepting the yellow frame you're only accepting what's in the box and it doesn't work but i don't know dilla hunta is not getting it and the crowd's not getting it it's the issue why do you think you're valuable and worth preserving because i am the descendants of people who thought they were valuable and worth this worth that's the lawnmower answer serving and the ones who didn't think that have killed themselves but this is not a statement about and peterson hangs his head because you're not getting me the lawnmower has no ought when the lawnmower is going through the lawn if there's a if there's a puppy in its path and the the lawnmower is doing its own thing it cares not for the puppy now you might say the lawnmower ought not to chew up my puppy peterson hangs his head because dilla hunta isn't seeing it this is not a statement about intrinsic value i don't know yes yes i think no it's okay okay but i think it is okay it the reason that we talk about this in terms of well-being is because irrespective of whether or not i care about well-being there are facts about well-being sure let's hear a man line those suckers up and again again if you understand the two frames you can see why their emotional reactions are how they are right now if you chop off my head it's in contradiction to my well-being i mean that but the point no i wasn't willing to grant that actually okay i'm saying that's a metaphysical presupposition you're just saying i have to accept that no i'm not i'm not telling you at all what to accept sure you are you're saying that your death would be wrong i'm trying to explain what my position is okay but but you said that that wouldn't be in accordance with your well-being okay that's a metaphysical statement or philosophical statement it's not an obvious fact that chopping off somebody's head is contrary to their well-being it depends on how you define well-being now this is this is again chopping off someone's health head is not contrary to their well-being well situationally we can certainly imagine a story where okay you're um suicide so someone comes to the decision that ending it all is is in the best is in their best interest that is essentially what every suicide is now you might argue it isn't reasonable because because why because they're being unreasonable well but they are being natural because again the world is just a more complex lawnmower that's the the world is a more complex lawnmower with the illusion that it's self-conscious that's the materialist world it sure yeah but it matters if you define well-being is this glass of water we're no longer talking about the same thing well you can define well-being that's fine that's what i'm waiting for this is so this is what i'm it's you can't do it you can't define well-being it's very why should i now when he's saying you can't define well-being he's saying you can't define it within this frame within this objects in space there's no room in this objects in space to articulate well-being because you don't have values i certainly can't do it if you keep telling me i can't do okay sorry okay i'll back off i'll back off there's a go ahead i'm i'm i'm all ears so the primary objection to mine is am's position that keeps coming back is why should anybody care about well-being and we both will acknowledge that this is an in fact a subjective preference there are people who are going to care about well-being there are people who aren't the second objection is that well-being is not clearly defined both of us have acknowledged this it's not as if we're saying we have all the answers to how to go about living a better life we're just saying that however we're going to define well-being which is i say you can start with a couple of foundations you can start with death is preferable to life but you don't get very far that way and so suffering well no i'm saying you could now it's again you got to listen carefully peterson is saying death stops suffering and start with death is preferable to life but you don't get very far that way because yeah you do you stop suffering you just die yes right so you can start with the presupposition except that when you're dead you're not being so there's no well-being well that's it and Peterson might say well you don't know that now again in objects in space we've already decided that i have consciousness and my lawnmower doesn't so if i do things that gives me the kinds of attributes similar to the lawnmower i know laring up conscious again you bring in rupert sheldrake and he'll say well can you really know that do you know that the sun is not conscious and i think the way a materialist answers that is well it doesn't act like it's conscious but once you take that step you're over into peterson territory because i say oh so now we're determining things by virtue of how they act within a system and now we're into peterson's world where it's a forum for action if that's not that's not necessarily if we're looking for the best things about our life you can't say death is better best things okay we got another value judgment in here yeah you can well i know that you can say it will do all the time they did no look they can express their preference but their preference can be wrong how can it how do you know what's wrong who's to judge these are objects in space there's no right or wrong there just is these are propositions these are facts possibly be better for your life if you're dead what if you like are a terminal burn victim with cancer i am so this is the point that i was getting to i am perfectly fine with the idea that for certain instances there may be occasions that death is preferable to an individual over life but when we're speaking in broader terms if we're talking about let's create the best society we can let's create the best quality of life we can for people death is not that across the board it doesn't mean that there aren't individual exceptions now let's we don't have to go back all the way to lobsters we can just go back to pre-christian societies how many how many dead workers does it take to build a great wall how many dead legions does it take to subdue germania how many i mean people have made this decision all the time well individualism see right well what about individual but where does individual come from jesus or peterson would say individualism comes through christianity so your if you want to have your your value system that values the individual you need a non-christian clean room and you might say well but there's other societies that haven't been as deeply influenced by christianity you'd say yeah and you'd also probably say and they tend to be highly communitarian look over into the number of asian cultures highly communitarian it's the west that we have this individualism now again within christianity there's critiques of individualism now again within christianity there's critiques of individualism but peterson would say christ is the archetype of the divine individual he's saying this is this is out of which your ethic is being determined that's right there and and peterson keeps pointing to it but delahunty doesn't see it now again they're on a stage let's give them both some let's give them both some leeway but this is why i slow things down and do these little commentaries because peterson is saying you have your individualistic eth you have your individual value of human life that is playing out here yeah there might be some there might be some examples where we where we justify breaking that but that value itself is constructed on top of christianity and if you want to take christianity out of it you're probably not going to be able to make it because you can't make up a fairy tale so the foundations that i started with you can start with death is better than life but blah blah blah if you start with life is generally preferable to death health is generally preferable to sickness happiness is generally preferable to sadness none of these are absolute locked in stone rules from those but now pay attention everything dillahunty is saying is already bracketed by individualism because if i am emperor nebuchadnezzar and the wise men are unable to discern my dream or even recount what my dream is i am going to kill them all and kill all their families and take all their property now we say that's not right why well there's a telos nebuchadnezzar could say it depends on you know if my well-being is more important for the empire than any of these stupid wise men i was watching um i was re-watching uh avengers with um ultron that one they want to save the town of eastern european white people okay it's going up into the we have to get every individual off this rock all the civilians must be saved i was watching uh justice league and there are these this family's escaping from the big horn demon guy and there's an apartment building where people are in superman breaks off the fight runs over to save these individuals and then goes back now someone might say ah wait a minute you've got to beat the guy to save the world no we're going to prioritize the individual that is built into the story and peterson's saying that's right it's built in all the way from the bottom here and you're not going to have that story without christianity dill hunday might say there was no religion in that movie at all and peterson would say the religion is built into that movie from the bottom and you're fooling yourself if you can if you imagine you're gonna have the individualism that is governing your ethics without this okay so if you start with them yes if you start you're not skeptical about those claims wow well you know i came out and said that i wasn't going to be trying to straw man you left and right and now every time i say something you're like oh so you're not skeptical about that well i'm ah we're seeing a frame again before peterson was doing a little talking down now um dill hunday's playing the victim i haven't i haven't gotten sorry i'm not trying to attack you i'm trying to understand and peterson now takes the humble approach and says no no no i'm not i'm not trying to attack you you don't have to play the victim again well where's all this from this is nested in all this stuff and and this layer has been operational throughout the whole conversation and probably no one expected dill hunday or peterson to play the victim but here they are why it's all built into this where your argument begins well it seems odd that you would come out with so you're not skeptical about that while that's a while i'm on my skepticism tour while i'm in mid-sentence to describe that these are the general foundations that you start with okay that's what i was asking those are okay so but what you're saying if you're saying correct me if i'm wrong i'm not trying to be difficult you're saying that those again peterson's being conciliar are your starting positions those are the things that you accept i'm saying they can be faith no oh you have a rationale for them yes now it's interesting that you know we're slowing down the video and we're looking at this carefully i pluck out individualism is that the only one that's operating uh no uh there's many many many more there's things that none of us are even aware of that are operating here that probably some of you watching this slowed down like um you're coming up with some and you're going to put them in the comment section um now we might say well these are propositions well sure they're propositions but there's way more than we can possibly name and they're all at work and and they are working and they're operating because we know how to act even if we can't articulate them into norms let's hear it you already have life is generally preferable to death because we're talking about our life again the individualist frame is in this he's not seeing it but it's there and death is generally not in the interest of the living um the death of the death of the germans was in the interest of the living for the allies who bombed the heck out of their cities the death of the japanese and hiroshi nagasaki was in the interest of the allied soldiers that would not be killed by the invasion of japan death is in the living all the time death is in the living of the old people who die to make jobs and room for young people it can be an exception this is the point that i was getting that's not an exception that's an exception that's the general rule so you could start with those you can start with any three that you found you could pick three arbitrary foundations and the one aspect that makes a secular moral system distinct from religious pronouncements and divine command theory and those sorts of things is that the the secular moral system has as its goal the object of getting better at getting better which means if you find out that one of your foundations is wrong or in conflict with something else you can now change that pause before what 1977 the latter-day saints church had a pretty specifically racist view of black people they changed it why the lds church has a built in within their system prophecy what happens a prophet can come up and change a rule well there you go in fact now you say well christianity doesn't do that and that's right well what why is ross de thot writing this book about divorce in the catholic church because he's afraid the pope is going to change the rule this is how religions work religions change things all the time now this is often an argument used against religion because religion seems to create a monolithic structure that will not change whereas in fact there's always stuff going on change the difficulty is is change improvement or corruption now peterson's going to use the old and new testament and we just had uh andy stanley made a comment about the value of the old testament that's all over the news right now and so now within the christian tribe we're going to have a fit about what andy stanley said because he's a celebrity preacher and we're going to argue about that these arguments go all the time and with with respect to religion so so you want to talk propositions this proposition mr dilla hunty is just plain wrong you could start with death is preferable to life and then when you find out that it's not working that well you change that foundation i think that these foundations based on the evidence of how people tend to live their lives and what they care about are a good set of three there could be better ones that somebody come up with i'm open to revision on any of these at any time but to say that i'm not skeptical about them is exactly the opposite of what i am because skepticism is about i'm not going to accept something as true without good reason and it's about being willing to being open to revision should there be evidence if now again something built into when he says something here is a proposition this is his frame objects in space propositions are objects here they are true false true false true false if you and i agree that we care about a good life good life isn't very well defined and we may have different ideas about what good life is but if we can actually just sit here and take notes you know i think that we'd come across maybe a handful of things that we would agree would make for a good life if we take those and compare them to the foundations of a secular moral system like what i'm describing we can determine non-subjectively whether or not non-subjectively what we've the list we've come up with are consistently approachable by that from that foundation and we can do that for religious morality as well the the analogy that i've used in the past is is for example a game of chess there's one thing about the universe that requires that we care about chess or care about the rules of chess the rules of chess are arbitrary somebody made them up we changed them we added on passant we added castling things like that we have the rules of chess we don't always know what the best move is but if the goal of the game is to win or the the chess thing is going to get into the the the rules thing and that doesn't go very well the world doesn't seem to work that way and i would say back to the metaphysical substrate argument you know you laid it forward a set of propositions and the reason i was perhaps inappropriately torturing you about them is because there's a metaph or there's a metaphysical there's a metaphysical under them there's something that's driving you to put those forward as reasonable you say well they're self-evidently reasonable see my question is well it's a it's a it's something like that because you said well reasonable people could agree on these three or something similar like it seems to me that what you're saying is that there is a set of finite axioms that reasonable people could conceivably agree on from which you could generate a rule-based moral system have i got that wrong like i thought that's what you said it's curious because i didn't say that but it's very close to something that i have said in the past which is for any given situation there's a finite set of actions that a person could take and some set of those actions are better than others it with respect to whatever the goal is if the goal is to continue you know a decent life or improve the quality of life some set of one or more actions that you could take in this instant now now part of the difficulty of that is um i decide that my life would be better if i divorce my wife okay so i decided to divorce my wife 10 years goes by i look at the wreckage of my children i look at the destruction of my financial situation i look at um uh both me and my wife having a series of um not well chosen relationships well chosen relationships with other people and 10 years from now i decide hmm i was wrong should have stayed together well here's here's kind of where religion is like a ulysses contract religion is kind of like a ulysses contract and this isn't too far from peterson's argument i've been making this argument for quite a few years actually religion basically you take the wisdom of past centuries and you consider that wisdom when you make your present decisions now if the bible says don't get a divorce maybe i look back in another situation where i didn't get a divorce and i judge it would be the problem i have is that we're all really bad at this we don't really know the future and so we try to make the best decision we can based on the available evidence that we have and what religion does is actually build into it the wisdom of thousands of years of conversations and examples and this is what comes up and this is actually not too far from what peterson has of all of this creatures with um nervous systems and eyes looking at each other and this then gets detailed into action into drama into story into text and govern society as we within this society continue to play around with it and tweak it and and and at each tweak we evaluate the tweak produces results that are better i get better we would agree they're better now and and again this is where okay agree they're better now and i just watched the franz de waal think big thing and he was talking about you know long periods of time okay agree they're better now well ddt was a good idea um you know in new jersey dumping dioxins into the waterways during world war ii in order to fight the war effort was a good idea well now to get all those dioxins out of the passek river um it's like that was an incredibly bad idea because do you know what it costs to try and clean up these sites and and if you had just kept the chemicals isolated in the first place yeah but at the time it was a good idea yeah at the time it was a good idea and this is where you get into the piaget it's the time it's for me and you and you and you and it's me now in past and present future this is where we go along the axes and we say it's got to be a good idea all the way through and we don't know that if if we were in that situation i could be an unconscious fantasy going on here or something eh because we keep returning to that and it's fun but one one of the possible actions of this set of actions would be for me to throw him off the stage another possible set of action would be for me to you know shield him it is clear and you can say that i'm just saying it's self-evident it is clear that one of those is going to be more in sam's best interest and perhaps even more in mine than another that's all we're saying we're not pretending remotely that we have the answer to every possible scenario just that we have the foundational tool set that allows us to come up with the right answers and we do this you also think that you can do that with a set of rules not well so first i don't actually don't think that's technically tenable i i don't think there's any evidence for i don't know why it wouldn't be now dilahante hasn't heard peterson's talk about rules and piaget because you know playing marbles at a certain age the kids can play marbles but if you take the kids apart and you ask them okay what were the rules of the game the kids can't tell you the rule of the game a little bit later they can tell you the rules of the game a little bit later they can in fact make up the game and govern the game by the set of rules but this is part of peterson's point the game we're involved in right now is so enormously complex and so enormously large that we are trying to work this game of marbles out in terms of the developmental age of the children but most of the time we're not doing it we're just acting it out well you can't build expert systems for example well you can't say that you can't because well we've tried for about 40 years with no success 40 years out of 13.7 billion but he's the one that was just saying that we can decide the good right now in the moment and for big decisions like a divorce or a job or immigration to another country we all know that we can't make those things and we haven't cracked it yet so now they're going to talk about computer stuff which doesn't really go too far telling the computer don't play h i talked about on a college campus last year is if the government was running around dictating to people what their job was going to be what their future was going to be as some regimes have done nobody would appreciate that nobody almost nobody i'm sure somebody would be yes oh very happy thank you i couldn't figure out what to do i'm glad i'm going to be you know a brain surgeon even though i don't know well i think i'm going to leave it at here and because pretty soon they're going to run out of time and they're going to stop the conversation and i've repeated it again and again now you might say well why did you repeat it so much well if it's boring to you it's because you've already figured it out if it isn't boring to you like me it's because i'm still trying to i'm still trying to get it into my noodle because this is so complicated that actually what i'm doing in talking to you even though you're kind of abstracted into this youtube cloud out there i'm working this out i'm figuring it out i'm evaluating i'm talking about it and you know it's through this amazing thing called the internet and videos of dil honte and jordan peterson and i'm i'm kind of out of time i've got some things i've got to do so i'm going to leave it here and i think this is going to be the last one that i do on dil honte and peterson conversation i hope it was helpful for you it was helpful for me talking my way through it so thanks for watching
