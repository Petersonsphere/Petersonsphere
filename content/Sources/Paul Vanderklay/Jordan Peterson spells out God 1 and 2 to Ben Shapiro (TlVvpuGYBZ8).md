 Hi, this is Paul. I know in the video released today I said I probably wasn't gonna be able to do another video and I know all of you who remember my vacation from last summer are gonna give me a lot of a lot of crap about making videos on vacation but as many of you know the Rubin Report did what at least from my aspect of the Jordan Peterson Phenomena was a really important conversation and My wife had to go to work this afternoon Which I didn't know about usually Saturdays are honeydews and chores and family and so I don't usually make videos on Saturday But she went to work so I can make a video so here we are and we're gonna have to talk about the conversation at the Rubin Report because it was a big one and I this is only gonna be a this is good this is gonna be a conversation that we return to quite a bit because Peterson has it's clear that Since of Dave and Jordan have been traveling together and if you've been to any of Peterson's what I call his evangelistic crusade Dave Rubin takes the questions and I think David Dave Rubin has a good understanding of the kinds of questions that are coming Peterson's way now and So he very much directed the conversation as a good Host should towards conversations that the audience really wants to hear I saw the Rogan experience I was a little disappointed in that conversation Just because it was it focused on most of the things that most of the Peterson conversations have been focusing on in terms of the mainstream media and The aspect that I'm most interested in is a little bit different and Dave Rubin and Ben Shapiro I thought Ben Shapiro was a very helpful Conversation partner in this I thought I thought it was a really good talk. So let's dive in now I'm going to want to treat lots more of this then I'll have a chance to treat this today My wife walked out and said well, how long are you going to be videoing? I said well, this is gonna be at least one to two hours and she says well How do you know how long your videos take and it's like well, I kind of look at them and say well There's a lot here to talk about so Let's let's jump in All right, so let's let's dumb this down for just one second Because I want to ask a question that I know you don't like getting when we get in the Q&A's But I think it would be interesting for the three of us to sort of kick it around here, which is For the average person that that's listening to this that can only take in so many of these ideas and so much Now they had just been through a really good section on some consciousness on a bunch of things I'm gonna want to go back and look at that deeper dive later But but Ruben is well Ruben ask the question I think that actually is most people that are just living their lives I think a certain set of people are listening to both you and going alright These two guys think that some guy is talking to them from the sky I mean, I know this is this is the most I know why this you don't love this question because it's so ridiculously oversimplified But how do you get to those people then for the people that think well, wait a minute What do you what do you talk about Shapiro loves facts over feelings? But he's talking about this imaginary sky guy that wrote this book and blah blah blah What do you think is the is there a psychological trick to sort of get people over that hump if you wanted them to start exploring? some of this It's a great question and Peterson begins by going in all the wrong places here because he begins by getting esoteric now If there's anything I've learned about Jordan Peterson after watching him for the last year and a half is that he thinks out loud And so every time he tries to answer this question He is thinking out loud and every time he works on it He either explores the field a little bit more or refines it a little bit more or focuses a little bit more and and I think what he's been doing through this book tour and As he said to Joe Rogan He does a different speech every night which I pretty much figured out when I listened to what he said in Sacramento that he's continuing to process this and he's continuing to work on this and So in my opinion he's making progress now Dave Rubin's question is of course the question that pastors deal with all the time Because the job of pastors talk about these things and what Rubin is saying essentially is Well, this gets complicated so I've been about to do exactly what I criticize just kept finished criticizing Jordan Peterson for doing Because here's the deal If you go all the way back to my Hoffman videos All of us deal with representations all the time. Okay, when I look out in in the room I'm sitting in right now. I am looking at representations of everything and and these representations This gets into the April filter that Peterson had been talking about this gets into the type of of things that my eyes are and the limits of The the limited spectrum of light that my eyes can capture the way my brain processes what I can hear all of this And so all of this is a representation that that I am able to perceive and that my mind is able to capture now My dog when my dog walks into this room My dog sees a slightly different room than I do and if there's a house fly in this room and all of you can go To YouTube and and look at those interesting YouTube is about how house flies look. Okay, so the world is a representation Now when we're talking we're using verbal representations And so what we're what we're trying to do is answer these questions, but all we can offer each other are these rep representations representations that we can understand So you'll have low in espanol algunos de ustedes me entienden pero otros no me entienden No, man the end of nada in other words what I just said in Spanish is that when I speak in Spanish some of you can Understand me and others of you can't understand me and we have this in all of our lives So what's lurking behind this conversation? In many ways is the question What do you need to know to live? Well, okay This is Dallas Willard's fundamental question that he dealt with that this really is a pastor's question that he deals with now You get into tribal isms. Okay, and what tribal isms are communities of representation? within that tribe a community has a certain set of Representations that it uses to try to Articulate that which is most important to them that which they believe is most true that which is most valuable The difficulty that you have is if you go into another tribe not only might there be substantive differences Between that which is most important both in terms of actions and objects Remember the main fork at the beginning of maps and me maps of meaning but also the representations of That which is most important so as we get into this we're going to get into Protestant Catholic issues we're going to get into Christian Jewish issues and Along the way there might sometimes be differences of substance and there might sometimes be differences of representation because we are all all the time trying to Articulate and represent in words Or In actions or you know and actions are in many ways a more powerful Fully embodied Incarnational representation in words then words are this is why Peterson likes to say I act as if I as if God I believe I act as if God is real I act as if Jesus rose from the dead so on and so forth what every time Peterson says that he's basically Understanding that actions are far more incarnate and therefore have many more layers of representation than mere words do All right, so there's just a real brief summary now Ruben comes into this and Ruben says Okay, you know we just talked a lot of the esoteric stuff We were talking about philosophy and phenomenology and and the history of Western civilization And what the Enlightenment is and how indebted the Enlightenment is to Christianity and Peterson just finished saying but you need the mythos Without the mythos, you can't understand anything and and Ruben stops and said hey. Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait, let's You always get the question Jordan about whether you believe now believe is a is one of these powerful Representational words and it's also a tribal word and that's part of the reason that Peterson avoids it and resists it all the time Because he doesn't want to get pegged in one of those tribes now this This has part to do with Peterson's temperament and it's part to do with Peterson's mission and and it's it's probably just part of who he is and The communities that he feels comfortable in and the communities that he doesn't feel comfortable in the communities has had good experiences and like the Academy and perhaps the communities that he hasn't had good experiences and for example the church okay, so so he resists that language and Lately in more and more videos and Jonathan Peugeot is has has captured this You know I said, yeah, this is when Peterson says I live as if That's a translation for belief but Peterson is Critiquing it and nuancing it and yeah budding it and all of that but but those who say he doesn't believe in God This this is all the ambiguity he's not dodging it he's not playing cute he's not avoiding it if you look at Jonathan Peugeot's Q&A November 2018. I think I think Jonathan is dead on right. I don't know Peterson like Jonathan has I've never been to his home I've I've I've had I Had a tiny little conversation with him at the at the VIP thing when he was in Sacramento I had about a 35 minute conversation with him the recording of which is sketchy that's on my YouTube channel but I don't know him like like Like Jonathan Judd's Jonathan says when you meet him he is exactly the same person he is all the time now I as a pastor watch people a lot and Even through this thin section. I certainly in this thin window called YouTube I certainly can be fooled but my take on Peterson is exactly like Peugeot's I think he I Think he is just exactly who he represents himself to be and as Jonathan mentioned in the in the in the Q&A 2018 I mean when Jordan Jordan took a minute out of his time a few minutes out of his time to He had to find my email address and he sent me a condolence email for my sister That that is I I am a tiny little youtuber. I'm a pastor of an insignificant church He gained nothing from doing that for me But it impressed me and it said to me this guy cares He's got millions of people but he cares so anyway So Rubin says okay All of this era esoteric stuff Shapiro and Peterson that you're talking about here people just want to get down to the basis of it They just want to get down to the nub. Why don't you two just start talking plain now? What do you mean by that? Why don't you use? representations that are commonly understood and Live with the ambiguities Without the nuance with the with the fear of confusion Let's see if we can make progress on this Well, you know to me we can we can do the high-level stuff for hours and hours But but eventually it just keeps getting to a sort of small This tries the poor man's soul because Remember his role be precise and you're speaking so he wants to be precise, but it's it's as if It's it's as if It's as if he has a little bottle and he wants to make sure that all the liquid goes in that little bottle and Not none of it spills and and in a sense and in a sense Dave Rubin now, he's his friend. They've been traveling together says you're gonna have to use a picture Jordan It's gonna be sloppy lots of stuff that's gonna spill but for you know, please say something that Regular folks can understand and and what he initially does well, this is just who he is Is he saying a little prayer all right, so That's so that's so hard a question. And so I'll try to address it this way So there's a and again, it's hard because he wants to be precise and it's hard because this is just where he's at right now He he is he is a very intense guy and he is really trying to get this right in The shape and worldview he has now for me having grown up in the church being a Christian minister Do you believe in God? Yes, that's what mr. Reagan asked in his interview of me. You know, do you believe in Jesus? Yes, do you believe Jesus is the Son of God? Yes. Oh Now if you say well, what do you mean by that? Oh No Now I'm gonna be rubbing my face and say okay it's like somebody called me up last week and and I get this often as a pastor because I'm a pastor of a church who answers the phone because I'm the only one at church I pick up the phone and someone calls and they say pastor Are you the pastor? You have a pastor. What kind of church is it? Hmm, I could say Christian informed church, but hardly anybody here in California would know what that would mean in Western Michigan Yeah, California not so much so then I'll start with Protestant not nobody knows what that means start with Christian well, you know, they kind of assumed that when they called and you'd be amazed how difficult it is most of the time when regular people call who have some motivation to just Maybe figure out churches It's alarmingly difficult to have that conversation and Peterson knows that that's why he's rubbing his face and doing all this stuff and and and Peterson So when I say I believe in God I believe Jesus is the Son of God I am locating myself on a tribal landscape generally in North America that I'm comfortable with he isn't Okay, you might You might want it another way. It's just how he is just come to terms with it It's not a big deal. The poor man is trying to tell us exactly what he thinks as precisely as he can a Line in the New Testament where Christ says that no one comes to the Father except through him Which is a hell of a thing for anyone to say Now go back and watch my conversation from sure. I can't remember his name right now Shoot, I've talked to so many people but he asked this question in an East American East Coast and Peterson has been Reading Lewis and and right here what Peterson says here. He's grappling with Lewis's trilemma I'll back it up a little bit. I mean those to the far to address it this way So there's a line in the New Testament where Christ says that no one comes to the Father except through him Which is a hell of a thing for anyone to say. I mean, there's a lot of statements in the New Testament that are strikingly Strange in that man. I am the way and the truth in the life. That's another one. It's associated with the same idea So here's here's the idea and it bears on your question although I know it's gonna go very esoteric here, but it really does track and and and Connect if you can take the little journey with him. I don't exactly know how it's as if there's a spirit at the bottom of things that is that is involved in the in the in the bringing to being of everything and Julian who saw this Julian one of our I had a conversation with Julian Julian's a Canadian. He's a hutterite. He said bingo He's a theist. I mean that's that's essentially what a theist would say. So let's back go back And and it bears on your question, although I don't exactly know how It's as if there's a spirit at the bottom of things. It's also as if there is it So the two talks that is that is involved in the in the in the bringing to being of everything so like so for example People talk about evolution as a random process, but that's not true. It's not true The mutations are random, but there's also a lot of sources other sources of genetic variant variation But the selection mechanisms are not random Okay, the selection mechanisms now I do have queued up I didn't make a PowerPoint for this but I do have queued up the God one God to Part of the Vancouver one conversation with Jordan Harris God is highly involved in selection Now some of you might say if you know a little bit of Christian theology Well, you're a Calvinist. Of course, you believe God is involved in selection Yeah God is involved in selection and that's precisely the aspect of God that we don't like because Selection is hard on us because it defies our wills anyway So now then the question is what are the selection mechanisms? So I'm gonna have to go a bunch of places Well, here's one selection mechanism, it's like so Human females are very sexually selective. That's why you have twice as many Female ancestors as male ancestors. So the male failure rate for reproduction is twice that of the females Okay, so the question is well, how is it that males? Succeed differentially and the first answer is well females reject if human females reject but then the question might be well they reject on the basis of what and the answer is well It's something like competence and then the question is well How is competence defined and then the answer to that is well men put themselves in hierarchies and they vote on each other's competence and it's really counterintuitive in some sense from a Evolutionary perspective because you'd have to ask yourself Why would men put themselves in positions where they elevate some men in status and then give them a huge reproductive advantage? Given that that's to their reproductive disadvantage in some sense Okay, and there are reasons part of that might be let's say you decide to follow the best leader in a battle Well, then you don't die like he might get all the women but you don't die So at least you're still in the game and it might be the same if you're following the greatest hunter and the greatest hunter Wouldn't be the person who is best at bringing down the game It would be the person who is best at bringing down the game and sharing it and organizing the next hunt and all of that right and so men will organize themselves into groups and privilege certain men and that puts them ahead in the reproductive hierarchy and so what that means to some degree is that there's a a spirit of masculinity that's Shaping the entire structure of human evolutionary history. That's what that means and then I think okay Now Spirit of masculinity he is using Okay, remember what I started early saying all of our words are representations and so it is helpful to As best we can to understand things what we essentially we do is we line up representations together the whole project that Jonathan Peugeot is doing with the symbolic world is an attempt to line up all kinds of Representations because we don't understand any of the elements until we understand the relationship of them all All right. So when he says a spirit of masculinity He is using that word in a very complicated way in that moment now Part of the difficulty we have that is if you live in the West when you hear the word spirit Spirit or remember words that fudge when you hear the word spirit your mind will go in a particular direction and that particular direction Has been created by all of the relationships that have been going on in the West for a very long time with respect to this word spirit or Spiritual and so a spirit of masculinity So some of you are thinking about what like like a ghost of masculinity like an angel of masculinity like a demon of masculinity Like a principality or power of masculinity, but he's talking biology. And and so what he means here by spirit is something Something not necessarily Metaphysical But not necessarily not metaphysical Okay, that gets really complicated and when you look into my conversation that I had with Jonathan Peugeot about angels That's where Jonathan Peugeot went And when he was having the conversation with I was a little confused because again We understand these words in relationship to one another and all the other different words and our minds are incredible in that Incredible in that we navigate this but we don't navigate this in terms of the binary fashion that computers do we Navigate these this in other ways that we don't even understand how we navigate the meaning of all these words It's why I'm excited about rebel wisdom talking to Ian McGill cross because he works on some of the stuff in some really interesting ways so so there's a spirit of masculinity and Now also don't forget that Peterson is a union. So young uses Sometimes the way when Jordan Peterson uses the word spirit it reminds me of the way young uses the word spirit Okay but it but I don't necessarily want to map them completely on to each other because I think Peterson in some ways goes off and does his own thing from you but there's a spirit of masculinity There's a there's a sense of something that governs. Let's say that there's a principality or power of masculinity That has gotten built into us Biologically, that's where he's going with this. I just be a biological Epiphenomenon and so now an epiphenomenon again your there's epigenetics epi. That's a Greek. That's a It's a Greek Pre and I can't figure can't get my words out. That's a Greek prefix. That's an epiphenomenon It's something kind of a little above Phenomenon a little around phenomenon. So it's not material itself. It's much more relational Because here's part of the problem with materialism Daniel that in his conversation on unbelievable said well, well, it's it's material plus Plus information. I thought that's a crappy That's a that's a crappy word choice for that. What it is is it's material plus relationship and the relationship we represent it as information, but it's it's relational and You know sometimes relational can be plotted on an XYZ axis, but sometimes it's only plotted Gosh, I don't want to use this word. It's only plotted on It's probably the best word for it's probably plotted on a spiritual relationship mmm, because I don't have another word for it because Because I don't want to say relational relationship So it would be a spirit that it's the spirit of positive masculinity that manifests itself across epochal ages millions of years perhaps and it actually has shaped our consciousness actually and And that one he says actually shaped our consciousness. This is into our biology. It's into our psychology. It's into our brain chemistry It's also into all of our relationships it permutates it So you go back if you go back and look at some of the videos I made again about the Sam Harris Jordan Peterson When I was talking about the gods when I was talking about polytheism, those are the gods. Those are the principalities and powers Now now you might say well Are they exhausted by? the relationships between human beings a Theist would say no remember. There's a spirit at the bottom of this manifesting. That's a very theistic understanding of this but We don't know and and we can't say and as Christians we say well We very much believe by virtue of revelation that there are other spirits now. Are they nearly exhausted by? materiality plus relationship no but But as again my conversation with Jonathan Peugeot about angels and demons These are principalities and power so in a sense what Peterson has said this is the this is the principality and power of of masculinity of good masculinity of healthy masculinity of competent hierarchical masculinity that some men will say yes my king sleep with You know sleep take the best woman of the land and may she be your queen and we all will celebrate That read King Arthur it's essentially what happens with King Arthur and and the heraldic So so read Tolkien sir Wayne and the green knight I mean this is this is what's represented in it CS Lewis with all of his Medievalism and his heroism in this he sees this and Peterson says this is built into us It is a spirit it governs we can we can we can feel it in ourselves, and it's even Biologically set within us So you can think about that as a figure and it would be the figure that emerges it's like Figure what kind of crazy accent do you have dude? Sorry? I just couldn't resist it's like the It's like this. It's like the essential spirit of all the great men who defined what greatness constituted. That's a spirit Okay, now that's a purely biological explanation. Okay. That's a spirit. It's a surely biological explanation of a spirit so now some Theists will Convention well, but again Peterson isn't open He's getting to the border of agnosticism here He's open about this because he keeps saying I am NOT he is not precluding the possibility that there is in fact a Realm that's because again, that's a representation and it's a representation that it it's a word that has meaning It's all in relationship to these other words around You know, it's like when he says the beginning a spirit underneath this now some of you're gonna say well You keep stopping it and talking well go back and watch Ruben's thing He's got the whole thing running in real time and come back here and watch me chop it up I just don't have time today to run through it and go back and run through it again You say well, that's God for all intents and purposes You might essential spirit of all the great men who defined what greatness constituted. That's a spirit Okay. Now that's a purely biological explanation. You could say well, that's God for all intents and purposes now. He's not saying that Exhausts our idea of God or that alone is God or only this here is God, but he's saying God is a word of representation that we use to talk about that dynamic in our lives so when the king is coronated or the king marries the Queen and The entire nation comes and celebrates this union what language do we use? God brought you together Okay, we use it not just for Kings and Queens we use it for Everyone we use it. I use that language and I use that language in weddings all the time God brought you together well, and now Peterson saying okay, well what aspect of God well that this this spirit of of masculinity Has been governing in terms of the hierarchies and that's been built into the women and built into the men and that's been going on Now to have that entire conversation Would be extremely cumbersome. So what has human society reduced that all into To reduce it all into a little three-letter word in English Eric takes the middle letter out God God brought us together There is there it is. That's God now again if you're if you're an atheist or materialist you might say Okay, I guess I can understand this shorthand way of you saying, you know, that's a representation and Okay, fair enough. But now we're gonna have to get into the question of consciousness You might have an image of that built right into you even the sense that you can experience something divine and Paternal might be merely a reflection of that evolutionary process So that would be a biologically reductive argument for the existence of what we experience as God That's God number one right there. And and as you can see Even if you're an atheist, you don't necessarily have a problem with that and one of the things you should appreciate is how through thousands of years of human development societal development development of language that we have been able to Take these ideas and pack them so tightly into a little three-letter word into something that's in relationship to all kinds of things And essentially what theology does and what you know, my job is in terms of pastoral a pastor is a is an applied Theologian in a sense so we we're not technically Academics, but we try to apply theology to people's lives That's what that's part of what pastors do but but all of this is boiled down into this little word called God now again If you say well, do you believe in God? Well now as I've given you this definition a whole bunch of you could say well, I don't believe it I don't believe there is a consciousness in the sky that I can relate to that If I in fact do something towards him, he will do something towards me Okay, well that's never gonna get to God number two but we're talking about here is God number one and Even Sam Harris can listen to this and say I kind of get what you I kind of get what you know It's this consciousness thing that that that that trips me up Just just just to back up again if you go back over my videos where I talk about where I'm processing his His little five-part Easter thing that that Peterson did in 2018 Easter 2018 When he talks about sacrifice, you know, you talk about sacrifice now. We're getting into God number two Because now we're getting into the relational in a new way and we're gonna get into consciousness But then there's another possibility too, which is that that's actually reflective of a deeper Metaphysical reality that has to do with the nature of consciousness itself I would say that I think that's true is I believe the biological case and I believe the biologically reductive case But I don't think that exhausts it I think that there's a metaphysical layer underneath that that the biolo that the biology is a genuine reflection of Okay, this is key so now he's just basically laid out God number one Dave you can thank me because hopefully what I'm doing is interpreting Jordan's answer I'm willing to be more sloppy. I'm pouring a jug into a tiny little bottle. Okay Allowing a lot of spillage. That's what pastors do we spill academics. They like to be precise pastors It's like boom. We broadcast we spill so there's got number one now Peterson saying I Am NOT a crook it's weird watching myself do this God number two What has got number two well there's more to this there's more to this and Peterson knows this because Why did sacrifice Go viral in the prehistoric world Well Peterson as a Darwinian and even in fact Brett Weinstein can get close to this well because it must have worked Well, why did it work and then Peterson goes into well? well sacrifices is the discovery of the future and you're making a bargain with the future and Okay, so It still doesn't necessarily get us into this conscious thing and and so if you go back and if you look at again Vancouver one Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson Jordan Peterson is laying all this God number one stuff and Sam Harris like no no no no no You know, you know, it's it's not what everybody means when they talk about God. Well, what do they mean? Well, it's like it's like Verizon Lisa saying the universe wants me Well, what is want what says what does a function of a conscious agent a conscious being? And so consciousness has to have a piece of this And that's the sort of the macrocosm above and the microcosm below that we that we are really reflective Including in our consciousness of something about the structure of reality. It's okay. So what he's saying here is that if in our biology we can Feel pretty comfortable about God number one being reflected in our biology Biology when we all celebrate that King Arthur and Guinevere the best man of the land and the best woman of the land and if they come together and if they are king and Queen of the land and the entire land will prosper or you can do Tolkien you can do Aragorn and And our wind and the entire land will prosper Okay, so so so Okay, and we can say well a good king makes the land prosper. Okay. God number one God number two if in fact This spirit of masculinity is built into us Might it also be that consciousness Itself is reflecting something that's out there and And it isn't just as as many materialists have have questioned. It isn't just this Accidental random byproduct of a larger brain that that just as If if the spirit of masculinity As we talked about the spirit of masculinity if the spirit of masculinity is an expression is the product of Something out there might not consciousness also be to might there in fact be a Consciousness that is the source of all of our subconscious Of our underlying consciousnesses and subconsciousness to Might there actually be a mind a father mind of which we are all his children He's saying That's not an unreasonable idea Self and that might involve whatever Whatever it is that God is well So that that's why I think this is so interesting because what you're doing there Especially at the end is you're giving it a little room to say I don't know Such a modern meme He keeps saying he doesn't know he keeps saying he's working on it. This is part of The tribal conversations we're having right you have to yeah, but I think that that's what people don't want to grant you This is Believe in God it's like well, that's like it's to me that question is always like well What makes you so sure that you know that God exists right? It's like well, I'm not sure I'm not willing to claim that certainty, you know But well, but I laid out the argument What do you think about when he takes it all the way to that end and then there's that little space at the end again I don't think that that's severely problematic in terms of just general religious thought I mean the general religious thought going back thousands of years and this is why when you look at Aquinas's proofs of God What he comes to is he says? Basically what you say which is if you go down deep enough then you get to something and that something is what we call God So he doesn't say God he doesn't the Bible starts from the premise God exists and he created the universe Aquinas starts from We have a universe what says God is there and he says well when you go all the way down deep enough there has to be a force that lies behind the combined logic of the universe and That thing is what we call God, right? And so he's trying to reason his way back to first principles And I think that the the case for God not in the way that we think of him as like a jolly Bearded guy in the sky. Oh, you know Peterson has been Peterson made a pretty compelling argument that Even though now now Shapiro, you know, he's a good he's he's He's a good he's got a yamacan We're not gonna represent God in terms of anything that God has made in his creation That is that is that is a commandment that Christians and Jews Ought to keep like takes care of all of our problems or anything But the idea that there is a logos right this is that there's a structure a fundamental structure to the way life is Brought in John 1 is and there was a reason and a fundamental purpose to why life is and what lies below that you can Call God and that without that has some association with it. Well and that well That's really important there was a reason and a fundamental purpose to why life is and what lies below that you can call God and That without and without has some association with it God number two and that well that your consciousness reflects God again This is the this is one of the fundamental this is sort of liveness is proof of God Is that the principle of sufficient reason the idea that you are capable of understanding the universe if you actually believe you're capable of understanding? The universe in anyway in anyway Then your mind has to in some if you believe in objective reality as Sam does and you believe that your mind is capable of grasping An objective reality not an evolutionarily beneficial reality, but an objective reality your mind is reflecting a greater mind Right your mind is reflecting a greater logic. Well what stands behind that greater logic? It must be something right and so this is the idea that there is a God that stands behind that so the proof for God I think honestly is is not supremely difficult And I think that we all do have whether it's biologically sourced or in my view logically sourced a belief that there is a structure to the universe A predictable structure to the universe that didn't emerge out of simple randomness And there's a reason that things are the way that they are and that from that we can draw the fact that we are capable of Acting within that logical universe of everything or sheer chaos you could not act to be there I was getting into natural law, but there's a natural order to things that there is a created order and that Functioning within this created order yields outcomes that can be predicted So would you both argue then that at a micro level and at the individual level you could live a perfectly good decent life We're gonna have to get into this some more One of the things I wanted to do though was I've got a bunch of videos queued up here What's interesting when you look at the world of the universe What's interesting when I listen to this and we're talking about God number two, Jonathan Pigeot So God number one, stuff built into the world In a sense, God of the natural order, the God who selects And so when a bullet whizzes by and takes out Sasha Eric Weinstein's great uncle And where is God in that? God is that which selects, God is that which chooses This is where you get into Providence, Heidelberg Catechism Lord's Day 10, God brings fat years and lean years Now there's some Christians, when we get into Christian theology Christian theology has been chewing on all this stuff forever And so even when I say it in that way, I'm giving a representation And the challenge of Christian theology, of theology at all Or thought or language at all is to try to give the best representation that fits That most accurately reflects reality And this is what's difficult with us But I thought when we got into the consciousness part here This is basically what Pigeot has been trying to do all along This is from his November question and answer Anjo Terpstra says Einstein He believed in the God of Spinoza Who reveals himself in the harmony of all that exist He did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with faiths and actions of human beings A view which he describes as naive And he says he believes in the personal God and in what matters Now this problem Stands from the problem that I've been trying to help you guys understand From the beginning It is the problem of ignoring the reality of consciousness Now again, when Peterson is When Peterson talks about modernity and the fork that modernity made By excluding subjectivity And basically creating the split between the subjective and the objective Eliminating the subjective and trying to isolate the objective As Thomas Nagel said You put a fork into culture You put a fork into philosophy And this proved very powerful in terms of In terms of gaining a handle on A certain aspect of the world But even Hoffman says that technically isn't objective We're still living with representations between us And whatever the strangeness of The real world truly is and we have a sense of that now with modern physics But the split here That Jonathan has been working on right from the beginning This is why he's making videos, this is why he's talking about symbolism He's saying I'm trying to reintegrate the subjective into the conversation And this of course is what Thomas Nagel in his book Mind and Cosmos says We're at a point now where we've pretty much exhausted The benefits that we have gotten from splitting the subjective And the objective, from splitting consciousness out Of the program And Thomas Nagel fears, well, he's not so sure that you can put Humpty Dumpty back together again Jonathan in a sense is a Real conservative in that he says I'm using a computer, I'm using modern technology, I'm using all this But when it comes to how we govern I want to inhabit the pre-modern world I want to worship within the pre-modern world Of acting as if consciousness has no bearing In the world, acting as if personhood Either didn't exist or isn't important or is just Taken for granted maybe, that's probably the best way to see it, to think as if Personhood and the point of Self-consciousness is taken for granted And then we look out and we try to imagine the infinite And somehow we find it naive to think that The manner in which I look at the infinite The manner in which I am the only creature that we know of On earth, who is able to even ponder the question of the infinite That the capacity that I have to ponder the infinite Which somehow, it is naive to think That that would somehow mirror the infinite To me that's just, I don't understand how people can get to that I don't understand why it bothers people That God is mine, that God is person That God is infinite consciousness I don't understand why that bothers people And this is, Jonathan is dealing with the main objection Same Harris' objection to God number two, this is same Harris' objection That God in fact would care for us Which is what the Psalmist understands, it's a very understandable Thing to say, why should the maker of A universe the likes of which We experience care about me, that's a very Reasonable question, because we know hierarchies and in a sense The reason when Jordan Peterson sent me that little email is because he's on a Different hierarchy than me, now obviously our hierarchies have worked complicated There's other hierarchies like in the Christian informed church, Jordan Peterson has no status I have status in the Christian informed church, but in this other hierarchy Jordan Peterson's very high status, he sent me a nice condolence note about My sister, he cared for me, and so the Psalmist says Why should God care for me? And this is a major objection To the idea of relating to God But what Jonathan is saying here is that, but why would you Exclude God from even this power that the tiny Little likes of us have, in other words if you make the argument That big, he's not a creature, that God Should care for me because I'm small is difficult Well, let's flip that around and say, well even you who are Small have consciousness, why would you exclude that From the source of the universe? That makes no Sense, that makes no sense at all in fact, why would In a sense we, who have this little experience of consciousness which is As Brett Weinstein says in his rebel wisdom interviews, an incredibly Powerful tool, why would you imagine that our Source would be lacking this? And that our source Could, if our source desires If our source has will, if our source has choice, if our Source selects, picks and chooses God number one, if our source has This, why wouldn't our source, if he wishes, get involved In our affairs? Well I just can't imagine that that would happen Why? Because you've lived 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years And one person on top of one other hierarchy hasn't bothered Well let's map this out to all time Because again time is not a finite resource In the universe, we experience it as a finite Resource because we are finite because we are little, but why would you Exclude from the great source that which we have Even in tiny measures, and to a degree even my dog has consciousness Even the cow that produced the beef for Jordan Peterson's steak has a degree of consciousness I love Jonathan's rant here And so the question And the problem is that we're so scientific We only think in quantitative manners And so we don't understand We don't understand how Qualitative things work, and so when we Think of God who answers your prayers The only reason why it bothers us is because we have to imagine a God that is In space and in time somewhere And we have trouble with that, for all of the reasons That I just said, we have trouble imagining it, so whose limitation Are we really bumping up against? We're bumping up against our Limited imagination, not God's capacity And he's there tabulating a calculator And he's answering your prayers Why does it have to be that way? If you Come from the infinite divine mind, if that is your Origin, why does it bother you that you can interact With your origin and that origin can interact with You? To me, maybe it's like I don't, maybe it's because to me I find that People are not Like I said, people just take consciousness for granted, and I think that that's the problem Once you start to understand When you start, once you start to put consciousness back into The chains of causalities, which is what I'm always saying, then all of a sudden The infinite The infinite God has to That aspect of you has to also reflect The infinite, and that's all I guess that's all I can say, and so I don't have a problem with God answering My prayers at all, I don't have a problem with that at all, and I know that It happens to people all the time, and I don't have a problem with Miracles, I don't have a problem with Yeah, I don't have a problem with that in any Way Me neither, I'm gonna stop this here, I'm gonna compile it There's a section that's coming up here where we get into agency That Esther O'Reilly and a number of People said, oh you really gotta talk about this, because in many ways Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson are They don't know enough theological history Of Protestant Catholic issues, I'm not saying Ben Shapiro is lacking in terms of Jewish theological history, he knows far more about that than I do So I wanna do that, and I'm gonna do that in a separate video So, but this was God number one and God number two, Jordan Peterson Laying it all out there
