 it's a little darker but at least you can at least I don't have this halo thing behind me so where do you live? I live in Auckland, New Zealand but I'm originally from Sydney wow very cool whenever you check your analytics and you see viewers from New Zealand I'm probably two of those per video because I listen to half of one and then I might try and listen to it again but I won't be able to remember where I was up to and then I go oh forget it so I listen to like the first half of many of your videos well thank you for listening yeah no problem so I said in my in my sign up form that I wanted to talk about all this highfalutin stuff but actually I was thinking about it later and I actually just wanted to talk about myself oh that's perfectly fine because I pretty much fit into the Paul Van de Klay viewer archetype oh really? what does that profile look like? I think there is one so I grew up in Sydney and around so my my two grandparents on my mom's side and my dad's side were both kind of very fundamentalist Christians in the 60s and 70s and they still are and my parents met at church but then they kind of left the church when they were together but I grew up around that kind of Christianity and so when I was a teenager I was very into science because I was naturally kind of good at it and I my grandmother realized this and started giving me creation magazine from from Ken Hans group and this this was at high school and I actually did a science project on creationism in year nine with my friend and we actually did I thought a reasonably good job like we were open minded about it and I wasn't convinced but I thought it was interesting and so but that was kind of the you know that that was my first thinking about science and religion was like well science says this religion says that one's wrong one's right and then ultimately I you know I am a scientist now. Oh really? What do you do? Yeah. I was trained as a physicist I did my PhD in astrophysics but while I was doing that I became more interested in data analysis and statistics and so I ended up as a statistician so that's what I am now Wow. So I'm an academic at the University here. Okay. Oh wow. Are you married? Yes married. We've been married since 2014 so four years and we've just had our first child she's two months old Congratulations! And you have a dog. I'm supposed to be doing dog training. Good girl. I have to say good girl when she shuts up. What kind of a dog? She's a miniature pincher. Okay. Yeah so a little tiny bundle of energy yeah yeah also have a bird so we we had lots of practice runs before having our kid. That's how you can tell people are nesting they have the dog and the cat and the bird and they have a kid that's pretty good because if you can't keep a dog alive don't have a kid. Yes. The other things we did was move to the suburbs, buy a house put decals on the back of our car and for me at least start paying attention to the Bible I don't know I don't know how that happened like five years five years ago I was I was quite different in what I thought about lots of things. Wow. When I was doing my PhD I was the guy in our office I was super into the new atheism and so I loved Richard Dawkins the whole time I read his books I found them super interesting and I thought he was just the greatest and I liked Sam Harris as well and I've read all of Sam's books and and also I guess I've always been interested in politics as well and I was kind of just you know around academics and you just what circles do you hang around in you just kind of automatically default to thinking that what you hear is just true especially if the people are all really bright and you know it and it feels rational and you think you can argue for it and you probably can and I think what happened was about four years ago there was some kerfuffle among scientists some culture war type thing so I won't get into the details but the culture wars are in the scientific community as well and I didn't like some of what I was seeing and I was I happened to be following Claire Layman on Twitter do you know of Claire? Yeah. Yeah and so I messaged her because I knew she was well at the time she was more neutral in the culture wars and now she's not very neutral but she's on the side that I like but she recommended I read The Righteous Mind and I did and nothing's been the same since I read The Righteous Mind because I was like this is how my mind has always worked there's this whole thing with the rider and the elephant and intuitions coming first and strategic reasoning coming afterwards that's what it's always been and if I look at my look at my grandparents who were both fundamentalists I don't know if there's like maybe there's some heritable basis for being a zealot I'm sure there is! If there is I've probably got it so I was I was like the most die-hard new atheist and I was gonna get rid of religion and everything was gonna be great and now and then I was like this super passionate leftist and only thing that mattered was global warming and now I'm like this kind of center-right economics liking guy who's semi interested in religion and gets annoyed at all the things I used to be Wow! So that's how I ended up listening to your stuff and of course Jordan Peterson's stuff and all of that. Well I think Jonathan Haidt because before I ever heard of Jordan Peterson I had read Jonathan Haidt's Happiness Hypothesis and The Righteous Mind they're both good books and Haidt continues to maintain himself as an atheist of sorts or I'm not exactly sure I haven't listened to him recently how he would categorize himself. He unlike Peterson has not he's kind of maintained himself as an academic he'll talk about this stuff but keeps the line between and I think that's why that's what so unnerved Bernie I forget his last name Jordan Peters the guy who hired Jordan Peterson so unnerves them about Jordan Peterson because Jordan Peterson's like ah screw it this is who I am yes very different I think Jonathan Haidt is very kind of when he speaks he's very careful and and you know Jordan Peterson always says he's really careful with his words and I'm like 90 percent of the time I'm like yeah but then you see all the other 10 percent I'm like that wasn't careful that wasn't careful that wasn't careful and that 10 percent that's the stuff that makes people go like if you say you like Jordan Peterson that's that 10 percent they're going to bring it up and you and you have to defend it oh so true yeah well I guess no I suppose if I do have an audience you're definitely a your profile is definitely a part of it because I do talk to a lot of people like you a lot of people come to my meetups have similar stories so yeah I feel like this watching Jordan Peterson's videos actually maps of meaning videos I understood some things about my own work and about science that I didn't understand before and I actually think that if you if you listen to it charitably and open-mindedly I think he actually has a very good philosophy of science that's kind of through through the videos because one of the things he talks about when he I think in the context of like different methods of therapy and I guess this is a way another way in which I fit the mold of someone who would be interested in Jordan Peterson I've had anxiety kind of issues my whole life and I've seen probably 15 to 20 therapists in my life and so I've always been interested in psychology from that angle but the difference between a good psychologist who gets you to do the things that you need to do and a bad one who makes you want to go to the hospital after you visit them that's that's a really big difference and there's something about about Peterson is that he I think this was in the the Slate Star Codex review of him it's like it's it's like self-help but it's delivered in such a way that it really makes you think this is the this is what I need to be doing and so when I pack away the dishes and my wife's amazed the last two years I've been packing away the dishes a lot better than I used to she can take about half the credit for that kind of thing but the other half is that when I'm putting it away I'm making the world a better place and I didn't understand that before I thought making the world a better place was you know donating money to the right charity or something which is fine but but also just doing the things that you know you have to do that will be worse if you don't do them and it's I found it helpful with the baby as well because I I don't know if you go into the the shadow business but but there is one oh yes there is when you've had not enough sleep and you're trying to settle the baby you think things that that baby will pull it out of you babies are brutal teachers of your own selfishness and yeah issues boy they just it's yeah it's like she's the most important thing in my life and I will just be begging for her to let me go back to twitter and it's like I don't the the language of sin like people don't like it but but that's that's sin that's that's wrong that's uh yeah yeah and and we're full of it and we can't stop ourselves no yeah and I think that one so when I a few years ago when I was reading Sam Harris's spirituality stuff so waking up and his meditation stuff and I practiced meditation for a while and it did actually help me and and I enjoyed it although you're not supposed to enjoy it you're just supposed to do it everyone either enjoys it or finds it boring like unless you devote your life to it you're going to be you know thinking about what you thought of it and whether you're good at it which is another thing you're not supposed to do I thought it was interesting but it didn't really like help with life it felt very passive like so so if I get upset in my life I can pay attention to the fact that I'm upset yeah but I was kind of like but then what and I I kind of have been looking at philosophies that are a bit more practical and hands-on now I think they they maybe work better for me and I'm not afraid of religion anymore I think there's there's there's stuff in there that's worth knowing about and so it's so that's why I'm reading the bible I'm like there's stuff worth knowing so I don't know what's going to happen you know with what I believe or whatever I think this is fun I mean I just finished so I just finished recording a video because I'm trying to figure out what to do with this Sam Harris, Brett Weinstein, the two talks in Vancouver so I started at the end of it which I think is the whole thing right at the end okay I've listened to this thing at least a dozen times and it's like the way you paint anybody hurt Sam Harris what did they do to that man why is he so afraid I mean he's just like bundle of anxiety about religion it's like gosh what happened to you that's my impression I don't know if this is a actually a true memory but I have a memory of being about 12 and my grandmother so I lived with my grandmother and my dad after my parents got divorced and my grandmother was very fundamentalist and her pastor was over and they were having a group and they were praying and I heard them I don't know if I don't know if I made this up or exaggerated something I overheard but I think that someone had died in their group and that the pastor has said he was going to go to the morgue and pray for him to be raised from the dead and I was like well that's uh you know that's the kind of thing that puts you off for a very long time I appreciate the I appreciate the the guts of the pastor that's very gutsy yeah I personally got it I liked that pastor I think he's still around I he was a good guy and I would sometimes argue with him and sometimes you know I'd sit in my room and I could hear everything that was going on in the meeting and I'd be sitting there with like you know Richard Dawkins dot net open and then and then I'd go out and I'd have an argument with them about something or other and I remember once also trying to explain natural selection to him and it was actually a really good conversation because we had like had this discussion I feel like I did a good job of explaining what you know a creationist would have called microevolution and he was like oh yeah that that's sensible I'm fully on board with that so so it's not like you know he was this super closed-minded guy who you know wouldn't tolerate anyone who disagreed with him or anything he just had very he was very adamant in ways that I would be afraid to be yeah I I could appreciate a pastor who'd go down to a morgue and pray for the resurrection I pray for the resurrection I'm just a little more quiet about it that's like yeah dude go for it even announce it yeah it is gutsy it's like I could see something admirable in that but I could see that's the kind of that's what Sam Harris doesn't like yeah yeah yeah it's like why would you believe that that's gonna work yeah you know that's why not hope for it and yeah fair enough and when and when I bought the the whole like hard determinism thing because I trained as a physicist so like it's very natural for me to see the world as particles moving around and following their destiny according to the laws of dynamics and you know reading Sam Harris he has the same kind of picture but mysteriously there's consciousness which you should think about when you think that way I you know you get up in the morning and and you think well I hope the particles move themselves in a way that that's good like that what's her name Verizon Lisa that's right Verizon Lisa go universe by the way thanks universe you'll hear Sam Harris in the in the Weinstein or you'll hear Weinstein talk about the universe arranging and I thought I arts it's our language is so embedded with this we're not gonna get rid of it yeah yeah and yeah I guess I guess other things I'm just rambling at this point but that's cool you're well so other things that oh thank you I think about this stuff like you know all day every day people could hear a recording of my brain they think I was nuts but um I don't know where to go now well it's you know it might be that Jordan Peterson is is what Jordan Peterson is doing he's gathering all the people who think about this stuff all day like me I've thought about this stuff all my life and then you hear Jordan Peterson ramble and you begin to say I'm not alone thinking about this stuff all my life and he's got some interesting ideas yeah yeah definitely I think there's a master stroke with his first biblical lecture was calling an introduction to the idea of God yeah the idea of because I you know for a lot of people I think if it was introduction to God or something they just wouldn't even click yeah yeah um and and whether you think God exists or not or and in what sense God exists or not and whether he's okay with masturbation or not um you you you would you know the idea exists there are many different ideas and they're worth talking about him and trying to understand somewhat and the idea is powerful and that's that's one I one thing that I think Peterson is helping people talk about that you know okay you've got issues with God and ontology yeah that's a whole nother conversation but this idea has afforded so much and I think you know so now I'm doing a lot of thinking about secularity and the relationship between Christianity and secularity and so I've been watching uh the dude I'd note in a network and he's referenced this book about from by Charles Murray that I'm gonna have to look up now where Murray was basically saying you know and nobody knows why why science developed in Christendom and not in China that's a question we don't know why but it seems to be something that the idea of God got so built into our culture that in a sense we could freelance without him and that's into some interesting ideas too I'm somewhat sympathetic to that but I also just don't know like this kind of seemingly one-off things that spark up in one place I think you can try to over explain them um and say well it was it was this or it was that and and there's that economist Deidre McCloskey who um she has some writing that I haven't actually read but I've heard about that argues that a lot of the explosion in wealth in the last few hundred years started with a change in norms that meant that commerce was okay and that commerce was good and I'm like yeah maybe but then you get the like Steven Pinker types it's like oh it's when we started questioning the Catholic Church then that's what made everything take off and I don't know maybe and then there's the people who will emphasize more the the kind of long guest Judeo-Christian heritage and some of the attitudes and things that that would have would have created and said well that was the thing and I don't know maybe it was all three of those things or none of them or two of them or plus more yeah or John Calvin rejiggering the biblical exclusion on loaning with interest and saying well that only applied to loans for necessity if someone wanted to borrow money in order to do business with it surely the Bible doesn't prohibit that there you have the connection between Calvinism and Capitalism interesting yeah I didn't know that yeah yeah there's lots of them because that kind of thing happens when I read the when I read the Bible I started with the gospels which is where everyone recommends you to start and I've been really struggling with what version to read because I thought NIV would be the best place to start because it will be easy but then you read you read the Sermon on the Mountain NIV and it sounds stupid like they really had to say pearls pearls in front of pigs people know what swine is I should I should tell you so the NIV got started in the Christian Reformed Church okay and so some of my professors at seminary were in the were in the were on the committee to create it and there was a story about a professor named Basvin Elderen who he was a New Testament prof and he was working on the committee and he would take passages and give them to students to translate yeah and so they'd have these big they'd have these big conversations about how they should translate this and then the NIV especially for some key memorable passages just always defaulted to the KJV the King James Version just because okay everybody's got it built into their head who cares what the Greek says quote the James Version and it was point exactly pearls before swine yes it's built into us now yes yes and it was so funny watching your video analysing Jordan Peterson on the firing line where he was quoting Jesus and saying that old phrase oh it's it's funny and the first time I read the Sermon on the Mount I guess it was a it was interesting at least on on the literary side I was like wow it's like every second sentence is something that you just hear everywhere every second sentence became a catchphrase and it's it's like at the very least it's like Shakespeare or something like you should at least know about it on that level yeah but I didn't really but now I do more so right now I noticed that you're using ESV in some of your talks so I've been I've been looking at ESV on what I need them for okay because the it's gotten really complicated in the English world because of the marketplace and translations okay and that's why I'm glad I still I went to seminary back in the day when they demanded Greek and Hebrew because it's really helpful to be able to get down a level lower and at least play around see where all the translations came from yeah yeah that that never even solves it but I mean if you think going into Jordan Peterson is a rabbit trail the Bible is the king of all rabbit trails yeah this is nothing compared to what I yeah I I feel like I I I've realized that I'm never going to solve everything obviously and I think I got that from from Jonathan Haidt and Thomas Sowell but I think you like sometimes I go into a subject I'm like I see that this subject has something in it that it's worth mining there's something good in there so a couple of years ago I thought economics was there and I'm still interested in economics now and I've taught myself some and it's part of what made me realize that a lot of my old politics would have been a disaster had it ever come about but um but I you know I studied physics for eight years I don't know anywhere near all the physics and but I sat down to learn economics I was like I'm going to teach myself economics this year and like that didn't happen like I taught myself economics 101 um now I'm gonna gonna teach myself Christianity like no I'm not I'm gonna get a surface level thing that and I'm gonna find the angle on it that's like okay that's gonna be my angle on it but it's probably wrong and I'm missing heaps of detail and 50 000 people could argue it but it's like trying to solve everything but it doesn't happen um your your life is simply too short yeah there's a good passage in Job that I highlighted when I was reading it about um something about paying attention to your ancestors because your life is short or something um but yeah I'm not aware of that passage I'll have to look that up because yeah that's another thing that Peterson just in that last three minute thing at the end and I I found that in other pieces that you know he makes the point that we need these structures to you know intermediate between us and the rest of the world because life is just too short we just die yes yeah um another thing that his his lectures made me more comfortable with was something I had difficulty squaring with the kind of particles moving around view of everything um not that there's anything wrong with particles moving around so you know if any I might send this to my friend Luke Barnes who I recommended to you he's a cosmologist who's a Christian and uh you know he spends all his work day simulating particles moving around so there's nothing wrong with particles moving around god loves moving particles just say it yeah but I was trying to square that with what statisticians do a lot of the time which is you know you get this data so say you want to say someone is shooting free throws in basketball and they they're practicing free throws and they they do 20 attempts and they get 15 of them in and then from that you want to say something about how good that basketball player is at shooting free throws now what statisticians will do and they'll all do this is they will come up with something called a parameter which is just a quantity it's a hypothetical quantity that is a number that describes how good the basketball player is and then they'll say from the data which is 15 shots out of 20 where we're successful they'll say okay given that data what can we infer about the value of this parameter which describes how good they are and then if they want to predict future shots they'll then you know they'll then use the value estimated value of the parameter to predict the future and to account for the uncertainty about the fact that you don't actually know the value you can like compensate you can like vary the value a bit see how much that affects the predictions so that's what statisticians do but this parameter doesn't exist it's nowhere and i was at a conference once and there was this crazy guy with a long beard and hair and and he was giving us ostensibly a statistics talk and it was all weird um but he said parameters are ghosts like they they hardly ever exist so a statistician will be confronted with some data and then they'll use it to estimate quantities which don't exist and they'll just do this without thinking that there's anything weird about it or that there's anything non-materialist about it um but it's just it's completely an abstraction and the other thing that's interesting about that is that the the data doesn't tell you how to extrapolate from the data to do that you need another structure you need something that statisticians will call variously depending on what school of thought they're into you need a model and you need something called a prior and this is all the stuff that you need that isn't the facts that you need to put with the facts before the facts can do anything huh so i don't know how how well i did at explaining that that that was really good and that's tracking with you know because my video channel is nothing but what i'm thinking about now i mean yeah other people have structure and stuff is like nah i don't have time for structure so that explains your productivity basically what you've done is you've hooked up your chattering brain to the webcam and that's it that's exactly my channel yeah here it is that is really interesting there's a guy who comes to my meetup who's also a statistician and he's a very interesting guy and very faithful in the meetup and oh that's that's just fascinating well to me it it holds it just is this it's just in keeping with my ob my observing just how we as people work we need these things and so you'll hear when i publish the video that i just i just i may just made this afternoon i'm just listening to sam harris and i'm thinking do you listen to yourself do you do you you're throwing out i mean and throughout the whole thing he keeps talking about stories stories you know ah stories but he he keeps using stories it's like yes because we can't do anything else i think i think sometimes you're unfair on sam i'll say that is it that's why i probably am i i don't have a problem that he's an atheist i love atheists yeah but i get frustrated because i i think i don't know that he listens to himself i think i can possibly steel man him okay so i think the the i think where he's coming from is that he understands the necessity of assumptions i don't think he denies that i think if you read the moral landscape he's like he he says yes the facts don't fully speak for themselves you need assumptions somewhere to kind of get started and here are some plausible assumptions that we can all agree on now the the difficulty is that he thinks they're obvious assumptions yeah i think whereas they probably come from his idea of kind of what it means to be a good and moral person yeah which which if you look at history is not obvious yeah and it's not something he worked out he inherited it right so i think that's that's the i think that's a good point against what he's against what he thinks but i think for him the sticking point with religion is that so say that one of the founding things in christianity is the resurrection of jesus i said and i suppose physically the resurrection of jesus and in in all our like theories about anything there are these weird there are these like foundational areas where you have to make assumptions or you could say have faith like um the universe is at least somewhat intelligible or if something happens a lot has happened a lot in the past it probably will happen in the future even though you can't guarantee it so there's there's those kinds of assumptions at the base of everything what there aren't assumptions about is this particular person died and then got resurrected that's like a weird place in the context of all the different theories that's a weird place to put the to put the faith yes or to put the assumption and i think that's what he doesn't like yeah does that make sense what do you think about that i think that's exactly right and that actually is the i pulled i don't have it sitting here on my table uh nt wright's book on the resurrection of the son of god that is this big fat book and nt wright basically says if you go through all of the history about what what the greeks thought about in terms of their metaphysics resurrection makes zero sense what the jews thought about i mean even though the idea of a resurrection had kind of developed in judaism in the intertestamental period and you can find a little bit of it in daniel this nt wright basically says there's no other way to explain the existence of christianity other than these disciples something happened and it wasn't an individual vision yeah old group of them all at once and so the best you know occam's razor is that the the simplest way to understanding what happened was that they touched this guy yeah he came back yeah but you're exactly right it's like i i don't what does that mean and that's why you know i love your story about the guy going to the morgue and pray for the resurrection of the dead people have been playing with this idea on tv lately and it's a fascinating idea because on the tv what shows well there's there's some been there's been a whole bunch of shows in american television that have been playing with people coming back from the dead okay what that does and and most of them aren't any good the shows but but so but if you sit down and you imagine this because i think about it sometime okay so let's say my father who died five years ago would knock on this door and walk through this door i i don't know what that would do to me physiologically just the shock of that yeah and then what is that going to do to me relationally yes oh okay well we're going to go to go down to social security and get your number back you know you're gonna have to start eating again you would be in chaos the bottom part of chaos oh yeah not not a little bit that appears within the oval that's right that's right one down there yeah so i i have zero i i you know for when people say they just can't stomach this i think yeah you're paying attention because most of the time christians that kind of blithely embrace it it's like okay but i mean if you just start and stop and think about this thing it is mind-blowing and then you know if you listen to my sermons usually around easter i'll talk about it because i think about the fact that so in the stories jesus comes back they touch him and i would want to take okay let's go see pilot you know let's let's let's march and and this is just where we go and and i think you're right in terms of the sermon on the mount i don't know if you saw the video where i talked about virginia stems oh when she was teaching she was an english teacher in texas a and m in the 1980s just took the text of the sermon on the mount not in a bible or anything handed it out to her students yeah without context and said write an essay on what you think of this yeah many of them did not recognize it okay but they most of them hated it they couldn't stand what did they what didn't they like did they say well jesus is unrealistic jesus is you know the sex stuff you know this lust business good god what's that about oh yeah the thing about you like if you look at another woman that's right that's like in my head now yeah because i have a very accepting wife i'll i'll tell her if i think someone's hot or whatever and she says you have a very secure wife yes yeah i don't know what it says about me though i think i think it says that even if i wanted to i i'd be incapable which is probably true um and probably for the best but uh i'm like that it that is an impossible standard yeah but you know what do you what do you expect i suppose yeah try holding yourself to a standard that you that you're not currently achieving at least is probably good yeah um and it's it's funny with the me too stuff now that a kind of conservative sexual ethic is coming back but under a different uh different philosophy um but it's the same thing like behaviorally what you what you should what you ought to do is almost the same yeah which is be very cautious yeah um yeah yeah an incredibly high standard yeah in some cases the left the numerality of the left i look at it and think wow good luck yeah i think it's i don't know whether this is going to go up but you know maybe i'll show it to my wife and she'll say not um because uh you know what academics can be like i won't say are like because it can be this stuff i did in my 20 early 20s i was extremely awkward i was a physics guy in a physics department who was shy and didn't have many friends and didn't meet very many women in the physics department and because there weren't many there no there are more now there were fewer then um it's uh you know some of the stuff i did and like i i look back on it now with embarrassment i don't think i should have you know been booted out of my phd or something but if if i did it to the wrong person well to someone who thought maybe i should have been then that could have happened and it all seems very random yeah this kind of thing it's like and same with the like the blow ups of people that say something that makes a firestorm and then they get fired like the brett weinstein thing that kind of thing it all seems very heavy-tailed to use a statistics phrase if you i don't know if you know what heavy-tailed means it it means something where it means a distribution where there's very very a lot of probability near zero and a small probability of something extremely large so there's probably thousands of academics every day saying something you know that would annoy someone or you know okay you violate a taboo of someone but nothing happens but then you just never know if you might be the big one and so that's kind of what puts the chill on means you you know you can't say anything in public in case you're one in one thousand chance that you become an international celebrity like jordan peterson yeah like it worked out pretty well for them but there are others that hasn't worked out that well for i'm sure there's plenty of them or at least a few of them but i think you're right i think most people i i think we fail to you know why is the story of this guy going to a morgue and praying for the resurrection such an outlier why don't most pastors do that we are so there's so much pressure in some sense if you really believed it why wouldn't you like you were saying that's right yeah that's right and that's actually one one reason why i find your channel appealing is that you don't signal that very much youtube is a place for people with little to lose that's why i don't have very many things up i have some statistics lectures and some videos of my bird but you don't you don't you don't signal the stuff that would trigger sam harris you don't say it very much apart from say criticisms of him but i should be nicer to say i i get it from both sides people are like you're too nice to sam other people like you're too hard on sam so sam isn't watching yeah exactly worried about it yeah but i think uh it's like i'd listen to several hours of you before i heard you say i believe in the coming the world to come yeah or something and you said in the world to come i'm going to study this or something or i'm going to do this and i'm like ah you're actually a christian like in the sense that i would have recognized years ago not the sense that yeah these weird agnostic christian people who like jordan peter whatever we are um yeah well that's and that's what you know the the big game is here isn't he this is this is where you know and it was it was the it was the hard things of my life that forced me to ask myself or it was the hard things of my life to force me to say okay if i forgive my enemies if i turn the other cheek with the rules of this world the outcomes are utterly predictable you turn the other cheek you usually get hit again yeah you start forgiving people you start losing yeah am i prepared for that when now if you're a loser and you lose all the time and you don't have the capacity to win what is that to you you know you don't but if you if you're large enough to hit back if you're smart enough or have enough status or or or have whatever it takes to kick down on other people and you don't do it well now something's in the game because now you're feeling the cost of discipleship and then emotionally you have to decide okay i am going to deny myself these things how can i emotionally compensate for that yeah the world to come yeah and sam harris would say you're crazy and this is where i say yeah and this is exactly why everyone wants a christian neighbor yeah they might not want to be themselves but they sure love it when their neighbor is one yeah and wouldn't it be weird and this is kind of what i think but because i'm not convinced about the resurrection i could go read nt right and but then i'd have to go read bart urman right and then i'd have to sit in my clean room and figure out which one of them was correct and then i'd you know i'd need 10 lives to figure that out but uh see um could it be that believing something that isn't factually true and i'm not necessarily saying it's not is is the most the best thing that you could do i don't see why that couldn't that could be true there could be things that are false that if you believe them they're the best thing to believe this is this is the this is the brett weinstein act as if the gun is loaded yeah and i'll talk about that today and sam harris just at the end talks about it and basically says no well yes and no i don't so if if so you've got one person over here that because they were raised in a christian home has never thought through the resurrection of the dead and what that means can simply say oh i believe that's real it's a kind of a facet of belief i one of the things i like about peterson and is is he leaves open the honesty which i think is exactly right that okay your belief is not well earned it's it's just simply part of the package you were given now maybe that's a wonderful package to have been given but it hasn't cost you anything yet so that's where jung's comment that peterson adapts about beware of unearthed an unearned beliefs yes now i think there will be i i'm a i'm a traditional christian in many ways i i believe in hell i believe in the second coming i mean go right down the line of the apostle's creed and i i buy it so that's that troubles people so fine be troubled if they if someone's upset by that which is not going to be a bit um but where was i going with this um i think there will be a lot of people who god welcomes into his kingdom who are utterly surprised by the whole affair and sam harris sam harris in the in the talks basically says you know i'm going to hell and i'm thinking oh i don't know sam you know i i'm let's and i know a lot of christians would be really upset hearing me say that but i i say that and i can defend that theologically by saying no human being in this world has the right to designate that for any other human being right god's job yes why play that well i i i've uh i've imbibed enough christianity to know that that's what you're going to say but it's not your job no um and so why not act as if and there's actually a christianity foreign minister that was writing about that why don't you act as if everyone is saved and i i remember talking to my father about that book that this guy read because my father is also a pastor my father said you know we have that's what we all kind of do when i meet with someone i don't think oh they're going to hell i'm not going to pay any attention to them but you know now after jordan peterson all of that stuff digs down because in a sense if you don't have time for someone you are acting as if they are going to hell and c.s lewis actually writes about that and so the opposite of that is you should have time for everyone and jordan peterson when i when he was here in sacramento that was the most remarkable thing i saw in that he just had a little bit of time because we're all limited in time and space in that little time he paid attention i thought wow i am a i am a lousy christ follower because that expression of christ following that jordan peterson was doing right there better than me baby yeah better than me too by miles i like i said was trying to settle the baby and thinking about wanting to be on twitter or something like i did the personality quiz and i came back like one percent once percentile on um compassion and also first percentile on agreeableness you would fit in my meetup i got a whole crew of disagreeables yes i think that's it i think there's something about i don't know maybe claire layman would know about this i should ask her but about um disagreeables and at least classical liberalism there all it strikes me as the the politics of the disagreeable um just you know something gets too much and you have to believe it you just no no and that's that's kind of what made me read all these books and change my world view um that's yeah something's been nagging away in the back of my mind since you said it about half an hour ago so i want to ask you before we wrap up if we have to wrap up soon but you mentioned the thing about calvin and paying uh taking out a loan with interest yeah because that's the kind of thing that happens to me when i read the bible is a lot of the time i'm like oh that's interesting or you know sometimes that's boring or i don't know why all these cities are mentioned i don't know them that's that's a thought that comes up a lot but there'll be one sometimes there'll be some a statement that's as clear as day and i'm like that's incorrect like an example that would be something like not taking out loans with interest because i know enough economics to know why there is interest it's because in order to persuade someone especially given that there's a risk that they won't pay it back and that if they do pay it back it won't be for a year or whatever like so if you're reading do you if you think something is wrong you might be wrong but maybe you're not maybe you're right what do you do about that see i i don't have these i don't read the bible that way okay and and that's that's i guess partly why i get frustrated with not only sam but all of these people on the stage because they're talking about how christians read the bible and i think yeah i've never read the bible that way i could understand why um you know and again this is this is what i do for a living well don't when jesus says if someone asks you for for a cloak you know give it to them and give them something else too well what's going on there well you're living so do you mind if i take this call oh yeah go ahead i'll be right back okay hey how's it going that was probably your wife you're ordering dinner yes exactly that's lunchtime here lunchtime yeah yeah no so so where were you so you don't read the bible as if you know you see a sentence and then because jesus said the thing about giving the cloak there's an assumption that i find in people that that they think what the bible fundamentally is is a list of of things telling us what to do yeah do this don't do that if you read enough of the bible and you read it carefully you begin to realize there's all kinds of places in the bible where people are you know in fact in the book of proverbs there are two proverbs right next to each other that say exactly opposite things okay now if we were meant to read the bible as a whole list of prescriptions why would the editors put those two things next to each other you know we know enough and and we ought to be able to figure out that you know if someone is out there on the curb freezing to death give them a coat yeah it's not hard yeah but we should also know well enough that by the time you get to the end of the mercantile period and you know at the end of the you know the transition from medieval europe to early modern europe that people there's excess money around and people want to do things with it and john calvin looks around and says if you read the bible they're talking about give the guy a coat this is a different situation now that's so the bible is by no means in my mind a list of things telling us what to do okay it's a very different book yeah and do you think maybe the contradictions that i suppose if you want to call them that are a feature and not a bug absolutely because i that's kind of what i'm thinking lately as well oh i i think absolutely and i don't think you could write a like a legalistic document that's like do this and do that that didn't you know start to leak out the out of the exceptions or the amazing thing about the bible is not that oh think about it this way i often use this illustration jesus jesus heals a bunch of people right okay yeah i have no problem with that jesus heals a bunch of people someone would say you know if jesus really wanted to help people he would have given them the formula for penicillin you know introduce antibiotics in the first century yeah it's this deos ex machina thing that really doesn't work in the bible because they say well why wouldn't jesus give them penicillin and you start thinking that through and then you start asking questions well what are the miracles really about and that's when the bible starts getting helpful okay and the difficulty is and this is why it's hard to learn the bible without a church really smart people wind up doing it but the bible is something that has to be practiced and and it's not the kind of thing where if you if you invest in these kind of stocks you'll grow rich that's not the kind of information the bible gives because that's not the game we're playing yet so it's you know i i know i try to think of what productive things i could do with my channel you know i want to help people read the bible better but there's a lot of good stuff out there to help people read the bible the bible is tremendously difficult yeah it's really hard like i'm just getting it right isn't the game either yeah well i don't think i could well and and then the point is christianity is a faith to be lived not a faith to be just thought about yeah so and and so another thing i'd introduce when i mean i've been all these debates about slavery and what's in the bible say hey let's make it real simple jesus does love the lord your god with all your hearts hold mine and strength and love your neighbor and stuff well i say well i'm a little wobbly on the god part okay then start with your neighbor yeah then it's exactly where we started talking about your daughter it's like i love my daughter like crazy there's nothing i wouldn't do for her but gosh let me sleep yeah that's it it's a human condition this is this is where we are yeah so i don't know if you gotta go now you gotta get you gotta you gotta go get my wife soon yeah and and the baby she's probably asleep right now because she'll be in the stroller but she'll be awake as soon as we try to eat lunch well i you know i i i am just you know there are days that i think what am i doing making all these videos about jordan i know it's great i'd be out of my mind but then i have a conversation with you and i think oh no this is exactly what i need to be doing now this is the stuff like once you i think you had it like six months ago people getting tired of jordan peterson or if like pete pete or you know yeah how much can one person teach you a lot but at some point it stops or it's diminishing returns and i think you're one of the good channels that people can go to next um i mean to me it's not what jordan peterson teaches i'm still learning a ton from him but again he's kind of the wick of the candle and we're all kind of finding each other through this and really having amazing conversations so yeah i agree it was a pleasure meeting you paul it's a pleasure meeting i'll send you the uh i'll send you the recording and you can decide show to your wife you can decide what you want to do with it okay i confess to some crimes from back in the day lovely to be making about it likewise say hello to your wife and daughter from me i will do thank you have a great day bye
