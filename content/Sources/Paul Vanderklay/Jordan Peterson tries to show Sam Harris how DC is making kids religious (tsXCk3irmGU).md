 Hi, this is Paul and I'm continuing my conversation Basically about God and ontology and what is reality Jonathan Peugeot was making some videos now to discussing similar things he had Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy and and I might be coming at this from a little different Way than he is we're planning to have a conversation later this month Jonathan and I about this So we're we're both kind of ramping up and making some videos for it I'm following the the video that I made on God number one and God number two now. Those aren't different gods Those are two different definitions of God and I'm following the the tweet Esther O'Reilly wrote that piece same Harris asks questions Jordan Peterson can't answer and Peterson tweeted that article and said it's a good article and it is a good article and Then Gordy Allen said great read instead of belief or non-belief now the conversations moved on to a much more interesting question what do we mean when you say God and and I see the conversation between Peterson and Harris as as Improving the conversation and bringing us to not only more interesting quick questions, but better defined questions And and I think we're asking more intelligent questions For example is is Mickey Mouse real and I'm using Mickey Mouse because Mickey Mouse isn't in public domain And most of us know why because the Disney Corporation Finds Mickey Mouse real enough to spend a considerable amount of money keeping Mickey Mouse out of public domain Our super our comic superheroes real and again same point Marvel is going to want to keep Iron Man and its whole cast of superheroes in Under their protection and within their intellectual property rights for as long as they can Because they are very real indeed for the Marvel Corporation Which now is the Marvel movies are made of course by the Disney Corporation and so we might ask is the Disney Corporation real? Well, what do we mean when we talk about God? Well, what did the ancients believe when they talked about a son of God or a son of God now? Some of you who saw my Sunday school class two weeks ago Noted that I got into that in my Sunday school class and I do want to revisit that someone left a comment that Or sent me a tweet that I should really do a shorter video on this channel on that and and I'm thinking about it because Actually, if you've been listening to Peterson and you're understanding the way that he's addressing these questions You can begin to see how these questions are important and how they impact our lives Now again if you go all the way back to the Jordan Peterson Conversation he begins maps of meaning by saying there are two ways you can map out reality Okay, something is real if you can locate it in three dimensions in physical space These are objects in space and I've been repeated this quite a bit through my videos Peterson says something is also real if it impacts human behavior and I'll often use the example of a marriage is a marriage real Now a marriage might be might be born witness to buy a piece of paper But the piece of paper itself isn't the marriage the marriage is a relationship Now a marriage is not an object in space but relationships are very real and they're very strong and they determine our behavior to a To a huge degree if you walk away from your spouse and you say I'm not married or I don't want to be married anymore These kinds of words govern history to a tremendous amount They have a great deal of power and this is part of what Peterson is saying, you know This is a forum for action. So a marriage is real in a way that Goes through time and space to a great degree the marriages of Henry the eighth Governed and colonized history the history of of England for a long long time now Would you say that marriage is not real or your marriage is not real or your parents marriage was not real or Henry the eighth marriage Marriages or or deals regarding marriage were not real. They were very real indeed They were very powerful and they governed human history and have changed history to a tremendous degree even though you cannot find Henry the eighth's marriage as an object in space It is nevertheless real and this gets into some of what Peterson talks about with this Jungian statement that that perhaps we don't have ideas but ideas have us these these ideas these Non-material realities are powerful indeed And they govern this world to a tremendous degree now Harris wants to just dispel a lot of this and say this isn't real Well is Harris's marriage real? I would dare bet his marriage is very real even though he can't identify it as an object in space that non that non object reality governs Their behaviors so now we get into Santa Claus Mickey Mouse Iron Man, are they real? Well, how is their reality different from let's say Jordan Peterson's reality? Well, they're they're real enough to change Behavior, but we would rightly say Jordan Peterson is real in a different way than Santa Claus Mickey Mouse and Iron Man are real but but in Illuminating and elucidating the ways that they are different is not terribly easy because part of the reality and John Jonathan Peugeot gets into this to a certain degree in his video the image we have in our mind of Jordan Peterson What is the relationship between that representation and? Jordan Peterson himself. What is the relationship between Jordan Peterson located in time and space? Let's say here in in early August 2018 and the Jordan Peterson that was making videos at Harvard a while ago or the Jordan Peterson a few years ago Before he took his his status rocket ride. So is Jordan Peterson a process is to what degree is that Jordan Peterson the the actor in history more real than the physical Manifestation or the Jordan Peterson that appears on our Cellphones and computer screens as a YouTube representation or the Jordan Peterson that authors this book 12 rules for life What kind of power does Mickey Mouse have compared with Jordan Peterson? Now that is not a simple question to answer Does Mickey Mouse or Jordan Peterson have more power in terms of the Congress of the United States Who has more lawyers? Well, you might say well the Disney Corporation Is more real than Mickey Mouse and the Disney Corporation's Corporation governs Mickey Mouse, but that just pushes the question back because Jordan Peterson's reality is Different from the Walt Disney corporate the Disney Corporation's reality to the Disney Corporation is not the same as a person But he's a corporation and so we get back to Mitt Romney corporations are people too well But they're special kinds of people and they're different kinds of people. So again, you can begin to see why this fundamental assumption that reality is primarily objects in space Really doesn't govern that much you cannot Locate the Disney Corporation as an object in space, but it has agency it has tremendous power Does it have personhood? Well, it kind of acts like a person because it colonizes Mickey Mouse and and determines that representation So so where is their power located? How is their power manifest? Do they have power or is their power colonized by persons? the Disney Corporation has a chief executive officer the Disney Corporation has a board of trustees and That board of trustees has a process by which they act something like persons they make decisions They affect decisions and these decisions have impact on people all over the world Now their CEO has is a person more in the way that Jordan Peterson is but even then When we begin to look at how they behave and the kinds of power they have you you you realize that Personhood with respect to being a legal agent is also itself a complicated situation this this conversation we're having about God isn't real because he's not Something that I can take a ladder up to and put my hand around like I could put my hand around Jordan Peterson's wrist wrist is a is a rather simplistic Conversation because even if when I shook hands with Jordan Peterson I was holding his hand and shaking his hand and there was a reality to it and I could have you know I could have pulled his arm or punched him in the nose or but but the greater reality the realities that we would have been most Interested in wouldn't actually have been our bodies even though our bodies would have been engaged the if I had hit him in the face with a pie or Punched him in the nose actually the most interesting realities would have been the relational realities and the actor realities and these realities in fact would have governed a whole bunch of things if I had punched him in a note in the nose he could have called the Sacramento police and had me placed under arrest for assaulting him and On and on and on and so you very much begin to see that Form for action and these realities of actors is in many ways the governing reality That in fact governs colonizes the this meat space this these these material creatures that we are And and these relationships are complex But again moving the conversation beyond or reality or objects in space and because we cannot find a God You know therefore there is no God and I think Peterson rightly says This is this is the thinking of a you know of a 13 year old Who who hasn't thought much about these realities? within which we all live and again Peterson talks about hierarchies and status and how our psychology and our brain chemistry is deeply attuned to Hierarchies and realities in fact all most all of the social war conversations that we're having right now is about realities pat patriarchy are is there something in terms of maleness and femaleness that makes them asymmetrical or Equality and so I mean almost all of our conversations right now are dealing with Relationships they're not they're not so much dealing with these Material objects even though these material objects are obviously also deeply ingrained in the picture if if I decide to plagiarize Mickey Mouse and If I do so in a determined fashion and if I refuse to pay the fines that the courts will levy against me They will take possession of my material person and put me in prison I'm currently sitting within a a locked building am I in prison well again It's all of the realities and all of the social relationships that actually differentiate this church building that's sitting on a particular corner in Sacramento California and another building closer to downtown that is also sitting in a corner But there are guards and laws that keep that those doors locked and here I have the keys and freely let myself in and out of this building so again as you see Simply reducing all of this to the material is an extremely simplistic thing and so that the better Conversation we should have is what do we mean by gods? Well? What do we mean by reality? What do we mean by characters? What do we mean by agency? Now in previous video I talked about God number one and God number two now I'm not saying that these are two different gods I'm saying that these are two ideas about God and two notions about God now Christianity I believe the Christian God is Both God one and God two integrated into this is one God now there now God number one has the kind of power like Mickey Mouse to a certain degree and And this is exactly the point that Peterson has been making this Character that we call God Governs reality and in fact the governance of reality of this character called God is a big part of what Sam Harris is protesting the Disney Corporation is sort of like the church and that the Disney corporations governs Mickey Mouse and its its priests are the writers and the and the the graphic designers and the Storytellers and the marketers these are all the priests that govern the God Mickey Mouse Now tell Disney stockholders that Mickey Mouse doesn't exist and in fact they will get very angry And they'll say no Mickey Mouse is the reason I buy Disney stock and the reason I hold on to Disney stock and the reason every time Congress You know every time Mickey Mouse seems to be threatened to be pulled out of you know pulled into public domain There's a huge amount of power that is governing the status of Mickey Mouse And this is not unlike what Jordan Peterson is trying to reveal about God number one And this is part of what Sam Harris is protesting But a big part of Jordan Peterson's point is that Sam Harris's imagination that you can simply get rid of this Isn't that much different from imagining you can just get rid of Mickey Mouse There are vested interests that very much are determined to keep to keep Mickey Mouse the The property of the Disney corporation now you might say ah but God number two if you pray to Mickey He won't answer you well now we're talking about personhood Well if you pray to Mickey and in fact if enough people start praying to Mickey the Disney corporation might in fact pay attention And the Disney corporation may in fact answer some of the prayers that that you are praying to Mickey if the Disney Corporation finds out the kinds of prayers that they are praying to Mickey and the Disney corporation Determines that's in that it's in their corporate best interest and it's in their financial best interest to maybe through the Make-A-Wish Foundation Mickey Mouse will fly into a representation of Mickey Mouse will fly into a Child's hospital room and shake Mickey's hand now you're not gonna find Mickey Mouse showing up at a rival theme park He's not gonna show up at Six Flags. Why not? Well, there's a lot going on here and so Sam Harris says yeah, but you know we're playing games with this God idea Are we no we're I think we're I think what Peterson is doing is forcing the conversation into Really getting down with what do we mean when we say God there are various aspects to this Now I'm gonna bring in another another situation in this there's Phil Vischer who was the creator of Bob and Larry Larry the cucumber and Bob the tomato and and if you want a good book to read about what happened to Veggie Tales You can read Phil Vischer's me myself and Bob where he talks about now he writes it as a Christian and Phil Vischer very much saw his engagement with these fictitious characters of Bob and Larry very much in Relationship to this God that he has and that's very strongly a God number two approach Phil Vischer is pretty solid evangelical credentials And as I mentioned in my previous video a lot of this transition between God number one and God number two happened in the 70s the rise of evangelicalism This I think is a result of what had been happening in the church in terms of the mainline church in many respects The mainline churches is more deeply invested in God number one and the evangelical church is more deeply invested in God number two And it doesn't again. I don't think it's a it's a coincidence That Peterson was raised in some ways with a little bit of the context of God number one around him Now what's the relationship between Phil Vischer and Bob the tomato? Well, why was it so devastating for Phil Vischer to lose Bob the tomato in bankruptcy court? You might say well, well, that's a funny thing Well, Bob the tomato is now governed by a different corporation and Bob the tomato is no longer In a sense governed by Phil Vischer now Phil Vischer might still do voiceover work But the scripts are being written by someone else and even if that corporation Decided they wanted Phil Vischer to write the scripts about Bob the tomato all of those scripts would have to be approved by the Corporation because Bob the tomato is owned by a different corporation and no longer the property of Phil Vischer Why because Phil Vischer didn't get particularly good legal advice when he was going up his status rocket and when he wasn't able to successfully negotiate the transition from VHS to DVD to online And they tried to expand to meet the anticipated VHS and DVD demand they and if they went bankrupt they overextended the movie cost too much and again It's a very interesting story. Well, what are the connections between Phil Vischer and Bob the tomato? Well, these are some very real connections and these connections are in fact legally recognized and and I don't think anyone out there Would demand that these connections no longer be legally recognized Now you might say well, I think of God number one as energy or a field Well, well see us Lewis shines a good light on that in his book miracles because this is a common thing But you don't really get away from the questions by saying well God is a force or God is an energy or God is the sum of all things And I'm reading from see us Lucy's book miracles at this stage I must turn aside to deal with a rather simple-minded Illusion when we point out that what Christians mean is not to be identified with their mental pictures Some people say in that case would it not be better to get rid of the mental pictures and of the language which suggests them? Altogether, but this is impossible People who recommend it have not noticed that when they try to get rid of manlike or as we call them anthropomorphic images They merely they merely succeed in substituting other kinds Images of other kinds. I don't believe in a personal God says one I do believe in a great spiritual force What he has not noticed is that the word force has let in all sorts of images about winds and tides and electricity and gravitation I don't believe in a personal God says another but I do believe we are all parts of one great being capital B Interesting which move with which moves and works through us all not noticing that he has merely exchanged the image of a fatherly and royal looking man for the image of some widely extended gas or fluid a Girl I knew was brought up by higher thinking parents in regard to God as a perfect substance in latter life She realized that this had actually led her to think of him as something like a vast tapioca Tapioca pudding to make matters worse. She she disliked tapioca We may feel ourselves quite safe from this degree of absurdity But we are mistaken if a man watches his mind I believe he will find what what professes to be specifically advanced or Philosophic conceptions of God are in his thinking always accompanied by vague images Which if inspected would turn out to be even more absurd than the manlike images aroused by Christian aroused by Christian theology and this is part of Peterson's point in his biblical series where he says You know to think about God as a father or God as a king Actually makes a whole lot more sense than that keeping trying to turn God into energy or turn God into a force because how this how this is this being is Working in our midst has much more to do it. In fact, it has connections with these human relationships back to CS Lewis For man after all is the highest of things we meet in a sensuous experience He has at least now man. He doesn't mean by male CS Lewis is writing before we have this gender inclusive language trend in writing and Man was understood to be male and female in the English language He has at least conquered the globe honored though not followed virtue achieved knowledge made poetry music and art If God exists at all it is not unreasonable to suppose that we are less unlike him than anything else we know What he means by that is Would God be more like energy or would God be more like us now? In fact you look at Mythology all over the world and you will often find well Thor we kind of looks like us Aphrodite she looks like us the Hindu gods they look like us Well, what's going on? Oh Lewis and Peterson are in sense making the same point that you know This this business about force and energy. That's you're really not thinking this thing through No doubt we are unspeakably different from him and to that extent all manlike images are false and again, this is me again when you contemplate for example the Ten Commandments where God says don't make an image of anything around you like me and You think that through? That's a tremendously brilliant thing because the problem we have is that once we start imagining God in a certain way whether it be like electricity or Tapioca or a force wind or gas or or something like that well, those images tend to bleed into our minds and it's for this reason that People look at the Bible say well, I can't believe that it's it's it's actually a stroke of incredible genius for the Hebrew God to say to them Do this unlike every other nation, you know and in fact this becomes a chief struggle throughout the history of the Old Testament because they they want to turn him into a golden calf Well, why a golden calf? Well actually if you think about Sacrifice and what cows how cows have functioned throughout the history of the world where we've had domesticated cattle Cows are one of the safest investments you can make for your money and And so then if you think about sacrifice and cows Well a golden cow is not an absurd attempt to represent God but God the Lord comes along to to the Hebrews as the story says and says don't represent me as anything in your world and I often use the illustration if you are a tremendous maker of pies You wouldn't want to be represented by a pie because you are the maker of the pie and you don't want people Confusing you between that which you make and that which you are So again back to Lewis no doubt we are unspeakably different from him and to that extent all I Just looked at my phone to see if I got a text from my wife I'll start again No doubt we are unspeakably different from him to that extent all man-made images are false but those images of shapeless mists and irrational forces which unacknowledged haunt the mind when we think we are rising to the conception of impersonal and absolute being Must be very much more so for the images of one kind or the other will come We cannot jump off our own shadow And so Lewis is basically saying this this this modern conception of trying to get away from an anthropomorphic image Really doesn't make much sense and I would assert that it's probably betraying something It's probably betraying we are we have motivation for that and this gets back into if you've been listening to my videos This idea of Colonization that I picked up from Lewis and miracles that in fact we Colonize the wind we colonize the waters we bottle gas we employ all of this and again if you look at movies that like to trade in Pantheistic conceptions of God pay attention in those movies and how often you will notice that the personal agent attempts to employ the impersonal deity For the purposes of that personal agent use the force Luke to destroy the Death Star We're the the god of the world of avatar is fighting for us Use the god to get what we want now. In fact, if you listen to my sermon Sunday there's a deep sense of consumerism implicit within polytheism as practiced in paganism because if Your god can be employed who finally is God and that would be yourself and this Christianity I believe exposes because Christianity essentially says We are in a power struggle with God. We wish to be gods of the universe we wish to be the god of the universe and the biggest problem that we have with Supposing that that position is already taken is that we don't have sufficient power to do so So let's talk about the power of God and I put God in quotes here because again, I'm continuing to work Jordan Peterson's Project from below about trying to understand this God Sam Harris is objecting to the kind of power that God has similar to Mickey Now this is probably something that Harris will as Brett Weinstein did in the first two lectures they will they will cave in and Brett Weinstein doesn't necessarily have a Have a problem with Jordan Peterson's God and he can understand how such a God could govern in fact how such a God could govern our behavior and in fact how prayers would and I'll put work in Because if you go back to my Hezekiah sermon It's the specific type of Situation that Harris is really is really Protesting now it would be very it would be interesting to see if Harris has as much problem with Luke Skywalker Saying use the force or Obi-Wan saying to Luke Skywalker use the force Because in a sense God one is much more like the force because many who look at God one say well this God doesn't have to Be personal this God doesn't have to have the kind of agency that all of us imagine human beings including Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris and Paul Vanderklaai as having God's power is colonized by preachers parents and influencers Now let's use a sexual more a that at this point is is nearly Uncontested and it seems like it's getting more and more difficult to find sexual more right well I think that's actually not true. I think as you can see in the university conversations about date rape that There's there's in a sense when we change the rules we always change them in the other side To to try to compensate because we say well You don't need well. We'll say it's it's not immoral for unmarried people to have sex well, okay So then we'll say well, it's not a more awful unmarried people to have sex if they consent Okay But now you throw alcohol into the midst and suddenly How clear must the consent be? Well also so then universities were teaching students you must have verbal consent before passing to the next Degree now as you begin to pull this apart you begin to realize well What really is the next degree? Be circumsex circumspect for younger ears that might be listening to my videos We'll have first base second base third base and a home run Well are all of us in agreement over. What is the difference between first and second base? There's a classic moment in many relationships when one person says to the other person I Love you, and we all know There's no Physicality to those words, but we all know those words are powerful and those words those words have power and and those words have power to govern and those words are Relational and they have power to govern But they are not the matter the matter of one hand or one part of one person's body Making contact with another person's body and in fact when you get into this entire area You begin to realize that the entire debate over appropriate sexuality is all relational Because it's not just about well bodies are considered But it's also about what are the relationship between the two persons and so again when we talk about marriage well Marriage is governing is a relational situation governing other Relationships actions and in fact physical persons on down below it and and so in that sense Marriage is kind of like God one God number one so Here's an example of a sexual more or a taboo you'd better not Same-sex siblings had better not have sex well. What do you mean by sex well? well, let's say we all know what we mean by sex now the fear of opposite sex siblings having intercourse as as for a long time been Been pregnancy now Jonathan Jonathan height works on this well There's my wife. I guess you just gonna say did you just you didn't actually see it because I paused the video But my marriage governed my fingers and those fingers governed this computer and my eyes My wife just said she's eating chocolate for dinner. I better get home You could see how this relational world governs things okay and much more than say even the objective world the relational world colonizes and governs So let's say imagine same-sex siblings Is it wrong for same-sex siblings to have? Sex let's say and and obviously they're not going to have male-female That could produce a child But I won't go into all of the variety of things that we designate under this term sex between same-sex Persons, where is the harm now you might say well? There's psychological harm well, okay Where does that psychological harm come from is it from a taboo that? that somehow in ways we Sort of know but haven't talked about because you almost never talked about this kind of thing Because everyone thinks it's wrong if you learn that everyone thinks it's wrong Then you'll feel bad about yourself and so on and so forth so what's governing and you might say well well Siblings have evolved Not to do this okay, why have there been persons involved in this in this choice has there been the Storyverse getting getting built into by hierarchies and all the things that Peterson talks about Has that been built into all of this and so again from a Petersonian perspective? You might say well Let's call all of this stuff that has developed around all of these ideas And that in fact governs all of this behavior. Let's call that God Now this isn't the kind of God that you will point to in the sky but let's say that God is best represented as a Judgmental father who says to his boys or his girls Don't have sex with each other if you do I'll punish you and when they see them as little children They'll give them a stern look or slap a hand away or something like that from a very early stage on and then this Families that don't do this, you know, however story you want to put in this But again Peterson says this all gets built into God now We'll get to Sam Harris's of Harris's objections to that later, but here's the problem that Sam Harris has there's no clean room Sam Harris might in his mind say we can get rid of all of these stories, but There that's just simply a figment of your imagination. You might imagine a wand out of Harry Potter Getting rid of all of the supernatural tendencies getting rid of Verizon Lisa who imagines the universe is talking to him this this Religious nature has been around us and those who say well, we don't need it anymore Why do you think that can you demonstrate that can you demonstrate that? Scientifically, can you demonstrate that rationally and I would argue you're a long long ways from it. It's mostly assertion Is having sex with your same-sex sibling harmful only because of the history of moral condemnation That history is like Santa or Mickey Mouse. It is it is in the society Do you want to get rid of it? Do you think maybe we'd be healthier? So why don't you go ahead and have a bunch of children and raise them on an island or Apart from all other human beings and and maybe feed the children more and encourage them to have sexual Thing do sexual things with each other from a very young age and grow them up. But here's the problem You haven't been raised in that clean room either and in fact your desire to bring to have all these children on an island and raise Them with this new society is already tainted by the ideas that you brought to the island in other words Everybody's got a belly button everybody you start from a story and We have almost no idea the consequences of the quote-unquote God That we've been immersed in and that has been forming our society with all of its particularities and and so to to simply at this point just Wipe away and say all of this is wrong is quite frankly in my opinion simply naive Jordan Peterson makes the point that these moral histories are cumulative powers represented in stories that have real power Psychologically and in fact just as a cat jumps away from a cucumber and Monkeys are terrified of snakes even if the monkey has never seen a snake We don't know how much has been imprinted hardwired into us from birth This is Peterson's point and he makes it over and over again. And so when he keeps telling Sam Harris This imagination you can that you can simply wipe this away is Naive because even if you wanted to run a grand experiment off Let's okay move everyone off Australia Australia's been the or let's say Tanzania or Madagascar or find an island and and and run your test Even setting up the test has all of the power to do that Even setting up the test has all of this built into it you have no clean room in fact, even if you could take the take the the the memory wiping stick from men in black or Persons in black if we were to remake the movie Well It's built into the DNA wipe the memory of an ape Wipe won't you put that snake into the cage of a chimp that has never seen a snake? Bang it reacts you slide that cucumber next to that cat who has never seen a snake bang. It reacts We don't know what's built in and you might say well, you're a pastor telling me this This isn't from church. This is from Darwin. This is from science This is why Peterson is is rocking these cages and and again Peterson isn't saying stuff that's debated this is just given and So you're just going to disavow us of this. Are you going to talk the monkeys out of being afraid of snakes? Are you going to talk the cats out of being afraid of cucumbers? Because here's the thing. I Think it was big oh Chris says a dog has about as many neurons as a human being has in their gut We don't know what all is built into us now put on my religious hat. Do I have a hat? Well, I guess I have my River cats hat Well, guess what? Theologians have been saying for a long time God has built into us st. Augustine. Nothing can satisfy one who would not be satisfied with God John Calvin, what does John Calvin say? Well, John Calvin says the census divinitatis. That's Latin This is built into us. He can't see my eyes when I wear a cap So same-sex siblings having sex they feel guilty or maybe they don't or Is that put on to them or shouldn't they be doing it? What is the harm? Here's the problem we don't know now Just recently this just came out August 1 Pew who does a lot of studies this study why Americans go to church or stay home Number two reason number one reason 81% of Americans who go to church or other religious services say Very important reason for attending is to become closer to God. Well, that's interesting. It's obviously pretty psychological second reason 69% say so children will have a moral foundation Now this has got to drive Sam Harris nuts because Sam Harris and the other Celebrity atheists have been saying You know this this is doing moral damage to children. Well, here's the difficulty How much do we know about the damage this has been practiced now for thousands of years and Parents and I talked to many people who say I went to chill I went to church as a kid my parents sent me there They didn't even go with me now do studies with psychologists and they'll tell you When whole families went to church together it tended to stick more with the kids when the kids just went alone Didn't quite stick as much and so actually the the bigger determiner of whether or not your children are going to practice religion is Whether the parents continue to practice religion why? Because what we do is more important and in fact imprints more deeply into our children than the words We say now, why would that be? Well Peterson says we're watching each other Well, what happens when we're watching each other? well, our conscious mind is about this big but our watchers are there and they're watching and they're imprinting and they're taking it in and Well, we learn this if you're a parent of any kind there's no clean room with parenting and Even those who say they didn't like how their parents parent How do they start the script by taking the parent script and reversing it? In other words, there's no clean room It's for or against but there's a structure. There's something they're working from and this is true about us with nearly about Everything and this is one of the things that the psychologist began to realize and why the psychologist will sit down and listen to you talk and At some point it's gonna come back to childhood because you were deeply formed before you had any Any idea that you was a you and in fact this goes back generations the decisions made by your Ancestors have governed you in ways that you don't even know So So last night we had our Jordan Peterson meetup and we had the biggest meetup ever we had 25 People show up. These are those willing to have their picture taken Some don't like to have their picture taken some don't want to be associated with this So I always say if you're willing like to have your picture taken they do so we had our Jordan Peterson meetup and it was very interesting because on the after I had We had the meetup on Sun. This is our weekend once a month weekend Sunday We have a week midweek Sunday once a month a midweek meeting too once a month but on Saturday I had gone to a bar mitzvah of Of a student my wife is a school teacher in her class Had his bar mitzvah and I was talking to another parent and the parent was reflecting on his own childhood how This person wasn't raised with any religion at all And he was quite impressed by the ceremony of the bar mitzvah and seeing the generations of people in the formation of a child and seeing the values and all of that built in and expressed through the ceremony and this parent said I I wonder if I've missed out on something. I wonder if I've missed out on giving my children something and One of the things that people say well churches are full of old people Now part of this is in fact because of the curve of religiosity that's going on through American culture and American church attendance reached its peak during the Cold War as I've mentioned in many movies but a large part of this is because people when they get into their 60s and 70s start to think about this more deeply and they begin to appreciate the fact how we Are formed how we are constructed and begin to appreciate the fact that We are making decisions based on what feels good at the moment or the older you get you begin to make decisions based on I've got more experience and the older you get and the more you begin to remember past generations you start realizing that You really want a far larger timeframe from which to gather your experiences and information and data in order to make better decisions One person in fact came to the meeting and was talking about the fact that She noticed a grandson had zero religious formation and she said something the fact that I need a mythology I don't even care that it's real and many people are recognizing now that this lack of a religious system that they were raised in has Not afforded them a framework from which to actually engage the larger questions of life Now you can read books So I cleaned my office my office is clean But you can read books from Houston Smith about Islam or from Karen Armstrong about the Buddha and you can learn these things but That's a different thing from being in it and Peterson rightly says now growing up a Buddhist and in Japan is a very different thing and last night actually there were there are a couple of individuals who grew up in the Middle East one grew up in an Islamic society and another grew up in a in a an orthodox Christian group within an Islamic society and and It's fascinating talking to both of those individuals because you very quickly realize that Our view of religion in the West is Western and the rest of the world doesn't see any of this this way and all of this imagined Objectivity that we bring to these conversations and rationality this is intensely constructed from where we grew up and And again this this leads me to think that so often some people These conversations are just incredibly naive the idea that you can choose your religion a number of these individuals They just laugh at that say you you're not choosing anything It's your it's already baked into you man It was baked it got started being baked into you by the choices of your parents and the decisions of your Ancestors your parents your great-grandparents your great-great-grandparents all of these are baked into you All of the decisions that they made so You're playing with words And so now Americans are are feeling I need to have something and I don't know what to think about it And I'm trying to work it through and in walks Jordan Peterson and lights start going on and they start saying I Want to talk to someone that has a different experience. I want to talk to someone that knows something. I need to figure this out Well, how do you make it real well some people say How do you make it real well Santa and the Tooth Fairy gets made real by the parents behaviors Mickey is made real by Disney lawyers Mickey can take your money and your freedom Parents and the church make God real because it educates the kids into the stream of civilization and that's probably at heart of Peterson's point, but now Peterson doesn't go to church and Will he go to church? Peterson is in a sense saying again to the dismay of Dillahunty and Harris You're Christian and if you talk to the folks from the Middle East they'll say duh Yeah, but you're Western Christian and that's a very different thing from Eastern Christian or Muslim or Eastern Buddhist or Eastern Hindu you don't just choose to be a Buddhist Like someone who grew up in Japan or China That's not how it works just like if you grew up in the middle of the Islamic world You'll be very different and now Harris wants to rail against that and it's like, all right Rail against gravity. What are you gonna do kill them all find your clean room? It doesn't seem to me to be a very productive way of approaching people So we don't need these made-up stories Really? How are you gonna stop it? Do you know which stories to stop now when the when these are finally? Released you'll hear Sam Harris talk about his daughters now I'm not saying anything about his daughters are gonna teach treat his daughters in an abstract way, but little girls dressing up as that girl or batwoman or a wonder woman That girl or batwoman or a wonder woman Well, their gods are real enough to impact their behavior probably in ways We don't understand that we might say well, these aren't these aren't really gods Or are they well, what is a god is Mickey Mouse a god? is Santa a god is Thor a god is Wonder Woman Diana is She a god. Well, what is a god? That's the conversation we're having and and we're noticing that in some ways Mickey Mouse and Bob Tomato are sort of like God aspect one that Jordan Peterson is talking about But so is and Peterson pursues us a bit in the conversation So are these and Sam Harris might say well, I'm not raising my daughters to become religious Well, I think you're gonna have to be more careful Well, what are the cultural priests doing to these girls? Why all the excitement about strong female characters now? one of the things that I've noticed is that in all of this the priests of the gods that are Wonder Woman or batgirl or Superman or Thor or Ironman or Mickey Mouse or Bob the Tomato or any of these characters that these children are playing These characters are being created by the priests as it were and they are forming the children and nobody will disagree with that Even the secularists say well, we need more strong female. We need better Representation in movies because we know this is imprinting on the young We're not playing religious games with this. This to me is completely religious It's not really a lot different from parents Different from parents sending their kids to school and in fact the religious communities for years have been Ringing their hands about these things and asking questions. Should we let our children go see Harry Potter? Well, there's magic and Narnia too should we let our kids well Tolkien was a Christian So Tolkien and Lewis tend to get a pass Harry Potter not always so much Star Wars not always so much Christians have been dealing with this and a lot of other Christians have been saying we don't want our children seeing these Disney movies Well now the left which has gotten very religious is saying well these Disney princesses are bad We don't want our little girls dressing up like princesses. This is all Religion this is the same thing. This is not very much different from church and Part of what's interesting about this conversation is that these strong female role models tend to be masculine Wonder Woman fights and beats men at a rather masculine approach to negotiation Women have used feminine approaches to negotiation which tend to be Asymmetrical and I'll often make the case who is stronger a beautiful woman or a strong man My argument is a beautiful woman using feminine strength is far stronger than one strong man because that beautiful woman can colonize the minds of a number of strong men and in fact subdue the one strong man female power is Enormous feminine power is enormous. Why because it colonizes Okay, and again go back to the CS Lewis miracles conversation about colonizing the the beautiful woman with feminine powers Colonizes the man and although he's physically larger and stronger she now employs his strength to her will You can watch last week Sunday school class when I talked about Cupid Well, what is what is happening there? Is it a spirit? Well, that's the way the Greeks talked about it and that in a sense is the way the the second epistle of John talks about So the first epistle John talks about the spirit of Antichrist. Well, what do you mean by there? What about the spirit of love? Well now we're dealing with Anthropology and we're dealing with metaphor and we're dealing with we're dealing with that which government That which governs and again the point Peterson is making is God aspect one governs this world in ways that Sam Harris Simply has no power to dispel in fact Sam Harris can't even keep Religion away from his daughters now Sam Harris looks at that and says my daughter dressing up as Wonder Woman is not religious And I say again, you're naive Is Wonder Woman real? Real enough to have those images and to have those her ethics and to have these ideas Colonize your daughter and the priests of the DC universe Are colonizing your daughter is Wonder Woman real? DC thinks it's real real enough to have lawyers My girls won't don't pray to Wonder Woman Don't pray to Wonder Woman Well, maybe they are now maybe you say well, they'll outgrow that And as a pastor, I have to say really Because what I find is that adults even those who say they don't believe in God They'll talk to the universe about Verizon phones and again This is what people do Oh, but aren't they learning to be like Wonder Woman isn't aren't the qualities the masculine The masculine strength that Wonder Woman exists aren't those qualities Being ranked in your daughter's hierarchies and being baked into her neural pathways To the degree that she is going to be dealing with these her whole life long now You might say well, these are the ones I want. Okay. How do you know that they're good? Well Because here's the funny thing whenever we talk about morality we don't say owning Enslaving people based on the color of their skin is only sometimes good We say it's always wrong and so we are going to condemn george washington and And thomas jefferson for those wrongs Okay But notice what we're doing when we're talking about morality. We're saying it's always wrong. Well, how do you know that? It's always wrong? Well, I know morality well, how do you know morality? You might see my sermon from last sunday because I got into that at that point You're in a sense saying you're going to get outside of time and get outside of context and make a determination about it Well, how what? Clean room now what moral clean room can you stand within? To make your judgment about Wonder Woman and whether or not she's good or she's right Isn't that the point of representation in that entire conversation? Isn't this establishing a moral narrative for the girls to live out their whole life? Now how tested are these gods see now we're getting into Some really deep things because the ideas of or the now we're getting into the word archetype will come up at this point Because these patterns have been going on throughout history using different features We are confident in our tools of science to orient ourselves Really in terms of behavior we're more confident in terms of objects in space But as we saw at the very beginning of this video that the governing sphere seems to be formed for action And our tools of psychology that a lot of people imagine Govern morality which I would assert they don't and go ahead and watch the Sopranos which dealt with this issue These tools are just a few generations old Freud is not that long ago Jung is more recent. He died in the 40s Psychology isn't 200 years old and you're going to base your morality on that What you're probably doing are taking your presuppositions and trying to employ Psychology as Luke tries to use the force in order to get the outcomes you desire But where do those outcomes come from? I made the point in the meetup that I made the point in the meetup that You know listen to Tom Holland and NT Wright in the unbelievable talk about the Moral assumptions of the Roman Empire and Tom Holland who is a historian writing books about the Roman Empire He's aghast at the cruelty of the Roman Empire If you had status as a Roman man, you could have sex with whatever whenever you wanted and I mentioned that You know you mentioned Nero Nero finding a political rival and raping that person in the street As a political act. Do you think sex in prison is all about sex or is it about status and power? Well, and you know, well donald trump and chuck schumer, I won't say what I said at the meetup, but You get the image now today this is unthinkable to us why well Because christianity has been around for 2 000 years and we've got all of this these developed moral ideas that say Persons ought to be respected and so you can have any religion you want as long as it doesn't harm another person But this business about harm gets difficult because again well Is wonder woman harming our young girls our disney princesses Harming our young girls is Mickey Mouse harming our children well the priests of the Disney Corporation are Really the priests So we are confident in our tools of science to orient our behavior. These tools are a few generations old We spent a long time burning fossil fuels before there might be global warming And figuring out what CS CO2 might do in the atmosphere is a whole lot simpler Than figuring out what representation in the media which is also very new is doing to us Jordan peterson's point is that we want to appropriate knowledge on a far larger scale Which is exactly why he looks at mythology and religion because that's where we actually have records kept And that's where we actually look at story and behavior and that's where we actually get a sense of what people not only a few decades or a few hundred years, but a few thousand years ago thought And so in a sense what peterson is trying to do is orient ourselves and he's saying if you orient yourselves over the last couple a hundred years You're really driving blind if you drive in the fog And you can only see five feet ahead of your car and you say I know what's out there You only see five feet and if you're traveling 60 miles an hour and I would argue the pace of change is speeding up We are traveling a hundred mile an hour through 10 foot visibility fog that is how we're navigating but we're doing it We built this car. We really know what we're doing And peterson basically comes along and says I don't think so and Religious people are coming along and saying You have no idea Because we've been telling these stories and having these conversations for hundreds of years And we're we're in the same moment you are But we're also listening to the past in a way that sam harris wants to simply dismiss This Now what if sam's daughter started dressing like elsa? Well, who's elsa? We'll watch the indiana jones movie with the holy grail and elsa is this seductress? that indiana and his father have both Made moves on but she is a nazi spy So how do we evaluate elsa? We have a little image of her here Don't we with a little action figure you start looking at these things and we dress like them You start looking at these things and you start doing a little bit of history and you look at ancient temples and you say We're kind of doing the same thing And this is probably most clear with wonder woman And you look at wonder woman's backstory the story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother queen hipolita and given life by Aphrodite along with supernatural powers as gifts by the greek gods in recent years dc changed her background With the revelation that she's the daughter of zeus and hipolita Why those greek those greek myths sure didn't go very far but What did zeus do? Well zeus didn't act that much different from nero so The greek gods which the greeks with the road which the romans appropriated from the greeks and gave their own little twists Did the stories of zeus impregnating all kinds of women? What does that teach those at the top of the roman hierarchy did they realize they were being taught by this Does sam harris's daughter realize how? Wonder woman or bat girl what she's learning from them? Well, we just brought her up again, didn't we? Well, how tested are these gods? Well again back to peterson. It's a far larger scale Now we look at wonder woman and say Well is is wonder woman? Is wonder woman how does she relate to the beauty myth because she's gorgeous? um, what if wonder woman looked like a bodybuilder instead of a A model Well, nobody would pay to see her well, what's going on? well, why do we all want to see this beautiful woman who's got long flowing hair and stronger than men and fighting for the right and Now This is what we're doing aren't we this is all religious How in charge are we of these characters? In less than a hundred years these characters take on a life of their own Especially once they slip into public domain disney's really trying hard And they're going to try and keep iron man and all these marvel figures now thor's a little harder because Well, but watch is what watch what disney has done didn't disney Look at panocchio. Look at the lion king. Look at sleeping beauty when when disney Took these stories. They took them out of public domain because well, what does peterson say you watched maps of meaning you watched Personalities, these are archetypal stories. What does that mean? It means we're doing religious things all the time Say well not supernatural things. We'll get to we'll get back to god, too. Don't worry And peterson again is just telling sam harris You're you're really not paying attention here sam And you're not even paying attention to your daughters as they get religious right under your nose Well, they're not praying to wonder woman How do you know? What is a prayer? If your daughters get scared do they? I've seen kids do this Do they put on their wonder woman costume? Do they act like they have magic bracelets? And you might say well Why are his daughters acting that way? It's imprinting baby. It's imprinting C.s. Lewis says If you want to be an atheist, you got to be real real careful about what you read and now what you see and What you let your kids see Christians have understood this and again conservative Christians have been the ones that have been most um Careful about what their children see why because religious people have an understanding Even if they can't articulate it very well How this stuff works? Well, we didn't know psychology But long before we had psychology Embedded in religion was an implicit knowledge of all of this wasn't it the monks that said Give me a child until they're six and i'll have them for the rest of their life I think that's the truth The government's figuring this out Less than a hundred years these characters take on a life of their own new writers take the story in a new direction People debate the morality of the old and new stories and we see this all the time We have to we have to have politically correct batman and and go ahead and watch look at older comic books and watch older Superman and wonder woman and and watch how we twist them morally and watch how the new priests update it and and and and well What happens with all this updating? Well, this is Not in some ways different from many of the things that you Conversations that you read in the bible now again, there's a lot of misconception from people about what's in the bible Well, I thought I think the bible is a book of rules telling us how to behave. No hardly at all There are rules in the bible. There are laws in the bible, but there's narrative in the bible And there's poetry in the bible and the bible is working through all of these things Then how do you understand it? And this is what the church has been doing with story Ever since there's been a church They are re treads These these comic book stuff these these are just retreads of old stories just like disney has done Just like we keep doing well why? Well, because these stories work the darwinian approached two stories now sam harris will say ah, come on Do we pray to these gods? What do you mean by prayer? Do you worship them? What do you mean by worship? Do you act out what these gods do? Did the did the did the caesars? act out the gods of the pantheon How you stand with respect to them may determine how others see you And I would argue This line isn't very thick Jordan peterson's argument for god from sacrifice basically which is we saw that those who could delay gratification Those who could delay gratification And Prosper well who delays gratification? I remember watching I think it was suzy orman on tv Telling people give away a certain percentage of your money like 10 Why because then you have power over your money and it doesn't have power over you? Well, that's interesting Churches have been telling your people to do this for a very long time Now that did they give it a psychological reason no, well, what is the real reason Does the psychological representation of the reason actually exhaust the truth of the reason all the way on down? Well, you don't know that Because what peterson would say would that would be that well offering the sacrifice Rehearses put in psychological terms reinforces the neural pathways By which a person can delay gratification and not eat their seed corn Even when the supply is getting low They're delaying gratification, but they're preserving that best corn for the next season so they have something to harvest. So Those who sacrifice prosper and those who don't in jordan peterson's easter Winter in jordan peterson's easter videos this essentially and then my commentary on them. This essentially is his argument for God one Well, what about god too? Is there a god too that? blesses those Peterson will say I don't know But it sure seems as if that's what's happening Is that good enough good enough for you to believe Do these now let's get back to Phil and bob and again bring in dorothy sayers and her book the mind of the maker Do these does bob express his creator Yeah, in fact if you look at bob and larry bob and there's a lot of philip's And larry bob and there's a lot of phil visser and bob and larry and the representations that that phil created of bob well he voices him and in fact I would argue that Probably a a good shrink sitting down with phil and talking about bob and larry would find that Bob and larry are parts of um parts of phil and in fact if you don't even need a shrink just talk to probably phil's wife And say how much bob is in phil and how much larry is in phil and how much of these other creatures are in phil And his wife would probably laugh and say phil is full of them Well, what are we are we sure there is no maker? Because again to to imagine simplistically what we're looking for an object. We're looking for god to be an object first of all, we see that god one Is all over the place and and again peterson has this argument one It's practically undeniable, but then harris says well, I want to know if there's an agent more like phil vischer And jordan peterson says Those who act as if there is tend to prosper And he'll still stop short of ontology And that's where we tend to get into the resurrection because then i'll talk about this in further videos What we want to know is Does god two can I actually have a relationship with god? Is this a personal god? Does Having a relationship with this god makes sense Now this is where god one and two are really coming together because in a sense when jordan peterson says those who sacrifice prosper They're acting as if they're having a relationship with this god And they seem to be prospering So how do you know? Well, i'm a I I don't believe it because there could be something supernatural Well Who is more real phil vischer or bob the tomato? Well phil vischer is more real why because phil vischer made bob the tomato It would be a very strange thing if we were the most real thing In fact again the most real paul vanderkley is not actually this body that's sitting here It seems to be this story That is producing these videos rather than just this body this story And this agent that is paul vanderkley within this consciousness is moving the hands and controlling the computer and colonizing the internet And my words are colonizing you So is there a real paul vanderkley I Tend to find the denial of god aspect two Number one, it's unprovable which most will agree But most of human history hasn't had a problem with it So what's the problem with it for the celebrity atheists given the ubiquity and power of god number one It's hard to see how the addition of the number two reality Fills skeptics with so much fear unless it perhaps is motivated Because here's the thing we want use the force loop we want God number one to be employable, but the real problem we have with god number two is Such a being is not employable by us Such a being can say no to us such a p such a being can do with us What it wills to a greater degree than a tsunami? Can do with us what it wills or to a greater degree than a hurricane can or an asteroid can Or even the results of our own? Stupidity We can't even control god number one and what's really interesting is that I don't want to go to church or I don't want to be part of formal religion But I really like the idea of using the force What is that in you that's your religious that's your ambitious religious ego And and what's really interesting about the desire for there to be a an impersonal god is all you expose is that You would like to have the power of the universe at your disposal. You would like to be god Now in my Sunday school class a couple of weeks ago I asked what would it be how would you know if someone was the son of god? Well, if they could boom out of thin air create a pile of cash in the middle of the classroom. Okay So that would be you know to bring wealth Okay. Well Jordan Peterson's sacrifice delaying gratification bringing wealth It's not supernatural But again, how would we see the supernatural? When Jesus multiplies loaves and fishes all we see are differences in pattern There it wasn't glowy bread It was just a difference in the pattern and even mana. There's a lot of debate. What was this mana? in fact the word mana means what is it and Almost we see a difference in the pattern Okay but now you get into Christianity and again going back to Charles Taylor and the secular age With the step of providential deism you can go back and look at my video that I did about that the step of providential Deism where we kind of say well the universe is running itself. Okay Well, why do we like that? Well when the universe is running itself taylor has his water bottle. I can't use it anymore I'll have to use the tape dispenser Or I can use my water bottle. Oh, I didn't put it by me The universe is running itself Then we can employ it Then we can colonize it then we can take charge of it then I and my desires and what I want can have power over it That's the desire of sam harris's children That's the desire in my heart. That's the desire in all of our hearts Well, why don't we want god number two? Thomas nagle says it very well I don't want there to be a god I don't want there to be a god that says no, I don't want there to be a god who determines What happens to me? Then you see the fiction of control you didn't determine your genetics You didn't determine the family you were born into you didn't determine the country you were born into you didn't determine the the moment of history You were born into we have this we have this fantasy of controlling things We can control some things and we have agency. I totally believe that But it's all built within a history it's all built within a system and it's completely wrapped in god's stories All the way from the ground up So the denial of god number two is of course unprovable most of human history hasn't had a problem with it Given the ubiquity and the power of god one. It's hard to see how the addition of number two reality fills a skeptic with so much fear Well unless it's motivated And of course as a christian I say we're better off noting that denying god two is probably about pride If there is a god a god aspect to a personal god that is actually all good In fact has a better capacity for moral judgment than we have because we know how fallible human capacity Well, we think well my judgment is great. Well again, we're back to the delusion That I could be god and that paul van der ke can determine what's right and wrong in every circumstance based on my little 55 years of living Oh, well, i'll be really smart and use reason way to go The people in the middle east look at me and say you're just a westerner. You don't know anything I say no, I know more than you because we're more powerful than you. Ah, we see how constructed all this stuff is If there is god aspect to That is actually all good as a better capacity the judgment than us and all powerful the universe is a happier place And then suddenly we were going to say well, how can I align myself with this god? Because I'd not I would not like to be his enemy I would rather be his friend And now I get into the conversation I had with my son to school class two weeks ago Here's the crazy thing about christianity Jesus not only says I am I am the way the truth and the life. I am the author of creation. I am the logos He says I will give you my power What you will give me your power? Yeah If you live like me And die like me you will reign like me over a new creation read the rest of the book of miracles The book miracles by c.s. Lewis and I should get back to that There have been so many interesting other ideas for videos. I Keep getting distracted. There's so many interesting things so Here we are What do you mean you will give me power? acts one um stay in Jerusalem and The holy spirit will give you power power to be bold but also power to be In submission to the father power to see your own sin, this isn't the kind of power we usually want We can easily see everybody else's sin. The holy spirit gives us power to see our own sin What does that mean the problem we have Is that this makes claim on us that our hearts resent? Heidelberg catechism says we have a natural tendency to hate god and our neighbor And I think a big part of that resentment is their resistance to our efforts to colonize them Just watch a child child tries to colonize the parent the parent says ha I got you beat I've been around longer than you then you get married you try to colonize your beloved first you fall in love and you submit like crazy and then The more those glasses come off the more the relationship develops and guess what? You want to change your partner to be have them be in your image and your partner says No, I wanted you to change to be in my image and the one person says no, but i'm right and the other person says no But i'm right. Ah We have a natural tendency to hate god and our neighbor. We have a natural tendency to hate god and our beloveds well Sort of work it out with those that we love or we split up Here's the difficulty we have with god He might be a little smarter than your spouse or your spouse might be a little smarter than you Chances are you're fairly evenly matched and sometimes you win and sometimes the other one and if you're smart You'll learn to submit to one another out of reverence for christ book of ephesians And you'll learn how to make the marriage work Here's the problem with god well He's way too smart he knows way too much he's got way too much power We are no match your arms are too short to box with god as the old saying goes So then what is the rational thing to do? Why don't you try submitting? Why don't you try believing? That would be my recommendation. But again, we've talked about the fact that you don't just Believe because you choose to believe Well now we're realizing that in fact if we even want to believe We're going to have to colonize ourselves Well, what is the part that's colonizing ourselves? See, that's why this is fun. All right, this video's gone on long enough Hope it was helpful Uh, sorry, I haven't had a lot of time lately to engage in the comments. I've just been I'm just getting busier and busier. So yeah, I know some of you said well You're gonna go up the hierarchy and you won't have time for us anymore I really hope that doesn't happen, but we'll see what happens
