 It's time! This is Paul. The big video that a number of us have been waiting for for a while has dropped. It dropped on one of my busiest weeks of the year. So hence the little phone video I did. I might be continuing to play with other shorts. I was tempted to play with a one minute short. This one will not be short but it's limited to the amount of time I have today to devote to this video. I doubt I can get through the whole thing today. My goal would be to maybe get through half of it today and half of it tomorrow. I am taking Thursday and Friday off. I will not be making videos Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. There will be a Thursday Thanksgiving meditation on the channel but there might not be anything posted during the weekend. So fair warning. Now as I mentioned in the video I dropped yesterday, Jordan clearly has some production peeps and the production peeps are quite well attuned to the conversation in this little corner of the internet. One of the big takeaways of this video was that for me was that if we are doing dia logos, if we are doing distributed cognition reps in terms of conversations are vitally important. Last time I did the major commentary on Peterson's video I did an entire hour plus of comments before the video and a whole bunch of people were annoyed. So I'll give you some video and then we'll do the comments. But first they started with a teaser clip. You know first you had your little ad for you know 12 more rules and then continue the journey. So you had the little book ad and you know Peterson will probably be starting a book tour soon. But he had first little ad for the book and then they had a teaser clip and the teaser clip teased me. It teased me hard. Later when I heard the portion that was in the teaser clip within context it was so much better. But it's like hey you know we Protestants and Catholics and Orthodox we finally after a number of centuries stopped killing each other. Let's not start this fight again shall we? There's also something important Jordan in understanding that at least that the traditional churches at least the liturgical churches that you don't you don't them like for example the Orthodox Church they always say if the sermon is more than 15 minutes it's pride. Ouch! Keep your sermons as short as possible because you're not there to... No I'm obviously guilty of that. Jordan seeing himself as a Protestant preacher that is very much who Jordan Peterson is and I think you know there's all these you know if people are betting if and when Jordan Peterson joins a church which church he will join because of his wife you know some people say Roman Catholic and he loves the symbolism and you know the vestments and all some people say Orthodox because of the Peugeot connection but I think he's deeply deeply Protestant. I don't think there's I don't think that doesn't make for good video. Let's keep going. You're not there I mean it's propositional understanding is fine but it's participatory right church is participatory so you enter into the church like you imagine an Orthodox Church even a traditional Catholic Church you have a space which is structured as the hierarchy ontological hierarchy of being and then you see these images which are patterned and are revealing to you these mysteries that are beyond words and then you participate in the singing these processions and it is it is a participative thing and so if you go there to kind of get knowledge it's not the same type of practice and as you're singing these songs and as you're hearing these hymns all of a sudden two images connect together and all of a sudden you know these things start to connect inside you in somewhat in almost a kind of super rational way. Now again when you when we get to this clip and it's towards the end of the video and this conversation really starts out slow and that's not unusual for conversations where you haven't had people meet together and talk together and really get on the same page but it will pick up speed as it goes along there is the psychedelic thing we are we are we are gonna be dealing with the psychedelic thing for a long time I can tell it's you know I made that little video last night and this we're gonna be dealing with the psychedelic thing for a long time. It's also interesting that the teaser highlights Peugeot and this in This is what he said so that was very interesting too because you know you always have to sort of look at Jordan Peterson and then you have to look at Jordan Peterson incorporated because right from the start you know when Jordan Peterson status rocket took off you know he he grabbed his family his father was sorting through email and his daughter was doing stuff and his son you know you'd see Julian coming in and fixing the mic and everything and and then of course he went on the crazy first you know 12 rules for life book tour which wasn't really a book tour and you know these this this other organization got involved and he's got publishers involved and all of that but Jordan Peterson Inc. in terms of the people he has around him working on this stuff are do have a hand in what's put out now the relationship between Jordan and this I have no idea about I if I had a staff which I don't except that I have a I have a budding I have a budding staff made up of a crazy guy who does saving throws for videos and an alcoholic and a former Canadian who has another symbolic world that seems to be my staff so this this was a very interesting now as Grail Country as Nate Hiles said on Twitter I did think that the verveky Sam conversation their second conversation was in some ways especially for Nate given who Nate is he preferred that conversation to this one but this in time will be important one of the things that I've learned in doing these commentaries especially the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris one is that my first reading or living with this talk for the first week or couple weeks or so after a few weeks after things continue to go different resonances pick up and that's because there's a lot of reasons for that one of which is we don't see everything at once the world is too rich even a video like this is too rich for us to take in the nuances and so with repeated viewings or repeated listenings or something else reminds me of it so I go back and listen to a segment this video you know it's alive in that sense and it continues to change as we go but again starting out with this red meat clip that is intended to you know get some you know just stick it into a Protestant preacher like me well well and the insights you get sometimes your heart you have difficulty explaining them but they're very deep and they're they're embodied as you bow down as you kneel as you eat the body and and and blood of Christ these are these are different types of participation than just and Jonathan I'm totally in agreement with you and what did we do in our Catholic churches in the West the same time we were presenting the Bible in this in this flattened out historical critical way we also were flattening out our churches emptying out our churches of it just that mystical cosmic symbolism the angels the Saints color the cosmic dimension and we flatten them out and we made them like you know empty meeting spaces now Bishop Aaron in this conversation is that a since is that a real disadvantage one of the things I keep reminding people who want to well this is a favorite guy I listen to and this is a favorite person I listen to and we're gonna get them together and they're gonna have a great conversation and it almost always disappoints because again it takes a while for if you're going to have the kinds of distributed cognition the kind of deal logos that John Vervecky is talking about and we're going to talk about that especially when we get to the end of the video when Vervecky mentions a name which I did some digging on that name because in a lot of ways this is what Vervecky has been doing it it doesn't go because it's first meetings and again these conversations they kind of beget other conversations just because you have high status really smart articulate people someone like Bishop Barron doesn't mean he necessarily can sort of slide in and you can accomplish you know now I'm doing fancy Vervecky hands you know sort of a dance and get that deal logos going and you know I I mean the last few conversations I've had with John Vervecky have been really amazing and you know I credit certainly credit John for a lot of that but a lot of it is well he's not only such a gracious conversation partner but you know we've gotten to know each other we've gotten to trust each other and and you can just you can just learn to dance that's sort of the way it goes so now we have the Peterson intro music here have the opportunity to speak with and we know who they are the professor at the University of Toronto Bishop Barron Orthodox Christian and public speaks I thought we'd see what we could all do together so welcome gentlemen it's a pleasure to have you here thank you thanks for having me John I thank you very much yeah John I'll start with you so I'm going to ask you two questions I'm going to ask you what you think meaning means what does the term mean what does it signify and then there's some implicit idea I suppose that meaning has different depths and that religious meaning is among the deepest of depths and I'd like you to riff on that we'll go from man to man to do that then we'll now just initially who performed best in this conversation if I had to rank them it would be Vervecky first Peugeot second Peterson third and Bishop Barron fourth and the reason for that is Peugeot and Vervecky have done a fair amount of conversing back and forth more than Peugeot and Peterson have more than Vervecky and Peterson have especially recently and Bishop Barron is is just not a regular in this and it's not just it's it's not just how familiar or how many reps you've had with the individuals in terms of a conversation like this it's also how much of their content you have seen now lately John Vervecky has been putting out so much content you know he's almost putting out more than I am which again my project is a little different I'm not I don't really think of myself as a content creator I am trying to figure out how to use YouTube and you all as sort of a third lobe for distributed cognition and I think John Vervecky is doing more and more of that the rate at which he's having conversations posting them on his channel posting them on other podcasts now Rebel Wisdom is interested in a bigger project in this I mean he's really putting out a lot of stuff but John also watches a lot of stuff and he he'll regularly he always says I can't keep up with your stuff and I certainly wouldn't expect him to but he he tries to watch and listen to the things that are salient to the places where especially we overlap and I know he follows Jonathan and I know Jonathan you know obviously Jonathan none of us can keep up with the amount of content that that we are producing now and especially you know in my in the little corner that's closest to me with randos united and grim grizz and nate heil and I mean all the different individuals and more and more coming online I'm always getting emails and tweets from people who are doing videos or doing a little bit of commentary and you know one guy emailed me today and said I think I should ask for permission to know use the stuff and Peterson taught us that Peterson was like no use my stuff on YouTube and you know when you do that you open yourself to critique or criticism or even you know Jordan's certainly been a lightning rod but use the stuff use this stuff to think together if you don't like it I mean I mean the the um oh how can I describe the you know pacao and and chad and grim I mean they're sort of the they're sort of more they're the they're the chaotic they're the chaos fringe of of this little corner of the internet but you know muppet me I mean just just just do whatever it doesn't matter because what we're doing is we're thinking together and we'll all do the sifting as we go so having said that about John's performance where he begins I mean it's kind of hard to go first in a group like this because you're sort of you're sort of out there and he um um their opening statements were all quite interesting and quite telling in terms of what they've done so let's have John do his first we'll start talking as if it's a conversation great thanks again for inviting it's also the case that in a conversation like this Grimm Grizz likes to talk about the fourth wall now I know I regularly hear good Grimm you got to keep in the comments here because people keep asking who's this grim grizz guy so keep sticking your nose in there and keep putting your comments keeping your links in there so people can find you he does much shorter videos than I do and he's very much at the chaotic neutral side of orientation in fact he has a video on his own orientation in that way it's a grim grizz orientation not a different kind of orientation but oh shoot I just distracted myself okay the fifth so there's a fifth party in this and that's us and when I first so all the way back to the start of my channel I was watching a lot of Jordan Peterson videos I wanted in on the conversation uh Jordan Peterson at that point already had uh you know about 300,000 subs on his channel and so I knew he was too far up a status hierarchy and hierarchy and you know there wasn't going to be much chance to really engage personally but in many ways the individual individual matters of course but it's the ideas that I'm engaging with and on this flat screen we are engaging with them together and so when I thought about the kinds of videos I wanted to do there are other people doing little commentary videos and stuff I wanted to watch the videos with you and give and share my thoughts on that and of course twitch was out there and many other things were out there but it is the fourth wall that I wanted to break down now virtually we're only doing that virtually because these four are talking to each other in real time but that's one layer of this and the other layer is they are doing a public performance as such and I've done plenty of conversations in this and those of you sorry not a lot of rando slots during the holidays there'll be more during December but those of you who have managed to grab a rando slot no I always tell you the same thing let's record it there's sometimes reasons why we don't record it at all because it's just the nature of things let's record it and then you know if you want a copy you can I'll send you a copy you can share with whom you want but once we know that someone else is watching us it changes it's not a bad change it's a realistic change and you go out on YouTube and people are going to do whatever they want with it and my channel is quite small so you know I don't have anywhere near the liability as especially Peterson and in some ways Baron and Peugeot and John as well but there's this conversation is part performance and it's part conversation and we're recording it and and so we are really exploring sort of a new way of creating community and you know all John's fancy vervekey words as Job calls them distributed cognition and and all of those things so thank me and it's a great pleasure to be here it's great to see you again Jonathan and it's a pleasure meeting you Bishop so there's a question as you said quite correctly that's at the center of a lot of my work and also I guess my own personal project I take it when we're talking about meaning in this context we're using meaning as a metaphor we're talking about something similar to the way a sentence works it has an intelligibility to it that connects us to the world in some important way so that we can interact with the world and so we can be informed by the world and that what we're talking about when we're talking about meaning when in the sense of meaning in life not just the meaning of a sentence the question to ask is what is that metaphor pointing to so I've put forth the proposal that what that metaphor is pointing to is something that's fundamental to our cognitive agency and Jordan this is something you and I have talked about before in other contexts which is the problem of relevance realization which is this deep profound problem at the heart of cognitive science you find at the heart of AI many issues within cognitive psychology categorization communication and this is of all of the information available to me how do I zero in on the relevant information of all of the information available in my long-term memory and all the potential ways I could combine them how do I how do I connect and zero in on the relevant information out of all the possible courses of actions I can undertake the way I could sequence various things together how do I select the appropriate sequence of actions how do I do that and and and the thing that's that's mysterious and wonderful and perplexing and intriguing and I'm obsessed about is we're doing it all right now and we're doing it like this and and it's not a cold calculation now again I ranked them in terms of how I thought they performed in this and I ranked for vaquie first but he really you know Chad the alcoholic is pretty open when he says I don't understand anything that comes out of his mouth and oh I've got to play grim grizzles appropriation of John I'm building an ecology of practices of group information processing and attention hyper focusing towards towards constructing the best salience hierarchy beholder I can with which I intend to steer the overton window toward something terrible okay forget that last part but the first part now grim is a huge fan of John and his work and but that's and you know I I could chattel off and say I just have difficulty understanding and so in all fairness to John he tries to take 50 hours of awakening from the meaning crisis and put it all into one video and it was John who has you know brought forward the idea of the meaning crisis which is just this real succinct way of framing a ton of things and when I first heard John talk about the meaning crisis a lot of Jordan stuff just fell into place but it's very interesting because at the beginning of this video a lot of people are just going to be like what what what what it's it's meaning is a remarkably difficult thing to describe is it a feeling is it out in the world now John will say it's the connection between us and the world meaning is in many ways between us and the world it's also between us as human beings and it's it's something that in some ways it's not unlike what I talk about in terms of spirit we generate it by our actions Carl made a comment that you know if I had read his first paper that he sent me a while ago I would understand that the reason we have a meaning crisis is and then he went into a series of political and economic things which I completely agree is part of it I I can go faster and simply say the reason we have a meaning crisis is our success and affluence is certainly a contributor to the meaning crisis but I think it goes far deeper especially with end game modernity and I know as I get more consistent and more articulate in terms of talking about the recession of modernity and the end of modernity many people who are deeply committed to modernity whether or not they know it will get increasingly uncomfortable about the kinds of things that we're talking about and I've already begun to see some of that aimed at Peugeot although for myself and Peugeot and Bishop Barron once you're used to dealing in a religious community you're used to taking shots that's just that's that's part of you know at the beginning of it was the Christopher Nolan Batman series I mean the Batman origin story many of these origin stories are like that dune is sort of like this where you come out of this absolutely brutal harsh environment and so if you're in any way a Christian leader and have been around Christian communities it's like this that pit that they have at Batman where you're just gonna you're just gonna get people coming at you from all sides doing things and so it toughens you up but the end of modernity is in many ways we have looked around the world we have found ourselves alone and we're the only agents here and then suddenly we look in the mirror and we wonder about ourselves because we've been looking at that and doing it well you're just the sum of your psychology and your sociology and your genetics there's no there's no little person in there you're just the product of the whole show as C.S. Lewis talks about in his book miracles you're just a product of the whole show well then I'm just a product of the whole show then nothing matters and right there you are at your at your meaning crisis so I think I think John will probably you know want to and Christopher Christopher Masto Pietro is an excellent resource for John because Christopher is just really good at just getting getting these little and as a preacher a lot of the explanation just right over people's heads it's the stories it's the images it's the illustrations as a preacher I know people very quickly forget almost all of my theological abstract theological points expressed in abstraction but tell them a story give them an image give them an illustration you repeat an illustration in a sermon people say you said that last week you repeat an abstraction in a sermon and nobody remembers it you know I'm standing out I'm salient there's an element of arousal there's affect you're caring about some information and you're backgrounding and ignoring other information so it's this very affectively laden connectedness because the idea of relevance realization is it's not relevance is isn't in the head it isn't in the world it's in a proper real relation and you see Jonathan nodding because Jonathan's hat Jonathan's done the reps with John he's heard this many times I've heard this many times and so now and and I regularly have this with John's work it takes me a long time to really have this stuff sink in and the same with Jonathan's work I think it's the truth almost anyone so Jordan's you know Jordan is how familiar is Jordan with John's work I don't know is Bishop Barron at all familiar with John's work probably not at all but Bishop Barron is and you know he's highly adept in experience at this kind of thing so he will take in what he can but it's just tremendously difficult to contextualize and understand this between the embodied brain and the world this is what's known as embodied cognition this is the kind of cognitive science I am involved in so the idea is this is a dynamical self-organizing process and you can feel it a little bit at work right now as I'm talking part of your attention wants to drift away and think about other things right this is like variation and evolution another part of your attention is focusing in and selecting and you're constantly varying and selecting and you're evolving in this dynamically coupled fashion a salience landscape that makes you feel that you're here now in this particular state of consciousness in this situational awareness so you're deeply fundamentally connected and that is and there's just so much information going that and what you really need is the information having a flow and coming to a point and again narrative does that narrative does that so well narrative is this enormous compression engine that that grips us so deeply that we can communicate so often so much more than we even know sometimes to our detriment but deeply central to your cognitive agency if you don't have that you're not a cognitive agent and this is of course one of the things that has the whole project of artificial intelligence has disclosed we thought that intelligence was mostly about propositional manipulation right getting you know sort of coherence and instead no this dynamical embodied evolving connectedness is very central to our cognitive agency so much so that it stands to good reason that it is a core motivational feature and dimension of our whole agency so i talk about meaning in life and i use the word and i use it deliberately but i hope it's not offensively i use the word religio to discuss to describe this connection because that's one of the that's the meaning of religio to bind together it's one of the purported etymological origins of the word religion and that allows me to now segue into what i would want to say religious meaning is so i think when we are here's a metaphor and i often use this a lot of our a lot of a time our mental framing is transparent to us like my glasses we're looking through it and by means of it but there are times i think this i think this illustration works well when i need to step back and consider this is what you do in mindfulness practices i need to consider that mental framing and i might want to not only consider it i might want to educate it i might i might want to celebrate it so normally religio is transparent to us and and therefore we are it affords our agency but there are things we do where we step back and we try to become more directly aware of religio in order to educate it perhaps correct it improve it celebrate it and when we're doing that in a way that creates what i i i call a reciprocal opening the opposite of what happens in addiction reciprocal opening is my agency is opening up this is so much of awakening from the meaning crisis is just right in this little talk world is opening up and i'm experiencing this inexhaustible fount of emerging intelligibility that's not just conceptual but is this about this religio for me that's the experience of sacredness and so when we when religio when we we when we focus upon religio rather than focus through it in order to accentuate it and accelerate it so that we can come into the deepest mutual resonance between ourselves and the depths of reality that for me is what religious meaning would be the religio about the sacred so that would be my initial answer i hope that was helpful okay so so i'm going to comment on that and i'll make my comments about this question because i'm also a psychologist and then we'll move to we'll move to to you to you guys to jonathan and to bishop erin now you just listened to john verveckis comments and i think probably many of you are just kind of lost unless you've listened to awakening from the meaning crisis two or three times you've gotten very familiar with a lot of john's terms and even then if if i had to sort of i even considered just skipping this whole first part of the video and commentary because it's difficult commenting on that unless i sort of would take it five or ten a phrase at a time and um it's just so compact but now watch how peterson now watch what peterson does with the same question well he doesn't really engage with much of what john says here but i mean part of the reason peterson is so skilled as a protestant preacher as a public communicator why his book tour and his biblical series were so much like protestant revival meetings in some ways you know they they weren't they weren't the pageantry that the little teaser clip of bezot talked about um is watch what he does here because this is this is quintessential peterson and he was in this conversation at least for the first while about as sharp and we're seeing more of the old jordan peterson back and it's really good to see so if you think you're when you look at the world there's a central point of focus and that's mediated by your phobia and that's at the back of your that's on your retina in the center essentially now he almost immediately goes to something which is a little bit more than we know because you kind of know that there's this area in the oh yeah it's the phobia i've heard that before he's peterson is very skilled at sounding clinical he's a clinical psychologist he's a clinical psychologist i'm not a prophet i'm a clinical psychologist he's a clinical psychologist and so this in terms of our culture is deeply resonant because of the trust credibility that we see in this sort of medicalized field and so he leverages the credibility of medical science in his answer but he's also doing it in a very personal way this really is a rather little remarkable piece that he gives us here and you'll notice that when you zoom your eyes on something that becomes very clear it's a very small area that becomes very clear and then you'll notice that around that area it's less and less and less clear until it fades out into nothingness and the nothingness you don't even perceive it's just not there and so it's high resolution in the center lower lower lower lower way out here in the periphery you actually don't even see color you can't tell that but you don't and you're better at detecting motion because maybe you should look at moving things and then the world and again this is this is just way peterson talks now also pay attention in terms of rhetorically now he's going to just try to make a few points but the points are going to have sort of a hierarchy they pull all the other they pull all the other points with them and then they pull all the other points or at least a a descending number of points then into us some of us who are most familiar will be able to grab most of it but again it's much more of a one-pointed thing and again and when you teach preaching something that i fail at regularly but when you teach preaching one of the things a couple of little little tidbits that we tell people who are aspiring to learn preaching most sermons fail because of too many points too many disconnected points what you want is one point and everything else is connected to that point and ideally there are metaphors and images that hold the whole thing together and in that way you can sort of you know really focus and you know what he's sort of done with this illustration is in fact embody the way he's talking even in this illustration vanishes so and that's sort of what that's very much like what consciousness is and and you're and and also it's associated with meaning because you you focus your fovea on what's most meaningful and those foveal cells are tremendously connected into the visual cortex that that and again notice the scientific connection the medical connection that that gives him authority when you mention physicality as opposed to something abstract which to us especially after years of modernity and materialism make it make it suspect it takes a lot of brain to make those fove that fovea work and that's why it's such a small area and we move it around instead of just having a retina that's all fovea we'd have to have a brain like this big to manage that so okay so that again watch just the imagery it's it's just an amazing speaker he really is that's sort of like a metaphor for consciousness and meaning and then i want to layer something on top of that metaphor so and this is something like the relationship between see right there is a good transition again homiletically homiletically homiletics is the study of preaching if i were if i were critiqued if this were a sermon and i would critique him i would say that's a that's an effective transition conscious and unconscious and also the relationship between narratives and consciousness and consciousness and unconsciousness so i'm looking at say john right now i'm looking at his eyes because that's what you do when you converse with someone and i'm doing that because we're having a conversation and so i have this little frame of reference that helps me realize what's relevant right now my goal is now he's just brought in some of because if you're awakening from the meaning crisis relevance realization is sort of is a key piece of john vervecki system and jordan just let's bring that in here have an interesting conversation and i picking out the targets that i presume are relevant to that goal and then but then you might ask yourself well why that goal and then so that net that story that's guiding me is nested in a larger story which is well maybe i'm an educator and a communicator and i'd like to bring this knowledge to myself but also to other people and then outside of that is another story which is well why am i doing that and well it's because notice how he's been connecting everything all the way through it's not this this this this this this this it's one thing it's sort of got a narrative thread that's running through it this is really good rhetoric i think that it's an interesting thing to do and it's a meaningful and useful thing to do but it'll help educate people and maybe that'll make the world a slightly better place in some manner and then outside of that there's another presumption which is well why would i bother trying to make the world a better place and maybe that's because well because not suffering is better than suffering and because i think that that's a moral way to act and i would like to act in a moral manner and then outside of that there's yet another story which is well and that's where you start to shade into the religious it's like who exactly am i imitating when i enact that morality and i think that's where we can have a particularly interesting discussion because i now after watching peterson for four years plus now what's his contribution in many ways his contribution is giving people a sense of credibility about the relationship between religion which in a materialistic culture feels abstract and tenuous and our biology i would say psychologically that implicit figure at the outer edge of the narrative structuring of my consciousness and meaning realization that would be something that's psychologically equivalent to the the hero of heroes in some sense that would be culture free but in our culture in the judaeo-christian culture that figure is christ so he just had a little nod to pluralism which is something that people are deeply anxious about you heard that come into the question and answer for jonathan's presentation on genesis so we're always deeply concerned about diversity and pluralism and the world and christianity well that's our thing here and jordan sort of incorporates that anxiety and sort of lays people puts people to rest and says but but for us that's christianity and so then there's a then there's this is independent of religious belief as far as i'm concerned and there you've got his his anxiety about propositional belief dogma some of these things that the kinds of the kinds of confessional fights that have gone on within between religions that people look at and say oh you have the truth and you have the truth and you have the truth but none of you agree with each other why should i agree with any of you so he sort of deals with that very quickly and succinctly now there's an interesting relationship with formal religious belief but i think this is the way it works psychologically and i got some of this from studying neuroscience the same sorts of things jon is studying but some of it from studying yung and you know yung proposed that at the very least speaking psychologically christ is the symbol of the self and what he meant by that is that christ is the symbolic realization of our culture's determination of the embodiment of the ideal and it's an image and it grips us it's the thing we imitate or we fight against we're in that whether we like it or not and then again classic peterson using emotion using his body using using that physically in many ways this is where he and peugeot meet because not only do you have a sense of not only only is he talking at us but he is giving us structure he is giving us image he you know he is he's really using some of the stuff like this where okay and when peugeot used these kinds of diagrams peterson used similar diagrams in maps of meaning and so following on this he's seeing all these structures both high resolution and low resolution and in a very short amount of time he's putting things together now for those who have listened to a lot of peterson there's a lot of repetition in here but repetition isn't necessarily a bad thing because with each pass over something that is quite complex you you not only get the basic structure but you're able to sort of fill in the little details and so that is that is what jordan is doing here and that's part of the reason he's able to be listened to again and again and again because there's a fair amount of complexity to what he's giving you and so every time you hear it your resolution goes up your resolution goes up and as your resolution goes up you're continued to be satisfied because there's still little micro new micro novel areas that was was given to you before but it sort of passed over you weren't able to grip it you weren't your the little aviola in your you know like in your small intestine or weren't able to sort of capture those little things and now you capture it so you hear it again and again and again and your resolution goes up and you can gain more of it and your ability to yourself re-represent what he says begins to come through the question becomes for me okay that's a psychological truth but it it can also be a metaphysical claim and an ontological see and now he could have said truth and people wouldn't like that and a little bit later in the conversation he says you know i go to a protestant church and they just they just tell me all these things that i should believe and you know don't tell me what i believe a little later bishop barron says well beauty is you know of the transcendentals beauty is many ways the most winsome because truth it's you know we bristle and and goodness you know someone's sticking their morality down my throat so his his choice of claim there is for our culture much more well it's a claim i'm not saying it is i'm saying it's asserted by someone and if it's asserted by someone it's not so say we all you can take it or leave it it's a claim so i mean this is this is why peterson has has moved so has has moved a mountain in the way that he has claim but it it can also be a metaphysical claim and an ontological claim and that and that's where this starts to shade into the religious per se so that's it for me so that was quite brief i mean he did a lot very quickly and and a lot of that this is that was very pleasing you might not have captured everything he said but you felt like he was sort of telling a story and you got a little bit of medical stuff and you got some psychology stuff and there's some tantalizing some some teasing of religion in there i mean there's a lot of reason why peterson has been so popular with this stuff so now again if you look at john's presentation i think for many of you if i'd ask you okay pop quiz what did you capture from john's presentation what did you capture from jordan's presentation and in terms of preaching stuff one of the things that you also quickly learn is people don't remember what you said but they remember how you made them feel how did john make you feel how did jordan make you feel and again i'm i mean john's my friend i'm i'm you know giving this critique and again out of the entire conversation all included i thought john did the best of the four but the intro i think i think john if he he would probably be good to okay what do i mean by meaning and then tell a story and then another story that's adjacent then maybe a point or two and then a concluding illustration like with the glasses and i think people would listen to that and they'd say oh now would they get everything that john wanted to give to us no but i don't think most people got everything john wanted to give to us anyway and that's when you have the question of the audience i mean how much did bishop barron get i don't know he's you know he's far better educated than i am he's you know much better in philosophy than i am but so again i was tempted to kind of skip over the opening comments but then i thought about it i thought no actually these opening comments sort of set the table for where this is going to go and there's some instructive moments in these opening comments that are worth sort of taking a look at okay so we've had a cognitive scientist and a clinical psychologist take a whack at this hard question bishop do you want to take it from there now we get the bishop yeah uh thank you first of all everybody thank you and jonathan and john to meet you for the first time at least virtually i've met jordan twice now virtually but good to be with all of you you're all canadians right all of you are canadian born because all i can think of is as you're both were talking about lon here's a pastor well how much local pastoring does he do in his position i don't know but this is a smooth pastoral move okay and uh pastors have lots of tricks that we do and that we use and always lead with the personal so here's an aspect that all three share personally and come in with okay let's let's talk about another canadian again i'll get maybe back to him but one of my favorite philosophers the canadian Jesuit londrigan came to my mind a lot but to answer the opening question i guess i would say meaning is to be in a purpose of relationship to a value so now that's pretty it's really good it's it's probably for him so barron's been around the block and it's and one of the things that we see with barron in both of his conversations jordan peterson and in this one a lot are a lot of set answers and you almost can't help that if you're actually working in a field a lot and always fielding the same questions you get some pretty set answers and they're they're your favorites and they're how you um it's how you'll go after things but that's a really good answer and it's it's very compact it's very brief it's just all right there they mean my mind a lot but to answer the opening question i guess i would say meaning is to be in a purpose of relationship to a value a purpose of relationship to a value it's a little abstract but it's succinct so i think certain values appear epistemic values of the the true moral values and aesthetic values so the true the good and the beautiful right the three transcendental properties of being and i think those values appear and i really like what you're saying too both of you about attention what gets our attention what draws our consciousness why like i suspect he when he said this i suspect he watched the pichot peterson video he can't have much time to watch a lot and probably almost none of vervecky and the virecky peterson video was so unusual it would be tough to to get a lot out of it without really sitting down with it but also notice rhetorically what he did here's the statement and now he's going to articulate it's very easy for the listener to sort of follow you know william jane says the mind is like a bird that flies and it perches for a time it looks and then it flies again you know he's able to name drop you know a pragmatist which of course all of jordan peterson oh it's a pragmatist and a nice little illustration nice little word picture i mean this is this is he's very good at what he does why does it focus on certain things and we call those values i would say and a meaningful life is one that's lived in a purpose of relationship to values it's seeking them in a very concentrated way now what's religious value is he just answered the question in less than a minute very very good life lived in purpose of relationship to the supreme value of the summa bonum to the the source of he does use too much latin he does it all the time now john does it sometimes but when john uses latin it's in the academy when bishop barron uses latin it's from rome goodness truth and beauty which is god and you know what came to my mind as you were talking jordan was two things from aquinas one is probably the most misunderstood and overlooked of his famous five arguments is the fourth argument and it's the most platonic of the of the five he's usually aristotelian in form aquinas but number four is platonic and what he says is we experience things in the world as more or less true good and beautiful so just what i was saying we notice values and we also notice them ordered hierarchically there some that's truer that's better that's more beautiful then thomas says we only can make that calculation in implicit relationship to something we consider highest in goodness truth and beauty and the way it's misunderstood is people think oh i guess well there's a tall building there's a taller building and boy there's the tallest building there must be some absolutely tall building but he's not talking about something as trivial as that he's talking about the properties of being the good the true and the beautiful and being is by its very nature unlimited so therefore it's true that we make those calculations we see those hierarchies only finally in relationship to an unconditioned i can use the more modern kind of kantian language see i don't know that so if again i already sort of graded everybody or ranked everybody on the total performance jordan i think has so far the best opening statement and and bishop barron the second best but he i think he started strong i don't know how often he needs to mention thomas here because who's he scoring points with now if you're having a debate among colleagues for whom you know you usually don't get into trouble by quoting john calvin in the christian reform church or abraham kiper or herman boving same i would imagine thomas equinas in the roman catholic church he keeps going back and using that and so you know maybe he's so here you have a question again of context is his primary audience jordan peterson john revakian jonathan peugeot or where do we rank in the audience some unconditioned form of goodness truth and beauty that's religious meaning it seems to me is to be in purposive relationship to that the other thing from equina and i think there's a little um nature grace dichotomy that's that's a big element of roman catholicism and i think in some ways nature grace sets up see protestantism gets a lot of blame and or credit for modernity but the protestant reformation didn't happen in a vacuum there had been these micro product micro reformations happening before the protestant reformation and in some ways the nature grace dichotomy dichotomy sort of sets us up for that and there could be his whereas peterson and peugeot and vervecky very much want to be post-decartes and have one system of meaning i wonder how this fits in how barron's answer fits in there and i think jordan you and i talked about it last time we were together i love what you did there because that's an implicit argument for god it's in the second part of the summa from final causality every time i make an act of the will i'm seeking a good i'm seeking a value of some kind but as you say quite correctly and that's just like a coin is that value nests in a higher value which nests into still higher value and so i can't go on indefinitely that would make my act of the will incoherent so i've got to come finally to some summa bonum some supreme value that's motivating me that's religious meaning it seems to me is now to be in relationship to this most alluring horizon of all of desire now there's lonergan again my canadian reference to be in relation to god lonergan said is to want to know everything about everything so that's the the value okay so he sort of split it and i think with lonergan now he's putting it back he's pulling it back together the epistemic value of the truth but now in its unconditioned form i want to know everything about everything we call that in religious language the beatific or i want not just this particular good so i'm talking to the three of you now which i think is a good but it's nesting as you say in a higher good and it's still higher good and so finally i want not just this particular good i want goodness itself that's a religious relationship so i guess that's how i'd approach it maybe piggybacking a bit on what you both said i think he started really strong and i think if he had stuck with this you know purposive i'm going to rephrase it a little bit purpose purposive pursuit of a value and of course the highest value i would have liked to have seen more of a slide rather than sort of a two-step and i think he he started strong i don't think he i don't think he finished as strong as he started but um okay so what what do i know about meaning after listening to bishop barron talk about it i got i got a lot of religious things i got a lot of you know again who's he talking to um i got i heard about thomas and i got some latin and a beatific vision that sounds religiousy and you know i i go there's always the conversation about me investments now after the nigarian anglicans had their thing in the church here and i tweeted about that today so hmm where do we where does that answer leave us okay now let's get to the icon carver i think i mean i it's interesting because i by the way thank you for making me last and this stacking up on everything that everybody said and again in all fairness to john vervecky going first for this group that's that's really tough that's really tough but uh i think that what's interesting in what john said in terms of relevance realization and in terms of this hierarchy of values that in terms of relevance realization and in terms of this hierarchy of values that both jordan and bishop barron brought up and so john you know he doesn't unlike bishop barron who sort of had this set term john is obviously sort of crafting this now and again he's had more conversations with john vervecky than i don't know how many conversations he's had off screen with jordan about these kinds of things but he obviously is a comfortable conversation partner with john vervecky the the thing that i might add at least in my perception is that first of all these this pattern recognition that we engage with and this hierarchy of values and just hierarchies in general they really are teleological in the way that bishop barron said that is that the reason why we perceive hierarchy is because we're always judging or perceiving or trying to evaluate whether something is good and but the other thing that this does in terms of so it binds reality together right so you're looking at something and you want to evaluate the apple and this this desire makes you see the pattern of the apple because you have to engage with it you have to relate to it you have to eat it because you have to eat the apple that's why you see it and that's why you can perceive it and that's why you're evaluating it but this pattern let's say a binding of religio that john mentioned it stacks up so until now we've actually talked mostly about individual relationship this individual relationship with the field of being that presents itself to us the individual relationship with the the ultimate good but it also does something else is that it stacks up people together it binds us together as well and that's in terms of meaning of religio in the in a now he's talking much more about what meaning does rather than what meaning is and he's he's sort of building on the comments that have gone before which is fine but again i think my ranking in terms of their opening statements i would give peterson the the best opening statement may maybe bishop barron the second and i think jonathan probably the third just because more of the things that he's talking about would be more commonly accessible and broader sense that can also kind of help you understand religious practice why we get together why we sing together why we celebrate as john mentioned why do we celebrate together because when you see the apple and you see a good apple you're implicitly celebrating it it every act of recognition of a good is going to be a mini celebration but that stacks up together in terms of people gathering and singing and and processing and doing all the things we do in order to celebrate the highest good and let me let me just just intersperse something there so it's also interesting how often peterson interrupts jonathan peugeot and just in the other video the symbolic world video he interrupted jonathan a lot and i would have liked to have seen jonathan been able to land the plane there there from a psychological perspective well that idea of the mini celebration so there's a technical reason for that in some sense so let's say you specify a goal and that goal is is nested inside the value hierarchy that we've okay now notice peterson takes something that's colloquial and then he attaches it to something that's technical and for again given our current cultural context for many in especially many men who tend to like things you know they have their preference for in terms of their job for things rather than people so again the tech nay the technical um he's this is just a quintessential jordan peterson move already described and so now you're pursuing something of value if you see something that leads you down the pathway to that value that produces positive emotion technically okay now what he did right there was really beautiful because he connected bishop barron's speech with with peugeot peugeot was much more moving towards meaning is not something and i would have i would have liked to have seen at least one of them talk about is meaning an emotion is meeting does meaning have more of an ontological reality that we participate in i would have loved to have seen more than that but what peterson did right there was sort of grab the grab the speeches together and okay we're going down the road but poor jonathan really didn't get a chance to to finish but um jordan jordan now sees the ball and he's running with it or he sees the puck and he's skating down the ice speaking that's dopaminergically mediated and and so that's there's psych and again there's there's credibility with that medical talk we you might not be able to say what dopamine does but no that's one of these chemicals in the brain that's important and and now if i have a picture of chemicals causing things you know this is again this is the real thing that jordan is doing is is connecting these worlds ecological there's a fundamental to doing something of value if you see something that leads you down the pathway to that value that produces positive emotion technically speaking that's dopaminergically mediated and and so that's there's psychological there's a fundamental neuroscientific reality underneath the idea that to perceive something good in relationship to a higher good is a celebration and and that is it is definitely that that imbues our life with a sense of positive meaning and i mean that directly like me and again watching peter this is the old peterson this is this is jordan this is what he does notice the intensity the urgency it's all right there and and it brings us in with him and it's it's the technological and it's the medical and it's the it's the brain chemistry and it's the out there in the world and we're gonna we're gonna very quickly pull all of this together meaning is derived from this nested hierarchy and then the perception of of valued what would you the the perceptions of values that lead us down that pathway without that there is no positive emotion in in my in my understanding of it yeah and so okay so now jonathan gets to finish hopefully i think i might want to say is that so in the same way that the world reveals itself to us as this hierarchy of the good in the same way that that we see that we it also reveals to reveals itself to us cosmically that's why i'm saying it stacks up and that's why there are these that's why there are temples that's why there are there's the law of moses that was received on the top of the mountain okay now we're getting into illustrations and so now oh yeah i know what the love oh temples yeah those are interesting so now you know we're getting less abstract and we're getting more concrete and he's drawing the relationships in that there is a cosmic revelation of the same pattern that you encounter as an individual which is in inescapable as an individual and so that is what ends up creating these revelations of you know of being into the world and binding us together as a as a body instead of just these disparate individuals and as jordan said it's very appropriate to discuss you know what are these revelations and what do they look like and and of these revelations which is the one that binds the most reality together into itself and i think that that is when the the image of christ as being god man as going all the way down into death as reaching to the highest summit as as you know we we could i don't want to go into his story too much but jordan you know that there's a most of christ's story seems to go to the limit of storytelling in all the aspects in which he goes right and and we've sort of lost the thread on i mean this is connected with meaning but you know we're following along and again jonathan also has an intensity here and he's he's being fairly concrete which is helpful now when when i finally stop it at basically the end of the opening statements you should ask yourself no we'll get there when we get there it's like christ doesn't just go down into the underworld and resurrect when he comes back up the underworld is empty and death is defeated and that's the end and so it's like that for almost every aspect of christ's story where he reaches the limit of storytelling and so in that way it's it's a it's a it is ends up just being the fact that we recognize it that we've brought it together that we've celebrated it means that it is part of this kind of cosmic revelation and it's something that we can look at objectively and talk about and discuss but it's definitely there in our story as a as europeans as you know as westerners and and we've discounted it completely but i think we're at a point now with this meaning crisis where we can go back and reevaluate it and understand it as this the possibility of these relevance realization pattern stacking up beyond the individual let's say okay so those are the four statements we're 25 minutes in ask yourself which of the opening statements who of these individuals gave you a better handle on what meaning is and how it relates to religion and of the four if i had to put it into a nutshell bishop barons sticks purposive pursuit of a value that's really good really nice little handle very succinct i can remember it if if you you have to ask me about john vervecki i would leverage all of the conversation listening that i've done with john vervecki um peterson i remember the the connection to brain chemistry peterson will often bring in brain chemistry and sciency stuff and then find a way to connect it to everyday phenomenological life and then to religion i mean that's his strength um so i think peterson had the best in terms of engagement i i was i was able to stay with him most of the time and i had a sense of excitement listening to him i'm just getting spam calls right and left um bishop baron again probably delivered in that he gave me a definition that i think that's a good definition and it's something i can remember and i'll probably if you'd ask me tomorrow do you remember that definition that bishop baron gave i'll probably say yeah and i'll remember persif uh percive uh purposive was a good word pursuit yeah value yeah three things easy to remember and then you know latin aquinas transcendentals and now if i were to listen to it again i would i would get more out of it and then of course jonathan trying to bring it and say well not just individual but communal this holds the community together didn't didn't mention the word meaning much so it didn't really tie it in and of course jon verveckis you know all of the stuff that i know from verveckis but if i listen to this the first time i'm not sure what i would have remembered from jon if he had just started talking about the meaning crisis and the symptomology of the meaning crisis and then a few examples of that symptomology and then maybe getting finding some stories to connect the you know individual suffering from the symptomology of the meaning crisis to broader things in terms of the meaning crisis and again i've i've come up with my own ideas about the meaning crisis but there okay so 25 minutes in end of the opening statements where are we going to go next okay so so i want to comment on that revelation idea i'm going to go a little sideways here and so you might say that the standard view of the world now is that there's an objective reality that's devoid that's made out of fake material things that's the most appropriate way to conceptualize it it's made out of objective things they exist independent remember beginning of maps of meaning there are two ways to conceptualize the world a space of objects or a form for action it's always starts maps of meaning 1999 published in 99 he's still working this independently of consciousness and we project a value structure onto them and so in other words values are there's something that we're cooking up but they're not real in the way that the cell phone stand yeah guys haven't seen this for a while i mean those of you who remember the cell phone standards and illustration you've been around a while values are not real like the cell phone stand you go all the way back to jordan's conversation with sam harris big debate about that which one is more real what do we mean by real independently of consciousness things that's the most appropriate way to conceptualize it void it's made out of think material things that's the most appropriate way to conceptualize it it's made out of objective things they exist independently of consciousness and we project a value structure onto them that existing independently of consciousness can go back to jonathan peugeot's symbolic world genesis on there because what peugeot really does is put the subject first and things second whereas in terms of order materialism puts things first and subjects second subjects are the product of things your consciousness is the product of materiality that's going to be addressed later in this conversation and and when we die let's say when there is no human consciousness that value structure is there's no value structure like that there and so it's epiphenomenal and evanescent it's not a fundamental part of objective reality outside of subjectivity so in the first biblical series someone asked him the question if all humans were to go away you know what goes with it and peterson basically says well materialism says values go away when we go away values are subsidiary to us and in some ways that's you know the the the vaunted evolutionary psychology is all about the assumption that values are produced by us they aren't out there apart from us as a part of the world that's what he just basically said now there's a couple of problems with that viewpoint i would say first of all it isn't obvious to me that we see objects we see patterns it's not all now it's really important to notice what he did right there because we see patterns how are you using the word see what is what is the seeing we are primarily doing jesus says eyes to see well our eyes are seeing things but if someone isn't getting someone isn't kept getting the idea we're trying to communicate to them we're saying you don't see it no i i see the cell phone stand what do we see obstacles and opportunities we see value well what does that mean he's not meaning that physically he's meaning that personally relationally the thing that makes us act it's pragmatist the thing that makes us act our values if you have a hierarchy values are higher than objects values rule over us more than objects rule over us objects only rule over us to the degree that we see the value in them obvious that is not now there's a couple of problems with that viewpoint i would say first of all it isn't obvious to me that we see objects we see patterns it's not obvious that we see it's it you could make a strong case and this was made by man who wrote ecological approach to visual perception that what we perceive first and foremost aren't objects we perceive meaning we perceive a falling off place if we get too near a cliff and it and i've used this illustration before my office is a mess and if you visit me here people always like oh where do you make your videos and i show them this tiny little corner of my office and the rest of the office is a horrendous mess if i were to open the door and there would be a king cobra or a bengal tiger or a ticking time bomb in my office i would react to those things before i would see them as objects i wouldn't even know why i jumped back we have that all the time i wouldn't know why i jumped back but i i do jump back and before i see it that's his point even we perceive a falling off place if we get too near a cliff and even a six-month-old will perceive that children infants very very young perceive beauty they perceive symmetry they perceive value and so we don't perceive the object and obviously project the meaning you can't say that that's the way the neuroscience of perception has laid out the world and then the last thing is is that the problem with the idea that we merely project meaning onto a meaningless objective world is that meaning is disclosed to us in ways that we can't predict and that are out now that word disclosed he obviously used that very intentionally disclosed implies another agent or agency that reveals something to us disclosed is this so something is moving the curtain back side meaning onto a meaningless objective world is that meaning is disclosed to us in ways that we can't predict and that are outside of our our what would outside of it that the new knowledge that we don't have can be revealed to us through the perception of value it's not it's not obvious how we can project that and then also have something okay you got to slow that down new knowledge can be revealed to us and that's going to get new knowledge can be revealed to us in the perception of value okay that's not objects it's knowledge it's the basis for which we operate in the world is revealed to us through the perception of values new knowledge that we don't have can be revealed to us through the perception of value it's not it's not obvious how we can project that and then also have something new revealed at the same time so meaning is disclosed to us and the phenomenologists phenomenological psychologists made much of this in the like first third of the 20th century following heidegger so so anyways i'm going to leave it at that can i just jump in i go back here to detrick von hildebrand's famous distinction between the merely subjectively satisfying and the objectively valuable and i mean he certainly understood the play between the subjective and the objective and all the classical philosophers knew that acquaintance certainly knew it i mean if the the mind and the intelligible form light up each other he said i mean each each one illumines the other so i don't think the pre-modern people had the sense of you know sharp demarcation of the two nevertheless there's a distinction i think jordan you're hitting at it there we we feel the distinction between the merely subjectively satisfying and the objectively valuable the objectively valuable addresses me it it rearranges me it's not something that i've i've configured or i've projected it it's turned me upside down i think we all had that experience there was an article in rolling stone years ago and it asked a number of the famous rocket and no he's a philosopher and he's as i've mentioned before i mean he's a he's a serious philosopher he's written serious philosophies philosophical books now the question of philosophy we're going to get to that quite a bit later but um again he just laid down some a lot of philosophical terms but now he's going to turn and he's going to use an illustration and this is this is this is what preachers do i can rollers what was the first song that rocked your world and i remember liking the formulation of that question because it didn't say what's the first song you liked it was the first song that changed you that rearranged your consciousness and i can i can name that very clearly my own case was bob dillon's like a rolling stone it wasn't the first song i liked but it was the first song that rocked my world and rearranged me and i think that's what real value is like now bring it to the religious level okay so real value to to sum up so he had you know objective and subjective and and he's dealing with that question that i said i'd really like them to ask is is meaning a feeling and so now we're getting into value so is value a feeling no because value is something that moves us and so in terms of trying to rehabilitate and understand again the word spiritual value is something that we are subject to now our subjection and our slavery to value and we it's we ought not to be slaves to value but we ought to submit to value certain values and not submit to other values etc etc so what we're talking about is is is understanding a working hard not to use that word objective because i i think the word has to be set on a shelf for a hundred years or so value is real enough that it moves us value is real enough that we submit to it value is real enough that it is it is more real than we are now we're in a biblical kind of framework where you know uh it's level now we're in a biblical kind of is like now bring it to the religious level now we're in a biblical kind of framework where you know uh it's not you who've chosen me it's i who've chosen you and now when the summa bonum isn't just dumbly out there waiting for us to rise up through some contemplative exercise because i mean the summa bonum plato and platinus and con could all say you said at once you probably could have said greatest good a couple of times and that would have helped yeah there's a summa bonum but when it really gets interesting to me is when the summa bonum is after me the summa bonum is is trying to find me and is breaking into my reluctant and real calcetrant consciousness and now you're talking about religious revelation but it has to do with that that i don't know stunning objectivity the good think of like iris murdick there she was so strong on that theme that the good confronts us and it changes us and it doesn't let us go and religious revelation is the sort of ultimate expression of that it seems to me now if we if we talk about agent and arena and of course those of you who have listened to enough of my videos know about my god number one god number two god number one is the arenic god god number two is the agentic god now these are not two different gods but these are these are dualities that we um that we see to one degree or another by virtue of how consciousness works is value this is so we get we can get into john verveckis transjective value sort of like meaning certainly has often a transjective quality i've often noticed i i am not a drinker i've when people find out that i'm not a drinker then at some point they get to know me enough they're like is there a reason you're not a drinker are you you are you a friend of bill or clinton no no i'm not alcoholic either i'm just not a drinker but i know a lot of alcoholics and for them walking through a bar or even just the the alcohol aisle at some points in their life may be a very difficult thing there's a value going on there is that agentic is it arenic but now what bishop baron did nicely was he now we're um there's a nice nice little conversation about personification versus personalizing but value has an agency to it that moves us anyway so verveckis can answer i i i i mean i this is something with which i'm in significant agreement but i think it's also important to wonder together why this has become so problematic i think we're in a meaning crisis so yeah um and i think we should remember you know the factor i mean so bishop you invoked aristalt's conformity theory uh and of course that was replaced by a representational theory of knowledge a propositional representational theory for various reasons one was trying to account for the copernican revolution etc we had nominalism that said those patterns aren't out in the world and that's why i keep saying jonathan is more radical than he sometimes realizes because he's challenging a fundamental nominalism in his work yeah um and conti conti is the is the culmination of that the real patterns are only in your mind and we right we have no access to the world and there's reasons why we got there and so jon nicely gives us a little history of philosophy and nominalism as he just said nominalism says that sort of going back to what peterson said before in terms of the values are what we project onto the world that's deeply connected with nominalism that the values aren't there in the world that we recognize that we participate in that we submit to values are what we project on to the world the the alcohol in the wine aisle doesn't have any value we project value onto the alcohol because of our neediness to it there's no inherent good that the wine would have and now i can pull isaiah five in and the parable of the vineyard um all of the the new testament wine is this image in the bible of glory well there's the glory is is all put onto those things it's not actually out there then again jon revaki might say no no it's it's it's between so then is it a renek is it a gentic and then of course there are you know related issues around ideas of levels of being which is you know i think you're right all of you have said this and i and this is you know central to the phenomenology of intelligibility but it seems to be you know contradicted by something that you know starts with scottis and goes through ackham and goes into the heart of the scientific revolution is there's no such thing as levels this this is not a reality just is you know existence isn't a predicate and those kinds of things now i'm not i'm not mentioning these things to espouse them i'm mentioning them to try and indicate there have been very profound philosophical historical developments that have challenged this uh phenomenology um and that part of the task now i think again verveckis opening comment was weak but right here we're seeing why he's such a strong partner in dialogue he has a tremendous amount everyone in this conversation does has a tremendous amount of knowledge from which to pull from but he has been practicing relevance realization here and what he's done in short order is and i know it was fairly technical but it sort of laid the landscape for the history quite briefly and will now turn and make his point um well sorry i don't want to be presumptuous part of what i see my task of being is to try and take the very best of science and answer all of those challenges in a way that restores confidence in the hierarchies of intelligibility and the phenomenology of connectedness now that's one thing i'd want to say the second thing now why are you doing that why why are you called to do that john do you well i'm called to do that and and okay calling now we've got something more than a value that is pulling things out of us and summoning us and of course you use this language and jordan's going to be right there on it and of course jordan and john have enough of a relationship and they're i think as as you can see in this video their relationship is growing because at the the last conversation that they had online you mean jordan's kind of surprised about all the christian stuff that's coming coming out of john because john was the guy who taught the class buddhism and cognitive science and now suddenly john's talking all this christian stuff and jordan's going to go after that a little while and again part of this is is the fun of jordan because there there's sort of a there's sort of a respectability we all don't know each other especially um john and and jonathan has had some interaction with word on fire and he's written for them but john hasn't had much so so there's you know there's tentativeness there jordan's just going to dive in and and that's it's something winsome about that at least for me i'm an interrupter so if i wasn't an interrupter i certainly wouldn't be making these videos where it's a constant interruption because um why that's one thing i'd want to say the second thing now why are you doing that why why are you called to do that john do you well i'm called to do that because um well this is how i i i put it to my students who take my introduction to cognitive science we have a scientific world view in which science and the scientists and their meaning-making have no proper ontological place we are the whole science and and we are the black hole within this okay now john now john's coming out of his shell now he's speaking from the heart we're hearing his calling we're hearing his passion the room has been set everybody's getting a little bit more comfortable with each other and now john is really gonna start to jordan jordan's pulled it out and john's say hey wait a minute this this is something that matters this is something i care about the scientists and their meaning-making have no proper ontological place we are the whole science and and of course peugeot is smiling here because peugeot is like they have no place to stand that's what he keeps saying and they said that's what he said on the symbolic world that's what he said to rationality rules that's what he said to adam you have no place to stand there's no framework from which you can account your entire effort this foundationalism has been accounting for things but you can't account for yourself you you demand that everyone else come to account you can't count you can't account for yourself oh science and we are the black hole within this worldview okay there's the meaning crisis and if he had started what okay i believe we have a meaning crisis what is this meaning crisis we are a black hole in the middle of this world view and we used to be the black hole out of which we imagined we saw everything and now we realize we looked in the mirror and we realized we are the black hole ourselves that this is tied to and there you've got a central image now everything else flows out from it that would have been a powerful opening statement it dominates it so let's let's be very clear and this is how to go to point domination is not just id i ideational or even ideological it is woven into the fabric of our technology the ways we communicate it's it's woven into our cognitive grammar we talk about like even the way that we divide subjective and objective one of gibson's points right jordan you mentioned gibson is the notion of an affordance and an affordance is not i don't know who gibson is so i don't i don't even have the first name to look it up and you'll tell me in the comment section jordan you mentioned gibson is the notion of an affordance and an affordance is not properly objective or subjective the grasp ability of this cup is not a feature of the cup it's not a subjective feature of me it's a real relation between me and so i mean gibson what again gibson's work is really profound this is why it gets taken up into 40 cognitive science he's trying to he's trying to challenge this grammar and there's a whole bunch of us i don't want to i'm in no way a singular individual although i might be a bizarre one but i i mean i represent a lot of people who are feeling john you're not the strangest one in the room here today trust me called to the fact that this this lack of ontological placement and the fact how and the way it ramifies through you know our ontological technological structure and our cultural cognitive grammar the very ways we think is causing causing massive suffering so i'm absolutely right i'm clear about that a bit i'm still unclear about exactly what you mean and see he grabbed the bishop and he had jonathan peugeot i mean that i would have liked to see in that can i pull that can out for the opening statement what is this black hole this is i mean is this the insistence on the absolute distinction between the subjective and the object oh no like what is this black okay so i what is well what i meant i mean it's related to that but what i was what i was directly referring to at the black hole is that science does science exist okay if it is what kind of entity is it and tell me using physics or chemistry or even biology use just though that ontology and those methodology tell me what science is and tell me how it has the status to make the claims it does and tell me how science is related to meaning and truth and how do meaning and truth fit into the scientific worldview they're presupposed by that worldview but they have no proper place within it that's what i mean so whenever we're doing the science and saying this this is what the world is we are absenting ourselves from it we have no home in which we are properly situated and i think that ramifies through everything we think say and do to each other and with each other in a profoundly corrosive way that's what i mean by the meeting okay watch the okay you see peugeot smile in there he's singing peugeot song he's making his points for him profoundly it's caused enormous suffering that's what i mean by the meeting okay what's the profound it's caused enormous suffering it causes enormous suffering so so yeah he's got their attention they're in i mean they i was talking to somebody just the other day in australia and there are more deaths by suicide in australia right now than covid yeah in australia is one of the epitomes of you know the best countries in the world affluent liberal democracy not much conflict been at peace for a long time blah blah blah blah all the things that the enlightenment said would bring in unending happiness and what you have is spiking in suicide you have the loneliness epidemic epidemic you have the addiction epidemic you have people choosing to live in a virtual world rather than the real world you have all of these things that are pointing to the fact that there's a significant stressor you have positive responses too you have the mindfulness revolution you have the resuscitation of ancient you know uh wisdom philosophies like stoicism you you have uh you know you have the work of people like right here i mean one of the things i i hope jonathan takes this as compliment because he knows that how highly i think of him i think one of the things that jonathan is doing with his work is responding to this suffering in the meaning crisis we were drawn to each other because we both saw the zombie as a as a mythological represent the culture was saying to itself we're suffering a meaning crisis i'm talking too much i'm going to stop but this is his best talking and this is when he you know he energized the room again this in terms of the opening statement he didn't start strong but very very quickly is making his points uh is getting people on his side things are going well if we if we go back to the image that you use which is the idea that we project meaning on an objective world already you can see the alienation that is bound up in that very proposition which is okay so where are we then we're not in the world we're like these these kind of ghosts that are floating above reality like and where does that come from like where does that floating intelligence come from that's able to separate itself so completely from the world that that it's able to just analyze it objectively and then project and then realize that okay that's what i call the monarchical vision realize that it's projecting subjective meaning on top of it and so when once i think that some of the work that john's been doing and some of the work that you've been doing is to realize this embodied reality is that we are in the world and we are part and parcel of the manner in which meaning even the world itself discloses itself we people who think they can imagine a world outside of human consciousness like where are they where are these signs where are they standing that they can tell us that we are projecting meaning onto the world are they like gods you know up in up in up in the world they would they would never say that they've taken themselves out of the equation and so and again this is the monarchical vision this is what peugeot you know what he says what he you know rationality rules adam friend did says to them you know where are you standing and the thing is we're so accustomed to making this move of the monarchical vision that i'm outside the world i'm looking down on it and part of the meaning crisis is realizing we can only sort of levitate up and look down if we're a ghost because when we levitate up and we look down we forget ourselves and we act like we don't have these filters and we don't have these biases which again if you look at the video i made about the prolegomena any latin people prolegomenon you might be right but i'm a creature of habit um the the basis of peugeot's business is he flips this around it says we're going to start with the subject we're not going to start at some pre-human point back in time and try and roll forward and in that way try to account for what we are and thereby once we account for what we are we quickly make this move and we self-transcend and then we try to manage the world like a puppet on a string no we're not going to do that game because we can't do it and there's just a lot of lying that goes on in that so let's understand that in many ways it begins with us no does it begin with us doesn't it begin with me there's the conversation but and notice how much energy is coming to this conversation now so coming back into reality and understanding this image of communion for example like a lot of the images that john is is saying is really this image of communions that meaning is relational that it's communal that it's all these things that can help us even understand once again what the religious patterns are for is to just hold it's actually holding reality together and once we've once we've broken that then we get this increasing alienation we get the increasing fragmentation you know the suburbs as just a spread of people they don't know each other they don't have common projects that have nothing in common except that they're living in okay now what's peugeot doing he's taking this this all this abstraction and he's saying well now we see the manifestation of this this meaning crisis in even the architects of the architecture of post-world war two cities in a in a in just this equal space and so this kind of reducing of hierarchy in the world that they that the scientists wanted to happen it's happened now to us and everything's breaking apart and nobody can hear there's the meaning crisis it's right there what we have done to the world has been done to us we did it to the world in order to have this power peterson talks about that in in the transliminal interviews we we shut one eye that's one way that i talk about it often it's the scientistic lab leak that's another way i talk about it and we caught the bug we leaked it from the lab and then we caught it and we had a meaning crisis because i don't know if there's a there there inside of me i have deconstructed all other agencies and now mine has been deconstructed and what have i left it's the whole show as c.s lewis begins in his book miracles hear each other and and it's a it's a direct consequence of that thinking yeah there's a lot that's just stimulating my thinking here and one is i mean god i love the sciences but i hate scientism and scientism is all over and that's an apt point but and this is where i grade him so lowly i mean everybody's everybody's into it bishop barron come on jump in the water's fine it's a fine point about scientism but again i it's not often anyway the place in our culture i deal with it all the time in my evangelical work hearing from not just younger people from everybody in our culture that science is the criterion you know i i saw a video jonathan you and jordan were talking to brett weinstein and it was about i don't know maybe something along these lines but he made very articulately intelligently but made the argument that the sciences the physical sciences belong in the supreme position vis-a-vis all forms of human knowing and i'm shen pizzo's like i'm still waiting i'm still waiting to finish that conversation with brett because he made that move and i called him on it and he he was a weenie about it counting at the screen no no that's exactly where they don't belong and that's a form of scientism uh the medievals call theology like the queen of the sciences well at least you're that's more appropriate you're talking about god and the summon bonum having some kind of uh supremacy i also go right back to the classical world the sciences from a platonic standpoint they're terrific but you're just getting ever more precise accounts of the cave right of the images the fleeting eveness and images of the world to rise to higher forms of consciousness by way of mathematics first of all then then to the higher forms of philosophy metaphysics aristotle you know moving from physics to mathematics to metaphysics it's not to denigrate for a second the sciences aristotle is the founder many ways of physics but it is to say there's a hierarchy again there's an epistemic hierarchy and science physical science does not belong at the top of it when it does something goes really wrong with the human spirit and there's a there's a starvation of the spirit well and it's hard to know how to take that seriously like let's say that's a fact there's a starvation of the human spirit that's a fact well is it a fact like a fact that emerges from physics well not exactly it's a different kind of fact but what happens if we ignore it well people suffer and die and we don't use the fact that in the absence of a proposition people suffer and die as an index of its truth not not from the scientific perspective that that isn't the methodology of science but that leaves us with this problem of of meaning it's sort of delivered to us and it isn't something it isn't obvious to me that science can address it at all i mean sam harris and other thinkers like harris have tried to put the value up to to to bring the domain of value within the domain of science i i think it's it's an effort that's doomed to failure because i don't think they're of the same type i think that science by its very nature excludes it does everything it can to exclude and that's wilfred cellars the manifest image versus the scientific image value except john it it leaves us with the problem you described which is the problem that you addressed when he was tying the development of empirical science back to alchemy because and this goes back to the idea of the hierarchies that we started out with you know you believe that he was really curious about why people ever became motivated to take things apart like scientists did to concentrate on the minute like that what now this is a part of the conversation i was very interested in because peterson has made this point again and again and again part of the weakness of so part of the weakness of the way jordan has gone about the first and second wave is that some of these things it's not it's not very easy to check people will criticize them in other videos people will doubt them but it's better in a context like this where now there's a degree of trust everybody knows we're talking in good faith here we're we're looking to grow together we can we can check each other we can we can work on things and so this is an idea that he's brought out many times and i've always wondered about it and i don't have the competency to to evaluate it and so with bishop barron with john vervecki with jonathan pageau you know i'm i'm looking for it and there's going to be some evaluation of this idea dream drove them what fantasies drove them and for for young it was he found that fantasy in the thousands of years of work on alchemy and the alchemical notion was there exists a substance which eventually became a material substance whose discovery would grant upon its bearer immortality perfect health and endless wealth so the idea the now that as he just said it is a really powerful image that sort of typifies and i see why this idea grabs jordan with respect to this conversation because that is how we're acting in a materialist age if i can only buy this one thing if i can possess this one thing it's it's almost an application of jesus pearl at great price of great price if i can possess this one thing then then it's like this moment of ecstasy and fullness and euphoria and kingdom come will come right there right now at the possession of this thing dream was that substance could be found in the material world and that was a deep deep unconscious fantasy manifested in all sorts of images all sorts of bizarre images that you had the genius to be able to analyze and understand he saw that as the dream that preceded the development of science in in in western culture thousands it took thousands and thousands of years to unfold this dream and scientists were encapsulated within that dream whether they knew it or not and so the prime example would be newton who wrote much more on alchemy than he did on physics and so and so john as scientists at least from the union perspective let's say we're necessarily motivated by a narrative that we don't understand scientifically to engage in the scientific process per se and we're so deeply possessed by that that it it guides and moves our perceptions without us as scientists even necessarily having to be aware that we're participating in that narrative so to your point the whole enterprise is driven by a dream whose reality can't be encapsulated within the process itself now apart from the historical point about young and alchemy and newton boy just makes me want to read a good biography of newton i don't know if there's a i'll have to do a little research on that as if i need to buy another book for fake he's been he's been pushing my book buying button a lot lately he made a book he mentioned to sam a book from carlisle on spinoza's religion that just sounded fascinating so i still haven't finished some of the other books i bought because john recommended me and anyway so so apart from the historical point about young and alchemy and newton the point he makes here at the end i think is really gripping in that it's exactly the same point that john vervecki made that scientists are moved by something and they never ask hey wait a minute what's moving me it's a very strange thing i think it's very interesting uh that dream and and and and sort of the undercurrents of development so substance goes back to hypostasis but of course there's another history of hypostasis which is into the persons of the trinity which is a very different history and so there's there's no necessity that you go from hypostasis the grounding of intelligibility to materiality and of course what happened right was also the inversion of matter as pure potential to that which resists and yes so and i think that's part of again about how a history of how um now he made two really huge points very very quickly there you know theThese nodes. well a history of how the reason was supplanted by will as the dominant faculty by which humans understood and identified themselves. I would like to say that that's bound up with a couple other strands. I wish I could do exhaustive history here, but I took 50 hours to do it. So I'm not gonna try and do it now. But you also have people like Harris and others, you have a deductivism model, right? Which is whatever I can deduce from the science is real. But in the neoplatonic tradition, you also look at what is presupposed by your sciences. And that is also a proper location for the real. So I have to presuppose, right? The intelligibility of the world in order to do science. I can't use science to establish intelligibility. And then if I'm realistic about my science, which I better be because that's what scientists seem to be doing, I have to be realistic about this intelligibility. But that's in the contradiction to the normalist presuppositions, the flat ontology. Notice the contradiction. Notice the contradiction in reductionism. So you have this whole tradition that says there are no levels of being, get rid of all that platonic stuff. But the bottom level is the really real level and all the levels above it are false. That is exactly symmetrical to the upper level is most real and everything coming down from it is just derivative. Now again, he packed a ton into there. So you might wanna go back and listen to it a few times to, okay, what's he saying? How is this connected? And basically just flip the script on there are no levels of reality, but science is most real. Well, wait a minute, you just said there are no levels. It's sort of this, what we do when we forget what we said at the beginning of the sentence by the time we get to the end of the sentence. There's no deep difference. This is part of the point I've made between an emergentist ontology. It is hierarchical and has levels and an emanationist. It is hierarchical and have levels. And so do you think dark and selfish gene is an example of that? I think the idea that you can explain things in a purely bottom up fashion, this is part of the alchemical revolution. And I think, and I agree with Young on this and maybe my interpretation is slightly different, but there was a predominance of emanation and emanationist ontology coming out of the neoplatonic tradition. And we needed to rediscover. Okay, so let me address that for a second, drag the Christians in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Last time Christians got dragged someplace. It didn't end well. The one of the claims that, one of the claims, yeah, I know. One of the claims that Young made in his works on alchemy, which are very, very difficult to understand, was that look, the Christian revolution took place and spread across, well, across what became Christian, the Christian cultures and the West, broadly speaking. And there was an offer of salvation, of deliverance from suffering. And the hope that Christ would return in the kingdom of heaven would be established on earth or something to that end. And then thousands of years went by and the disquiet grew as that wasn't revealed. And the unconscious imagination looking to find a source of new knowledge that could redress that suffering and lack started to focus on this emergent, this opposite emergent ontology that you described. So we haven't. Okay, this is the assertion that Peterson makes again and again. And he articulated a little bit more fully now that this was an unconscious desire that maybe we go and if we start from the bottom, we can in fact redeem this world. In some ways you can see the attractiveness of that idea. Jonathan Bajaud's gonna attack it pretty hard in a minute. Paid sufficient attention to the reality of the material world. Maybe that's what holds the key to the alleviation of our suffering. And so then there's a pull away from the top down, this top down hierarchical structure that Christianity had imposed in some sense or revealed to the opposite. And now it's swung way in the other direction. And so. Could I just say one thing in the defense of the Neoplatonists, which is, if you read Aragina and Cusa, Aragina is clear on this, you get a dialectical in the Platonic sense, not the Hegelian sense, in which the emanation and the emergence completely interpenetrate. They're both needed and they interpenetrate each other. And I would argue that what's happening now is people are moving, especially in the philosophy of biology, we need bottom up and top down. Jordan, this is rife through all of cognitive psychology, bottom up, top down thinking. And that's not just specific to the mind. I think it's now spreading out as, no, no, this is how we should start to think about it. But I think- Grim Grizz on his channel took a little bit from Kurt Jamungul, if I get his name right. I've spoken with Kurt. Verveke has, Peterson has, he's doing a filmmaker thing. He spoke to this guy about what they did was, they basically were growing frogs in, not a frog like way. Now, of course, Grim Grizz in his own way said, that looks like a horse. Well, they weren't really growing horses from frog cells. But this point about bottom up and top down, that's an illustration of the point that Verveke is making. So the specific Grim Grizz video is Frog Skin Abominations, Kurt and Levin. And Grim does have a Patreon, which he'd like you to know about. And there's been a hundred views on this video, but I thought it was actually quite an excellent video. And it basically made the same point that this video is making. A more proper reading, especially of the later neoplatonists, points to that heritage within neoplatonism itself. So it doesn't have to be something necessarily foreign to Christianity, I would at least argue. No, St. Maximus is clearly at bottom up and top down at the same time. In St. Maximus' cosmology, you have the notion that these revelations are both a communion of love and also a revelation from above. And that there's absolutely no contradiction between the elements coming together and coagulating in this relationship of love and in expressing this divine principle or this higher principle, which is coming down from above. And in terms of Jung's theory, I mean, I don't wanna be picky about it, that he kind of imagined this story. Alchemy came very much from Islam, by the way. A lot of its development was in the Islamic world. Even the word alchemy is not a Western word. And so I find it a little too simplified to just say Christians were waiting for Jesus and then they created this bottom up science. There's a deeper- kind of transformation which happened in the West related to nominalism and to a kind of slow progression towards this separation of heaven and earth. We could call it like this kind of ripping apart of the two sides of the world. And so I find that it's a little too simplified to just say Christians were waiting for Jesus and then they created this bottom up science. There's a deeper kind of transformation which happened in the West related to nominalism and to a kind of slow progression towards this separation of heaven and earth. Of the two sides, which kind of led both to materialism and to all these esoteric things that were going on at the same time, right? And that's a really helpful point that it isn't just the materialism, it's a ripping apart. And that led to the estrangement on both ends. It's not true that materialism was on its own, but there are all these kind of esoteric developments that were manifesting themselves. We have to remember that Descartes spent his whole life trying to become a Rosicrucian. These two things were, it's like a ripping apart of reality that leads into the new age, into all this kind of neo-spirituality. And Christianity's true message is rather the incarnational one. It's the one that John said. It really is this binding of multiplicity and unity, the binding of the emanational part and this kind of emergent part together. And so, Abhisham, sorry, I interrupted you. No, it's very stimulating stuff. But I would add, the structuring. And when he, you almost get the sense that three people are having the conversation and he's part of the audience, but he's not as obnoxious as I am to just butt in. But again, these three have been working on stuff. They've done a lot of distributed cognition together. And well, here's Bishop Barron. Element in the Summa of Aquinas is the so-called exetus raditus, right? All things coming out from God. And then more Latin and more Aquinas. And you can make the point in a way that some of the rest of us on the other side of the fourth wall might be able to access a little better, even though in all fairness, I mean, John Vervecky is tough to understand, but, and he does drop into Latin sometimes and has his own little words. I mean, dialogos and religio and those things. But there's just that, you're almost, you're almost just reinforcing a stereotype here that this is how a bishop would talk. And there's no problem with how a bishop would talk, but in the context of this conversation, I don't know. Then all things returning to God. And so God makes a world that's good, indeed very good, but not perfect. And part of the drama of salvation, which is in the Bible always cosmic, not just human, not just personal. The drama of salvation is this wonderful process of raditus, the return of all things to God, the coming together from below if you want, but under the alluring power of God's love. So that's just one observation. The second one about the son. And again, his points are always good and they're right on target. And again, his opening statement was really strong, but I'd sort of rather see Brett Sockold in here, another Canadian, but if you need a Catholic, get Brett in there, because Brett'll, you almost see Brett showing up in his flannel shirt and jumping all over the place and getting excited. And so I like talking to Brett. I haven't talked to him for a while. I should probably talk to him again. Sciences, I mean, I agree with, there's an army of scholars that say the condition for the possibility of the physical sciences in the West was Christianity. That is to say the fundamental assumption. Another element I think of how he participates in this is we all wanna make points for our team, myself included. And part of, when I talk with John, I mean, I'm trying to make points for Christianity. He's got some points against it. I concede some points against that. And Bishop Baron does too. They'll get to a portion in this video where Bishop Baron, like clergy, like myself, will do a lot of critiquing of our own house. But it's just, I'd like to see the tribal, I'd like to see the tribal wall come down a little bit more in terms of his participation here. And again, maybe it's just because he's, unlike the other three, he's sort of a fish out of water, whereas Brett Sockold, I think, would be another, be a fun Canadian in this mix. That the world is not God. If you divinize the world, you're not gonna experiment on it. You're not gonna analyze it in this sort of objectivizing way. So the world is not God. It's been created. Therefore, it can be experimented upon. It can be analyzed. But then secondly, as we've all been saying in different. And I think that's a strong point. Now, how it relates to my God number one and Newton loving God by exploring God with physical sciences. There's a ton of nuance in there. But I thought that point that he made was a very strong one. It is radically intelligible. Not just in a superficial way, not just in certain parts, but in every nook and cranny, the universe is intelligible. That's a very weird thing the more you think about it. Why should that be the case? And of course, it's coming out, I would argue, of a Christian conception that the world did come forth. The Bible puts it poetically as a great act of speech, meaning it's imbued with intelligibility from an intelligent source. Well, when you bring intelligibility and non-divinity together, you get the rise of the modern sciences. So they're not the least bit repugnant to Christianity, on the contrary. What is repugnant is the scienti- Before he, I was gonna go on to scientism again, but another aspect of his participation in this is I often get the sense that he's continuing to address most of the stock points in so many of the Christian versus atheist little spats on YouTube. And part of the hope of this little corner of the internet is to get beyond some of that. Tism, and you've all been hinting at it in different ways. Trace it to people like Descartes, but I'm with John, I'd go right back to Don Scotus and Occam and the breakdown of- They were Catholics? Huh, huh, huh, huh? Yeah, but they started Protestantism. Participation metaphysics. And when you get this univocal conception of being and following from that nominalism, and I would even dare say certain forms of Protestantism are very much conditioned by that way of looking at things, you get a lot of the problems we're facing today. I'm for a recovery of the pre-modern, this wonderfully rich pre-modern sense of a participative view of being. The world in God, the world reflecting God, not a world of separated things and God being the supreme thing among them. So Aquinas says that God is not the supreme being. And if you go to my conversation with John about classical theism and non-theism, we had that conversation after this conversation. If you remember at the beginning of that conversation, John said, ah, I wish this conversation, I wish this particular four horsemen conversation was out so we could talk about it, but we'll get another chance to talk about it, I hope. Lord willing, there's my little Christian saying. He doesn't call him ensumum, but he calls him ipsum esse, to be itself. So there's a whole view of reality that's implicit in that description of God. I once, there was a guy, he was Phrygian. We were in the Dominican Republic. We were all living in the guest house. He was a rough Phrygian, and he married a woman from The Hague, a very refined lady, and she was there helping the little evangelical library do their thing. And the rough Phrygian was helping build benches. The rough Phrygian had trouble getting along with the Dominicans. His refined wife had no problem getting along with the Dominicans, and I was staying in the guest house, and he was Phrygian, and his wife was Dutch from The Hague, as my friend Tim Blackman says, like the froth. So unknowingly, not knowing anything about anything, I said to him, oh, it's nice you have your wife here. You can speak Dutch with her. And he looks at me, he says, I don't speak Dutch. Dutch is for the preachers and the lawyers. I said, well, what do you speak? I speak English to my wife. Okay, I do too. I don't know any Dutch or Phrygian. I just kind of want to tell Bishop Baron, just lay off the Latin a little. I don't speak Latin. Latin is for the bishops and the priests. I speak English. Not all in good fun. I do really love Bishop Baron, and I listened to his, in fact, his video on transubstantiation that Mary Cohen sent me to after I said some inaccurate things on my channel that offended my good Roman Catholic friend, Mary Cohen, and she said, listen to Bishop Baron on transubstantiation. I listened, I thought, that's not very different from what I believe. And then of course I read Brett Sackle's book, and it's like, oh my goodness, we've got to do something about this Protestant Reformation. This is a real problem. So anyway, I do love Bishop Baron, but there's a sense that he's not quite, he's not one of the cool kids in this conversation. He's not kind of on the same page as the other three. God, and that is repugnant to scientism in its various forms, to be itself. So there's a whole view of reality that's implicit in that description of God, and that is repugnant to scientism in its various forms. And I think that's the key to recovering a lot of sense of religious meaning. He does know how to stop talking though, which is something I can't often say for myself. So, and I've said before in my videos, I sometimes watch his videos and think, I wish I were more like Bishop Baron. I wish I had all of those cool words and was self-controlled and knew how to shave, but I just gotta be me. I really liked the invocation of the participatory. Part of what I've been arguing is that the cutting edge cognitive science, what's called 4E cognitive science, is challenging the reduction of knowing to propositional knowing, knowing that something's okay, that what we're discovering, and you can even find specific kinds of memory for each one of these. There's also procedural knowing, there's knowing how to do something with skills. There's perspectival knowing, which is knowing what it's like to, John gets introduced as four P's, be here in this state of mind, in this situation, giving me situational awareness. And then the deepest is participatory knowing. This is the way in which we know by how we are conformed and transformed by others, by the world, so that our knowing of ourself and our knowing of this. So you see this, of course, prototypically in the way you know your beloved. You don't know them by yourself. Maybe we can get John a better camera. Although most of the videos he doesn't do from this spot, but this camera, this camera's just not up to snuff. So I know it costs a little money, but get a Sony, and if you can get a Sony A6400 with a fast lens like the Sigma lens, it's a fairly reasonably priced lens. Or even if you just get a Sony ZV-1, which is a nice little vlogging camera, it's got enough, really got as many features as the big Sony. It'll do, you know, it'll give you a nice crisp picture and that'll help. Your skills or your proposition, of course you know them this way, but this is not the essence of it. The essence of it is the way, you know, you are conforming to them and you're being transformed. So your self-knowledge and your knowledge of them are bound together. But this is now becoming, these ways of talking about other kinds of knowing and the way in which they, you know, are stored in different kinds of memory, right, procedural memory, episodic memory, that weird kind of memory we call the self. This is now coming to the fore. But here's the point I wanna make. The point is, right, we've suffered kind of a propositional tyranny from Occamon, where we reduced all of knowing to the propositional. And I would argue that most of what I called religio is being carried on by the procedural and the perspectival and the participatory. So say we all. And so that is in a fundamental way, how it's not just out there, it's like right in the guts of our self-interpretation. Yeah, again, weak opening statement, but in some of these sections, especially, so I'm gonna be ending this pretty quickly because my time I have today to work on this is ending. And then we're gonna get into the whole psychedelic thing, which this is the toughest part of the video. The psychedelics kind of carry it for a while and then we're gonna have to have that conversation again. But then the end of the video, the video really ends strong, but in some of these parts in the first hour, John really carries the conversation and he's doing it with passion and conviction. Now, again, it's pretty dense stuff. You have to know a lot to understand what he's talking about and could have used a few more illustrations in there just to help Chad the alcoholic have any idea what John was saying or maybe hope to. But again, Chad the alcoholic isn't one of the individuals here and part of what I tend to do in a lot of these conversations is always sort of say, okay, well, let's pause that and tell me that again in a way that your mother can understand, assuming that your mother isn't also a PhD in cognitive science or psychology or philosophy or something like that, but your mother who loves you and who trusts you, but who would really love to know what you mean when you use these fancy words. And I haven't done a lot of that translating for John here because I've done some in other videos and to really break down all that stuff would extend the length of this. Generally speaking, it's about an hour for, so to treat an hour of video usually takes about three hours for me and something like this. So as long as I don't have too many rabbit trails. I think one of the questions is what is the ontological significance of that, let's say. Okay, so what is the ontological significance or what are the implications of this ontologically? Is there, and of course this is where Jordan Peterson's bleeding edge really is. Now the point that he always gets to when this is as far as he can push things psychologically and can we really live into a Christian ontology? Can we get at this? Again, now he's deeply modernist in that he wants it justified. He wants to see the foundations of it. But this is of course is his ceiling and what keeps driving him. Now, whether he's making any progress in this, that's a difficult question, but this is where we're at. What is the ontological significance of that, let's say? Leaving aside the truth or lack thereof of various religious claims, one of the... Hate to make another camera point, but I always get camera questions. Look at where the camera is focused. It's focused on his mic stand. It's not focused on his face. A Sony camera, right now I'm looking at the little viewfinder of my Sony camera, it's locked right on my face. Now there's a little switch you can do to have it, wherever I move, it stays focused on my face. So if you really wanna up your game, now he's got a great mic and he sounds good and that's more important than the video. But if you really wanna do a video where right here, what Peterson said right there, we look at each other's eyes, it's what we do. So if you really wanna have your eyes in focus, no matter what you do, the cannons are good too, but I have a Panasonic, can't focus well. Sony, good lens, even just a ZV-1, which has a good lens. It's built into it, it's a little cheaper, it's about $700. Where's my Sony endorsement? Anyway, I distract myself and I'm sure I'm annoying you. Weaknesses, I believe, leaving aside the truth or lack thereof of various religious claims. One of the weaknesses, I believe, of the rational atheist's position is that, first of all, their argument is carried out almost entirely in the propositional landscape. They treat religion as if it's a set of propositions that are- And what did Vervecky say? It's the tyranny of the proposition. I've been talking about this for a long time. It's helpful to understand why we gave over our freedom to the propositional. That was part of the exchange of the scientific lab leak. That we, it's kind of like Odin giving up an eye. We gave up one eye, if you will give us mastery over nature so we can bind her and make her our own and make her do our bidding for us. That's the exchange we made and now, this is the biggest change we've made. And now, this is the way sin works. Now, we are its victim. Now, we are, it is our master. And the proposition, it's the tyranny of the proposition. I thought John said that really well. Some, they treat religion as if it's a set of propositions. And in all fairness to them, and Bishop Aaron later in this conversation will make points that I think are dead on right. He was trained a generation before me. He's, I think, a number of years older than I am, even though I look older, which I guess has its benefits. As my grandmother would hate the beard, but. This tyranny of the propositional was totalizing in theology, biblical studies, all over the place. And by the time I got to seminary in the 80s, it was already starting to wane in that increasingly our seminary professors and us as students were enamored by much more of a literary approach, because I think the reason we did, we were more enamored by that was the meaning was in it. And I have some of my commentaries back here. They have their grammatical, historical, which are of absolutely no use to a preacher because they sort of strip all the meaning out and the only meaning left is an authorial intent. And that then gets tricky, especially if you're a Christian and you've got to navigate old and new. Are in some sense expressed in a manner contrary to the propositions that constitute science. And then I think, well, wait a minute, guys, you're missing the point here. And there's a propositional element to religious claim. And I often think that's the weakest element of, but what do you make of the fact that people have. Now, if you look at the little video I did and my wife said, I look like one of those old sailor motifs. Sorry, this makes really bad audio. This video where I'm in my car, Grim Grizz didn't like the portrait. I should have flipped the camera over. I didn't have it selfie stick with me. I was just in Costco. I would have had a better camera too if I had thought I was gonna make a video. So I just had the phone that was with me, but this is part of the point of the psychedelic that you're not gonna get, are you? Well, if you're a thorough going scientist, you can't get a propositional from a psychedelic. And that's part of the alleviation of the fear that you're opening gateways for other spirits into you that Christians, at least sufficiently Christians, people who are sufficiently traditional have. Say, oh, this is just psychology. So I guess no space elves or I don't know. The DMT opens the door. I don't know enough about it. And I'm not going to play with it to find out. And I'm not against the clinical study of it. I don't think clinical study is by definition hazardous to people who subject themselves to it. But this point about the propositional is really important. Religious experiences. What do you make of that exactly? That's the weakest element. But what do you make of the fact that people have religious experiences? What do you make of that exactly? Well, you say, well, that's epiphenomenal. It's like, well, yeah, is it really? Like, are you so sure about that? Okay, so notice before he noted that the value was epiphenomenal, same word he used. The value was epiphenomenal to the materialist that says, it's the objects out there and we're projecting value onto the objects. And notice that's exactly the same move that the materialist are making with respect to religion. Now the religion is epiphenomenal and this is what Peterson is questioning. And this is his ceiling. He always goes just up to this line and destiny made the same point. Now a number of people have sufficiently said, this opening thing that he says. What Jordan Peterson does is Jordan Peterson makes a lot of descriptive claims, but he never makes any normative claims. Jordan Peterson's always in trouble for his normative claims. But with this respect, these guys make a really good point. So Jordan Peterson will say things like, women are not as happy today as they used to be. Women and men don't get along in the office. Men tend to be. And it's always these issues that they point to, even though this is just a portion of what he talks about, but this of course is what fuels his, and a very, and a very, I got my fancy verbatim words mixed up. And a very, and a gentic, aureanic, dynamical situation. That's what fuels Jordan Peterson's status rocket ride. You better at this thing. And then that's all he ever says. He never goes, he never takes a step further to make a prescriptive claim to say like, what should we do about something? Peterson's, the guy who's known for telling people they should clean their room. So don't say he never takes a prescriptive claim. That's not true. But with respect to this line that Jordan Peterson is right at here. And the problem is a lot of people will take the things that he says, and then they like jump to very bad places. Very bad places, like becoming religious. Might be so bad that you're a pastor. Obviously, it's where you would expect someone to go based on what he said, but then he never takes responsibility for any of the, I'm not gonna take responsibility for anything that you do after listening to my words. I should. The kind of normative leaps people make off of his descriptive ones. And that's kind of the annoying thing with dealing with Jordan Peterson. And here, destiny is, as he often is, bang on the money. Jordan doesn't necessarily smuggle bad ideas himself, but he facilitates an environment that makes it incredibly easy for others to do so. He's an enabler. He doesn't say that women should fulfill the role of looking after children. It's always these issues. But he does clear the path for those who do. Clears the path. Given this, the question is, how responsible is Jordan for the damage done by his rhetoric? How much responsibility is on the cross on his back? Truth be told, I don't know. I'd like to know your thoughts, so you can let me know in the comments, but what is for certain is that he bears some responsibility. Let's get past the culture war stuff. Jordan Peterson is not a Jesus smuggler, but he is a Jesus smuggler smuggler. Ah, ah. That's because he goes right up to the line. Anyhow, as always. Talk more about this. You get set 11 minutes and 28 seconds, not a long video in my book. You could just basically note that Peterson brings people right up to the edge here, and they take the next step right over the doorway into the church, and Jordan still stands at the door. And, are we gonna go this far? Let me give you an example. So, I talked to Brian Murorescu and Karl Rock a while back, and they'd be doing some investigation into the Aleusinian Miss. So, I am going to stop this here, because I'm really glad that he brought it up, because it was interesting, because Bishop Barron and Jonathan Peugeot basically held their peace. I was thinking more about this. Why are churches so against this? Let me give you an illustration. Why is Major League Baseball so against steroids? Why is professional cycling so against juicing? Why all of the drug testing in professional sports associations? Now, if you're playing in a church softball league or you're playing in pickup games or some other league and you wanna use performance enhancing drugs, nobody's gonna stop you. You'll hit further. You'll do all of that. But what you can't do is construct much more a communal, coherent, coherent, cohesive enterprise on these things. And that's why baseball, yeah, you'll roid up, but not everything will hold together. I think that's a helpful example. And that's part of the reason in the church, no, we want you to spend your time in meditation, spend your time in prayer, spend your time in song, spend your time pursuing your spiritual exercises so that you can hit that ball out of the park. But the individual home run is, and I think in the second part, Peugeot and Bishop Barron will talk well about this. And I seem to come down pretty much, at least with what Bishop Barron articulated here, I'm with him there. And so that always brings out the interesting comments and personal comments too, because people who know me from the meetup, there are far more people that have experimented with psychedelics than I ever knew before I started this thing. But nothing I have heard has brought me to the point where I would say it's in the interest of the church to promote these as a form of pursuing Christ. That's where I'm at, that's where I'm at. I think there's, I don't have a problem with Johns Hopkins studying them pharmaceutically. We do lots of things pharmaceutically with lots of different drugs. I think, I mean, at least listening to them, there seems to be some basis for it. But in terms of the church, I want people to hit their home runs after working out in the gym, spending time in the batting cage. So there's, and I know I had a conversation with Sevilla about this. I've had a conversation with a number of people and I know a number of you tell me and I don't question you or judge you on this that you came to Christ and you came to the church as a result of some of your experimentation with psychedelics. I'm not going to, you're not gonna lose status in my eyes for saying that. But the question that those of us who have, Bishop Aaron and I both have in common, those of us who have positions of authority in the church, do we imagine that the church should promote the use of this as, let's say, an evangelistic tool? I'm not there. I very much doubt Bishop Aaron would be there. Jordan is much more curious and open about that than I am. I am skeptical not that individuals can't have profound, ecstatic, even transformative experiences with them, but that this is a edifying practice for the community to promote and participate in, in the same way that you can roid up and hit a baseball further, but it's not good for Major League Baseball. It's not good for the Olympics. It's not good for the professional cycling because what we're trying to do as a community is build up together. So we'll have to talk about more of that when we get into it. So we're 56, 43 in. I'm gonna pause here because for the next long while, it's gonna be about the psychedelics. And actually for the next half hour, it's a lot of the psychedelic stuff. And I think actually the final half hour of the video is the best half hour. So, well, there you go. This is part one. I hope to do this in two parts, Sam and Hank, if you were betting on how many parts this would take. I'm not saying I won't return to it because again, often I read your comments on these kinds of things. And I was going back and forth on Twitter with Nate and I take your input and my opinions about these things change. And I know a lot of you have sent me messages about psychedelics and you've not moved me yet. You can continue to send me messages about psychedelics. Again, you won't lose status with me if you tell me that you have taken them. As a pastor, people tell me all kinds of things. And it is for me a spiritual discipline to not have people lose status for good faith, heartfelt things that they try or do. It doesn't mean I will change my mind about the moral valence of some of these things or about the functionality or potential of some of these things. So it seems to me that the psychedelic conversation, we're just at the beginning of it. And maybe, Peterson later says, this is something the church is gonna have to come to terms with. And I think he's right. That's been obvious to me in these four years that I've been working on this stuff. But my opinion of it still hasn't changed. And I really don't see myself wavering on it. Yep, that'll be the next part. But this is good enough for now. So let me know what you think. Like I said, there'll be less video production this week. This is a long one. I was just thinking that if I finish this up tomorrow, if this one is probably three hours or so, maybe I'll, I will post this one, today is Tuesday. I will post this one Wednesday morning. And then Thursday, there'll be a little meditation on Thanksgiving, which I'll just basically pull out of, I'm doing a larger little video for the church, my church channel, because we're not having an in-person Thanksgiving service. And then Friday, maybe I'll post the second episode of this. And then Saturday, Lord willing, if I get my rough draft for Sunday, video done tomorrow, again, my sermon's gonna be really rough drafty, because they'll do a lot of more thinking between Wednesday and Sunday, with respect to what I'll say on Sunday. So Saturday should be the rough draft. If Freddie shows up, we might have a Freddie and Paul show on Sunday. I'll also post my Romans class on Sunday. If you want to watch the Romans class live, you can watch it on the church YouTube channel, we stream it live. Rick helps us with that. There might not be a video on Monday morning, because I don't know that I'll have an extra one, unless sometime this weekend I grab my camera, and usually if I do a quick take like that, I usually want to post it right away. So that's the way things are gonna go. Then Monday, what do I got, Monday on my schedule. I have something Monday. I think I have a conversation Monday. I think it's gonna be a good one. So we'll see next week, Friday next week, I have to fly in and out of Salt Lake for a church business. Yeah, but I try to make enough videos for you. And thanks for watching, and let me know what you think in the comment section.
