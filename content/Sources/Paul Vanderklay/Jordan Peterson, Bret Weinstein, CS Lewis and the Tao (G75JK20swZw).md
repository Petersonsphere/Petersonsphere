 Hi, this is Paul. We're gonna get back into the abolition of man and a little bit of review over my last video from Alistair McGrath, but I want to begin again where Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris began in the Vancouver talks because so the first thing is I think I think that partly what's driving you if this is accurate is that You want to ground a structure of ethics in something solid and and and there's two There's two things you want to avoid two catastrophes Let's say one is the catastrophe that you identified with religious fundamentalism and the other is the catastrophe that's associated with moral relativism Is that is that reasonable? Yeah, that's good. Okay, good. Good. Okay. Well, no, but this okay and so again Just at this at the outset Peterson and Harris and Weinstein are all aspiring to moral objectivity Objective moral values. They are they are not relativists and well and we'll hear this later because because Harris will say Auschwitz was wrong. The gulag was wrong. This is this is not a relativist position now There we go In my in my last video with Alastair McGrath that actually Alastair McGrath actually makes kind of a nice segue into this and I'm gonna use a bunch of the stills that Alastair McGrath Had in his presentation in that video Talked about Alex Rosenberg and Alex Rosenberg is about embracing Neilism or what I would say the can and the you know, the this is what we're able There's some there's some ties to to Nietzsche here. Perhaps Alex Rosenberg is there a god? No, and these are these are his answers. Okay, he's he's very brief and to the point about them Is there a god? No, what is the nature of reality? What physics says it is? What is the nature of the universe? There is not what is what is the purpose of the universe? There is none. What is the meaning of life? Ditto? What is the difference between right and wrong good and bad? There is no moral difference between them so okay, so Rosenberg is not on the same page as Harris or Weinstein or Peterson or Or Douglas Murray for that matter Couple more Rosenberg quotes from his book science provides all the sufficient truths about reality And knowing such truths is what real understanding is about That's a definition of understanding and you listen to note in the network. He does a lot of good work on Understanding and he's been reading Cardinal Ratzinger introduction to Christianity and a number of people have recommended that book to me and I'm Thinking of picking it up and starting to work on it because Some of the stuff that note has been putting out with respect to Ratzinger's book sounds like it's very much barking up the same Tree which one of the watchers of my videos You know who you are. You've asked questions at a variety of Peterson events pretty early on I mean you kept pushing Ratzinger and you know, we tend to pick up books that eventually we see the purpose for but There's a lot built into Alex Rosenberg's Definition here that that he just kind of asserts he doesn't defend Science provides all this all the significant truths about reality knowing such truths is what real understanding is about and again This is a this is an assertion being science being Scientistic means just means treating science as our exclusive guide to reality To nature both to our nature and everything else's and so it's interesting when you listen to Rosenberg on one hand in terms of the celebrity atheists that would be Dilla hunty and Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins and we can even throw Woodford Rationality rules into that mix they're all in this, you know, they're all in there But now Rosenberg says give up the purpose business It's it's just not it's just not there what is scientism a total a totalizing attitude that regards science as the ultimate standard and arbiter of all under of all interesting questions or alternatively that seeks to expand now interesting is such an in such an interesting word in terms of how it pops up in these Debates and you can get into this entire a priori system and that which directs our Interest that's part of this a priori system that Peterson is working on or Alternatively that seeks to expand the very definition and scope of science to encompass all aspects of human knowledge and understanding That's what scientism is now Alex Rosenberg, you know says we have to be neolists now again It's if you're a true neolist Can you establish an ought because I think one neolist to another would say Shrug if we're if there is no purpose why ought we to Assert there is no purpose If there is no purpose, it's absolute freedom Then then we're in a sense back to Nietzsche and and it's only can and and can becomes in a sense must But but must only lives beneath can Okay, we have to be we have to be neolists about the purpose of things in general and again every time I read a sentence like that I chuckle because Why would a neolist say such a thing like this? He's got no he's got no ground upon which to make the must assertion to give the art We have to be neolists about the things in general about the purpose of Biological life in particular and the purpose of life in general. There is no purpose and this is where I get into my Little rectangle here where you have reason from above experience or empiricism from below you have some knowledge of the past It's history its record But but there can be no future and so the future is completely open. There is no ought about the future there There you you only have the indicative Okay, and when we get into Lewis, we're going to talk about the indicative and the imperative but but all there is is the indicative That's all there can be that's what? Scientism will say every time a sign a Scientist person uses the word have to or ought or must or should they are violating their own system they are they are simply being hypocrites because Where is the should of nihilism? Ultimately science and scientism are going to make us give up illusory Why would it make us give it up because again if there is no purpose than any purpose it is as good as the next Are going to make us give up as illusory the very thing conscious experience screams out at us loudest and Longest the notion that when we think our thoughts are about anything at all inside or outside our minds the the elephant on the rider Is a purely shattering creature and has very little to say or do about anything We're just We're just rather disconnected creatures Yammering about things which makes his prophecy here all that more difficult to imagine Could happen So there's there's an actually an atheist moral menu here Alex Rosenberg There is no good only can and science affords you power and science I think and technology afford you power But but don't ask what you is Just keep doing what you want and and that's that's some of the difficulties It's obvious to look at the difficulties of of faith for many of you those difficulties are evident But the difficulties of this position may not be so evident to you because In a sense at some point you just have to say so what now Iris Murdoch who? Alastair McGrath turns to next says no not there there has to be a transcendent good or or none of this stuff that we've built Will finally make any sense One of the main problems of moral philosophy might be formulated thus Are there any techniques for the purification and reorientation of an energy which is naturally selfish? Okay now we're gonna get into this quite a bit because this is the question of the selfish gene or the assassin robot And is there is there any way to purify is there any way to reform? Can we improve because finally if you look at the celebrity atheists their goal is the reformation of humanity Just like Gaius and Titius wanted to reform those students that they were supposed to be teaching English to in the abolition of the abolition of man So techniques for the purification or reorientation of an energy which is naturally selfish in such a way that when moments of choice Arise so there's a you here, and there's choice here. We shall be sure to act rightly So in other words well what is rightly rightly would be that which? conforms to reality and that's when you listen to Dilla hunty and Sam Harris and And and rationality rules This is exactly what they are saying that we ought to conform to reality and what that means is that there is a moral? Order out there. There is objective value you can be better or worse If you have two plus two Five is a better answer than six. It's closer Four is the best answer but and and you have a duty to align yourself with this reality and in fact that assertion is Beneath in fact even the pursuit of science and it's it's beneath the pursuit of well we're gonna get into some of the the it we're gonna get into some of the the logical inconsistencies beneath our culture because on one hand we say we should be truth-seeking on the other hand we say we should be eliminating suffering well Part of what's difficult for us as human beings is that when there are truths We don't want to face we avoid them in the name of avoiding suffering and and so this this truth-seeking and this goal of avoiding suffering are You know that they're not so easily wed Iris Murdoch continues on the term good the proper seriousness of the term refers us to a Perfection which is perhaps never exemplified in the world. We know there is no good in us this is from the Book of Common Prayer and Some of you might Might look at this and say boy that sounds a lot like Calvinism. There is no good in us Well, what do we mean by that? It means that again the Calvinist doctrine of total depravity Total depravity does not mean we are all as bad as we could be what it does mean is that we have dirty hands and That we have our eyes distort. We are motivated As as Adam says over in Think Club we we have we are motivated reasoners There are there are biases within us that warp and skew our ability to interact With the world of truth around us and we are determined motivated reasoners We we are filled with biases because there are there are reasons for this now the good that which is Unassailable by this we we don't get there the proper seriousness of the term refers us to a perfection Which is perhaps never exemplified in the world. We know There is no good in us and which carries with it the idea of transcendence so there is a a transcendent good But we struggle with it Good is a transcendent reality Means that virtue is an attempt to pierce the veil of selfish Consciousness and join the world as it really is and this is beneath the project of truth and The celebrity atheists purport to be all about that project and in fact in the name of the search for truth That's how they conduct their their crusade Against religion because religion is untruth and they'd like to critique religion in the name of truth in the name of good And that's that's in fact where they derive their Imagined moral high ground against all comers It is an empirical an empirical fact about human nature that this attempt cannot be six that cannot be entirely Successful now. I don't know if Sam Harris believes that but Rupert Murdoch has passed so we can't talk to her but he might benefit from her books Well, what is this good made of and this is again a real problem for for materialists now Daniel Dennett wants to say information That's really weak sauce. I mean in information But information you have exactly the same problem as you have with the with the monarchical vision once you once you interact with information our motivated reason are that which selects what is interesting takes the the stuff out in the world and Even before our conscious self engages with it sets it up in a hierarchy and this again is where Psychology comes into play because this is what we do and there are many ways to show that this is what we do Bertrand Russell says whatever knowledge is attainable must be attainable by Scientific methods and what science cannot discover mankind cannot know and I think if Peterson were if Bertrand Russell Were still around Peterson would have a hard time with this because there's whole ranges of knowledge that we work on and require And employ in pragmatic ways that that we don't know Scientifically again, you'll hear Peterson say again and again scientific thinking is hard. But but what is this good made of? Where is it from? Can it be known how? You can use must if there is no can you use must if there is no transcendent good So Bertrand Russell statements here in whatever knowledge is attainable must be attained by scientific method Okay, that's an assertion. Can you back up that assertion by scientific method? If you can't then then your whole statement falls apart and Then Alistair McGrath brings in Richard Rorty There is nothing deep down inside us except what we have put there ourselves No criterion that we have not created in the course of creating a practice no standard of Rationality that is not an appeal to such a criterion. No rigorous argumentation that is not obedient to our own conventions now I think Rorty as a pragmatist gets a little closer to Peterson here and he's very much living within the secular box and Probably what Peterson would Illuminate is when he says we no criterion that we have not created in the course of creating a practice Peterson would back that sucker up all the way 3.5 million years and say that's who we is It's it's we including our ape our primate ancestors our our mammalian ancestors our reptilian ancestors All the way back to the lobster and and even before where what once this is this is how the a priori structure gets created and this then creates our Sense of the good and this gets passed on it gets built into our bodies in terms of hardware and it gets built into our societies that which is Encoded in us by other human beings as software and it gets built into our cultures and it gets built into our customs and it gets built into our laws and and Peterson Rorty probably wouldn't say this but Peterson would say well these are the gods and But Rorty himself Acknowledges that well, there's that there's a problem with this When the secret police come when the torturers violate the innocent there is nothing to be said to them of the form There is something within you which you are betraying Though you embody the practice of a totalitarian system, which will endure forever There is something beyond those practices which condemns you and I think this is where Peterson would critique him because I think Peterson would assert that in fact there is Pragmatic goodness built into us that could critique the totalitarian system and and would basically say Totalitarian systems fail the standard of Darwinian truth because they Don't promote survival of the species and imagine progress of the species but that same definition of Darwinian purpose and Darwinian truth has a weakness when it comes to the question of well Survival of which species Now if we again are the bootloaders for our AI Our AI progeny well Then all of this serves the AI progeny But if what if that proves to be a dead end and part of the problem about The Darwinian universe is that there is always a dead end and that dead end is the heat death of the universe and and then we have the other problem of we which is Do I myself participate in the we and you have all those people who have lived under totalitarian? governments, I'm working on Daniel 3 right now and Daniel 3 is basically Nebuchadnezzar setting up a which was pretty much common in the ancient world a religiously totalitarian government in Babylon That's how most humans have functioned and that's what I'm trying to say and so Peterson in a sense is like this clip we're going to see of Dilla hunty later where Peterson When he says well our western form of government is the best In a sense, he's kind of driving with the same metrics that Dilla hunty and harris are in that How do you know it's the best? Against what standard do you say it's the best? Well, it's it seems to be what seems to be what well Scott alexander might say well, it seems to be stronger than other cultures in the world Okay But but what if this particular culture of consumerism? and of personal self-expression In fact leads to another dead end Not unlike neanderthals or some other or some other darwinian dead end you can't know right now What the end will be because again within a darwinian system just like within all of these other secular systems Well, you can't know the end of the story or I should say it this way the story doesn't have a happy ending because you'll have the death of the sun Well, maybe we've expanded out into the the universe. Okay, but then you have the death of the universe the problem is This story always ends in death And when you have that kind of story you have the question of nihilism Richard dawkins Alastair mcgrath has done a fair bit of work on richard dawkins stuff We have the power to defy the selfish dream genes of our birth and if necessary the selfish means of our indoctrination We are built as gene machines and cultured as gene machines But we have the power to turn against our creators We alone on earth can rep can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators And again, you'd have to ask why now you might appeal to harari and say that we have Transcended We have transcended the genetic verse With the story verse and and so if you read harari's book sapiens, you'll you'll hear him talk about and I think quite rightly that One of the things that human beings were able to do is to adapt and change ourself via stories Where because genes just simply change too slowly and and when you look at the amazing again but What's my standard for calling it amazing? It might be It might in fact be suicidal But the amazing progress of humanity over the last 10 000 years and the speed of change which seems to be accelerating Well harari would say that's because story verse change in the story verse is faster than change in the genetic verse And and I think that's right and so when you have peterson talking to harris Peterson keeps going to story peterson is on to something there because it is in fact via story that we remake ourselves so dramatically and so quickly and this has led to the ability of humanity to colonize the natural world in ways that No other creature in the world is even close to Doing now now dockins That's that's where dockins memes get interesting because in a sense the memes are the story verse versus the the genetic verse and and If we're looking for a way in which i'm about to play some some brett weinstein from rebel wisdom If you look at how this works brett hasn't said it this way, but you could argue with brett that in fact The way that we transcend the gene verse is with story Now this is a big problem if you're a materialist because again The status of story in a material universe Is a bit difficult if you're a celebrity atheist because Basically what you have to say is that what civilization has done via story is colonize the material And and change it utterly in other words Story is higher Than matter in terms of its power or this materialistic correspondence orientation of truth Well, let's I want to play two clips from one video from rebel wisdom, which is a really excellent video It doesn't have as many views as it deserves actually and so let's play two clips It deserves actually and so let's listen to brett weinstein describe our problem Um the other thing And you know and you you point to it the I think you called it the psychonaut route into that sort of unity involves an enlightenment an awakening to a deep truth And I the analogy I use is this if you discovered that you were a robot and that you were sent to I don't know assassinate Some person who was innocent if you discovered that that was the explanation for you. You would reject your program right you as the Robot that had been given decency in order to get by everybody so you could commit your assassination would say actually I prioritize The values and I reject the mission that i've been sent on so there's peterson's hierarchy of values and the question is Why would this robot do this How would this robot do this? Let's use denett's term from where would this Robot get other information that it would place higher in the hierarchy of values in order to say that there is an ought And again, I don't think we're gonna get the ought in anything but the story verse And and what he's saying here is that you can't find the ought in the genes And harari says the same thing That you get an ought from the story verse that makes me want to Transcend my assassin robot programming That's who we are We are that robot. We are on a genetic mission that is Absolutely unacceptable. How would you just how would you just succinctly define that genetic mission that genetic mission? Is just propagation at all cost propagation of your particular genetic spellings? And here's the key. It's a little subtle but If you and I have different spellings for a particular let's say a respiratory enzyme And let's say that respiratory enzyme functions better in you than in me. It's 10 more efficient My respiratory enzyme still wants your respiratory enzyme to go extinct because it doesn't care about the function And and it's amazing how we translate What all of them would assert? are unconscious Un, you know impersonal forces Into the story verse by this translation. It cares that that spelling is advanced and yours we can't appropriate genetic information Without translating it into story why? Well, because we are stories spelling is in conflict with my spelling as long as yours is around There will be fewer copies of mine. So our genomes are actually interested. I mean the If I can just be clear about it the mind fuck of the whole thing is that the entire evolutionary Story is the cosmic spelling bee and it ends in genocide, right? Once you realize that that's what you are that you're built to advance your genetic spellings into the future generations Irrespective of what they spell and that under circumstances like these we can afford to be decent to each other But if things were different one of us would be putting the other in a gas chamber No way, I want no part of that neither do you so when people realize that that's really what they are They are built to be nice when it makes sense to be nice and they're built to be genocidal in circumstances when genocide is the thing Then the question is well all the things that you actually value How consistent are they with being that robot on that mission? So it's now what's fascinating to me here Is what he's basically saying is that? well when when come to a point where Your story versus in conflict with your genetic verse There are points when you ought to Deny the genetic verse on what does that mean? It means dying it means allowing yourself to be killed because There are points when there's kill or be killed well What is the what is the what is the assassin robot dna tell us to do and it says to kill? And well, you just deny this. Okay What that means if you deny it is that you die Now again, if you keep telling this story begins to sound like a story in In the most published book in all of human history where Where where someone says he knows the truth and He says everyone else is confused And they don't know what they're doing And those are the words he speaks As the assassin robots are working out their programming It sounds like you are sort of saying at our root. We are nasty british and short, right? The old selfish gene kind of thing compared to some Ascensionist or triumphalist clearly, you know, it's very prevalent in the self-help popular psychology space. We are on the Frothy edge of realizing our true natures as you know spiritual beings blah-blah-blah Is that something you don't hold out hope for you feel like at root? We are just self-oriented Robot programs is what's what's our shot at redemption? Do we have one? It's easier It's easier than you would think because the fact is I'm telling you We are that robot on that mission. Once you know that that's your mission. You could just reject it All right. I'm not i'm not putting anybody in a gas chamber. I just won't do it Right. I don't care about the genetic spellings at all and I really don't if I just but again you have to ask what is I? in this He's he's a story. That's how he understands himself He's he's a story that's how he understands himself now it's interesting to listen to this and think about what happened at evergreen I'm not gonna i'm not gonna you know I'm not going to think any less of him for the choices. He made at evergreen. In fact, he was I think more noble more brave and more heroic than Most of the other people there, which is in fact why we know about him but again, this is all in the story verse discovered that my sons Were switched in the hospital at birth and they were not actually related to me. It doesn't change my relationship to them It doesn't affect whether I love them. I don't love them because they're genetic spellings So my point is we are actually evolution screwed up It handed us the tools to recognize that we don't have to value the game that it is playing and that we can now Repurpose the hardware to something that's actually worthwhile And how liberating is that I mean who wants to walk around with bigotry? Yeah Now what's interesting about this video is that? Listen to what he says right before this segment of the conversation I would just add that One thing you can do once you realize that that pattern is there is recognize That where this ends is not good unless we intervene. So in other words this pattern of There's abundance abundance leads to certain kinds of Willingness to interact broad-mindedness. Let's say then there's contraction And austerity and that results in a kind of tribalism this oscillation is going to kill us the solution to it The solution to it involves Architecting a stable a steady state that gives us the inputs of Abundance in a way that does not oscillate between boom and bust Okay So what he has right here is he sees the problem He says well the problem with humanity is we have this you can watch this in his other videos You have this oscillation between boom and bust and we get very You know, we get very liberal in terms of generous when we've got plenty to eat when We're living relatively secure lives and this is why you find Liberalism in the prosperous west because suddenly yeah, let the syrians come in let the mexicans come in let's have abundant a rigorous social safety network and tax us at high percentages so that the government can provide these things i'm not i'm obviously playing with different definitions of liberal here, so don't hear this too politically but When times are fat we're generous In lean times when times are scarce Well, then we get tribal then it's me and mine then i'm looking out for my family and you watch a show like the walking Dead is basically a study in it and and so this is what's going on and he says well we have this oscillation So he said okay. There's your picture of the world now what we have to do Is and then he gives a solution. Well, we have to we have to rejigger ourselves so that You're actually if you if you hit if you hit lean times, you don't become those assassin robots Okay but Doesn't that mean you'll die And if you look at for example niches beggar religion which he calls christianity well story of christianity is of course at the center of it is a man who was unjustly accused and who Even so even given the power that within the story He could easily have gotten out in fact He could have easily gotten out of his execution without the power pilots practically begging to let him off To give him an excuse and he won't take it. And so he's not going to Do what all of his followers want him to do which is to kill their enemies And so well, okay, this is the plan brett's brett's got his vision. This is how We can now that we have nuclear weapons and all of this enormous technological power This is how we can avoid killing ourselves, but there's a problem If you can create It looks like a world in which People have enough They have the sense that things are getting better because you've architected them to give people that sense of They have enough Not necessarily what they want, but they have enough and you architect them That they have a sense that they do have enough and that they're secure. So if you make them feel that they're secure What's funny about this is well, isn't this the trick that dictators pull It's one of the tricks the other trick of course Here's the terrible enemy over there and you marshal the people or you just well it's bread and circuses, right? I mean The roman emperors knew how to do this Well, you're most half of you are slaves and we you know, we've just killed a million You know millions in in gaul and we've enslaved another million in gaul. But look at the show Oh That's that's how you do it. This isn't necessarily a new program Breadth in other words, maybe you have shifted growth into a different mode. In other words if everybody Is freed to be generative. So you're constantly encountering new Interesting stuff that feels like the world of abundance that happens when you've just discovered some concentrated source of growth It's fundamentally entertainment it's the circuses it's the coliseum it's netflix it's the internet It's youtube it may not be predicated on growth. And that's the point is we're not In a position as human beings to track actual growth. So if we can substitute things that feel like growth Then we will put people into their growth mindset as it were Maybe let's put everybody in vr and even though the world is a disaster out there. Everything feels good or maybe we're all Sucked into a giant machine with all these tubes in our back and being used as batteries But make them think that there's meaning and purpose because because actually What you really do need more than than just comfort is also meaning because I think peterson is right that meaning is at the top Of the hierarchy and then they can afford and they will naturally be inclined to be decent to each other What you're describing seems, you know, beautiful possible but wildly ambitious and would take a hell of a long time if it worked At all, I mean like are you talking about like a fundamental retooling of socio-economic structures and national stories and pervasive messaging and public sentiment To the point where people like oh, yes, we can afford to be generous. We can afford to be kind We can afford to be inclusive. I'm talking about a process that will take three generations at least. Okay, do we have that much time? Well Let's put it this way. You don't need to solve the entire problem at once you need to forestall The existential threats none of them can come to fruition If this project is to work so we have to wake up to those things that threaten us acutely and we have And who's to determine what's threatening us acutely? To begin addressing them that does not have to happen In exactly the same moment as people begin to feel Uh a steady state abundance, but you do have to give them A burst of abundance in order to relax the tribalism that is setting in so the question is how do we get enough people? to have a post-global experience in order to annex Global centric perspective and the only two options I can think of is either one Independence day level stuff the discovery of other life something that really wakes us up to the fact that we are here together on This little blue marble. Um, and that's and that's the sort of shows the ash other beings other gods The the others that you know or some form of psychonauts some form of expansion in consciousness that you could scale I love how consciousness is such a It's such a flexible suitcase for just about any problem we have. Well, we'll solve it in consciousness. Well, we live in consciousness I mean, that's what other space are you going to solve it in? rapidly relatively speaking within the span of a generation that gives people a Post-conventional global perspective in their interiors such that when we get back to start doing your longer bigger hotter project There are people who are actually holding that that beat there's several routes to the place you're talking about None of them are easy, but they're relatively straightforward One thing is the fact that we have become an existential threat to ourselves Slots in very nicely to the enemy that we face together. All right, we've seen the enemy it is us It's us but is it all of us the same and so that Awareness of that can I believe trigger the kind of unity that you're talking about? The problem is that narrative which I believe is true. We have become the existential threat to ourselves That narrative is in conflict with those who are most powerful in civilization Who would like to keep it running as it is because it's feeding them pretty darn well. Ah So what to do with them so here's the question Are you willing to die for the sake of your enemies when you believe your enemies are not just? people against you personally But there are people with the wrong ideas who are destroying the world because That's pretty much what's at the basis of every genocide You The Soviet Union tried to you know prime the pump of history to get us to that workers paradise by you know Decimating the farmers in Ukraine the the Nazis tried to speed up the evolution of of history by Getting rid of the Jews. There's always an enemy There's always someone standing in the way and it's wonderful to say well, I'm going to just override I'm gonna use the story verse to override my robot programming and and not put anyone in a gas chamber. Okay How exactly are you going to deal with? These People who are holding back your vision of what needs to happen in the world When you're pretty darn sure that unless something happens to these people to get them out of power or to Marginalize or to exile them or to do something to L. We're not gonna kill them. Well Listen to your own story. Aren't we in that wealthy period where we're liberal because There's abundance. Yeah, so So Yours program doesn't sound like it's very different from every other program of how to fix the world and I don't know that you fully appreciate where you are in it And I don't mean anything against them, you know, but this is a problem we all have So, what is the good Brett says well in order to achieve the good which is you know, the species must go on We need to marginalize those that are in power that those who hold on to power in a certain way of organizing the world Because it works pretty good for them. In other words a group that has wealth status, you know, whatever you define it race Well, that's probably us here in North America because you know, we're the 1% In many ways in the world we have to stop well, they have to be stopped Well, how are you gonna do that? Marginize kill exile take them out of power take away the vote how are you gonna do that and Replaced by whom well the person with the grand idea about how the world needs to run but they're not motivated They don't have motivated reasoning I mean again, I Brett's a really smart guy and I think there's a lot of truth in terms of what he says but Where are you gonna go with this? Doesn't seem to be going much of anywhere I mean those who think the right thoughts and those who have the right ideas because again in the story verse It's the story that governs now What good does Brett seek society must be preserved and we're gonna hear this in the abolition of man the me that can be Transactional about the genetic makeup of his son is still in a sense a code. It's a story code It might not be made up of four letters, but it's a story and again We're look at Harari Sapien on the revolution of the genetic verse to the story verse Why is Weinstein story verse of more value than the genetic verse? Where's the standard that says that? Well, it's been able to give us all of these All of these wonderful things like science and technology and the population of human beings and our domesticated animals has completely Dominated the planet. Is that a good thing? Well talk to the Talk to the people that think the that nobody should ever be born because they suffer do do we have happier lives than our ancestral hunter-gatherers someplace Um Harari says probably not but we don't know because none of us within our tiny little lifetimes Or even within the tiny lifetimes of ancestors that we've been able to know maybe Parents and grandparents, maybe even great-grandparents and maybe reading history a bit further back How can we determine if well-being is better for us than it was for those religious hunter-gatherers? How are you going to where are you going to find the ruler to make those measurements? Why is Weinstein story verse of more value than the genetic verse me Trump's Gattaca? Why? Now let's take a look again at this three-way conversation that we've looked at quite a bit So so look I mean It seems to me and again correct me if I'm wrong is that You made an absolute moral claim in the moral landscape, and that's what grounds your argument Let's take this evil piece because it'll be interesting if it's not totally on point Okay, the reason why evil is susceptible to total deflation is if you agree with me Evil is a category of human misbehavior human intention that we don't Understand significantly at the level of the brain But if we did understand it totally at the level of the brain Then every evil person we had in the dock at trial would be just like Charles Whitman with his brain tumor after he Shot up everyone at the University of Texas now. Wait a minute. Are you saying that all the Nazis? I mean because earlier you said, you know the Nazis and the gulag that was evil They all had a brain problem Is that what you're saying? No, because and many other places say no the problem is that they they had other beliefs that were a problem and then he tries to make the Nazis and the and the Soviets to be Religious people. Okay, and actually I buy that because we're all religious people including Sam. He's the one that says they're not so Sam's definition of religious gets pretty selective but but Now you refer to a guy who had a specific Biological physical problem in his brain and saying that's what evil is and once we learn that but but now What Weinstein just said is that this is programmed in fact all the way down to our DNA and factor respiratory enzyme Even if it's less functioning than your respiratory enzyme still wants you dead So so what world is Sam talking about? Right. So like he he's he's the prototypically evil mass murderer, but he's complaining about This change that overcame his personality and he thinks it would be good It'd be a good idea that if after the cops kill me you autopsy my brain because I don't know why I'm doing any of this Right and lo and behold he had a glioblastoma pressing on his amygdala and all of a sudden it made sense of his behavior in a Way that a full understanding of psychopathy or every other variant of human evil would make sense of it In a way that would be deflationary ethically and then and so I wonder if at this point that Sam is saying Let's do brain surgery on evil people because that's how we can fix them Who would look at so then you look at someone like Saddam Hussein or the worst evil person you could imagine and you say well He's actually unlucky, you know there but for the grace of biology go I And then why would evil and good be then lined up with religious and non-religious? I mean this argument about the brain Just makes no sense and and it doesn't and I wish Weinstein would have jumped in on him. He said hey wait a minute what What we do when we kill other people What the Nazis did to the Jews and the Slavs and and those they considered to be racially inferior? What the Soviets did to their enemies this is built into all of us, which is in fact Peterson's point It's not only built into all of us. But if you listen to almost any Secular plan for saving ourselves from ourselves by definition it involves Us against them and and it doesn't have to do with some very rare tumor in the brain pressing against the pituitary because if you if you if you buy if you get a if you Basically did an autopsy on all the Nazi guards You're probably not going to find brain structures that they have in common and then Sam would say oh But anything that we think or do that's that's just our brain expressing itself so But this is where again Peterson's walk through Auschwitz is so important because Peterson says I'm capable of this What because you have a tumor pressing on your pituitary? No and and and Harris will go on to This is just incoherent Because if I had that brain if I had those genes if I had those influences that gave me those Napses I would be just like him now if you think there's some other element that gives us free will and now Then then you and I are disagreeing then that's a factual claim. That's at variance with mine But but if we are but then Sam why are you arguing? I mean this is this is the problem Or just on some level now a malfunctioning biological system When we're being evil then a complete understanding of evil would cancel that category Can you have a could you define evil so we know what you're talking about? Well, just let me take take the just the worst people who have sadistically victimized I'm gonna define evil, but I'm not gonna use the word evil. I'm gonna say worst The most people and those are the evil evilest people we can name so it's a so when you say so I think this is Really important I think actual evil of that kind is pretty darn rare and there's a lot of badness that you know Oh, yeah Well, the most troubling thing are all the good people doing evil because they're ruled by bad ideas that I think is more consequential Peterson's over there Peter Peterson's like I'm a scientist I'm trying to reduce the number of variables and you just vomited a whole bunch of new ones up on the table Just want to make it clear why I went there so you were saying this is this is this is I forgot the word you used Inevitable or Ineluctable was permanent the implications that this category is permanent and I'm saying that I don't think okay But evil in that sense is a permanent category for us. It awaits more see and and this is funny because again Harris begins by saying I'm I believe in objective value Nazism is always evil the Google log is always evil But now again, he gives up the game information and insight. Okay We're gonna distinguish for a minute good versus evil and good versus bad just look okay, and and that goes on but What did he say before well, you're what he said before You're what he said before Think it's easier perhaps to gain initial agreement between people on what might constitute a generalized ethic To concentrate on what we don't want. Yeah, I'm not saying that what we do want is unimportant But it seems to me to be harder to get a grip on we don't want Auschwitz We don't want to go like archipelago So and and there are and those and I would add to just closing the door to moral relativism here Those who do want Auschwitz are wrong to want Auschwitz I mean, it's obviously what's only happened because some people did want Auschwitz not the victim side, but the perpetrator side and so crucially for me is the claim that I'm a realist. I'm a moral realist and what realism means is that it's there that there are right and wrong answers Yes, the question of this kind and and and you cannot know what you're missing In fact, we almost certainly don't know what we're missing on questions of human value and then and our job is to discover just how good life can be and just what variables are making it needlessly horrible and to mitigate all of that and live in a better and better world. Okay, so okay, so All right, Sam, I really don't know what to do with you but there it is Let's get back to see us loose his doubt and Again, this is the this is what Sam Harris is looking for Because this is universal because later is gonna talk about Hinduism Well in early Hinduism that conduct in a man which was which can be called good consists in conformity to or almost participation in the rita The that great ritual or pattern of nature and Supernature which is revealed alike in the Cosmic order the moral virtues the ceremony of the temple Rightness correctness order the rita is constantly identified with such a or truth Corresponding to reality. So in a sense, yeah. Yeah, but that's so let's call that good Sam should be in alignment with that as Plato said That the good is beyond existence It's transcended Iris Murdoch and Wordsworth that though virtue the star that through virtue the stars were strong So the Indian Masters say that the gods themselves are born of rita and obey it This is the Tao according to Lewis. Okay, this is this moral order The Chinese also speak of a great thing the greatest thing called the Tao which is in reality beyond all predicates The greatest thing called the Tao which is in reality beyond all predicates the abyss that was before the Creator himself now remember Lewis is not saying that is what it that he's saying This is what the Chinese say it is in other words He's making the point that this is something and those of you who know your Bibles might read Romans 1 here That there is something that we know about God. It's in a sense what Lewis is saying here It is nature it is the way the road it is the way in which the universe goes the way in which things Everlastingly emerge stilly and tranquilly and tranquilly into space and time It is also the way in which every man should tread in imitation of that cosmic and super cosmic progression Conforming to all activities to that great exemplar in ritual say the Analects It is harmony with nature that is prized the ancient Jews likewise praised the law as being true So go ahead and read Psalm 119 This con this conception in all its forms platonic Aristotelian stoic christian and oriental alike. I shall henceforth refer Henceforth refer for brevity simply as the Tao Some of the accounts of it which I have quoted will seem perhaps to many of you merely quaint or even magical But what is common to them? All is something we cannot neglect It is the doctrine of objective value that belief that certain attitudes Are really true and others really false to the kind of things in the universe to the kind of thing The universe is and the kind of things we are Those who know the Tao can hold that to call children delightful or old men And venerable is not simply to record a psychological fact about our own parental or filial emotions at the moment But to recognize a quality which demands there's an ought A certain response from us whether we make it or not The waterfall was sublime I myself do not enjoy the society of small children So c.s. Lewis because I speak from within the Tao I recognize this as a defect in myself Just as a man may have to recognize that he is tone deaf or colorblind And because our approvals and disapprovals are thus recognitions of objective value or responses to an objective value Therefore emotional states can be in harmony with reason When we feel liking for what ought to be approved or out of harmony with reason when we Perceiving that liking is due but cannot feel it. It's not an emotion but Hopefully if trained well We can in fact have proper emotions according to the Tao so that The Nazi guard who was enjoying the torture of his victims Was not in accordance and c.s. Lewis and saying this has broad multicultural Implications that you can know good and bad Mult you know across cultures, there's a transcendent good Now The celebrity atheists aren't looking to get rid of the Tao they are trying to reform the world along some line But they've got a lot of problems figuring out or even admitting to What's the line? What's the standard against they against which they wish to reform the world? So that brings us to the second chapter Of the abolition of man called the way To the way It is upon the trunk that a gentleman works And elects of Confucius one two The practical result of education in the spirit of the green book must be the destruction of the society which accepts it But this is not necessarily a refutation of subjectivism about values as a theory The true doctrine might be a doctrine which if we accept we die No one who speaks from within the Tao could reject it on that account Now they skip the the reading skips the greek but again, there are a lot of websites out there one is uh, lewisania and it it mentions the greek here The greek quotation is to kill us in broad daylight, which is from homer the idea of accepting death rather than evading Manifest truth is related as a more dramatic variant to what lewis Elsewhere commended in a socratic principle follow the argument wherever it leads what he's saying here Let me put up again what he's saying here is that there are things worth more than just life Well How what kind of sense does that make to our assassin? code where the Enzyme coding wants to kill you so that the even the better Coded enzyme in you will die. It's it's the selfish gene But it has not yet come to that there are theoretical difficulties in the philosophy of gaius and tissues However subjective they may be about some traditional values gaius and tissues have shown by the very act of writing the green book That there must be some other values about which they are not subjective at all And and this holds true of the celebrity atheists, too They they in a sense are working within the Tao while trying to deny it any Association with religion but they're simply embedded within it subjective at all They write in order to produce certain states of mind in the rising generation If not because they think those states of mind intrinsically just or good Yet certainly because they think them to be the means to some state of society which they regard as desirable They are on the circuit. They're making money. They're writing books and i'm not going to say craven things Like they're just doing it for the money. They're sincere. They believe this they are trying to improve society And they're trying to do so and and what you see here in chapter two is that the celebrity atheists are no different from gaius and tissues It would not be difficult to collect from various passages in the green book what their ideal is But we need not The important point is not the precise nature of their end but the fact that they have an end at all In other words, they do have a purpose now they might say that well, we can't really get a purpose from nature We can't finish the rectangle, but they're working from a purpose They have an idea of the good and they're working towards it just like brett weinstein is in that video I played They must have or their book being purely practical in intention is written to no purpose And this end must have real value in their eyes In other words, they do have a purpose and purposes sneak in because we can't live without them To abstain from calling it good and to use instead such predicates as necessary or progressive or efficient Would be a subterfuge And they could be forced by argument to answer the questions necessary for what progressing towards what? effecting what And and this is a trick that I often play when people want to get into debates about things like marriage Just bring the purpose question in and say well, I think marriage is this and i'd say well, what is marriage for? And and it's usually by that question That you may uncover Some some purposes that are back in your head that might not be lodged in your in your consciousness And it's it's for this reason that alex rosenberg keeps slipping ought into things. Well alex what exactly are you trying to trying to Come to you believe that certain forms of society are better than others that you are directing across a line that leads to purpose even if You're denying it or you're not even conscious of your own purposes In the last resort they would have to admit that some state of affairs was in their opinion good for its own sake And this time they could not maintain that good simply described their own emotion about it For the whole purpose of their book is so to condition the young reader that he will share their approval And this would be either a fool's or a villain's undertaking unless they held that their approval was in some way valid or correct In actual fact anguis and tissis will be found to hold with complete uncritical dogmatism The whole system of values which happen to be in vogue among moderately educated young men of the professional classes During the period between the two wars Now of course lewis is talking about These two individuals and where they grew up and this is sociology of knowledge and and in that sense This is peterson telling the celebrity atheist. Well, you're you're christian because you you obsede on the fact that You're christian because you you absorbed Without even knowing it through your books all kinds of christian assumptions about moral value You just did and and you don't even know yourself well enough to know that it's in there Their skepticism about values is on the surface It is for use on other people's values about the values current in their own set. They're not nearly skeptical enough And this phenomenon is Wait, wait till you get to the point of where I play dilla hunty and peterson when they're talking about skepticism peterson basically does c.s lewis on matt dilla hunty here because he says you're not skeptical enough about your values and and dilla hunty just Denies him and this phenomenon is very useful A great many of those who debunk traditional or as they would say sentimental values have in the background values of their own Which they believe to be immune from the debunking process I can think of a channel that almost all their videos are debunked debunked debunked debunked debunked Well, okay put forward your values And account for them debunking process They claim to be cutting away the parasitic growth of emotion religious sanction and inherited taboos in order that real or basic values may emerge I will now try to find out what happens if this is seriously attempted In other words, he's saying what if what if the celebrity atheist actually did what they'd say they're doing instead of smuggling in All these christian values under the surface Let us continue to use the previous example that of death for a good cause Not of course because virtue is the only value or martyrdom the only virtue But because this is the experimentum crucis which shows different systems of thought in the clearest light Let us suppose that an innovator in values regards dulce et decorum and greater love hath no man As mere irrational sentiments which are to be stripped off in order that we may get down to the realistic or basic ground of this value Where will he find such a ground? First of all, he might say that the real value lay in the utility of such sacrifice to the community Good he might say Means what is useful to the community? But of course the death of the community is not useful to the community only the death of some of its members What is really meant is that the death of some men is useful to other men That is very true. But on what ground are some men being asked to die for the benefit of others? Every appeal to pride honor shame or love is excluded by hypothesis To use these would be to return to sentiment and the innovator's task is Having cut all that away to explain to men in terms of pure reasoning why they will be well advised to die that others may live He may say unless some of us risk death all of us are certain to die But that will be true only in a limited number of cases And even when it is true, it provokes the very reasonable counter question. Why should I be one of those who take the risk? Now now it's interesting because when I listened to this the other day I thought of This conversation now pang burn seems to have its volume low. So sorry about that It doesn't matter whether it was an act of free will or if it was my lawnmower It's clearly not good for you because you think you're valuable and worth preserving. Yes Okay, that's the issue Why do you think you're valuable and worth preserving because I am the descendants of people who thought they were valuable and worth Is worth preserving and we're going to get to this argument a little bit later in the book not in this video Who didn't think that have killed themselves? But this is not a so it's instinct really about This is not a statement about intrinsic value, I don't know yes, yes, I think no, it's okay. Okay, but I think it is okay It The reason that we talk about this in terms of well-being Is because irrespective of whether or not I care about well-being there are facts about well-being sure Let's hear a man line those suckers up if you chop off my head. It's in contradiction to my well-being I mean that but the point no, I wasn't willing to grant that actually. Okay. I'm saying that's a metaphysical presupposition Metaphysical presupposition That's this you don't find that in atoms you find that in the story verse You're just saying I have to accept that no i'm not i'm not telling you at all what to accept I'm trying to i'm trying to explain what my position is Okay, but but you said that that wouldn't be in accordance with your well-being Okay, that's a metaphysical statement or philosophical statement. It's not an obvious fact That chopping off somebody's head is contrary to their well-being it depends on how you define well-being See and and right here with dillah honte and harris is They get squishy On one hand about the definition of fact whenever they try to make their metaphysical claims Facts get to be this elastic suitcase that almost anything can go into but when they're trying to debunk Someone else well fact is this thing I can touch taste or or hear? Sure Sure Yeah, but it matters if you define well-being is this glass of water. We're no longer talking about the same thing Well, you can define well-being that's fine. That's what i'm waiting for this is so this is what i'm if you can't do it You can't define well-being. Well, then why should I try certainly can't do it if you keep telling me I can't do it Okay, sorry. Okay, i'll back off i'll back off. There's a Go ahead I'm i'm all ears so This is why peterson's so much fun to watch primary objection to mine and sam's position that keeps coming back is Why should anybody care about well-being? And we both will acknowledge that this is and in fact a subjective preference There are people who are going to care about well-being there are people who aren't The second objection is that well-being is not Um, I don't know if they're really going to care about well-being differently. I think they're going to define well-being differently Clearly defined both of us have acknowledged this it's not as if we're saying we have all the answers to uh how to go about living a better life We're just saying and and and this again this eschatology among the celebrity atheist is really interesting But well, we don't have all the answers and we don't know. Okay What is guiding your decisions today? Because you have you already have an existent hierarchy that you're living at when you're not on stage Where did you get that one from? And that's exactly where peterson keeps saying you've borrowed the christian one you go on stage and debunk it But when you live your life, we all kind of live the same because we had all snuck in through our culture I think that however, we're going to define well-being which is I say you can start with a couple of foundations. You can start with death is preferable to life, but you don't get very far that way and so Death is preferable to life. Well What about this guy antinatalism well Very simple syllogism To live a human life is to suffer If your goal is reducing suffering Don't birth people Then you won't have suffering Well animal suffering you're not going to worry about but a dead universe has no suffering And and it's in a sense in this way that the goals get revealed Spring Well, no, i'm saying you could start with death is preferable to life But you don't get very far that way because yeah, you do you stop suffering you just die Yes Right, so you can start with the presupposition except that when you're dead, you're not being so there's no well-being But there's an assumption underneath there and the question is what's at the top of your hierarchy? Is it suffering or is it being? Why is one above the other in your hierarchy? If it's not that's not necessarily if we're looking for the And here he addresses the crowd. This is very interesting rewatching these videos again and again things about our life You can't say death is better Yeah, you can well Well be in a sense what dilla hunty is saying here is that well To to live and to suffer Is better than to die Okay. Well, what about killing? Infants that are are unborn children that have terrible birth defects. What about euthanasia? I mean again, you're making decisions and even political statements in the present world based on a metaphysic that on stage You're kind of flipping on its head. I know that you can say it people do all the time. They didn't know what look They can express their preference, but their preference can be wrong. How can it possibly be? Their preference can be wrong Well, again, here's your standard. Where is your standard? for your life If you're dead What if you like are a terminal burn victim with cancer? I am so this is the point that I was getting to I am perfectly fine with the idea that for certain instances But here's the funny thing about certain instances now this is where again we get into brett weinstein's comment about the fat years and the lean years because well in in wealthy affluent western society where We simply assume mostly promoted by the propaganda of our media that everyone is happy and healthy and everything's going great for everyone And little old you as the problem again. Look up look up scott alexander's how bad things really are Oh, just just a few people get cancer. Well, let me tell you something about people all of us suffer and and all of us will die and you might say well we should We should speed our death before we suffer Well, you just flipped on its head the idea that You know that being is better than cutting your head off I mean what happened to that? Well, only just a few people suffer really I don't see that. I don't see that at all. In fact, I can go down the street And if I talk to people long enough, you have the initial polite facade, which is a very useful thing But i'm a pastor. I start digging into their people and what do I find everybody suffers So then you have to do a cost-benefit analysis Is life worth the suffering? So then you have to do a cost-benefit analysis Is life worth the suffering david benatar is antinatalism says no Don't have children because they will suffer. That's the moral thing to do. Okay, if that's your moral system What's at the top of your moral hierarchy? anti-suffering Problematic because again we will exchange Meaning we will exchange suffering for meaning we will take meaning and say I will suffer you can You can nicha Um victor frankle you can endure almost anyhow if you have a why De la hunty's scheme has no room for this observation There may be occasions that death is preferable to an individual over life But when we're speaking An individual and I mean if you read maps of meaning I mean Peterson trots out the whole trolley thing with all kinds of other addendums to it, which is really interesting Who can do this math In broader terms if we're talking about let's create the best society we can let's create the best quality of life We can for people death is not that across the board. It doesn't mean that there aren't individual exceptions. So the foundations How is death an exception it comes to all of us suffering Comes to all of us How do you decide? When death is preferable to life when exists when non-existence at least in your metaphysical term because those are assertions That the crazy thing about you know read kirkegaard's despair unto death where you get to the point if someone's like i'm suffering I'm despairing. I want to die and what if they discover That suicide is not the antidote to despair That that suicide that that the The person who kills themselves realizes they haven't extinguished their story and their story continues and the despair still has them What then So that I started with you can start with death is better than life But blah blah blah if you start with life is generally preferable to death health is generally preferable to sickness Happiness is generally preferable to sadness. None of these are absolute Locked in stone rules from those things. Okay, so if you start with them, yes if you start you're not skeptical about those claims. Wow well This is lewis. I said you're not nearly as skeptical about the claims you ought to be than you are and now Dillahunty is going to basically use a social pushback to try and get out of Peterson's point. I came out and said that I wasn't going to be trying to straw man You left and right and now every time I say something you're like, oh, so you're not skeptical about well I thought we're just dealing with reason and arguments and now Hierarchies of interest and personality and sociology have intruded upon our pure room of reason here Where your argument begins well, it seems odd that you would come out with so you're not skeptical about that While i'm in mid-sentence to describe that these are the general foundations that you start with okay, that's what I was asking build a building with a general foundation The engineer goes there and says yeah, I'm gonna build a general foundation for this building. It's not going to be specific How specific how not specific? Okay. So but what you're saying if you're saying correct me if i'm wrong, i'm not trying to be difficult You're saying that those are your starting positions those are the things that you accept i'm saying they can be faith No, oh you have a rationale for them. Yes, let's hear it. You already have Life is generally preferable to death because we're talking about our life Depends on what life is for David benatar comes and says We suffer So therefore don't have children so what's your rationale against david benatar? Do you have one or are these in fact axiomatic? presuppositions that you have brought to the table and That's basically what delante now just concedes and death is generally not in the interest of the living Ah whose death we just finished reading that because every time we have a war we say Your death is in the interest of the rest of the living you have to die for the sake of everyone else Well, why how is that in my best interest? It all depends on how? Who are who is we who how do we define this? It can be an exception. This is the point that I was getting Exception what is exactly an exception when it comes to me? Am I an exception? I'm my whole life Right, especially under your terms of what a human being is So you could start with those family you can start with any three that you found How about there is a god Can you start with that? No, that's the one you say you can't start with You could pick three arbitrary And the one aspect that makes a secular moral system distinct from religious pronouncements and divine command theory and those sorts of things Is that the the secular moral system has as its goal? The object of getting better at getting better, which means if you Find out that one of your foundations is wrong or in conflict with something else you can now change that you What's the criteria when you find that it's wrong, what's the criteria for wrong on one hand? You're building a building and you're saying the foundations are arbitrary. But if you find out that it's wrong It's an evidentialist foundationalist system You're trying to construct and you just completely undermine it and and what you're saying is that mid course I can decide I like something better. Well, why can't I like god? Why can't I like god? Why can't I like jesus? Why can't I like dumbo's feather? You said it's arbitrary And and and and and now it's whatever works for you So what exactly is your goal and i'd have to say that It seems to be with well-being that your goal is just as peterson said at the first video I played in this video The reduction of suffering there's your purpose peterson has just said Death killing yourself can pursue that purpose This is how meaning works. This is how people work You have meaning according to your purpose. It's even how morality works if your goal is suffering Is to end suffering then suddenly it's moral as you say with euthanasia to kill in order to preserve life or Brett weinstein It's important to alienate those people for whom our dangerous system is working In order so that some new utopia can come about but this is exactly the system of every tyrant So what you need is actually something outside the system Someone who is a judge who can't be corrupted In the system of every human being is a judge who can't be corrupted Well, why Well because by definition, that's what you need someone above Every human being well the law well, okay, so we've got the dow well, that that's a good thing But but how are we going to find that? At this point the innovator may ask why after all selfishness should be more rational or intelligent than altruism If by reason we mean the process actually employed by gaius and tishas when engaged in debunking That is the connecting by inference of propositions ultimately derived from sense data with further propositions Then the answer must be that a refusal to sacrifice oneself is no more rational than a consent to do so and no less rational Neither choice is rational or irrational at all From propositions about fact alone. No practical conclusion can ever be drawn This will preserve society cannot lead to do this except by the mediation of Society ought to be preserved This will cost you your life cannot lead directly to do not do this It can lead to it only through a felt desire or an acknowledged duty of self-preservation The innovator is trying to get a conclusion in the imperative mood out of premises in the indicative mood And though he continues trying to all eternity he cannot succeed for the thing And this is where you'll get peterson's you can't get an ought from an is Peter and lewis just uses Grammar terms for the thing is impossible We must therefore either extend the word reason to include what our ancestors called practical reason and confess that judgments such as Society ought to be preserved Though they can support themselves by no reason of the sort that guys and tissues demand are not mere sentiments, but our rationality itself In other words society ought to preserve. Well, this is a feeling that I have and so in a sense with dillahunty and harris to say Well, well, it's self-evident. That's that's this feeling that society ought to be preserved and lewis wants to say great good But as peterson says where are you getting that idea? reason Not getting it from reason you're bringing it to the table and and when we have these feelings, it's not the case that Well, I just feel society ought to be conserved preserved in the same way that I feel Eating ice cream sandwiches is enjoyable No, those are two different feelings. Well Maybe maybe my body loves ice cream sandwiches because they're full of sugar and fat. Okay Well, there's a correspondence and society ought to be preserved that feeling within me actually corresponds To something out there in the world and there's something inside of me Conscience which is not simply from above but also from below That that is built into me that needs to be fostered and trained and nurtured that When I see Matt Dillahunty throwing sam harris off the stage I say You know, yeah, we've talked about this but your value as human beings Dictates that That is wrong But he itself Or else we must give up at once and forever the attempt to find a core of rational value behind all the sentiments we have debunked The innovator will not take the first alternative for practical principles known to all men by reason are simply the dow which he has set out to supersede He is more likely to give up the quest for a rational core and to hunt for some other ground even more basic and realistic This he will probably feel that he has found in instinct The preservation of society and of the species itself are ends that do not hang on the precarious thread of reason They are given by instinct That is why there is no need to argue against the man who does not acknowledge them We have an instinctive urge to preserve our own species That is why men ought to work for posterity We have no instinctive urge to keep promises or to respect individual life That is why scruples of justice and humanity In fact the dow can be properly swept away when they conflict with our real end the preservation of the species That again is why the modern situation permits and demands a new sexual morality The old taboos served some real purpose in helping to preserve the species But contraceptives have modified this and we can now abandon many of the taboos For of course sexual desire being instinctive is to be gratified whenever it does not conflict with the preservation of the species It looks in fact as if an ethics based on instinct will give the innovator all he wants and nothing that he does not want in Reality, we have not advanced one step I will not insist on the point that instinct is a name for we know not what To say that migratory birds find their way by instinct is only to say that we do not know how migratory birds find their way For I think it is here being used in a fairly definite sense to mean an unreflective or spontaneous impulse Widely felt by the members of a given species In what way does instinct thus conceived help us to find real values Is it maintained that we must obey instinct that we cannot do otherwise? But if so, why are green books and the like written? Why this stream of exhortation to drive us where we cannot help going? Why such praise for those who have submitted to the inevitable? Or is it maintained that if we do obey instinct we shall be happy and satisfied But the very question we are considering was that of facing death which so far as the innovator knows cuts off every possible satisfaction And if we have an instinctive desire for the good of posterity Then this desire by the very nature of the case can never be satisfied since its aim is achieved if at all when we are dead It looks very much as if the innovator would have to say not that we must obey instinct Nor that it will satisfy us to do so but that we ought to obey it But why ought we to obey instinct? And i'll leave that for the next video So we have our secular Or atheist moral menu rosenberg nihilism no purpose or objective more moral reality, it's Just what we want so therefore can so Have at it boys and girls. There is no ought murdoch transcendent good, but She's she's at least fesses up to the difficulties of her position We've got to have one But how I don't know rorty gets a little bit more specific Crowdsourcing pragmatism but uneasy with the implication in a tyrannical world. What if multiple generations? In fact, you know, you say well, we'll never again suffer multiple generations under tyranny Most of human history has lived most of its life under tyranny And you know to say that we prefer what we have now well i'm with peterson on that but Showing the ruler why it's better when you say well we won we we won the 20th century Well, yeah, the united states helped win the 20th century, but There were you know, france didn't do too well in in the second world war Why was it because of their moral system or was it more complex than that? Celebrity atheists use rhetorical tools for popular consumption, but again The celebrity atheists are not I guess it depends on what jordan peterson's goals are but I don't find them if jordan peterson is going to the celebrity atheist In order to try through conversation to make progress In trying to sort these things out. He is going to the wrong tribe In trying to sort these things out he is going to the wrong tribe Now now maybe And this perhaps helps us locate peterson Maybe in a sense peterson is on some levels kind of like them because he's out there in the public world in the popular world unlike Many academics who like alistair mcgrath Quite a bit more dry. Well, maybe church people like this because church people have built up a capacity to listen to dryness Because they go to church all the time and and maybe when you say I find church boring the problem isn't with the service The problem is with you And and maybe what you should say is that when you recognize that you should say I can't read that book because it's hard well, maybe the goal should be to Become more educated and better at reading books than necessary to say books should be more entertaining And you've got theistic seists systems cs lewis says all cultures have assumed the dao And we never get beyond it and and that's why these these these reform efforts. Well pay attention to them because It's it's there's something going on and you've got to see what's really going on And now note christianity and this is where some people say well the dao that you you've just Ruined christian uh christianity some of christianity's exclusive claims Christianity Assumes with many other religions the dao and actually in the appendix of cs lewis's abolition of man There are a bunch of pages where he says yeah There's commonality between some of the moral law and christianity and the moral law you can find in other cultures Christianity and the moral law you can find in other cultures lewis doesn't deny that but is christianity and this is what many people assume simply about telling people This is what you should do and having carrots and sticks to enforce it and I would say that's not at all what christianity is about But christianity certainly does understand carrots and sticks and sowing and reaping That's my dog snoring my little dog has a very big snore Peterson wants darwinian survival for purpose and there are real issues with this and I pointed this out in the previous videos that Finchness, you know in the metaphysical club is in a sense what's at stake with darwinianism and so Peterson I think has some fogginess between okay, so you've got darwinian truth And you've got darwinian purpose But you've also got suffering and and I don't think I you know, I guess you know the deeper I get into peterson Probably now after a year of thinking about him because and I don't I don't have any embarrassment about this You know, we're all growing and learning and i'm not the smartest person in the world thankfully, so because smart people have other things they have to deal with but So darwinian purpose How does that really match up with suffering? And and because and you know, even with dilla hunty some of those some of those issues are coming out with peterson and so, you know peterson continues to work through these issues and That's probably something that i'd want to probe with him And he finds the dow in a priori structures and I think this is actually now again my Tradition if you say god reveals himself only from above no god reveals himself only from below no Heideberg catechism god reveals himself in two books general and special revelation from below and from above Okay, and at some point I'd like to continue to think about how that Below and above continue to mesh together. But but what's interesting is essentially Jordan peterson is saying the dow is built into us from below And and I think when you look at say brett weinstein and those issues we begin to see the below above Issues coming forward in that because in a sense brett weinstein says we have our genetic code from below But we have this story verse from above and well Where did we get our story from? what if Dorothy sayers what if god inserted himself in the story? To help our story verse Well, if god would insert himself in the story, he'd probably do it in such a way That his story would By all measures be The Story that is propagated in the world beyond all others That's the definition of the bible So, where's the evidence is it evidence is it a leap of faith So so I think again peterson for me In my my consciousness committee after listening to peterson I mean that I got interested in him because i'm thinking he's helping me with stuff from below This is really helpful stuff but Via my religious tradition. I also know stuff from above and so Well, we kind of want to get these things lined up Next in the abolition of man more on instinct And yeah This has gone on up. Well, it's not as bad.
