 Okay, what's on your mind today? Oh a whole bunch. Really? Yeah, a whole bunch. But I think I told you last time we talked, I've got this giant list of you know things to things to talk with Paul about and they always do. But I think the one thing that we could talk about that I don't think I've heard many people talk to you about at least, well a lot of people approach this subject, I want to talk about what really grabbed me in with the whole Jordan Peterson phenomenon and why I latched on to him initially. Okay. It's something that I don't hear a lot of people talk about. So I guess when when Peterson first kind of made his splash, my life was already pretty much in order in a lot of ways. I was 25, I was married with a kid and a good job and a house. You know things were, things are going pretty well just because I was on the path. Yeah. So it's that kind of classic thing where I came to Peterson's stuff for the controversy and then stayed for the content you know. So it was like the yeah all the political stuff and the ramifications of all that it was refreshing and nice to hear and I liked him for all of those reasons. But I think what really stuck with me originally was, so I'm a visual thinker and when I'm learning something or when I'm thinking about something I'm kind of building like models of things in my mind. It's just kind of how I see things and that's how I think and how I learn. And that's what Peterson did right off the bat. He started revealing in my mind this model of reality in a way. And I've now come to realize that it's the reality that you would call the forum for action. So it started on the very first podcast I heard him talk. I think it was with Joe Rogan is where he first talked about it. But he told the St. George story but he told it from the point of his order chaos paradigm I guess. So it's like George is in order in the castle. He goes out to face the dragon and then he returns and he restores order. And that I just remember that shook me just that little thing and the way that he a story. It's stuck with me and I even talked to my wife about it that night. I was just like I can't believe like the effect that this had on me just hearing that story. And then the more I would listen to his content everything mapped onto that diagram where there's this center point that's order and then there's periphery surrounding it. So it's George goes out to the dragon or Harry Potter goes to face that or Bilbo goes to Mordor or the mother and the child in the playground and she's the center point and the child goes out to the periphery faces chaos just till he's uncomfortable and returns to the restored order. The rats that are dropped in a new environment they establish that tiny little center point of order and then they slowly work their way out. So it paints this picture of this forum for where it's like experienced reality and the experiencer of that reality is always weaving between order the known and the chaos the unknown and kind of using the periphery to build the center the order. And it just I don't know that that mental diagram is what has kept me going and going and going into Peterson stuff. And then the more you get into it and into his material you see that that center point actually has a vertical axis and it's a it's a an axis of value. So often the hero from the center point he goes down to the periphery and then returns upward. So that diagram in my head starts to look like a cone in a way you know what I mean. It's got the periphery and the center axis goes up. And so then he talks about you know Horace being at the top of the hierarchy but also above the hierarchy and he talks about Christ in the same way as well. He did that a lot in that that transliminal interview the one from 2015. And I think that it's when Jonathan Pajot came onto the scene is where I see he's what really convinced me that this is more than just some really interesting way to look at reality. He kind of says yeah you think this is interesting and you see all these what's the word what's that Jungian word for things lining up? Synchronicity. Yeah he's a you see all these you see the way that this matches reality so frequently and that's because this is reality and and then Pajot's ideas I always pronounce his name weird Pajot Pajot. That's the way to pronounce it isn't it? Yeah I guess I put the emphasis on the wrong syllable as they say. Oh Pajot? Yeah Pajot. But where was I going with that? I guess Jonathan his his big point that he made especially just early on was that this is the way reality is and that Christianity itself describes this system very well. And when you as I started to kind of make the transfer from understanding the system through Peterson's material to understanding it through Pajot's material it kind of matches but some of the labels on the diagram have to change in a way where order and chaos still work technically speaking like the at the center is the known the order and the periphery is chaos and the unknown and the potential. But when you have it as a cone it's probably more accurate to describe it with unity at the top and multiplicity at the bottom and and Jonathan goes into that a lot but that and that gets in I guess am I rambling? No no keep going you're doing good okay I'm tracking okay well so with the unity and the multiplicity that gets into the idea of And Peterson and Pajot's ideas of logos are slightly off as well and I remember when I first heard Jonathan say you know Jordan's close on logos but he's a little bit it's a little bit off it's not quite there at first I was like I didn't understand what he meant but the more I listen to Jonathan's stuff I've come to understand it that so Jordan talks about the logos has the capacity of consciousness through truthful speech to generate order from chaos so that the experiencer faces chaos regenerates order and to him and does it truthfully and that's logos but Jonathan's idea it's not his idea but what he says logos is is the ability to create a unity from multiplicity so it's kind of the same idea but almost zoomed out a little bit more it's the ability he uses a pen so he says a pen there's infinite multiplicity in this pen there's spring there's a little ball there's a lid there's these things but we take all of that multiplicity and we make it one thing and we say pen and that is logos the ability to take those multiple things and make one thing make a category or a concept of something it's it would be then you know from there you can kind of see vervekis gestalt and or the the verbal cause from Aristotle yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember that when he when vervekis talked about the bird the gestalt of the bird I remember right and and Peterson's part of part of what continues to part of what there's a wall that Jordan keeps bumping up into which he did on yesterday's Q&A where when he when he has to talk about metaphysical ontology and that's the limit that's the limit of his Darwinian epistemology in that he can't get beyond that which causes serve that that which promotes survival in the physical dimension and so that's part of the reason why for Peter the way Peterson lays out logos just as you described it it's it's very determinative of consciousness but the the consciousness problem then continues to plague him which obviously isn't much of a isn't much isn't as much of a problem if you're in fact a theist because consciousness is a gift and it doesn't have to be accounted for via science which of course Peterson and many others and it's called the hard problem they can't they can't get there so if you're a theist consciousness isn't the hard problem consciousness is simply a given it's a yes that's funny it's in the language too it's a given given by what it's a given and it's given because in in a theistic framework consciousness is foundational and the then the formal cause and the thing the thing in the world is derivative of the consciousness and that's why that's why the big dividing line the big fight of Darwin always winds up being is there a designer is there a conscious cause to the shape of the world and that's then the divide that no there is none it's random which is not really a response because all random really means is too complicated for us to see so it's so random is in a sense a mystery that we say is godless and the other is a mystery that we say is god yeah the mystery on this side they don't fess up to yeah the mystery on this side the essay yeah that's that's this is the part we can't explain it's it's like the it's like the old joke you know that that the that a that a Darwinian a an atheist would say give me one miracle and I'll explain the rest it's like mm-hmm yeah you're always relying on something you don't understand you start somewhere yeah well I'm trying to remember where I wanted to go with this thing it's just this this model of reality is what is it's so interesting to me and well an interesting thing that I've heard Jonathan talk about with that the concept of unity and multiplicity is that that is also love yes love is the ability for unity and multiplicity to exist together basically like myself and my wife are multiple but we create a union a unity and then there's the phrase that God is love so yeah God is that thing that all things in one but then I don't want to don't want to go into saying that this diagram I'm building in my head is but I do want to say that that whole thing is a picture of him in who we live and breathe and have our being it is that it is the reality that we consciously exist in and to me that is God one if I can use your term and maybe wrong but that's exactly right okay I think so and then so I I've heard you talk recently about you know people having problems either finding God one believing in God one versus God two and you kind of need God one to connect with God to I am fully on board with God one because I can see how everything fits into that this kind of reality that's being painted for me to see God two is hard for me and I'm trying really hard Christ a personal relationship with with whatever it is that God is in whatever way he could be personal well so here I mean if you have God two without God one you have let's say maybe a Greek God you have something you have Zeus that can swoop in and you know impregnate a maiden you know you have relationality in the Greek gods but you don't have God one in the Greek gods you're ironically until let's say you get the Plato and then almost all you have is God one in Plato right there's no God two in Plato so if you have Zeus and Plato you've got a God one and a God two but they can't come together so here's the thing it's so so then many people say okay I'm there on God one but God two well here's the thing you're not in charge and that is really hard culturally for us to stomach and and so in a sense what and this is sort of where the church comes in because the church is where in Christianity the church is where God to lives it is the body of Christ yeah okay and then you've got the God one guard to dynamic a little bit wonky because in some ways God one is sort of institutional and God two is sort of relational and we can understand how institutions are relational and how we personify institutions the American government is Uncle Sam you know so it's interesting how countries embody themselves in these in a sense if we were if we lived 2,000 years ago there'd be a statue of Uncle Sam that we would go to Washington DC and yeah so so and that's why people that was a God one okay kind of get God one and Peterson lays that out but what about God two and it's like well well you kind of have to go to church to find God too because that's where he lives and and also in another sense I was just preaching on Sunday and in Luke revving up to the lectionary text and again and again Jesus when he talks about perdition says go away from me I never knew you and people say well what do you like I thought God was God was omniscient I thought God knows everything obviously never knew you is a relational it's not that I never knew of you it's not that I can't see that you're a thing in the world it's it's a relational thing and and when you read the gospel of John again and again Jesus talks about God you know drawing those two Jesus that he wants and this is where you set up some of the Calvinist dynamic and Calvinism actually gets its election from the the Western tradition because it's there in Augustine so that's why I say to people well God God will come looking for you now at the same time also within the tradition it's seeking you will find knock and the door will be open so you can go seek him and in fact you should go seek him but but just like in let's say a marriage relationship one of that one of the most frustrating things that people will bump into in terms of a marriage relationship is you are not in control there's two people here yeah and that's where you get into Peugeot's love observation which is just brilliant I was listening to his March question and answer and yeah I think Jonathan is I think Jonathan is just brilliant I listened to him but he's not he's not always terribly accessible for a lot of people you start listening to him and it's just like what is he talking about yeah it's time to kind of okay now it's coming together yeah but I don't know if that helps at all no it does so I I'm a visual thinker who thinks in these like images like this but I also tend to get kind of analysis paralysis you know rather than I have what was that note in the network was putting out some videos recently called abstracted to death and I do that with everything as I abstract and analyze things like this to where I've removed the personal aspect from it in a lot of ways so it's it's hard but then I I find I've got I've got ideas going off but so I can see Christ in that same model that same kind of hierarchy model because if he is the logos he is that which is unity and multiplicity and there there even there things that match on to this this kind of I this the shape that I'm that I'm keep talking about where Christ says straight is the gate and narrow is the way and like you know it if you picture if this is reality this cone thing we're talking about and the and valentine it's the central axis is based on value and the ultimate highest value is at the top and if that's heaven or God or ultimate goodness we're supposed to aim there and if Christ is up at the top at the point and he's saying this is the narrow little gateway that you've got to get through and you have to aim here with your behavior your behavior and your action has to aim here so when you when you talk about being truthful it's it's not so much about speaking the truth but it's well it could be about that but true action as in properly aimed at the right target which is that narrow gate and and to sin is to deviate is to not be pointing where you need to be pointing so you could sin or you could be true aim true and I and I think of the word faith as well in the similar context not so much as faith as in trusting or believing but faith as in following faith as in being faithful faithful yes yeah being faithful to to Christ Sam is faithful to Frodo and that's his I mean that's that's the that's the virtue he embodies in the story if Sam is the ultimate faithful servant and yeah it's interesting in Lord of the Rings because every character by embodying that which is there so Sam is the ultimate faithful servant Frodo is Frodo is sort of a satin sacrificial lamb you know and and and Aragorn is the king and you know Tolkien gets to kind of map out these and they each play their own role in the you know and Gandalf has a sacrificial element to him in his death and rebirth huh so yeah so again I I I can see Jesus in those roles it's like he is the perfect example of the behavior that we should fulfill our behavior should that should aim for for his behavior in a way to follow that and be truthful to that and again I think I see all those things but I'm personally removed well it's always important to remember that Jesus is one member of the Trinity so Jesus is the icon of the invisible God and so Jesus manifests in our flesh the you know God with us and and so it's it's helpful to not see in a sense part of where evangeline all traditions tend to all of our church traditions tended we're embodying some things and we're we're failing to embody other aspects we can't embody the whole thing because we're human and but that's what we're pointing you're exactly right and so there's Jesus but Jesus also remember the relationship between Jesus and the father which is very clear in the gospel of John and then Jesus ascends to the right hand of God and the spirit comes and then the spirit guides and that is the spirit of God and it is also the spirit of Christ and then you have to think I just did a whole bunch of things in my Sunday school class about this then what do we mean by spirit and it's that you know the spirit is like the it's the animating element that then that way it's sort of like Aristotle's Aristotle's formal cause and then the spirit shapes us and causes us to be in a particular shape that looks like Jesus but that the the the God of creation and the God of redemption are the same God and so God doesn't just blow with wind God moves through history and creation and it all comes together and the hardest thing in our culture I don't think it's just I don't think our culture is unique in this but it's particularly hard for our culture is the idea that you are not in control of your own salvation and that is when you look at all the Peterson stuff that's the point that Jordan Peterson and I stop that because in for Jordan Peterson's schema carrying that cross up the hill is your salvation and you take up your take up your cross and follow me yes absolutely carry that cross up the hill but we did not make the hill I mean it's there's finally from the book of Jonah salvation is of the Lord and so I think about John Calvin's commentary with Jacob fighting with the the the angel of the Lord and John Calvin says on one hand he opposes us with the other hand he fights for us and so you have this sense of you have the sense of okay so so then a lot of people are talking to me they're like oh you know I I intellectually I kind of see it but I don't feel it and so part of me says okay but remember again this is all God's work and and I always use the illustration of the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul stands if you read the book if you read the book of Acts Stephen is the most Christ like figure in the book of Acts Luke quite intentionally describes Stephen in similar terms that he described Jesus and so there's set scenes that parallel and so Luke is saying Stephen is just like Jesus and there's Paul Saul holding the coats of those who kill Stephen and you might say well why does God why does Jesus not appear to Saul before the stoning of Stephen and I think it's significant that Paul has to see himself with blood on his hands and that's part of the narrative he must play so then God comes in at Damascus and calls him and Ananias is unsure about going to him but this whole thing is God's story and he is calling the shots and so and you cannot understand the Christian life if you don't understand that God is finally in control because otherwise what we wind up doing is just like we do with our American self-salvationism okay I'm going to get the right education I'm gonna eat the right things I'm gonna exercise properly I'm gonna get the right job I'm gonna marry the right person I'm going to tell the truth or at least don't lie I'm going to do all the correct things and then I inherit the kingdom no the kingdom is a gift we're saved by you know by grace through faith and so faith is this trust in the midst of now you're young and your kids are young and you haven't had enough time for your life to fall apart significantly in some ways I'm waiting it'll come but but see that suddenly then that's why in a sense you don't have to go looking for your cross oh your crosses will find you and some of those some of those they'll be they'll be blood on your hands because it's amazing that you have Peter and Judas they both betrayed Jesus Peter is restored and Judas falls away and we say why why can't answer those questions hmm Wow geez I'm kind of speechless after that one but but but Americans hate this rightfully so yeah because we want to be in control and who I finally trust more than anyone else is me what an idiot I am I have abundant reasons that I can name that I will not hear to say why I am not trustworthy yeah yeah I feel the same way I I've noticed the so last time we talked we spoke about kind of the my struggles in finding a church and finding the right match for one that fits me if it's my wife and then where the heck two kids fit into any of that and so well I'm going a few different directions but but on that note of just kind of like our American ideas of individualism versus the church as a community and the body of Christ kind of thing when I'm in a church my instinct especially if I attend like a Catholic practice which I have a strong leaning towards Catholicism but every time I go my American individualism turns into a porcupine you know it's like don't put me into your group I'm not in your group you know I'm me and and then that voice in my head says yeah you're not gonna get anywhere that way you know but so I know that and I'm starting to realize that that maybe this individualism is it's been a strength in a lot of ways for our country especially but it's I mean where are we now we're lonely and we're just a lonely culture everyone's in solitude you don't know your neighbors and it's because you're just all individuals you have no tribe yeah you're not part of one of the one of them one of the topics at one of our last meetups was ethno-nationalism or my term confessional constitutional nationalism do you does the nation America is a constitutional you know we organize around the Constitution yeah the countries of Europe they're ethnic groups or you know the fragmentation the Balkan ization here's our little ethnic tribe well it's really handy to make that your group but then the problem that you have is the problem of Empire which actually if you read the Bible it's it's it's a wrangling with Empire and and finally the answer in the Bible is well the final state of the world is Empire and the Emperor is Christ yeah it's book of Daniel book of Revelation and but then there's a competing Empire and that's Babylon Egypt Rome Satan yeah and so that kind of maps on to a while ago I you've heard Jonathan talk about hierarchies of consciousness and then kind of principles and principalities and how this this realm of consciousness also organizes itself in that cone hierarchical shape where it's there's an individual and at the top is his conscious guidance and at his feet are the material facts of the world so right even in there on the individual level you have heaven and earth and then if that individual is in a group or a family they all revolve around some animating force so it just kind of scales up guidance at the top material world at the bottom and then from family to community same thing community to country country to world and world to existence itself that that same shape scales itself up and in the ideal everything's revolving around that one point at the very top but say one community decides not to revolve around that thing at the top and then it's suddenly in conflict with these with everything else and yeah so I guess that the hierarchy of consciousness idea is is aiming at the ideal state of that right it's ideally if we are all to be coexisting in peace that's kind of how it would lay itself out but we go off and we create our own gods in the forms of whatever ideologies or ideals that we decide are the ideal and then that puts us in conflict with everyone else who have different ideals that's right and and none of us so when you you look at the you know one of the things that I've been thinking about over the last few months is okay how so if you read the book of Revelation passages from Isaiah how can how can God end the story well and you get these in these images or these symbols in Revelation and and in Isaiah and in other places and it's I don't know then that again has to be it has to be a gift to us because you're exactly right with those hierarchies and when it comes to the principality that is Paul VanderKley it's it's it's it can't work and if you want to see what the principality that is Paul VanderKley looks like you have to look at my life and anyone if you look at me through YouTube and oh pulls it all together talk to my wife you know talk to my kids talk to my church anybody who has a higher resolution of me knows all by they only know just some of my deficiencies you know God's list is longer so so so we need we need a king if we are actually see this is where what secularism does is it puts a ceiling on things and so I've been watching the Ricky Gervais thing after life and and and my I come away from that and I'm just like is this all you're asking for that okay so so be nice to people until you die that's the best we can have it it's like yeah you really set the bar high there buddy yeah yeah yeah well that that reminds me so when I worked out that this worked out but when I was trying to figure out these this idea of like the hierarchy of consciousness and I went down to the individual is there's there's that conscious guidance at the top now every individual in the system is receiving conscious guidance from above from the highest point and it filters its way down but to a secular materialist atheist which I know their perspective well all there is is just that individual that's it it's just a it's a flat plane full of those little individuals each of which has their own little consciousness and all the material facts at their feet and so like when Peterson would ask Sam questions like why questions it would go back trying to where's the source of your morality and he would say something like it's self-evident you know it's like well what so why is it moral for you to save your enemy's child from a burning building and he'll just say well duh it's just it just is you know because he still feels that conscious guidance like knocking on the top of his consciousness but he's just looking at his feet and he's saying well it's I just I feel it it's obvious you know I mean and I've obviously it must be obvious just based on these facts that I can see you know it's like he refused not just him but people of that mind refuse to look up and try to figure out where those things are coming from it's just like well it's self-evident they don't realize it's been handed to them through culture through etc but in this framework just through this kind of consciousness that we all have it's those kind of things are handed down it's you know them explaining where them explaining the shape of our morality is like all the best videos I've never made you know they're in my head they're so clear in my head but I can't actually make a video that good you know and I get oh I'm gonna do a video and I'm gonna talk about all about this it's all gonna be clear and you know no then this is the video that I actually make and and so I always get the sense with Brett Weinstein he's talking about all the evolutionary and all of this has developed into this morality that we have and it's like well then why are we even talking about it I mean and then suddenly we have to transcend this this Darwinian morality and well where did you get this other morality yeah where's that good coming from well we should transcend it and it's like who says should you can't have that should unless there's a bigger should outside of your the should that you're supposed to be transcending that's right otherwise you're because isn't this part of your assassin robot programming where did you get the enlightenment or inspiration or revelation in order to transcend everything that the biological systems have bequeathed you with yeah and to say we have to stop playing this game or we'll kill each other okay you know and and and it's it's again it's kind of like the guy who looks in the mirror and then forgets what his face looks like no you know your face it's you've been you've been describing your face to us but you have no idea is where you're getting any of this information from and so but yeah that's we're all like that yeah yeah we are yeah I probably derailed you no no no no no I'm derailing myself there's a lot of on okay yeah we'll go this way so let's say we take that that kind of model of reality this this kind of cone and especially if you keep the idea of the of the you know the the groups the principles and principalities where there's individuals to groups to communities to cities etc and they're all circles within circles within circles all revolving around this top thing now if you were to look at that model from the bottom and see these wheels within wheels within wheels within wheels I was I was thinking about this one day and because I was listening to the Bible project and they were talking about Ezekiel's vision and I was thinking I had this idea in my head this model and I was thinking I as a modern person would describe that as machinery or gears you know God's machinery God's golden you know the inside of a watch kind of machinery cogs and and but an ancient person wouldn't because they don't have that and they were talking about Ezekiel seeing the wheels within wheels within wheels and he called it the the wheels of God's chariot and they those guys they do a great podcast the one guy is a little more kind of like American kind of your standard American what would you say evangelical I don't know exactly so he was he was kind of stuck more on the literal he's like so Ezekiel saw a chariot and and it's like that's not I don't think that's exactly the point it's more like he saw and to me this might be my bias but I think it's like he sees what this this interacting you know wheels within wheels of reality itself and how things are organized through our consciousness and that's probably me making a giant leap and but I to me that's more what it's about it's like you see that and and even that vision organizes itself in that same thing where those wheels are at the bottom it's also they're attached to beasts periphery beasts you know that are multiple their multiplicity and then God's at the top on his throne of course and this is all coming to you through a text and a description that too because sometimes people will try to artists will try to render elements out of the book of Revelation one of my favorite ones is in the book of Revelation you have the tree of life and it's growing it's it's planted on both sides of the river of life and you think about that you say both sides how so then you see artists with you know every that up yeah and but it's you very much have the sense that okay even with a common dream that we have if we have a dream and you wake up and you try to articulate your dream now pay attention to the tools you must use you have to put it through your consciousness I was so I did one of the videos I did last week it could have been patterns and Peugeot and Peterson and Piaget someone dropped a comment in there which had an mp3 file from Rookmaker Rookmaker was a he's that he was a Dutchman who was attached to Libre he had a very interesting little lecture on reality that he did back in the 70s and he had a couple of really cool things in there one of it was you you only you you only see what you already know and so when it comes to this when it comes to this description of the of the throne slash chariot of the Lord that is shockingly by a irrigation canal outside of Babylon and and again understand now Ezekiel is from the priestly class and he was taken into exile too young before he actually was able to serve in the temple and then you know so much of Ezekiel's visions have everything to do with the temple and you know because that's who Ezekiel was and all of this has to come to us via written text and I mean though the whole thing so okay so then what does he see and how should we regard that which he sees yeah it's there's a reason there was all these books yeah it's rich and it's yeah and so then it's revelation well what do you mean by that well it's we use the way some of the other ways we use that word you know we wake up from a dream and suddenly in the dream everything made sense about our lives and it's like I had a revelation well what was it I'll get back to you on that you better do it fast so no so Ezekiel is such a I did Ezekiel for my Sunday school class last year the year before and wow people people don't yeah I need to I haven't read it I've only you know I just kind of know bits and pieces I'm working my way through the Bible slowly but it's taking time there's one more thing that I wanted to talk to you about because I know we're getting close and it's it's I think it comes it's kind of about my personal this is it kind of comes back to that analysis paralysis I think but I've noticed that there's a difference in the language that I use when describing stories from the Bible it feels more comfortable to say things like Ezekiel sees the wheels at the bottom rather than saw so using present tense versus past tense Moses ascends the mountain rather than ascended the mountain or he sees he talks to the bush rather than he talked to it and I don't know using the present tense almost seems like you can place it in this ever ongoing mythological structure where if you use the past tense it's it's very like historical literalistic in a way and I mean ideally you should probably be able to bridge those two but I noticed that I trip up when I use the past tense and I go oh wait do I mean that do I mean that he saw that or do I mean to say in the story he sees that you know and I just I catch myself a lot when I'm thinking about these things or talking about them well in different languages do different things with that so Greek has a way sometimes of something that happened in the past that is continuing to manifest itself in the present so the Greek language has a way of kind of embodying in English we have past present we also have the imperfect which is also different but right there you just you just hit on so there's this thing that happened well is is the Bible always happening well yes did the Bible did events in the Bible happen yes now a parable Jesus tells a parable in Luke 15 about a man had two sons now is Jesus talking about a guy who lived down the street no it was a parable so in that sense that parable is purely it's always happening and it never happened but but the Bible very much does not want to choose between that for important reasons for us because what tends to happen if you don't have that rootedness in the physical world you tend to have a Gnosticism which just sort of floats up and up and up and out of the world and again for me over the last year and a half in terms of if someone had asked the question well how has your Jordan Peterson journey and it's very much a Jordan Peterson journey it isn't it's by no means just Jordan Peterson it's people like you and Jonathan Peugeot and the dozens of people that I've had conversations with and the new things that I've read because of Peterson and all of this stuff if there's one big thing that has that this has really changed in me it is I am more I am more certain both of the necessity of the historical resurrection of Christ and the historicity of it and it and even with a lot of the Jonathan Peugeot stuff the the the so we get certain important things lots of roads travel through certain important things including the Protestant Reformation the it's easy now to look back and say ooh the Reformation it gots a bunch of things mucked up but it had to happen things had reached a breaking point in Western Christianity that had to be addressed and and and some of that has to do with this question of symbolism and mythology Tolkien I love Tolkien's mythology I love Middle-earth and I remember I first read it in junior high and and as a junior high kid for the life of me I wanted that to be so true I wanted to have Middle-earth with orcs and dwarves and wizards and elves and I just as a junior high kid I just wanted to live in that world yeah yeah and and so now in a sense I say yes that world is real but there's the the resurrection of Christ is so important to me in terms of you know that he rose from the grave that Mary grabbed on to him that Thomas said I ain't gonna believe this you know here's a modern we think yeah I'm not gonna believe this until mm-hmm okay Thomas but the scars are still there I mean it's and and then suddenly I realize oh man the dream I had as a junior high kid living in Middle-earth I've actually been given a gift that is far deeper and richer and better than that because I actually inhabit the story from which Tolkien derived his subcreation which was Middle-earth mm-hmm yeah but at the same time I'm like Bilbo and I don't like there I don't like all these dwarves coming into my house and muddying up the carpets and dragging me to be eaten by trolls and get in the midst of a fight between you know between the the chief dwarf oh yeah I just lost it now that you said it and the elves and Bilbo's like you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna take the Arkenstone and and I'm gonna I'm gonna hoodwink my friends because they're not behaving as they should and you know and yeah my life is like that too there's all kinds of issues and problems and ways I don't want to be in an adventure and I long for the the the reunion of heaven and earth so then you just have to trust that the author knows what he's doing basically yeah yeah yeah yeah and again as Americans oh we hate that because because what if I'm what if I'm Judas and not Peter oh and see on the other hand if you if you just frame it that way and I know Calvinists have sometimes framed it that way and many more times have been labeled as framing it that way no that's not exactly right too and Augustine had that crate this is that no you do have choice and and you do have to exercise will and if you're if you're concerned that you've committed the unforgivable sin you haven't and and and all of Jesus amazing promises asking it shall be given seeking you will find knocked and the door will be open those are all true and we just can't square that with all the other stuff but now you're back to your hierarchy where no we can't square it but we do by faith believe that it finally does hold together and the evidence for that is the way that we see cohesions and things together even with the limited capacity we have to see it yeah talk too much no no no no no no that's why I watch your videos every day to hear you talk so well I got here late so if you got another question or two and I don't have anyone after you because again I had a glitch in my schedule so yeah well I mean I could keep talking but it's your your time so well we can go another 15 okay let's see I've got my journal here I'll make you a deal if we go another 15 you'll let me post this no I'm already gonna let you post this has been a great conversation you can post it that's fine unless I say something very embarrassing in the next 15 minutes okay cool so one time you it was I don't remember I was listening to the podcast I don't even know if I knew the name of the podcast that I was listening to but you said I'm gonna quote you real quick you said I'm deeply secular and there are wonderful things to be gained from this perspective in some ways the secular room makes a nice hallway for lots of other rooms but what we're learning is that it's really hard to live in the hallway yeah and that that just like it's exactly where I am and it made me think a lot of things so aside from the personal stuff first it made me oh am I am I dropping out says my connection okay so I believe I think we emailed about this but the the discussion between Brett Weinstein and Jonathan Peugeot in I can't remember where they were somewhere in Canada and they it was like a Q&A at the end of some talk and Weinstein kind of he just he said I can't understand what I'm running afoul of here if if scientific if scientism I guess is kind of what he was saying it's not what he said but if that was belief system 1001 it is simply the best because it is the only one that can look at all the other systems and see why they're working and you know and explain them and to me that is that is the hallway right it's like you're in the hallway and you can see all the other rooms and you can kind of peek inside and see what's going on in there and you can compare them but I mean there's a few things places to go from there for one he got into the hallway by leaving a room so he brought the assumptions of the Judeo-Christian room into the hallway but again that was just interesting you know the hallway comparison it's like yeah you're in this you're in this no space where you can just you can see all these other systems going on and you can compare them and try to explain them but it's not the same as being in them and and participating in them and getting everything that comes from them so that Weinstein's I don't remember him making that comment but I'll assume you're retelling it correctly which I have no reason to believe you wouldn't be every system imagines it can see the other system clearly just like every person imagines they see the world clearly it's it's it's just a function of we all stand in a place and evaluate through the eyes that we have but what we don't do is like Sunday morning I got to church and I drove in and I saw someone had dumped a whole bunch of stuff around the dumpster and like oh the dumping that's always the illegal dumping and I went into church and I got busy with all of my things and at one point I caught I was out in the breeze when I looked over across the parking lot and I saw a shopping cart and more stuff and it looked like so used to be a homeless man here Daniel who's got a restraining order he can't come here all this kind of stuff I saw the shopping cart and I saw a whole bunch of stuff that looked like one of Daniel's old encampments and like bang right away and me first two thoughts is it's Daniel second thought is why didn't I see that when I drove in now it wasn't Daniel but why didn't I see that when I drove in it's and this gets back to what Jordan Peterson I think so eloquently describes that we have this we have this we imagine I've told the story before too I was friends with a guy who had very low vision and he had the same experience we have of seeing you know I can you know there's my peripheral vision about here all the way to here this whole image before me that my mind says I'm just seeing the room as it is there's Sam Harris well I had my friend with low vision he explained he says you know I really see kind of like through a paper towel tube but my mind fills in the gaps just like the reason I close one eye and I don't see the blind spot my mind fills in the gaps so well what does that say about how we see each other's systems we're just we're just we're just filling in the gaps well it's what you said before we see the things we know we're going to see so if you want to see simplistic fundamentalists who are idiots that's what you're gonna see when you look at the system that's right yeah or if you want to see godless scientists who believe in Darwin and are and and and this is where I think again Petersen's I was I've been listening to trying to find all Petersen's Peugeot references not Peugeot but a Peugeot references lately because that was fascinating to me and this this idea of the equilibrated state that you know it is in a sense if we're going to use the order chaos language it's where order and chaos get it right at the center and it goes out and it goes out and it just keeps going out and yeah the problem you know from from let's say Steven Pinker's point of view and Peterson talks this way sometimes too boy we've almost got poverty licked yeah well and and they're absolutely right in that we don't have anywhere near the challenges we used to have with starvation but we've done it at a cost of a number of things one of the a book that I read a number of years ago which was really a fascinating book the alchemy of air was about the fixation of nitrogen so basically towards the at the beginning of the 20th century using only organic fertilizer basically people guess the earth maybe has a carrying capacity in terms of food for maybe three three and a half billion people and Germany in particular doesn't have very good land climate isn't particularly good and Germany was always facing starvation now this is one of the drivers for war always facing starvation and so one of the German scientists ironically a Jew figured out how to pull nitrogen everybody was you know grabbing all the guano they could from Latin from South America grabbing all you know figure out how to grab nitrogen from the air because it's all around us and create well two things they could create with that chemical fertilizer and explosives became really important for Germany and they're only part of the 20th century they had now a reliable a reliable source of nitrogen for explosives and but then you think about okay wow we have this we have this artificial fertilizer now we can we can fertilize you know and the European fields were worn out that was part of the boon of coming to the new world because the land wasn't worn out now we can reliably put nitrogen back into the soil at a far better rate than let's just say planting beans or something which was sort of the old way and crop rotation so now suddenly the world has maybe a food carrying capacity of 10 billion people yeah but what have we done to the nitrogen cycle and and what happens with farm runoffs and and and and that's that's part of the way of that's part of the way of this particular scientistic paradigm yeah we let's feed everyone so we've create we've solved this problem and we kind of that's kind of sneakily created this problem it's kind of like DDT look go back to YouTube and find all the fun videos about DDT and they know the guys eating in and his porridge and all that the tribal guys are like I ain't gonna eat that DDT and of course you know then then 20 years later everybody's like oh you gotta stop the DDT because it's it's killing the fish and the birds you know so so so that's that's why I'm so I'm so pessimistic of so many utopias because we're just so bad at it yeah and if you want to look at the cycle that has been so then Peterson's talking about Piaget you know pay attention not just to the the outcomes but pay attention to the process well here's the process we see a problem we use whatever power we can to fix the problem usually at someone else's or something else's expense and we solve our problem and then we realize oh a lot of today's problems were the solutions to yesterday's problems horse manure was the problem so now we have the internal combustion engine okay now co2 is a problem and yes we'll get comments about co2 that's just an illustration of how we are and this is where again you get back to your your hierarchies we were just we're playing with these hierarchies so let's put internal let's put let's not worry about gasoline and the internal combustion engine so we can get rid of all these horses and and let's not worry about what we're gonna do the nitrogen cycle once we fixate nitrogen from the atmosphere and this is what we're doing and to imagine we'll do this forever well nobody even dares imagine that you need you need you need God to imagine that yeah that it raises the question to me do you keep well do you keep messing things up by trying to fix it or I mean you can't just sit back and do nothing right we're always replacing problems with new problems right so do you well do you just bear that cross until the end and then you just you know I mean they yeah I know exactly what you mean Peterson Peterson is right and you know I so you know you read 12 rules for life and so much so much good stuff in that book there's so much you know he's he's been able to gain so much wisdom so much good advice and so and all that is good people should get off the couch brush off the dust from the Cheetos and you know do what you've done you know find a woman make a commitment start a career raise some children you should do those things that's what you're made to do but both so in the Roman Catholic tradition you have nature grace and they kind of stack it up that way that's what Roman Catholic theology does you know Calvinism tried to synthesize it into into one so your work is your worship and you know every all of these systems are all of these systems that they're all our systems so but no we should do these things and so we okay so let's say let's assume that yeah we can put too much co2 into the atmosphere for our own good well let's see if we can do something about that so you know Peterson is right and so when you get when you get going on his sacrament which is meaning boy let's let's pick up this cross of of environmental degradation and start cleaning up this world and you know what this is the the image of God in us gets it swells up and we and we actually become heroic and we do heroic things this is what we were made to do but we will always so that's when Peterson's Augustinian anthropology comes in and says yeah and you're probably gonna muck it up and so you've got problems over here and problems over there this is our lot and so you know we pray for the grace of God we ask God to move and forward we travel so and that's exactly right Wow well I think we wrapped it up pretty good there in the last 15 minutes well this has been fun I'm so glad yeah I'm so glad I messed up my schedule and did a conversation today this is because I'm I'm all you know I've got a million things I've got to do before we leave that you know I haven't left the country in years you know yeah the missionary days and all the kids are coming and and so I'm just kind of like oh there's a million details and wrangling a bunch of you know young adults is different from wrangling a bunch of little kids when yeah little demigod in the house that yeah have your stuff down here at this time or you're not coming yeah so you've kind of talked about it at one point you said that Peterson was gonna be doing like a call in to the yeah it's not gonna happen I'm gonna happen so are you gonna be just speaking with John Anderson and then John Anderson's not gonna be there either it's gonna be the Paul Vanderkley show so actually I got to make a video right after this and post it and and and see actually the the guys who set this up you know they they said to me they said it'd be really great if like you could do a conversation with Jordan Peterson and John Anderson as and we could tape that and that could be the kickoff for the show I thought yeah that'd be really great I thought boy I hope they can get Peterson and Peterson and Anderson on board and then they said so why don't you get Peterson it's like yeah actually so I sent Jordan an email and he responded right back to me it's the kind of set the setup it's again I'd like to do this but you know but look at how the dude's been living so I you know Jordan Peterson owes me nothing I am I am I am 100% gratitude to Jordan Peterson for the work that he has done for this world I really am because I think I'm a fanboy through and through I haven't flipped like a bunch of other people I I the stuff he has given us has been I think gold yeah but I'm a 55 year old I'm more his I'm more his contemporary rather than you know a son so at the same time he's another guy you know and he's he's got all the same issues I got so to have him say on one hand I know I've I'm sure that I flaked on other people for probably far lesser reasons than then he couldn't have the conversation with me so yeah so and and for the office these guys in Australia you know but they when they contacted me a few months ago I thought they had to be out of their mind I thought who on earth is gonna actually show up and listen to me I know who shows up and listens to me at the room make that big over here but it's been you know whatever happens I I'm grateful for the opportunity and I the truth is you know so then I go around this and I do these meetups in different parts of the country when I can like get my travel paid for I you know somehow and sit down in a room and if four people show up or if ten people show up or if thirty people show up it's all good yeah just like these conversations I mean it's I people told strangers to me sign up to talk to me for an hour yeah and some people look at that and say you got to be crazy what what you know what if they're an idiot well I'm an idiot too so it'll be too idiot yeah so you know I got my YouTube channel started with the Freddie and Paul show this is who I am yeah and then to me cool people like you I mean that's been that's been just the joy of this whole thing yeah it's I I loved watching your channel grow I since the very beginning I think I watched your first video really it's funny yeah I was your first I'm sorry your first video on Peterson yeah and it's funny the journey that I've come on just because I was still very much in my kind of atheistic materialistic phase but I was really hooked on Peterson's work and then I was like oh this guy's it's all Christian like can I really approach this stuff you know what I mean and I just kept watching kept watching and watching more Peugeot and doing my own reading and as I'm miles away from where I was just what a year and a half ago and all for the better so I really appreciate everything you do I know you hear that a lot but it's appreciated I feel I feel yeah now you're gonna make cry or used to watch a break up you know I feel nothing but gratitude for for what has happened over this this time frame for me it's it's been so much fun you know and and to me I'm a Christian so I just say God is so good God is so good and and this is why you know people get pessimistic and yeah there's reasons to be afraid and yeah the wheels could come off our civilization and yeah we could cook the earth or yeah we could blow it up there's a there's so many things that bad that could happen but the the real the real comfort and joy of being a Christian is to is to actually have a sense in your deepest self that you know what the the world got God is the best storyteller that that there can be and the story of this earth although for many people and in many places and times crushingly sad and tragic that the God who can make the glory of Yosemite National Park who a God who can make the amazing creatures that human beings really are this God can take the suffering and tragedy of this world and in some ways the deeper the tragedy the greater the glory he can make out of it and when I when I see that and have a vision for that that you know talk about meaning as sacrament I'm I'm flushed with meaning and there's there's almost you know and the meaning and courage and and and love and it's a for me it's it's I've never done drugs so I don't know what drugs feel like but for me it's like a drug and it's it gives me joy and confidence that God is good and and in the end despite all of our questions his will will be done and it will be better than any of us can imagine and we will see it and that to me boy no better way Wow yeah well I really appreciate it Paul this has been a really good talk sorry did so much preaching to you today no but hey I'm still trying to find a church I need some preaching so well thank you so much cord and yeah permission I see problem is when I have a great conversation like this it's like I want to post this right now yeah you have my permission you can post this for sure all right well thank you cord this has been wonderful yeah thank you very much have a good day take care bye bye
