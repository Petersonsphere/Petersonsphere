 Now I just had the the child care center that you that uses a building there isn't here so a whole bunch of maintenance wants to get done on it so just stuff I recorded a video this afternoon and along conversations I'm still figuring out this how to how to how to juggle everything so yeah how are you been pretty good busy works been real busy I've I was just today catching up on all your videos so that's how swimming in the back of my mind now which is interesting it feels like there's been kind of a thematic relationship though in a lot of your recent videos especially of course maybe this is just the lens I'm looking at everything through but I've been reading a lot of barfield so I just did a big video today on barfield yeah one so I'll post that tomorrow what was what was the high level well just his basic thesis and how how that addresses the meaning crisis which is the divided world yesterday I did a conversation with someone who is a graduate student of of of philosophy who he basically using panpsychism to try to rebalance the universe and that was interesting part of the problem is that I'm living my videos you know I'm living sequentially and because of how I have to manage all the conversations get posted later yeah so actually one of the ideas that I'm thinking about is having because I'm trying to figure out what to do with so Peterson's gonna have this whole new thing he's releasing and of course patreon is still out there and so one of the things I'm thinking is maybe having subscription service where I post at least the videos that I know I have permission in within the sequence so that maybe subscribers could see them early in the sequence so they wouldn't be out of sequence with the other videos but I'm you know it's I I this isn't my full-time job and I really can't let it become that way that's not fair to the church so I'm just trying to keep everything balanced so yeah that's gonna be tough yeah yeah and summertime is busy because my kids are home from school and my wife you know my wife is home from school so there's just always a lot of stuff to balance in summer so but but no barfield was barfield is so I used one of Malcolm Geit or Gates he's got some interesting YouTube videos yeah he kind of gets a little bit into stuff but he but he gets a good summary I think yeah some of his ideas so tomorrow tomorrow will be a big and of course if we release this it'll be a long time did all the sequence will be messed up but tomorrow I'll release that one I've got a pattern now of releasing them in the morning at least in the morning California time and that that's been working for me so I'm yeah I'm I did the I really today I released the the conversation with you know four of us that was fun I want to figure out how to how to let some of the people talk with each other you know I had a conversation with Mary and Cassidy and yesterday I recorded a new one with Nick from Santa Cruz who's been in four cults that was a great conversation that can I had yesterday and so I'd love to see some of the people interact with each other and I know that's happening yeah behind the scenes but I know you mentioned I caught a bit of that one you mentioned maybe having a sub channel that might be interesting too yeah where and I know one of the things the comments that came out of that was well would that what percentage of those conversations would be interesting or useful because and that that's fair and that's one of the reasons why it might be good to have a sub channel as you point out but it might not even be important how what percentage of them are interesting is as that the conversations themselves happen and then that might kick off something else that is interesting you know as part of this community and and that happens all the time sometimes you'll be in a conversation and you know it's it's just kind of going along and doesn't seem to you know yeah it's like oh now the whole conversation is different even the stuff we had before Sunday I preached a sermon in which a lot of the sermon is kind of this getting up to something and then at the end now suddenly you realize why I had to go through all this stuff and and part of part of our problem in this ADHD culture is we have so little patience to you know because so many things you have to pay your dues you have to do your homework got to get there before you get the payoff and today we just want instant gratification and many of the best things in life doesn't work that way so yeah I've been a lot of the barfield books I've been reading he'll refer to other languages without any sort of translation whether it's Greek or French or whatever it is and I realize he's just assuming that oh yeah if you're you're literate in this period of time you know these things you know yeah and even logos when it's written you know in the original Greek you're like oh what is that okay it's logos but about the dues you pay back then are much greater than we have to us today oh yes oh yes and I'm reading this book on Erasmus fatal discord it's Erasmus of Luther it's a great book but Ron Dart recommended it to me and it's you know I didn't realize how formative Erasmus was in developing what would become the the dominant classical education liberal arts education in the West I mean it was Erasmus that set that thing into motion but you had Erasmus and Luther and oh Wow so I know today I last couple of days I've just had a real deep dive not really a deep dive into barfield but just an immersion into barfield because I was making this video and taking some verveky stuff with it and because it's it's really barfield is really helpful in the verveky area of exploration because you know I've I scheduled a conversation John and I were gonna talk in a couple of weeks and I don't know how much barfield he knows but once and and I know other people barfield's gonna unnerve some people because we we like to especially with a very literalistic view of scripture that sort of implies a very flat assumption about language well that yeah that's the soup we live in yeah is is that we're all scientists and that we're using this language in very technical ways right and that when we say things they have very precise meanings right but yeah how many of the words do you use did you invent right not many if any yeah well when you watch the video tomorrow I think you'll I think you'll appreciate it I hope you'll appreciate it I you know most of the videos I do after I finished doing a video I always feel a little embarrassed by it because it's like well but then it's like I spent I spent all this time doing it what am I gonna just delete it no I'll just put it out there and and sometimes like the the CS Lewis kindness video I almost didn't post that because like yeah talk about politics that's just gonna be a that's just gonna be a headache for me but now just put it out there maybe no one will watch it so I noticed that things people don't like it's summertime now so that actually the channels and a little bit of a lull because people are busy in the summer with other things mm-hmm and weekends too don't tend to get as much traffic so if there's a video that I think I'll just put it out on a Saturday and maybe no one will watch it but people seem to like it so I don't know I don't know yeah I don't know what I'm doing which scares me some days maybe maybe years from now I'll say why did I post anything I don't know I think it's clear whatever is going on it's something good that's that seems clear based on the fruit of it so far so yeah if I didn't think it was good I would stop so yeah and I'm not stopping so so what's on your mind what do you want to talk about um I guess one of the things there's so many things like one of the things as I don't know if you remember an email I wrote you back about kind of tweaking the meaning has Jordan Peterson's sacrament I kind of put a twist on that to say more just this idea I guess that meaning is is very corruptible and it it takes place at these kind of unconscious or subconscious levels and so it it has this great dependent it's almost like this computer that's always going and it has this reliance for for so for your relationship to meaning to be meaningful in some sense you have to have this connection to the truth and so I guess what I what I was coming away with is that at the top of Peterson's hierarchy is the truth and and and again from his perspective the truth isn't something really access we're always at this remove from it but we are aware of occasionally we're aware of when we consciously lie and that this this is the thing that kind of began his item autobiographical journey to where he is now it's kind of like the thread he pulled on because as soon as he he decided I'm gonna notice every time I consciously want to lie and it's funny too because he he mentions that the line is kind of like in his book the 12 rules for I've you talk about like I can feel my solar plexus like when I there's something in me or he uses the phrase I feel like I'm being pulled or twisted apart versus coming together that's how I know when I when I'm saying I'm something I really believe I feel I'm getting power and like I'm becoming stronger and when I say something that I don't believe I I have this sense of being pulled apart and that really had an impact on me and made me think that one of the things that happens when you lie is that you you you further slice the world up into smaller pieces including even yourself and you know I talked about last time about how I had this realization of you know nihilism and in that that this was kind of it's funny because I would have never considered myself a nihilist but I what I what I realized listening to Peterson was that was kind of my life was compartmentalized in all these different areas and that my default way of filling a block was nihilism so if if something wasn't going the way I wanted it to like a relationship or my job whatever else I could just like draw a little box around that be like okay within that frame I'm just gonna treat this as meaningless and I think I think we're encouraged to do that again with this kind of technical use of language we think we can kind of slice the world up and kind of cut it into these little pieces and that we're doing so and we in a very clever way and and it's because we've we've I think Luke said at the other day like and your thing I was listening today you know that this idolization of the intellect and kind of falling in love with the product of that and the kind of nice clean lines that it produces in the imagination that that what it is producing is knowledge we don't realize that we've taken this living thing we've cut it apart and it's lying dead on our little examination mat and now it all the function and form of it has now been lost to us in its current state you know we've you and you mentioned a lot in a lot of your videos how time plays into things and it's some of this use of language is an attempt to try and like pause everything and like because that gives us the illusion that we understand something we were it's this over simplifying magnifying lens that we're using to to break the world into pieces I know that I'm going all over the place with this but it's hard for me to draw this thread together because I see it everywhere it's really the kind of the soup we're living in in the in the the age that we're in and there was there was a barfield quote I have here that kind of draws a little bit of this this idea we all imagine our not only do we imagine ourselves as scientists but when we look back into history we imagine all these other people as scientists and we they're failed scientists and he says you know imagination history bare common sense these are nothing beside the paramount necessity that the great mumbo-jumbo the patent double million magnifying inductive method should be allowed to continue contemplating its own ideal reflection a golden age in which every man was his own Newton in a world dropping with apples because we live in this world where all these scientific advances have happened we kind of all imagine ourselves that we are scientists in some respect even though we're not even doing it well we're doing it very sloppily we're kind of but we the I guess the the method of the of reductionism as a way to things is kind of it's taken for granted now as that's that's what the way you produce understanding is you slice this up into kind of small boxes and what you find this this often finds itself revealed in is a false dichotomy right it's either this or that you know like it's you're either you're either left or right you know and if you're not right you must be left and if you're not left you like you there's no like there's no complexity left in the world everything's kind of black and white it's like this kind of overwhelming desire for certainty that's that's driving everything why you know I I often that that desire for certainty becomes you know comes up you know so I read Frank Schaeffer's book crazy crazy for God Frank Schaeffer kind of makes the desire for certainty into a into a boogeyman of sorts into a demonic figure I don't think it's so much a desire for certainty as a desire for mastery and control and outcomes because again and again we want certainty our certainty isn't just certainty isn't certainty does have a sense of beauty in it but it's not that we want certainty in the same way we want beauty we want certainty as instrumental so that we can ensure outcomes as a I think it's as a function of our wills because I mean part of what I think has so you know wind the tape back part of why we decided to make this exchange and bar field use the uses as an illustration Odin exchanging knowledge for one of his eyes yep yep part of what why on earth would we make that exchange well clearly there's something we we want out of it and a lot of what we've gotten out of that if you read let's say you've all Harari's homo sapiens is hey famine disease war these things that have really ravaged humanity have at our time and place been to a great degree pushed down and away and that's not a small that's not a small thing and and that in a sense puts others who are who say yeah but to Steven Pinker that kind of puts him back on their heels because this is no small thing but for me this then boils down into the question of well what what actually and I use my little my little cell phone stand a lot in this video what exactly is the role of matter in the universe what is this role what is it for and this is a way of let's say asking a gnostic because a gnostic would say well this is perhaps a passing phase and we're moving on to a matterless existence but in Christianity no we're awaiting resurrection not just immateriality now and so and so in the Christian worldview what is the what is the telos of matter of stuff and I think I think obviously it's glory and and matter communicates glory I was I was so I was pondering I listened to for exercise I've been walking lately on a levee in Sacramento that you know by the river in the morning it's really lovely and I was driving back and there was a car at the intersection driving through and it was a a poor couple a bad car you know I live in a fairly poor neighborhood and so you just look at you get a picture of just knowing here I get a picture of their lives just to imagine aspects of their lives and so it's like okay how how do they live in what what function does does stuff play for them these are you know not unimportant questions especially in a world that says well this is this is finally what matters especially because a bullet to the head or a noose around the neck is a pretty consequential thing so one of the you know one of the things that I one of the long-term projects that I continue to roll around is okay so so we've got the ideal we've got the subjective we've got all this stuff going what's the role of stuff I don't know still thinking about it yeah it's um it's a tough one yeah it's very gets down to a level that we have a tough time thinking about one of the things barfield talks about in terms of language because language seems to be this thing that is basic unit of thought but he points out that a lot of languages in their infancies tend to be much more poetical this comes out in his poetic diction which was kind of his big first published work that he he dedicated to to CS Lewis he wrote it right after the that the great war letters yeah and he dedicated to Lewis with the his dedication was opposition is true friendship because they kind of really butted his heads and then Lewis did kind of force him to strengthen some of the more logical sides of his arguments that and actually some of the language indirectly from so he referred to poetry and what we we get out of it is this felt change of consciousness where it's like we're at this level of consciousness and we ascend to this other level and it's causes this feeling that we like you know I think for bake he kind of mentions this too when his kind of the sense of realization this aha and one of the things he points out is that poetry in its infancy was or rather language in its infancy was always more poetical because it again it had this connectedness to the language where these language had this life in it and and now we've kind of now that we've divided language in all these pieces where you have to use this very precise way of doing things he says that the poet's job is to kind of rediscover beneath the landscape how these things are connected and like they're like the the roots are still there beneath the ground you can go find them and then you connect them and then you read you have that aha again like you're rediscovering these sorts of connections and it's interesting you know all the I see this theme in terms of a lot of people in in your last conversation like with Luke and his orthodoxy right in the sense that we went wrong in Augustine and there's a sense in which I totally agree with that in a certain sense but I also see that well do you think that that God abandoned the leadership of the church well that would be crazy to think right or even if you think a further turn that we took in the Protestant reformation where again it's this you can see there's a this good and bad there's something there's a process where something's being fleshed out into all these kind of I think Luke called the intersectionality you know did for for religion it's Protestantism where we have this kind of splitting and splitting and splitting that to me seems like it's there's a lot of bad in it but it it does allow for this further exploration of things and I guess I'm trying to figure out like what is or where is this all moving towards you know is there is there any hope for like some sort of you know reunion of the body here and now of because you know that's one of the things Jesus always says you know they will they'll know you're my disciples by your love for each other and that's a little bit harder to see nowadays because you know most of what we the ways in which we define ourselves as religious communities is how we're different from the other people that's kind of that's you know how we how we represent ourselves well one of the you know one of the the the the fatal discord book is so helpful on some of these issues maybe it's just so helpful for me now because I'm paying attention to what so barfield you know barfield very much sees an evolution of consciousness and so you had you know let's say primitive participation or primary participation and then you have this split world where the person thinks that the rest of the world is dead well that's that's a that's an advantage and disadvantage it's lonely but it's useful for all of the colonizing and manipulating things and then of course barfield says guy at the end of the the one lecture that I post mentions that barfield in the 70s thought you know before each major turn in this there's always a period of instability and the 70s was very much an unstable decade and in some ways I feel that the these we're in a period similar to the 70s in some ways but you know that the Protestant Reformation there was so much going on there in terms of many of these types of issues that barfield is talking about and and so the contrast between and Luther is so instrumental there because what Erasmus was doing was he began to so everyone was excited about texts you have late Renaissance humanism there and Erasmus is he wants to now printing is going out so what what he can do is they can do a side-by-side comparison of the Latin Vulgate which was done by Jerome and then they're trying to set the Greek next to it and you know some some of those differences that the look Jerome's Vulgate was not put together with a great amount of care and that document served as the Word of God for the Roman Catholic Church for a thousand years by the time you get to Erasmus and Luther and one interesting that's just use one example out of Ephesians 5 well Jerome calls marriage a sacramentum in Latin a sacrament but in Greek it's a mysterious and you see that and you you realize that Erasmus puts that out at the Reformation and you know hey boom there's a there's a division that we're gonna do the Vulgate translate other places where it says is this mysterious to sacrament it's interesting well that's that'll I I don't know but that's just one notable there's a lot of examples like that and so this is part of why the book is interesting but so you've also got the combination that of the printing press so you've got this increasingly you have this thing that we are so used to living with called public opinion and and think about how public opinion would be mediated before the printing press think about I mean think of it there's this thing that we say the Bible is the Word of God what's the difference between spoken speech and written speech and you know even Plato was concerned about in verveky talks about now you have a Greek alphabet now writing is getting easier and easier instead of hieroglyphs which are all these symbolic so now you have an alphabet and and suddenly words on a page are different from things spoken in air and now we're talking into YouTube where it can be you know rewound and propagated and and you start putting all these things together and it's like oh wow so barfield is you know it could be that we are going to see barfields time come soon as as we begin to process that maybe when Aristotle saw that things you know this moves towards the earth out of love because it loves you know earth this is you know highly refined earth in a way and so it moves on purpose well no it doesn't move on purpose there's this thing called gravity I took a trip down the rabbit hole on this someone sent me oh people sent me stuff it was a Doug Lazar the YouTube or the the Area 51 guy with the you know with the spaceships and the flying saucers and you know we're talking about gravity and I mean the truth is we have no idea how gravity works and you know the other thing we don't know is how what role God is playing in all this I think is what do we mean when we say that word but GK Churches and like had this this thing where he said well we don't know that God doesn't take great delight in doing all these little things around us that like you know he maybe our father is he says our father is younger than us and that he still has this great delight in in like making a flower bloom in the sun come up every day and that like the the wonder of it all hasn't been lost for him like it has been lost for him and that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to us in some sense and I think there is something in in our reductionism that we do we we lose so much right it's it's this filter or as Jordan Peterson it's a map that covers the world that we don't see the world we see our map of it you know and the reason we have that map is like you pointed out we want we want control we want to make sure that when I do X Y happens reliably most of the time and if it doesn't you know I can control it and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to me and I think that's the thing that I think is so important to quickly you know using this map figure out why and so that that that desire for control I do think it does it does it does eliminate a lot of our ability to just enjoy and have gratitude because we have um I do I do think it does it does it does eliminate a lot of our ability to just enjoy and have gratitude because we have we have these very defined ideas of how we want things to be and we think if it was this way it would be good and then we get it that way and we're like oh well not just a little bit different and it'll be good you know and like it's um it's interesting how we iterate through this and haven't yet seem to figure out you know what is it we really want which gets gets really big into those those issues of agency in terms of you know you you were talking with within your four panel discussion today with you know Joe was saying how he this idea of a guy that's like oh I'm just gonna you're so crappy but I'm gonna love you anyway and I don't it seems I don't know like it I can understand why he would feel that way and why that why you could write a version of and I couldn't believe in that God either you know there seems to me that I don't know I there's this sense in which sometimes when when I when I feel like I'm actually having something that is revelation that it's a sense of you know peterson uses this like I it's like something I already knew like I think she uses this language as well it's like it's your remembering it's almost like and in when you get kind of weird and mystical but like it does make me wonder to what degree is is is God operating in our consciousness you know is is that a necessary component of consciousness that that God is present in some way like that maybe it can't really exist without his interaction and you know there's this there's this extent to which we are separate which is a good thing right because it allows for allows for love well couldn't we was just all one it wouldn't like the love would wouldn't be possible and so and it seems like and the Christian story love is is the supreme thing and it does it does require something like voluntary you know there has to be a voluntary element of it I guess that's one of things that that that scares me you know it's like there's still a part of me that is there's the cynical side of me is still there that the the nihilist that like like I'm still uncovering areas of my life where like I still have that kind of default nihilism and and what it what it buys you again is like the ability to just all it doesn't matter what I do here so I don't have to pay that close attention to it and it allows me to reduce right because if I don't care about these areas it allows me to care more about these other areas that I think so it's like it's a way of using that scientific magnifying lens to be like okay only only these things matter and these things over here don't matter but it seems like what we really want is is to have everything matter you know all the little details that they're all they're all part of the story like you know when you go back and read the story again oh well you didn't realize that that turn there was really important yeah and you know at the time you missed it but that me I think that's what we really want is to have a life that is suffused with with more of those moments that had a real impact and real effect on the larger story yeah and even and even to have those moments means something later there's a thrill and a joy in that too and you know our field has this great which is again is in the video this great realization that he and Lewis had where you know if you take if you take a wire and you pass it over the the magnets you generate current you know it's how we generate electricity and and and he noted that it's the change you know it's the it's the change in the polarity that gives the right the felt change felt conscious Lewis put the felt in and that's that's so true and and yeah yeah and and so we want we so so if you're watching a movie you know movies are you know this medium where you always have to remind remind you in a good movie everything is intentional it's like the I think was it was a check off or someone who said boy if you have a gun in the first act somebody better be shot by the third you know you all of the everything everything won't nothing will be wasted and and when we look at our lives we not only want that but we also want it to be true in the past so that when something comes in the future and I just I just talked to Karen about suffering a little bit and that that's part of the dynamics of suffering part of the dynamics of redemptive suffering so that when something comes in the future the past is redeemed and that the stumble when it happens or the loss when it happens something coming in the future Christianity has this idea of of greater glory and if if we were to watch a movie in which a bunch of happy people get everything we would not watch the movie yeah I would not be good story we we we saw only the good stories are nail biting and cliffhanging and disaster but always hope you know and so it's it's these changes that but yeah as as people what do we want for our children you know we don't want you know I don't want them to suffer I don't want them to stumble but then you know my children are now young adults and you watch them and they do stuff they make decisions it's like and they're going to pay for that yeah wish they wouldn't have to but they will and it's life yeah yeah yeah it's tough I'm sorry my brain just went like five different directions at once your your conversation the other day with I can't remember her name from England with the tough to understand accent that was that was so what was her name she bond she bond that was that was s I had no idea how to say it but she I said how do you say your name she bond it's kind of like Yvonne but with it was very interesting listening to her it was interesting for me because I mean I grew up in a in that tradition where like you know people are saying things all the time and it's like you know how do you how do you sort between you know somebody's somebody's thoughts and what's real it's it's interesting it's very interesting well it's it's you know and it's so what we've done again I just have this video that I made fresh on it I mean so at the end at the end of the one video that I played with with Malcolm guy talking about barfield he brings up Thomas Kuhn and Thomas Kuhn the history of scientific revolutions which is a book I read in college in a philosophy class and that really impressed me when I read it in college if I reread it now it probably doubly impressed me but he makes the point that you know when when there's a reigning paradigm in science that reigning paradigm acts like a filter and if you go to a Pentecostal church if you're a pastor you will always have people coming up to you telling well even if it's not Pentecostals well I think God wants this this is what God wants and then usually if you're the pastor it's like okay pastor this is what God wants you go up in the pulpit and turn the screws on everybody about this thing that I'm telling you that God wants as the pastor it's like okay well when it's your turn to preach you can go right ahead and we'll see how that goes but this is this is a part of life and that's why I was so delighted that she called and just shared openly and because and I I was first going to put a little front piece to make a few disclaimers now I'm just going to put a put it out there I'm gonna let that as good I mean I got a lot out of it honestly and I mean it was you know I think it's clear to me that God has to speak to people like and you know you had a conversation a while back with the most the politicians name John something John was it John Wood oh yeah John Wood Jr. yeah where he was talking about his interactions where God you know he decided to imagine that God existed and then once he did he started talking to him yeah and it's it's funny how that is there's something like we have to have if we if all we see is this this filter you know if we don't amend that that's all we'll see if we don't ever cut through the filter if we don't imagine another possibility that's all we will see is that map so it's it's I think that's why sometimes it's so important that we talk to people with different points of view why we you know have real experiences with matter with things that oppose our will and and like we have we get things wrong you know that's Peterson says you know that's kind of where we experience the transcendent the most is in error if we don't have those moments of error we don't we don't get to find out hey this is there's more here than I thought one of the things that brought to my mind was the whole thing with going back to this Eastern versus Western in the church one of the things I thought about you know with with all these icons is you know like one of the I guess the Protestant you know way we would look at icons and some of the things the Catholics do is that you know these things are being confused for God right there's like you know they're like they're idols and we what occurred to me listening to a lot of people talk about this is like okay well actually you know I think most people can look at those in like they're they're the fact that they're made by humans is written all over them like so we we know in some sense you could confuse them for being something divine and worship them instead of God but I think there's something about them that keeps it in front of us that they were made by humans but then when we shipped over into the Protestant world where now we don't have some of those things and it's it's all about our ideas about God it's much more easy for me to confuse my idea about God for being God than it is for me to confuse that icon you know images are not a lot of images are verbal yeah those don't get filtered out no that's very that's a number of people have that's an important point to keep in mind Jonathan Peugeot always says symbolism happens and I might I might tell him at some point I kind of class and I kind of iconoclasm has happened too yeah it's happened you know in the Orthodox Church there's been these iconoclastic moments in Orthodoxy so no these are these are really interesting these are really interesting dynamics yeah but it seemed it does seem necessary that there's this kind of destruction of the old before the new can can come into play and if what we really want is that that that change you described that felt change of consciousness we have to be willing to to go through the pain of that that death and rebirth and it is it's hard because I think Eric said this the other day on one of your discussions like we have this tendency to have a faith in answers themselves we want to get to the right answer and be like I'm done and I got here ahead of everybody else so I'm right yes well again I think that's connected with the certainty thing that we want answers because again answers are manipulable for us and once we have them we they become instrumental to us and with these answers we can then achieve secure you know and all of this in independence from God these are ways that we are rebellion against God gets expressed through those answers and and this is all part of our you know our rebellion against God and and this I think you know sets up Lewis's lovely lovely phrase where you know we are not you know we are rebels who must lay down our arms and and God you know I talked something some of the Mexican and the feminine we are in terms of our relationship with God we're the feminine God will have us the you know the way you know the the the man has the woman and and and and so then the part of joy that it's a it's a feminine joy that we discover of of being not being had by a con man but but being loved and possessed and cherished by a lover and you know this is that's that's the joy but but unless you can understand unless you can understand any quality that the blessings of inequality you cannot have these particular blessings Lewis calls it the specific and the specific pleasure of the inferior yeah and yeah you know it's it's interesting that you know that point you know the point you were making about John Wood Jr. You know Peterson there's some real stuff is so complicated I mean Peterson's acting as if God is real if you if you if you don't believe that's not a bad place to start yeah and and there's a video that contradicts himself because he says he doesn't act as if God exists. Right that's right but I do I do I do like that he takes that very seriously you know I think I think it's a part of him taking point on still pulling on that truth Fred like he's still mulling it over whether he can say that truthfully or not. Yeah yeah yeah well there's layers to it so so someone today sent me a little Russell Brand video that was on Twitter why I believe in God and he actually goes into the act as if God exists he follows Peterson in there because you know we know that he's in Peterson have spoken at least twice. I but the question you asked her you know the first line in his video is I believe God to be limitless consciousness and then goes on from there and I thought well I'm gonna have to do a video on this this Russell Brand thing. But you know part of so when I listen to Russell Brand go through his little video there are you part of. Languaging this kind of stuff is is so difficult and that gets to the the the icon question with the Eastern and and Roman Catholic churches the images because you know Protestant churches continue to try to use verbal images. Although those can get idolatrous to. Yeah yeah yeah yeah because and if you listen to so I was listening to a thing from a from an Eastern from an Orthodox Church in the middle of the country going on you know John gospel of John and mystic OJ and they kept just talking about that you know things that cannot be spoken and. Yeah there's always kind of at some point you have to realize the limitations of language but you don't want to do that too soon and you don't want to do that completely because the word becomes flesh and the Bible actually communicates with us in written form and I think in many many times we. We don't think enough about that. And you know much of the Bible it's postulated is actually recorded speech and I think sometimes if we recorded in the sense of the Bible is actually a kind of a And I think sometimes if we recorded in the sense somebody was writing down what someone was saying out loud correct but at the same time you can't push that too far because especially if you look at you know other parts of the Bible it's clear that it was consciously and intricately. Structured to produce certain effects words are chosen and then you have these parts of the Bible I mean the New Testament in particular quite likely that Jesus spoke Aramaic and so that you're reading Greek and so then part of what happens is you say well what might have been the Aramaic beneath this and you get into something like the gospel John there's all these word plays in Greek and say well those don't work in Aramaic so. So where's this coming from is it really coming from Jesus. Everyone should have a class in or maybe no one should have a class in New Testament studies it's it's you get into these things all the time which is probably part of the reason I've gotten into this whole Jordan Peterson for bakey Owen not Owen Benjamin Owen Barfield rabbit hole. Yeah back on the on the on the thing with the line there was a thought I wanted to wrap up there was. You know one of the things that I think Peterson discovered was that. Your so any like some. Anytime you lie in the sense like I said earlier you kind of you're you're making this extra compartment you're you're making a certain sense that you can't. There's some sort of power in our speech that you can't. Not believe to some extent the things you say it's one of the studies of neurobiology is that like people always remember the things they say more than anything else and like you know. And there's something that you become attached to that and what he found was that you know. You you can't you can't twist your use of language without twisting whatever it is inside of you that you use to delimit truth from error that that thing gets twisted anytime you consciously lie. In that. His sorting himself out thing is is is it's all connected to this trying to and in his in his articulation of it you can't you can't ever know you're saying the truth because again you have this removed from the truth but you can. Take note of the conscious lie and try to work your way back from those and try to undo the lies that you've kind of built into your to your being. As a way to kind of and I think that's that's kind of what he why he takes it so deadly seriously anytime he says something you notice like when he talks he's very very careful. And it's it's it seems like it's this attempt to to kind of stand back from himself and watch in my in is what I'm going to say next what I really believe. Which is I think I think what. What I think is part of what makes him really charismatic I think there's this sense in which you know I've had this kind of intuition lately that there's this this correspondence between truth and false. That charisma is a way in which truth is broadcast and kind of nonverbal ways so that there's some sort of correspondence between what's being said the contents of what's being said and then something else that we're picking up on and so that. There is it's it's a sense in that we can know okay because we're all kind of tuned towards were kind of information scavengers right and so when somebody has this kind of their broadcasting signal X and this other correspondence to it when those two things come together it's like alright okay here's some good information you know this has been tested in some real way I can I can glean something of value here even if it's like I can't see the truth in the truth. I can I can glean something of value here even if it's like even if it's just about it could be about very trivial things will listen to somebody with that kind of charismatic element all day long because there's something that they're saying something about us turns on and says hey there's something valuable here I can I can learn from their experience rather than go through my own rather than you know so much of what we hear there's this kind of. Kind of BS quality to it for instance I work in a in sales in the security field and I just realized this the other day like I've kind of gotten bored with security. There's a lot of things about security I love like it's a very you know there's there's new things new exploits so much is going on that space and has real impacts like you people are getting hacked and you know thousands of dollars are going to cyber criminals you know hundreds of thousands millions. And this is happening every day so there's like this real thing at stake but I'm around so many people that are talking about it that don't care about it but they're they're trying to sell something so like I imbibe that that belief that this is boring. It's not boring but you know when you're talking when you're dealing with people that aren't aren't really interested in the thing they're talking about it even though they're they're trying to act all jazzed about it I still. I still receive this oh no it's boring this is all BS don't pay attention even though that you know that's the exact opposite of what they're trying to communicate right. But but that's the undercurrent that really is what gets inherited because there's so much so often when we're communicating there's a complete disconnect between what we say and what we mean. Yeah and that's some of the way we kind of sift out who's intelligent enough to have a conversation with is like do they do they get those nuances are they sophisticated enough to figure this out. Yeah it's like little tests. Yeah yeah. You know I don't think we realize we doing it but we yeah it's just it's just interesting. No that's really good. I like that I like the correspondence between truth and charisma and yeah and when it comes to sales. I a couple few years ago so we always do these fireworks booze for nonprofits and so it was the the band from the high school my kids were going to and the director says why don't you come down to the show at the beginning you needed a ride so. So you had all these people they're like you know let's get fired up about selling fireworks. So they're like. And I always get I once my wife we could get free tickets to Lego land for my kids if my wife and I promised to sit through a timeshare sales talk and my wife was like don't say anything and we'll get out of there in the shortest amount of time possible. But I couldn't the cynicism thing I couldn't I just they'd say stuff it'd be like and so then I would start asking questions and I was just trolling them you know because there's no way I was going to buy this timeshare and I just but I just wanted to troll them so bad because they were saying things that were just such lies. I usually don't say no I usually like to do that I do the troll thing it's like really tell me more I used to play a game when I home schooled at telemarketers would call a house I used to play a game of. See how long and ridiculous I could keep the telemarketer on the line which is really cruel because these poor people are working crap jobs for minimum wage but I just I just. That I don't know if you, my father, when we'd go camping, my father would light the fire. Don't do this at home. He would take a little Dixie cup with Coleman fuel and put it in the bottom there. And it was a real cool thing because it's a very flammable cup, but it only burns from the top again because of oxygen, as long as the cup maintains its shape. So you'd put this little thing of, and then you'd light it. And of course, when fire ignites, there's a whoosh. And with Jordan Peterson, in our culture, there was a whoosh. And I think part of it was he was speaking certain truths that once a culture gets, once certain groups of lies get built up in a culture, it's that dead wood. And then all you need is someone to light it on fire and there's a whoosh. That's a great point. And off it goes. It's gonna be hot, baby. No, I really like that, the correspondence between truth and charisma. It's so true. And it's, but Peterson is right though too, that you will, and there's something that I always point out to people about the story of Jesus, because we so like to turn Jesus into hagiography, which is some glowy story. And he did three years of talking and people who were normally mortal enemies of each other could agree that the world was better without him. Now some people are just jerks and everybody wants him dead, but nobody looks at Jesus that way. In other words, the truth was just so, the truth was just so brilliant that they had to kill him. And that's telling. And of course the Gospel of John deals with that in the prologue a bit, but because the world loves the darkness. We love the darkness because it lets us get away with what we want to. I love what you said in this video about the lie. I think it's really good. It's really good. I'm tired. Yeah. You had anything more? I got a little extra time because of the last talk of the day. No, but I would like to put it out there just that if anybody wants to talk about Owen Barfield, if they're looking, they're happening to read his stuff and they're looking for a conversation partner, I'd be interested to have those conversations with anybody. I find his stuff is, it's difficult because he is assailing a lot of the Western mind, especially the book where the great war between the, like when- Have you read it? I'm about 90% through, but it's very difficult because I'm very aware of the fact that I know the way they're using the language isn't necessarily how I use it. Their use of the word spirit over and over again, I'm like, I don't think they mean this by what I mean. And it's very clear there's some technical, because even Lewis in his pre-conversion state is using spirit quite frequently. So that book's really hard, but there's a lot of things, like that, I started, I got like halfway through it and then I started Poetic Diction, which it's a little bit easier for me because it's all from one voice, whereas the book of the great war, it's somebody else's filtering of all this content and letters. But like in the great war book, I mean like literally every page is just underlined. There's so much good stuff, and the same with Poetic Diction. There's, I don't know, it seems there's this thread that's going through a lot of your conversations, I feel like. And I was actually hoping your conversation with the quality existence lady would go more into some of these things. So I think underpinning her idea of this metaphysics of quality is this idea of truth as a process, and ultimately, I think it makes sense, truth has to be a person from my own, like just thinking it through, it's gotta be something more complex. Calling it a process doesn't get far enough. And it's funny how often, again, and she even brought this up in your talk, I'm okay with this kind of pantheism of consciousness and the Tao or this force, but then once you move into the personal God that has its own desires and plans and tell us for the story, it gets scarier. Yeah. Yeah, it gets a lot. And I find that for myself too, because again, I think you can't read the Bible without realizing what it's moving towards is this union. And as I said last time, I believe that union costs God something very significant, but I think it also costs us something significant as well. And there's a sense in which maybe salvation is really linked to, if you don't live a certain kind of life, you can't be the sort of person that would even want that. Lewis talks about if you wanna keep your heart safe, you gotta make sure you don't attach it to anything, not even a pet or anything else. You gotta keep it locked in this box. But locked in that box, it's not gonna be the same thing. It's gonna rot, and it won't be what it was when it started out with. You can't keep anything in the clean room. Nothing stays the same. It has to either, I think he said, we're like eggs now, and we have to be hatched or we go bad. You can't just stay safe in where you're at. And it's scary, because it's like, well, what is, it seems clear that that union is intended to cost us quite a lot, but there's a lot we gain from it. And I don't exactly know what that is, but I have kind of intimations at times that makes me think, yes, it's wonderful, but other times I'm like, it's scary, and I can see why people on the outside of that looking in can have moments where like, oh, what does this God really want? Yeah. Well, I think that's exactly it. And God, I mean, God will have his way with us, and that terrifies us, and rightfully so. We touch on these kinds of things in life. When you marry, you bind yourself to this other person, and you bind yourself to the narrative of their life. And in a world as dangerous as this one, boy, there's a lot that can happen, and you're exactly right with Lewis's illustration about the heart. And I do believe that the central, when I read Genesis, the central drama is about love and trust. Do we trust in God's love? Do we trust that God finally has our well-being at heart? And here's the kicker. We don't get to decide what well-being is. And we wouldn't know even if we could. Right. And Larry Crabb, who, you know, I should really, I got a whole bunch of Larry Crabb books. He was a very popular author in Christian circles about a decade ago. Larry Crabb defined basically our fallenness as defining good and evil on our own. And that's the heart of our rebellion for Larry Crabb. And so when I listened to, I just dropped a little bit of the Jordan Peterson Sam Harris conversation. When Sam Harris both considers well-being as self-evident, and then he goes and defines it, because that which is self-evident need not be defined. But he's, you know, Sam Harris is... Yeah, you know, that was the funniest part of that thing. He didn't even, because remember he said at the end there, he said, my ethic is it's reason. And then he just kind of pulled out of a hat motivated by love or guided by love. Or like, and it was like the weirdest moment. Like, it's like he knew that that word doesn't have any real significance outside the Christian story. Like in some sense, he knew he was pulling the outside of his frame into that. Like he just, he would call it smuggling Jesus, but he just smuggled something outside of his frame into the story. That's right. It doesn't make any sense in that frame. Right. And I see, and I talked about, I ended the video with this, or it was towards the end where I noted that. So when you look at Thomas Kuhn and the history of scientific revolutions, at the end of a paradigm, people are continually try to adapt in ridiculous, their paradigm in ridiculous ways to try to maintain it. So when they're continuing to try to do the math on the motion of the planets before Copernicus, that just gets endlessly complicated. And Copernicus basically says, no, no, no, the math is better if you do it this way. And in a sense, that's exactly where Sam Harris is at, because I'll talk to people, why do you like Sam Harris? Well, Sam Harris is an atheist, but he has spirituality. And it's like, oh, that's kind of like, I'm married, but I have a girlfriend. I was like, okay, Sam, you've given up. It's like when I heard Dan Danan on an unbelievable thing. So everything is matter. Plus information. Oh, tell me about that information. What exactly is that? It's not matter. What is it? So now that you're back into formal causes with Aristotle, and he's a philosopher, he should know that, but you know, matter plus information. It's like y'all are losing the game, and so you're fudging, trying to keep it together. And at some point, it's gonna flip. It's funny too, because with Sam Harris, he's so rational and reasonable. He's kind of like, it's like the emotion is drained out of him. But he also denies free will and consciousness in a certain sense, right? That these are like, and I would say nothing is more readily apparent to you at any given moment of your whole life. That you have, that here I am right here right now, and I have some choice, right? I can look at this, I can look at that. I have, and these decisions, these little decisions have consequences, right? And somehow he, how, like he can somehow use this reasonable thinking to override the most present, like all of his, you know, quote unquote reason and scientific method, all that comes to him through this filter, and yet he doesn't, can't see the thing that he somehow, I don't know, it just, it boggles my mind how you could come to that conclusion of like, okay, there's, it's all an illusion. I can see why within a reasonable, like the, in a deterministic universe, is yeah, there's outward of consciousness comes in. That's why I think God has to be involved somehow. Like there's, he's right, you can't add determinism or even randomness from the outside. That doesn't get you free will. There has to be some other third thing. But I find him, he's an interesting person. I wonder what's in store for him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go back and I think I'm gonna listen to, I'm gonna listen to the first two. I think there's a lot of stuff to be mined in there for sure. Yeah, yeah, there is, there is. So anyway, but that's for another day. So thank you, Michael. This has been a delight. And here's an idea. So what happened with the four-way conversation that I did with Luke and Job and Jeff was they put that together. So maybe if you can think of some of the other people have been on my channel, I don't know if Mark, Mark Vernon lives in the UK, so that makes timing a little bit more difficult for him. But if you can think of some people that you'd like to bring in for a bar field conversation, let me know and I'm trying to figure out what to do with. So basically I've got the system with the link and a conversation and I've just sort of been using the limited, because I can only do this so many hours a week for a variety of reasons. That's sort of been limiting it, but it's still first come first serve and then I've got Luke. So I have to figure out a sorting mechanism and I am loathe to make it a pay to play type thing because I don't like that type of filter, but I can understand it in other ways. And I don't, one way to go would be if I just chose who I spoke with. But I think part of what has made this whole experience for me interesting to me is that I don't know, I didn't know you, you found me. And if I was doing the selecting, the world is full of people like you with that I see them on my channel. So if I don't, if I'm the filter, and then people have to send me an email and then you have an audition of sorts. But that doesn't work either because lots of, some of the most interesting people I've spoken with, I might not have. Takes a while to get them going, yeah. Yeah, so I don't know, I'm thinking a lot about this and hopefully, I don't know, I'll keep working on it. I'll keep working on it, we'll see where it goes. And the whole channel has been to see where it goes. Yeah, if anybody's out there and you wanna do a Barfield conversation, please hit me up. The other thing I wanna note just real quickly is that I had the idea with taking some notes that I was putting in somebody. So one of the ideas I had out of that too is was just to have like a master document that other people could edit of links to all kinds of notes. Because I realized a lot of people probably don't wanna come back over and contribute edits to somebody else's notes. But maybe there's other things that they're working on. And if we had like a, you know, like just a master document that anybody could, you know, put a link into, maybe it's a link to like somebody's reading Poetic Diction like I am and they wanna just put some other like quotes from it or other things like that. It could be a master document that just links to all court, all sorts of other, you know, stuff that people are working on. If they have like writing they're doing, you know, cause not everybody has a blog or things like that, but they do do, like I write all the time like in Evernote, but I don't really publish anywhere. But that might be a way for people to connect in terms of some people write better than they talk. And you know, they like to do that instead. I, you know, you gave the suggestion last time of a Google Doc. And so I did include links in some of the videos and some of the notes of the videos of a Google Doc where like for this, I took some notes during this conversation. I don't know, originally when I started this channel, I actually thought of maybe using a Google site, which is sort of like a Wiki. Yeah. Where people. Are they still around? Wikis. No, the Google sites, that still exists. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's up there. And so, because especially at early on when I was doing the commentary things, which I really wanna get back, I really wanna, I got so many things I want to do and I just don't have the time to do it. But I think you're right, it'd be nice to have kind of a structured written thing because part of the reason I started taking notes during conversations was I'll wind up posting these two or three weeks after the conversation. And when I'm doing the title slide or even the title of the video, it's like, what did I talk to him about? And so the notes are helpful, but I, yeah, figuring out a way to do this. Now, some of the teasers that Peterson gave of this ThinkSpots thing that he's working on. That's what he's doing. Where you could comment things in different places of videos or something. So I'm looking forward to see what that looks like. And that will be even to creators of all sorts to use as a platform. Yeah. Yeah, okay, that's cool. So, and that'll be a subscription model. So, I mean, part of what, part of what, I mean, oh, it's so complicated. So, yeah, I mean, this whole video YouTube thing has been such a cool new thing for me over the last year and a half. But adding a lot of complexity and still trying to figure out where this all goes, how to, I, how to let it grow and flourish naturally. And I think there are some technical things that we can do to help it grow. Because what I do want to see is our more and better conversations. Yeah. So anyway, while this will be out, this won't come out this week. I got a whole bunch of, got a whole bunch of conversations in the can. I just talked to Karen Wong, who's posting conversations on her YouTube channel too. And she's like, well, I still got two I haven't posted. You put so many out. I was like, you should see the size of my can. You know, I got a lot. I don't have a lot right now, but that's, I don't want to post more than one a day. Even one a day is a little fast in some cases. So. Yeah, I appreciate that. Cause it helps me keep up. I can always keep up with about one a day. Even when I get real busy. Anyway, thank you, Michael. Yeah, thank you. I really appreciate your time as always. My pleasure. Take care. All right, you too. Bye-bye.
