 Hi, this is Paul. I'm back from my trip to Massachusetts and I had a chance to look at a bunch of videos Number of you wrote me and would like me to do some commentary on the John MacArthur Ben Shapiro video I probably will I'll probably do some more treatment of the Jordan Peterson Ben Shapiro Dave Ruhman video, but this video came up I was I was on Facebook and a little bit chance to be on the computer I was on Facebook and someone tagged me in this conversation And I just caught the tail end of it and then they did in fact put it on YouTube And I thought this was quite a good conversation It's on a smaller channel called the three the three craters, and it's been it's been around quite a while I I came across Rachel Fulton Brown. She's probably the most famous of the regular panelists in this group She teaches at University of Chicago. She's a medievalist. She tends to get herself in hot water fairly regularly It seems she's had a very strong interest in Milo Yiannopoulos and that comes through if some of you listen to this entire video She's she's she's quite a defender of him and she's a little disgusted with with Jordan Peterson's treatment of him And and it seems of her a bit She's had a couple of conversations with with Jonathan Peugeot Both of which have been have been quite good and I learned a lot I listened to the first one the first one was a year ago and the second one was a month ago and I actually appreciated both of those conversations quite a bit She touches a bit She's we're gonna get into four year box a little bit in this and and she's This is from a blog post that she had done a while ago. She blogs about Peterson Semi-regularly she did a while ago. She might do a little bit more again now It's getting a little bit of a little bit of traction But there were a number of interesting passages in this conversation that I'd like to play and do some commentary on so Let's get started Any formal education just kind of a low-level layman factory worker Take a random lay person. We love random I am a random lay person who by coincidence alone kind of fell in love with the practice of You know proper pursuit of truth and so I Followed people that I thought were aiming at the truth and in fact people that I think and I don't want to say that I'm That I'm just no. No, I like this earlier section because this individual let me catch his name It's up here on the list of Cody that's right Cody Cody I thought get is a nice example of a lot of people I talked to not necessarily academics or professionals but one of the beautiful things that YouTube has done is given a lot of people who don't necessarily work academic or Necessarily intellectual jobs to Continue to explore the life of the mind and so he describes his Odyssey how he find Jordan Peterson Why he thinks he's important and that that sort of launches this conversation? But what how he frames how he frames his interaction with Jordan Peterson? I found to be a lot like a number of other people who I've been talking to over the last year But I think I'm properly skeptical of people that obviously aren't orienting themselves towards anything Honest and so I tried to follow the right people and I tried to read the right books So people like Vox I'm a little bit more skeptical of The purpose of this conversation was to do a treatment of Vox days book Jordanetics I beat up on the book pretty badly and I haven't read the book. It seems well-deserved most people seem to say that this is a hit piece, but That's what the the overall conversation in this video was the evidence that they're not being Sincere is obvious to anyone that wants to be an open-minded and I fell in love with Jordan roughly speaking with The best video is the little clips of the roughly speaking. Have you seen yes. Yeah It is so I kind of started following him around the time of the the big C 16 argument and then of course I went through all of his video history did maps of meaning personality and Followed him through the summer of the biblical lecture series and for me that I guess what attracted me the most was that I spent so much time through the previous 10 years trying to Reconcile this argument between guys like the four horsemen of atheism and you know Like the evangelical right-wingers that they were always crushing in debate after bait debate after debate and then I I fell in this very uncomfortable position of Not agreeing with any of them because the the argument from the atheists seem to be pretty flawed as well I mean first of all they relegate themselves to this very narrow and constricted Way of viewing the world that is strictly reasoned and deductive so they don't have the options of arguments from like Abductive arguments, right? They don't have the ability to look at things that are very likely or very probable everything has to be exact all the time and it just couldn't get down with that and there's Flaws in some of the arguments that they make just to give a quick example of that So they demand all of your arguments must be rooted in scientific evidence and then in debate after debate after debate Cosmologically, they would refute certain granted their fallacious fine-tuning arguments by resorting to refutations related to the the strong entropic principle which relies It's an unnecessary assumption of that argument is that there is and does exist the most Versus which clearly there's also no evidence for Nor could there be and so I just kind of wanted to turn to them and be like well What happened to your demand for evidence? Where did that go? And so I was stuck in the middle because there was obviously a lot of Conflict I guess I They contradict themselves a lot some of the guys that are making arguments for Christianity and those contradictions turned me off Of both sides and what Peterson did that caught my attention was You know what? I don't I'm not claiming that he reconciled this argument between science and religion But he was the first person that made an argument in favor of religion That he backed up with scientific literature And it's the first time I ever heard anyone do that and it was in a way it was in a way that You could feel Intuitively was on to something and so I just continued to follow him as much as I could And so I don't want to present myself as something i'm not i'm just an interested random lay person That's done a great deal of reading and a great deal of listening And I am strictly here in the context of defending that jordan is not in fact a globalist But i'm open to discuss and even learn about any any other subject that you want to talk Now I thought that was a good introduction They're going to talk about jordan peterson mother naughty's a globalist and they'll get into that No, they're going to get into rachel's going to have a rather interesting take on peterson coming up But I thought that lays out in a good way what i've heard a lot of people say about jordan peterson Now the aspect of it in terms of in terms of the validation power of science In this conversation and behind this movement is important and this is something that rachel's going to get into As as the conversation develops, so here's a little bit more criticisms of jordan First and foremost that my criticisms don't really fall within the domain of all the things he said outside of his expertise Because I just don't listen to them I don't listen to what he says outside of his own domain of expertise because i'm just not interested in that My biggest problem has always been until recently is something that was brought up in his debates The four part with sam harris is that he's made a good case for a god That is an abstraction That is the byproduct of a process of evolution That is a completely natural god You can make a ridiculous statement about a god That is a completely natural god You can make a reductionist argument within the domain of science for that god without any need for the supernatural And that's basically it's similar to my god number one that he's laying out here and and this is What you see at towards the end of of many of the debates that peterson has with her He also has you know eluded and hinted regularly at a belief in a supernatural god At a belief in a supernatural god and when put on the spot to reconcile the differences Between his belief in a supernatural god and the case that he makes for the emergence of a natural god He's bulked at the I don't think he has the ability to reconcile Oh my god, this is the place where I agree as well But I think that this is why I actually am hopeful For dr peterson because I think what's your heart it is at this point That he is able to I think start engaging with people Who actually do have good arguments? For the existence of a supernatural god and believe me there are people out there. There are plenty of pseudo-apologists who have I'm not an expert. I'm not a pseudo-apologist and i'm not a scientist saying you are things But what I am is is a person who's very careful about what he says and very thoughtful about argumentation And I think I have reconciled those two cases So maybe we can get into that after we're we're off the recording here But the I mean, I'd certainly be interested in that but what I'm saying about dr peterson is that There are people that he could be engaging with and this is one of my criticisms He could be engaging with people like like rachel, um or philosophers like dr. William Lane craig or alvin plantinga there are people out there who have vast swaths of knowledge About these topics, um and and have very defensible Um, they have very good defenses of the christian tradition in particular Um at least they have a good defense of classical theism um, I But he's not choosing to really engage with these people. He he did engage with dr craig once but it was in a tripart Uh panel with rebecca goldstein who is I believe steven pinker's wife And they it really wasn't it wasn't much of a dialogue. This was a um, this was sort of each person stood up and gave a speech And then they they were asked questions by members of the audience and then they were able to sort of cross-examine each other And there was one point where dr craig pointedly asked Dr peterson So you he he said something along the lines of I admire the fact that you want to uphold objective moral values and duties um, but why Why do you why would you not ground these in a transcended god or do you ground them in some sort of? platonic Um way and and dr peterson sort of said i'll i'll ground them in a platonic way But then just recently when he was on dave rubin Um with I think it might have been um ben He did I watched that one too. Yeah. Yes. He did admit to having a personal belief in a metaphysical God, um, so this is him stepping outside of his reductionistic scientific naturalism into Um this world and and and I think that he may have reasons for it that he's not willing to express because he's not a Philosophical expert he doesn't have a full grasp of the arguments for um or against the uh, classical theism and he doesn't necessarily have good arguments for or against the resurrection now, I do know I briefly emailed nt right who is a biblical scholar um, I think he's an anglican bishop of some kind um, and he I know that dr peterson is supposed to be reading his book on christ Um and that he's going to be reading dr peterson's book in turn. So dr peterson may very well Be planning on speaking with some of these people soon Um, but I think that this summer he's been spending too much time Debating people who I mean really the new atheists aren't saying anything new. This is this is sort of just Restated old tropes and this is the problem that I have with jordan is that the people he's talking with don't have anything new Or interesting to say and yet he spends so much time getting bogged down and In discussions of facts versus values and things like that with sam harris sam harris I have to say personally from from my analysis of his arguments, particularly with dr. William lean craig When i'm gone all my dog wants to do is play with me because because because according to according to me Okay, so had every video with a dog so say hello say hello Are you happy at home are you gonna let me make this video? Let's hope so I'm gonna pause i'll get a toy So if you hear growling, it's uh, you know, you know what's going on He's not very substantive and and and in the in the debates with dr peterson I think that really shows because they he keeps missing it This whole time. I think dr peterson is is wasting a lot of his time at this point Lucy that's that's what's been interesting to me jonathan peugeot Now now before we go I should that was mica in this and mica in this debate now again I don't know the panelists but but mica sample mica seems to be a student And he sort of represents he might be protestant Maybe he'll come into the come into the comments and let us know a little bit who he is But he's representing the the group that would like to see jordan peterson Become a Come into the fold and become a confessing christian and so he's been hoping that peterson will peterson is on this journey so kody starts out and kody kind of represents the individuals out there who Have been into the atheists are now interested in peterson and some of whom have have gone all the way into becoming Christian christians mica's the individual in this panel that That identifies as a christian and is hoping along with many others that peterson will make this journey And become a full-blown confessing christian Rachel is a roman catholic and again as I said a medievalist and you'll you'll get to hear some of her own agendas in this And I have done two videos and jonathan and I did a first video a year and a half ago where we talked about my Encounters with milo and what I was seeing in jordan and then about mary right jordan jonathan is a good friend of jordan Jordans and in a video that jordan jonathan did with jordan about a year ago He specifically milo came up and he specifically said You know rachel fulton brown's been wanting to talk to you. So it it really isn't that jordan hasn't been Now now rachel is is kind of a milo Apologist she's a friend of milo She's been studying milo and so that some of you who watch if you watch the whole video This will some this is probably something you'll react to nudged in in various directions, right? Jonathan has nudged him to me and he's not taking that up. As I said, we were in conversation I'm thinking that jordan is choosing not to have these conversations and again I think corey is fair and saying, you know We can't attribute intention to him that we can't we don't we're not inside his head But I do think it's interesting that he's spending more time talking with certain kinds of people than with others And that's why i'm skeptical about your hope mica so So rachel thinks that jordan has been intentionally avoiding people like nt right and others who want to have more substantive conversations about christianity And I I think it's it's important to again not read jordan peterson's mind not look too much into this i'm getting i'm getting a an education on People watch my videos and then they have ideas about who I am and what's going on in my life And then they send me things uh send me ideas and letters letters of concern over all those things It strikes me and all this well-intentioned and I appreciate people's Desired to look out for me and look out for my welfare some imagine that i'm Going this way or that way politically some imagine that i'm I'm losing the faith or i'm a hardcore evangelical. It's it's amazing all the different people that I am out there in the world Especially knowing the person that I am right here in myself So it's it's important not to you know get too deeply into this game about where jordan peterson is going who he is but at the same time Micah's points that the kinds of people that peterson is talking to have been interesting and now rachel's Pause in that you know there's it's not like it's hard to find christians that Are willing to talk christians are usually very willing to talk and and there'd be many who would who would want to talk to jordan peterson but I would imagine peterson like I I think about my own journey in this and people sometimes have questions Well, who do I talk to well? I often talk to people who come to me for one reason or another and they have their agenda It's always very interesting for me listening what other people who are listening to this are thinking about But yet at the same time I tend to follow the things that interest me and what goes into that computation of interest well, it's it's not I'm I'm Probably in terms of this part of my life. I'm fairly intuitive I just kind of go from one thing to the next that intrigues me and interests me and so then people are frustrated I'm not reading enough young. I'm reading too much young. I'm not reading enough philosophy Oh, this philosophy stuff is too much. You should stick to reading the bible on and on and on Everyone always has agendas for everyone else's life. But the question here is Where does peterson really stand with respect to this journey of his and with whom does he want to Uh, does he want to share this journey? Who are his guides? now I think again a lot of confession christians are highly motivated to have peterson become A confessing christian peterson might not be motivated at all to become a confessing christian peterson might be just Continuing his own journey of discovery in this and he'd rather talk with mcgill christen Or whoever he's talking to or he'd rather go talk to A quarter of a million people two or three thousand of them at a time every night as he does his rambling petersonian evangelistic crusade, which is What this book tour has become so it's it's hard to know but but here this group is I like I like this conversation because They were articulating a lot of the different voices that i've been hearing Out there in the comment section emails that I get again. Sorry. I'm Very backlogged on email with the death of my sister and all of my travels over this last month. So But but it's very interesting how a lot of the voices that I hear out there I heard in this conversation Like well, I just want to address your point about how the new atheists aren't saying anything I want to make a recommendation if you haven't already watched it go watch the follow-up interview that brett Weinstein recently did where he gives his take on the progress that was made between sam harris and jordan peterson because And that was an interesting video done by rebel was and again, I really appreciate the work that rebel wisdom is doing III didn't I don't know Brett Weinstein sure has a better place of looking at I I'm not I wasn't impressed by the so-called progress that was made by those Conversations, maybe I'd be curious to hear peterson's take on it. I don't think sam harris budged a bit I think sam harris basically you can watch the videos I've done on that but I I Think I think brett learned something and again I continue to appreciate brett even though I think his assumptions about morality are unexplored the moderator for some of their talks And he recently gave an interview with his thoughts on those where he Elaborated and kind of laid out what progress exactly had been making had been made there. Sorry and he talks about the hard pill that each of them had to swallow and the ground that each of them gave and The hard pill that sam harris had to swallow and the ground that he gave as Brett lays it out in the video. I think will be particularly interesting to you because One at least one of the new atheists has some new things to say and has had to take some considerations in this game and so for ten years as the new atheist cut a swath of destruction through Theism all across the world for the first time somebody has actually stepped up to the plate that's someone to contend with and They have had to swallow some hard pills and some ground has been made So maybe watch that video and take what Brad has to say into consideration there because I think it's valuable. I Think actually Brett Weinstein has forced the new atheists to swallow some hard pills. I think Jordan Peterson Has impacted the community that had followed the new atheist I Willing to do that, but just from what I have What I have seen particularly I think dr. Craig brought up the moral argument the argument for it for God from objective moral values and duties and Sam's and of course, this was years ago So Sam may have developed further with these discussions with Jordan, but there he wasn't saying anything new I really haven't seen much new in Atheistic philosophy since Bertrand Russell or since Anthony Flew really and then even Anthony Flew became ended up becoming a sort of theist Towards the end of his life because he realized that it was untenable To to remain a reductionistic naturalist, but I think that we can we can set that comment We can set Peterson is very much against Marxism. He's talked about it all the time Right, and that's why I think he is actually Marxist Now this part of the video is gonna interest some of you because Rachel is going to make an argument that Peterson is a Marxist and The the host let's see what his name is. Sorry. I don't know all your names the moderator Greg Makes the point that hey Peterson's very anti Marxist that now Rachel's your Rachel's argument It's kind of interesting that argument Let's get on Let's let's get Let's let's get Like to hear what Rachel has to say Okay, so this is this is the root of the globalist question Say I I think I think so what I think Jordan is is is a disappointed Marxist, right? We know from his own his description of his own political activities when he was younger that he was a socialist he has surrounded himself in his own house as Witnessed in the preface to 12 rules with socialist art with Soviet era Propaganda posters and such and the way that he talks about his disappointment with Marxism Suggests to me a deep betrayal right and again, we're it's very hard not to psychologize a psychologist. He invites it, right? What the reason I think that he's he's It's interesting that she uses the word betrayal here I think a deep disappointment. I think Peterson's been pretty Open about his own individual journey in the introduction to maps of meaning he he's He's Peterson has been very transparent about his personal life throughout this journey. So a betrayal That's a pretty strong word Fundamentally Marxist rather than fundamentally Christian he thinks that the ground of all existence is suffering And Now that's an interesting that's an interesting argument that that the ground of all existence is suffering because that of well Does Peterson think that the ground of all existence is suffering I think Peterson I think Peterson has asserted that suffering is a better way into the conversation with the materialists and I think that's part of Peterson's attempt to be Ecumenical as he tries to look at the mythological landscape beyond Christianity Maybe it's my Calvinism we're gonna talk a little bit about Calvinism later with Mike is gonna go into some of that but So so I don't know if Rachel is correct there But let's let's continue to listen to her and again I'm pausing her and if you want to listen to the whole thing, you know Listen to the whole thing but it's two and a half hours long And and that is not that is not a Christian understanding of reality or of the existence of creation As Christians, we understand that creation is good. We start from God loves us creation is good we do not start from and that's and when Jordan and Sam are having that big argument about what You know sort of what what the thing is we can start from what Jordan tries to get Sam to admit is Suffering right this reality of life is suffering. Well And Rachel is correct about Christianity there. I would I would say that the The foundation is joy. This would take a longer argument than well He kind of he kind of hints at the the the Buddhism and maybe he's I'm not going can I read some firebark to you? No, you can read firebark. This is what I'm saying to say Now what she does here is she reads some of her blog and so if you want to read the entire blog you can Find it at her website fencing bear at prayer dot blog spot dot com if professor Pete Professor Jordan B Peterson said he believed in God would you and this this is going to get into her larger argument Which I think is is more interesting where she asserts again as did Cody that it's this relationship with science That has been moving a lot of the former adherence to the new atheists and and that makes a lot of sense because the Part let's say let's if we would imagine the listeners to the four horsemen are their Congregation they've been preaching science and what you hear right away and Cody's introduction is that science evidence science evidence And the more they bang those drums It gets into their audiences head and their then their audience begins to look at what they're saying and say wait a minute You guys aren't following your own precepts It isn't about science and then Peterson comes along and Peterson begins to make his case for a traditional Christian mythos By using science and that's what's been happening By using science and that's what's been moving Many people to take a closer look at Christianity a closer look at psychology a closer look at the Bible and all of this so now now Rachel does not come at this in from the same place that Cody does right Rachel comes at this as an academic and And what she does I think this is a very helpful which she read this about wow This is really helpful in terms of understanding some of the roots of of foyerbach now before she reads too much For your Bach I wanted to play a little bit from many of you know this from some of my previous Videos a little bit from Philip Carey's philosophy and religion in the West Because he treats Hegel and then before he gets into Marx he gets into foyerbach And that's a rather interesting treatment in our last lecture We followed the history of Geist through all of world history culminating in Hegel's own philosophy Where Geist comes to self-knowledge through Hegel's philosophizing in one interpretation of Hegel Hegel's philosophy itself? constitutes absolute knowledge That may may not be what Hegel actually had in mind and in any case It certainly isn't what happened. It's not as if history came to an end after Hegel finished writing his philosophy There was much else that happened religion was still on the scene for instance Religion which for Hegel had been subsumed in this conceptual begriffe of philosophy Religion in its unsubsumed Unconceptualized form still remained on the scene in the form of churches and synagogues and so on and There was indeed a lot of history going on in the 19th century after Hegel and one of the key issues for Hegelian philosophers after Hegel was precisely what to make of religion and its social and political function Imagine you're in 19th century, Germany the churches are very important. They're state-supported. They tend to have rather old-fashioned sometimes repressive and Authoritarian ideas about political and social life most Hegelian philosophers were liberals They wanted more secularization. They wanted more freedom from the authoritarian The authoritarian strictures of the church they wanted more free thought So the issue for a Hegelian philosopher in the generation after Hegel was what shall we make of religion? Especially what do we make of this philosophical? Subsumption or aufhebung of religion proposed by Hegel We all agree all of us Hegelians that philosophy subsumes religion that is it it cancels the the old picture thinking form of religion and subsumes it to a level of Picks it up and raises it to a level of conceptual sophistication Now that's an important point that that Kerry makes because that is implicit in a lot of this conversation that that religion is subsumed and And in all fairness you see that with Peterson you see that in Peterson his intense interest in religion, but his Lack of intense interest to participate in a church and and this is true This is true much more broadly in society as well And and so you have those who confess Christ you have those who like to study Christianity studied in the abstract study it in terms of a philosophy and Then you have those who who actually practice Christianity in terms of worship in terms of observance in terms of living within a community that at one level or another has a degree of Accountability in terms our lives and beliefs and so you get the sense here of this transition after Hegel 19th century Europe Christianity is continuing to recede in many ways, especially among the elites especially among the intellectuals Intellectualism is starting to rise and now you're gonna see a split in the Hegelian community of philosophical sophistication, but does that mean then That something like Christianity is canceled by philosophy or preserved by philosophy remember that the subsumption of opposition by The Hegelian dialectic is ambiguous and deliberately so it means both canceling and preserving So what is it that's canceled about the Christian religion? What is it that's preserved about the Christian religion? Is philosophy fundamentally something that abolishes religion or something that preserves its essential truth if you think that? Philosophy is aimed at abolishing religion in its current historical form Then you're a left-wing Hegelian if you think that Philosophy preserves what's really essential about religion then you're a right-wing Hegelian and it tended to be that the Hegelians did divide in this way left wing and right wing There's very few that managed to preserve the the ambiguity of Hegel intact So the left-wing Hegelians were critics of religion They thought that Philosophies job was to help abolish religion because religion for the left-wing Hegelians was a form of authoritarian Unfreedom from which philosophy and its critical apparatus should free the human spirit philosophy has the goal of critique of freeing Humanity from this form of unfreedom called religion. That's the view especially of Ludwig Feuerbach one of the Now this this Liberating Christianity from the unfreedom of religion. You'll hear that theme pretty strongly in The Four Horsemen and and this this continues to this day leading left-wing Hegelians and he Philosophies job abolish religion because religion for the left-wing Hegelians was a form of authoritarian Unfreedom from which philosophy and its critical apparatus should free the human spirit philosophy has the goal of critique of freeing Humanity from this form of unfreedom called religion. That's the view especially of Ludwig Feuerbach one of the leading left-wing Hegelians and He is in turn the starting point of Marx's philosophy So Feuerbach represents the transition from Hegel to Marx Hegel pardon me. Feuerbach is a left-wing Hegelian He's a critic of religion. He argues that the idea of God is a form of alienation Right. So as opposed to Hegel who talked about Geist alienating itself in history Feuerbach is looking from a human perspective and talking about God as an alienation of human consciousness Feuerbach wants to start with human consciousness not with a Grand story of this kind of divine Geist He wants to start with human consciousness real species being Feuerbach will call it the species being of us as human beings and Where does God fit into this picture? God fits into the picture as an alienated form of human being Now this is going to be important in terms of what Rachel reads in From the essence of Christianity written by Feuerbach in the middle of the 19th century as Basically something that we made in our own image and then didn't recognize that it's really just an image of us. I Find that fascinating again within my pastoral work I work with people who hear voices and So in the past I've done reading on that one of the theories about people who hear voices Is that the voice that they're hearing is their own which makes perfect sense inside their head But they can't recognize their voice and and in a sense what what Feuerbach is about to say is that that's exactly who God is God is God is me, but I don't recognize mice. I don't recognize that I am in fact projecting and then you can begin to see The beginnings of a whole train of thought that of course will come to full flower and Freud in terms of his critique of religion So this this alienation theory and then of course when you get to Marx Alienation is going to take much more of a materialist term so Feuerbach proposes what has been called a projection theory of religion religion is basically Human beings projecting their own essence up into the sky into this imaginary being Called God who is supposed to be perfect love perfect power perfect righteousness all of those are human Qualities really for a box things right we take what we hope for For human beings human justice and we project it up in the sky and pie in the sky sorts of things and say well We don't really have justice on this earth, but up in heaven will have justice And so we're taking something that could be real human justice and projecting it in this alien form upon this Imaginary being in the sky and likewise with love and power and all those other divine attributes Which for foyerbach are really human attributes which we Alienate from ourselves and don't realize it we project it on to God Which is an alien power which really ought to be ourselves right? The real object of worship ought to be ourselves we should revolve around ourselves not around this imaginary God for foyerbach So for about houses theory of alienation that he uses to critique religion Now Marx is an inheritor of both foyerbach and Hegel Marx wants to take foyerbach's theory of alienation and apply it to the situation of the worker under capitalism Right and that's why he'll come up with a theory of alienated labor the alienated the alienation part of that theory comes from foyerbach Marx is a foyerbachian in his early writings who wants not just to theorize about human alienation But to do something to change it right alienation is an evil We ought to do something to change it hence in one of his early writings the famous theses on foyerbach Marx concludes the philosophers so far have only interpreted the world, but the point is to change it Right and so eventually Marx will propose a way of changing the world what he calls revolutionary practice the practice of communist revolution Now in order to understand the shape that alienation takes in the real world right not the shape of alienation and externalization of ideas you have to look at what Marx will call the material world Hegel's dialectic Hegel's dialectic is a dialectic of history that's all about ideas consciousness right for Marx The real dialectic of history is not idealist. It's not on a dialectic of consciousness It's a dialectic of material forces so Marx is a materialist. He calls his position dialectical materialism But what drives history therefore is not ideas but material forces yet these material forces are not just stones and other Material objects in that dull sense when Marx talks about material forces. He means especially economic forces, so And he's gonna go on and develop then his that particular chapter on Marx And it's actually I do recommend philosophy and religion in the West by Philip Kerry. It's on audible It's I thought it was a terrifically helpful course That adds a little bit of background to where to where Rachel is about to go because Rachel is Is saying that that Jordan Peterson is a betrayed Marxist which nope I haven't heard anybody make this argument before so let's hear Make it is is is primarily to say that his fundamental understanding of religiosity comes via Via Marx from Feuerbach now. I checked in maps of meaning he seems to know of for your box existence But he doesn't understand the degree to which for your bot Marx is reading for your block and a lot of what Marx's Hegelianism is via for your box So we'll say Jordan is for a box. So I did this post called If professor Jordan B Peterson said he believed in God would you? Right and and it starts with the tweet where Jordan said this is June 25th 2018 God is the mode of being you value the most as demonstrated or manifested in your presumption Perception and action right he's been pressed a lot to try to define what he means by God so there he was in his tweet and One of the things I started with was saying why does why does it be care right and both Micah and Corey have verified what I said in my blog post what matters is that Jordan identifies himself as a scientist and that that scientific perspective seems to Mean that if we can trust him to be able to get to a belief in God He's validated our our primary faith faith Position in modernity, which is the science right this Now again, I would critique Rachel there and say let's not paint our hours and our wheeze way too large I think especially for the group of people that were Participating in the Church of Sam Harris that elevated reason and science and again This is what Cody says at the beginning of the video Those people will be greatly influenced by Peterson because Peterson is in a sense these biblical reference repeat Peterson is in a sense the Apostle Paul walking into Judaism and and Peterson now has a new gospel to give to the people in the synagogue of Sam Harris and I'll and he's splitting the synagogue And I'm using this reference because if you read the book of Acts Paul comes into these synagogues Throughout the diaspora and starts preaching that Jesus is the Messiah and God has raised him from the dead and what he does is he splits these Synagogues and terrible fights ensue, but that is in a sense what what in what what Jordan Peterson is doing now For someone like Rachel who had already had her own journey Into faith and into the Roman Catholic Church and into all the things that she's into That wasn't you know that that wasn't Her journey, but for someone like Cody that is his journey and for someone like Micah who's Kind who's been over I imagine again. I didn't Examine everyone's credentials someone who's been a part of a confessional church He sees this as a win so everybody's looking at it from their tribal perspective, and they're evaluating it and But but some like like Rachel and again If you watch the whole thing If you watch the whole video You'll get a sense of where Rachel's at right now because she's she's pretty transparent too And she's got her own access to grind But I thought the inclusion of foyerbach in this is interesting now whether whether you continue to you whether you should Continue to call someone a Marxist if they have become in many ways Anti-Marxist because they feel betrayed by Marxism Well, I don't know if that's fair, but that all that dynamic is of course well known Many of the people who were raised in the church and felt betrayed by the church become the most hostile towards the church So it could be that a big piece of Peterson's shrill Anti-Marxism is because he feels betrayed so that could be a factor in Peterson who knows but again We have we've all got our filters. We've all got our histories. We've all got our access now Rachel has her axe Jordan Peterson has our axe the question isn't so much should we dismiss? This is the this is CS Lewis's point about vulvarisms should we dismiss someone because they have an axe No, everybody has an axe the question is listen to the argument weigh it see what's valid in it and and Continue to recalibrate and read just the filters through which we listen to individuals So let's let Rachel finish her argument Well, what's interesting is most you can and I I'm not gonna read it absolutely all the for your buck But you go to that post you'll find most of it. So for example, Peterson says I'll read it again and I'll read it slowly God is the mode of being you value the most as demonstrated or manifested in your presumption Perception and action and I use as a little straight for that his when you wish upon a star This is for your buck and it's a long quotation But I'll read it carefully because you guys are Jordan you guys are Jordan fans, right? So you're used to this depth level of depth. Okay for your buck Every man must place before himself a God that is an aim a purpose The aim is the conscious voluntary essential impulse of life the glance of genius the focus of self-knowledge the unity of the material and spiritual in the individual man He who has an aim has a law over him. He does not merely guide himself. He is guided He who has no aim has no home. No sanctuary Aimlessness is the greatest unhappiness Even he who has only common aims gets on better though He may not be better than he who has no aim and aim sets limits But limits are the mentors of virtue He who has an aim an aim which is in itself true and essential has a whip. So a religion A whip so a religion If not in the narrow sense of common pietism yet And this is the only point to be considered in the sense of reason in the sense of the universal the only true love Endquote all of that is what Peterson is trying to say when he does the thing about when you wish upon a star, right? And hi I swear when she read that I thought yeah that Something a paragraph like that could have come straight out of maps of meaning and so I think Rachel really nails It thing that gives you goal purpose meaning religion, right? Okay, so that's one Peterson says in another tweet from the same day quote God is that in which you manifest necessary faith Necessary because you have to start somewhere and this necessary axum is not a fact But a way of mode of being which is to say a personality Feuerbach To predicate personality of God is nothing else than to declare personality as the absolute essence But personality is only conceived in distinction in abstraction from nature in the personality of God man Consecrates the supernaturalness immortality independence unlimitedness of his own personality God is the idea of personality as itself a person Subjectivity existing in itself apart from the world existing for self alone without once posited as absolute existence the me without a thee Speculate as much as you will you will never derive your personality from God if you have not beforehand introduced it if God himself Be not already the idea of your personality your own subjective nature Now again if you understand Philip Carey's point about for your buck that Quote out of for your buck makes absolutely perfect sense now. I think Peterson definitely has that element in what he's doing When I when I listen to let's let's set aside the the Ruben Shapiro Peterson the recent one where Peterson definitely gets more Metaphysical but if you look at the main thrust that Peterson is saying Thrust that Peterson is taking with Sam Harris Peterson is making a much stronger argument that in fact God number one is built into us down below and Peterson does make that point with with Ruben ship with Ruben and Shapiro in the more recent video But there definitely is some fire back in Peterson, and I think I think Rachel Rachel Hit she noticed that I guess she teaches for your bark as as part of a class I don't know, but she she really nailed that and those quotes are those quotes are startling The point about for your buck is that he is the one that or is the origin of all of the everything right? via Hagel postmodernism is basically for your buck because as For your buck explains religion. It's the it's the projection of species consciousness Let me unpack that Human beings unlike other creatures. He doesn't really say creatures unlike other not animals, right? we have a consciousness of ourself as belonging to a species that we understand ourselves as as as existing Not as just isolated individuals, but is belonging to this idea of species consciousness is the direct antecedent to Marx's idea about class class consciousness that the postmodernist now speak in terms of the collectivity This consciousness of yourself your identity is defined through your race through your gender through your belonging to the collective Has a direct lineage back to foyerbach everything that Jordan says about God is from foyerbach's essence of Christianity It's a fundamentally atheist Understanding which is fundamentally scientific and has no existence of the transcendent Acceptance so far and this is where Jordan constantly says this kind of thing you project yourself into your understanding of yourself as belonging to the species and that belongs entirely in his understanding of True religiosity coming out of evolution evolutionary psychology. I can unpack all of that if you like I think Rachel has a good point. I don't know if this You know her point as I hear it is that Peterson is coming at God from an atheist perspective, okay? Her larger point in the video is that Peterson's view of God is deficient from her point of view, okay? Okay But you know and then I've a little bit more and a little bit more near Micah and saying well Is Peterson on a journey the the Jungian aspect of Peterson is really for me the wild card in terms of his journey because No one would have said that Carl Jung was someone heading towards. Let's say if you're an evangelical American evangelical Christian that that Carl Jung was on a path towards becoming a neo-evangelical in the middle of the 20th century The way that Jung deals with Christianity At least to the degree that I've been able to recognize it is is is different and there's a reason that Neo-evangelicals, that's the tradition Billy Graham Carl F. Henry on in the West and the British the British evangelicals to the British new evangelicals So It's complicated. It's complicated. So that's this is This is part of this is part of Rachel Rachel Brown's Big yeah, but with respect to Peterson and Her guy is Milo, which is an interesting choice What you're saying though is because he's he's shared some thought processes with firebark might maybe not necessarily Because he read for about but that doesn't mean it's the philosophical tradition that he's working with It's the philosophical tradition that he's working with absolutely Because does say asky he quotes the same scene from Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov every single time anybody asks about Christ, right? So I don't he he has yet to quote anybody else when he's talking about how he understands Christianity That makes me skeptical and he quotes Jung a lot, right? Yeah Well, he's a young man for sure and he's definitely union and and and the and the sort of I was drawn to the archetypes I wrote to him about that right? I'm interested in that idea What I appreciate now is the reason the archetypes are scientific. They feel scientifically robust is Because Jordan weds them with an evolutionary psychological argument, which also has its weaknesses as Corey is pointing out to me saying well an Intellectual lineage doesn't prove what he thinks Evolutionary arguments don't answer the problem of morality either because absolutely everything that we are is evolved Including our viciousness to each other evolutionary arguments Answer every question. So right there just What I'm saying what I what I've been saying is is exactly that that that ethics cannot be solved by evolution because Evolution has given us the capacity to do literally everything that we do including murder, right? That's not that's not a good enough explanation However, I do view this as sort of the the second book that God has given to us So so he's given us two books. He's given in a scripture and then he's given us natural revelation This is a very old Christian position this is a position that's found in one of the Doctrinal statements of my denomination the belgian confession that God reveals himself in two books God reveals himself through scripture God reveals himself through general revelation and and again in this conversation Micah Micah of these people Mike is probably closest to my tradition in terms of the confessional seat in which he said Evolution can serve in many ways as natural revelation For us to understand more about him and it can if we allow it to it can point towards him So insofar as these evolutionary arguments work, my position is that they are actually pointing to an even deeper reality they they are evidence for an ethic rather than an explanation for the origin of an ethic and and I want to get to something that you said earlier about This this notion of dr. Petersons that we sort of start from suffering I think that what he's doing is he maybe and in it correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to recall That in the maps of meaning book he he details the fact that he grew up in a Presbyterian household now Presbyterian right Presbyterian ism as you probably well know is found it Largely upon this thought of John Calvin in many ways. It's it's within the reforms tradition and one of John Calvin's Main points or at least the main points that were brought from his theology is that of total depravity of right? And so there's there's sort of this starting point for a poor Calvinists at least Calvinist Christians in the suffering in the depravity When that's where Vox kind of contradicts himself because he talks like a Calvinist I think I'm pretty sure Vox is a Calvinist, but he talks about you know original and the original sin What and he states I'd have to go way back to quote it but roughly speaking he states that we are evil if you're evil then you're without God if Except Jesus says when he talks about the parable of the the Scorpions and the fish even though you who are evil give good things to your children Jesus calls us all evil me being a Calvinist you are without God you are suffering So he's saying the exact same thing that he is refuting and basically calling Peterson anti-christ This is where I got summoned into the room there it is right there hadn't noticed this before in the recording Now I know why I got summoned into the room someone said Calvinist and I was summoned on Facebook He's saying the same damn thing in a Calvinistic sense. I think that Dr. Peterson hasn't been introduced to a sophisticated form of Christian theism I know I think his theism is very very amateur and he needs to like you've stated before he needs to talk To folks like Rachel and other people that are very knowledgeable about these things that can better educate him and challenge him On those things because I think he is very amateur on his understanding now he understands the the metaphysical nature of What you know, you know like in his biblical series and are very intriguing and interesting but Theistically he's he's a novice I think and Vox goes in and claims Oh, he did the biblical series and claimed he never read the Bible I can't find he hasn't he he says he hasn't I mean he I so okay As a scholar Jordans embarrassing right because he got really excited about finding this, you know One of the biblical sites that gives you the commentaries and scripture It's like that's what I work on right and he he I mean it's sort of delight It's it's kind of endearing in certain ways. He's like, oh my gosh, there's this site that has all these commentaries on it It's like yes, Jordan. We've all been talking about it. Not the only one that's discovered it So, you know right but for him this is new What I'm what I'm saying is that the the kind of Christianity he's been introduced to throughout his life is the sort of fundamentalist anti intellectual tradition that yes part in opposition to theological liberalism and so when he's when he's When he's at that cross you think he'd be dying to talk to me. Don't you I would hope but I was very sweet for months and here's other things You did Hold on a second. Dr. Peterson has talked with people smaller than us in the past So our size has nothing to do with whether or not they'll talk to us I think I think that dr. Peterson will talk to people if he views the discussion itself is going to be in the long run productive and I think that Well, if you're having productive discussions millions of people will follow you not necessarily yeah, not necessarily But Follow him it's because he's speaking to the speaking to them now right nothing he is saying is actually that that controversial I would say not because he's speaking to them now it has everything to do with the way he's approached this and the moment the man in the moment found himself Peterson had been doing what he's been doing for a long time and Reality is very very very very complicated and layered and just at this moment everything came together and and for Peterson and I think Happily, so I think again, it's it's been it's been a good and a powerful thing, but Right. It's pretty basic appeal to it to a sort of denominator I think right the lowest common denominator, but it is a common denominator That's what he appeals to I really genuinely think that he's appealing to a wide Thank you. That's a label. I've never been slapped with before Well, I'm not saying I'm not saying you because I am I am just as interested in dr Peterson's work as you are probably it potentially even more so I mean actually that's fair Mike is saying it's like of course he's got all this together We all have completely different reasons for watching him, right? So he has you know, I think that's you know, he's clearly tapped into a lot of people's interest and we That's why we started with what we did It's like all the different all the different perspectives that we came to with why we were listening to him to start with Okay. Well, I mean this is probably this whole episode is gonna go over our time limit, which is we're just gonna go over But I want to get into because there's so much more to unpack here Okay, I mean one of those so I'm gonna lose energy now that Cory's not with us that's too bad anyway, so the log I So Cory had to leave because they only do two hours usually but but this last section I thought was Central to what was going on. I think Cory is that he's made a good point It's like it's it's easy one because Jordan has attracted so much attention and everybody cares about what he says precisely because He's a scientist talking about Religion and that is I think of all of the things that he has that has attracted people's attention. That's it, right? Now There have been other scientists talking about real. So Francis Collins talk about a high status scientist Talking about religions camp Francis Collins wrote a book about his conversion to Christianity There are a lot of scientists that have been talking about religion Why Peterson and again, I think it's because the four horsemen created a church as such around them and Peterson is the exorcist that comes in Peterson is the Apostle Paul that comes into the synagogue of the new atheist and splits it open It's now why how he gathered my attention how he gathered Rachel's attention I mean again, the man and the moment found each other and Christians look at these things and talk about you know that the providence of God and the working of God Especially if you're from a tradition like mine, which is strongly providential So I don't think it's just science like Rachel says here I think it's the particular kind of science and the particular kind of Church or synagogue that the four horsemen set up Hungry to get out of this drought of being able to talk intellectually and seriously about I Don't even say faith because I don't think Jordan talks about faith He talks about the divine and he points to a transcendent that people want to be able to believe in But I think he I think he hedges himself I think he hedges his bets which is why I'm skeptical of Micah's optimism But anyway, let's this is this is What Jordan said that first got me listening to him because it's in the same interview with when he's asked about Milo, right? And fencing bear is Milo's mama bear when it comes to these conversations Now Western culture is foul logo centric. Let's say it. It's predicated on the idea of the logos The logos is the sacred element of Western culture. What does that mean? It means that your capacity for speech is divine It is the thing that generates order from chaos and then something turns path a lot and then sometimes turns Pathological order into chaos when it has to don't estimate underestimate the power of truth There is nothing more powerful than the truth Now in order to speak what you might regard as the truth you have to let go of the outcome You have to think all right, I'm going to say what I think stupid as I am biased as I am ignorant as I am I'm going to state what I think as clearly as I can and I'm going to live with consequences No matter what they are Now the reason you think that that's an element of faith The idea is that nothing brings a better world into being than the state of truth You might have to pay a price for it that but that's fine You're gonna pay a price for every bloody thing you do and everything you don't do You don't get to choose not to pay a price you get to choose which poison you're gonna take that's it So if you're gonna stand up for something stand up for your truth Okay now Well, okay, I and this is where Vox got interesting I think and it's it's partly where Greg is saying Vox got silliest but What does what is Jordan actually saying here is it's predicated on the idea of the logos and we all heard that oh great He's talking about the logos. He's talking about Speech being divine logos is the sacred element of Western culture. It means that your capacity for speech is divine It's the thing that generates order from chaos now that is problematic because when foyerbach is talking about the power of speech Foyerbach he has this claim in which he says, you know I'm not really an atheist the atheists are the one that don't believe in the ideals, right the To be truly an atheist would be to say you don't believe in beauty and truth and goodness But the problem is that foyerbach has done a sleight of hand there and he's saying God is simply the projection our projection In our species consciousness of our ideals onto this personality, which we then Imagine acting back on us, right and I've done what I do every time I teach for your body You're making yourself God right now that is what Vox is acute that Substantively, that's what Vox is accusing Jordan doing making that argument. Like you said it I would find that a compelling and intellectual argument. Oh, I'm glad I'm more convinced Okay, so just let me finish my version of boxes Possibility possible he gets down into the weeds Saying you know, he's using Alistair Crowley and you and things like that But what the plate that the sort of substance of what he says that I think is actually possibly a danger in in Jordan's understanding Is it your capacity? Danger now we're gonna get into Bring order out of chaos our speed and this is where Vox got kind of curious right is our speech can transform the world now if you think about that as Christian you think well, that's great. God spoke the word into being with the you know, let there be light but Jordan is is consistent in Mapping that onto us right? He did that in the Duncan Trussell interview He does that regularly saying your capacity for speeches to mind you participate in the divinity You are the logos you by your own speaking can draw order out of chaos And then I am persuaded that box maybe actually saw something that is worrisome That this is a magical tradition it's magic words I'm not I'm not sure I very much understand Rachel's point and I see her concern. I Don't think that Peterson I've never seen Peterson get into this magic Reality and part of what I think she does at this moment is undercut the earlier argument that Peterson is a Marxist because the last thing a Marxist would do is something like this because a Marxist is of course a materialist So the reason I'm a little like more than a little skeptical about where Jordan is coming from with his religiosity and with this In the Duncan Trussell interview, which is the one that I've heard him speak most directly about this one They talk about the psilocybin and the amy amy and Miscaria the magic mushrooms and Jordan also describes the mystical experience that he had while working on the mandala the meaning of music listening to Mozart and the the being or spirit or personality that came to him and spoke to him and brought you know invited him to He also talked about the high water or the whatever the other drug is. Yeah Jordan's done drugs He admits it in that that Duncan Trussell interview The idea of that transform I'm not sure when he's talking about the transcendent that it's anything that you actually would recognize as a Christian it sounds to me very like Um The Kind of magical transformations that indeed Crowley was interested in in achieving and that that's where I get anxious and suspicious Yeah, but that's a real But but again She's undermining her own Marxist position here now. You might argue that are the Peterson is inconsistent Yeah, we're all inconsistent and and I understand her. I understand her caution about the shamanic tradition, but Is he is he is he a shaman or is he a Marxist because You're kind of a two different No, it's not because I've read all of that stuff too, right and so so Maybe she He's not saying he's thought anti Christ He's saying he is anti Christian in his use of certain themes that appear sound to be Christian Because he's using Christ language, but if you examine the theology that he's working within simply aren't right And again, I think if you listen to Jonathan Pacheot Jonathan Pacheot will say You know, he's a he's a heretic but Pacheot said that a number of times Peterson is not a confessing Christian Now now you have the larger argument is what he's doing helpful. That's a much bigger conversation. I think and it's that's a To establish the metric of Helpfulness is Difficult and some people have argued that Peterson is leading people away from Christianity and those comments come up pretty regularly in my comments section And that's a that's a that's a conversation. I think that's worth having my Assumption as then a net positive. Yeah, he's Micah is hopeful that because he's using the language and Lewis said that right? He says I you know I was really interested in these these mythologies and then I came to this understanding that Christianity was the myth that became history, right? It's helpful also to read the joy Davidman books It's interesting because joy Davidman was deeply into Dianetics after her Christian conversion But but joy Davidman's Christian conversion came as a response as as a response to a mystical experience that joy Davidman Had and joy Davidman was a full-blown Marxist and she and she was an atheist and Again that joy Davidman biography that I mentioned before I left fascinating biography I might read another biography about joy Davidman just so that I don't get all my sources from one biography, but People are complicated like this You know, I think that's a very interesting thing to think about People are complicated like this you know, we don't all come in these nice little pure packages pure tribal packages because Well, then you wind up you do find people in their pure tribal package and that's okay But then there's lots of different tribes Jordan whenever you try to push him on the reality of Jesus as the incarnate word Pushes it back into the abstract pushes it back into the archetypal He does not like talking about the possibility of the actual historical incarnation Nor does he like differentiating His own sense of divine speech from the reality of our being creatures made by God He talks I think that's a fair point terms about the degree to which your speech I Don't think he's talking in magical terms Again, you can't have it both be a marxist and a magician here thing that can transform your life But the truth is that people's capacity for speech do Transform their lives and that isn't magical thinking you see it in a meeting when you're in a meeting and and the group is The group is conflicted and that's what leads to the people who are in the group The group is conflicted and that's what leadership is someone someone steps up has a vision and their speech Brings order out of chaos and mobilizes an institution or a group of people to go and do something amazing That is part of it's part. I think it's part of image bearing It's not magical speech at all. That's and when I did my that's what we do To that the same that's rather plaguing I'm a i'm even more anxious about the seductiveness of that kind of argument now than I was back in February Again, I think i've actually I I don't know if it was Just to you in comments or on facebook in general that I had clones. They could say where I started to Go away from and have worries about peterson. I said well, you know, it sounds like he's he's trying to you know Say what we already said, you know, like make yourself your own god and that's a dangerous territory I don't think he right but you know vox de kind of goes into and he said it on his videos I don't think he is the antichrist where he goes. I think he is an antichrist and in his book I think he said it a couple of times that he's uh, the peterson is satanic He did but but okay, so the satanic we don't we don't we don't have to go that far to say there's worrying ways in which Whether it's from yung whether it's the yung is but yung is fascinated by all this stuff, too And crowley and and that company it's coming out of this whole late 19th early 20th century fascination with mythology fascination with religiosity the You know the the spiritualists and you know lewis and tolst and tolkien may come out of this Problem we're still living with is this sort of all religions teach the same thing Claim right and all religions do not teach the same thing Um christianity teaches something that's radically at odds with paganism and now I can't remember which of the videos i've done recently I was talking about this paganism ends on human sacrifice that that was my goal. I was my goal the claim right That is satanic right because it's the seductiveness of being like god and that is where it becomes Absolutely terrifying the degree to which you can recognize the humanity of other people is the degree to which you can recognize them as Creatures made in the image and likeness of god which is a different kind of claim than You are powerful over the world by way of your speaking order into chaos Chaos into order by way of your speech that's divine. They're they're fundamentally Theologically different positions and I do not see jordan taking a proper position On the incarnation on creation on the soul On our our relationship to god any of those things and he's oh and one last point to before I open this back up In the in the conversation with duncan trestle. He specifically says Christianity sees the soul as masculine and that is utterly ignorant. The christianity does not see the soul as masculine sees either You're talking about we are creatures made in the image and likeness of god and therefore Male and female both are both are part of our our our relationship to god or in the mystical tradition It's primarily through exegesis of the song of songs. The soul is feminine, right? It's not the If you want to hear rachel talk about this listen to her conversations with jonathan Peugeot they go into something that simply doesn't know this tradition, right? And so for christians to be Drawn to the fact that he's talking about the biblical stories. He's talking about christ and he's talking But he doesn't he is not well versed in the actual christian tradition and that is In vox's vox's understanding I agree here with vox that takes people in dangerous places because it's it it makes you think That he's closer than he is What surprises me is is I get I know very little about milo but But But milo as she calls him this holy fool she doesn't seem to warn us about milo maybe because he doesn't have much of a following but I this is this fast this conversation fascinated me um argument, uh and What was I gonna say here? I kind of lost my train of thought in mid-sentence here so I'll take it to mike and why regain my uh Yeah, absolutely so so I think that rachel you are right to have concerns About this. However with this new development where dr peterson explicitly affirms a metaphysical god I don't think that we can any longer Uh stick to this idea that dr peterson is purely talking about a reductionistic kind of logos, which is Simply our projection of ourselves onto god Um, I think that he was in danger of falling into that and he If he's he could slip back into that that's still a danger and I think mike is putting a little too much faith in one Uh interview between peterson and ruben or the people who view his lectures ought to be aware of that At least well not at least but especially christians ought to be aware of that But also I mean he seems he's remarkably like socrates, um in some ways in the sense of like he even uses the language If you have to pick your poison in the pursuit of truth Socrates chose truth over athens and he was executed for it. He was he he literally drank Poison and I want to get to a quote from justin martyr because I think that the church fathers Have some things that they could say to to dr peterson here Um, so there's a quote where justin said in his apology We are taught that christ is the firstborn of god And we have explained above that he is the word or the logos Of whom all mankind have a share And those who lived according to reason are christians even though they were classified as atheists For example among the greeks socrates and heraclitus. I think that dr Peterson is coming at this again. You're you're right. He doesn't understand the tradition very well, but he's coming at this with new eyes He's coming at this from the perspective of someone who's been wrapped up in scientific naturalism And is coming to see the validity Of the christian tradition to some degree and he's he's making slow progress because he's really genuinely thinking about it um, but nonetheless he's making progress I think that we have to keep in mind that when he's talking about the logos, he's not necessarily reducing it to To our capacity to speak. I think he he what he focuses on that part because That's the way in which we can participate in the logos because that's the only thing he ever says I mean that that's the way he describes it depositing the existence of a classically theistic god um until very recently But I again this this this leap into this metaphysical claim This is I mean it may not seem huge to us as people who are already christian But this is huge. This is a denial of everything that the scientific community Has been telling him to abide by this is a rejection of reductionistic naturalism And i've got to say that this is something that that i'm always very hopeful about and I know that he's been talking to people Who are well within the christian tradition? Secrets is secretly privately. He's been talking to people like nt right who is a phenomenal history new testament historian Um who has done immense work in christian apologetics? Regarding the the veracity of the new testament canon Of the gospels in particular and and I know that he has retweeted for example, um, I think it was gary habermas's Uh minimal facts argument for the resurrection. He's looking into these things as a skeptic from And and he's and he's also quoting he's also been wrestling with the trilemma which i'll put in the pay I'll put in the comment section here because this is the tail end of it that I caught in the the idea of reason as a tool of faith That that these are that he could be convinced by philosophical and historical arguments For the existence of god and then subsequently once once he's got that in the bag He could be convinced of the death, burial and resurrection of christ. I genuinely think that And once you have those two things the rest will fall into place Provided that he's talking with the right people Yeah, well, I think that that brings up a couple of things. Um Is one, you know talking to the right people and I think some of the the Criticisms that we've had Is that he seems to have stuck himself in this bubble, you know the intellectual dark web, you know And not really seeming to have any Um, at least from what we can see, you know, we don't know what's going. I can't read his head But doesn't seem to have any inclination to kind of want to get out of that bubble at this time He doesn't want to really seem to challenge himself He seems like he's found a comfort zone and maybe you know, he's doing that for other reasons and I don't want to um put motive into his actions Um, but I I think that's a good point there and I would love to see him start to debate these things I think rachel is right that he's fundamentally misinterpreting um Theology from christianity. I think it's because he's very inspired by the Jungian kind of mysticism side and like this, you know kind of unitarian belief structure that all religions hold a Hold a bit of the truth and not any religion has the whole truth And so then he says well, you know, it's he makes these misstatements about christianity being uh, you know primarily male You know, right and well, that's like that if you look at islam. Yes, that's true Islam is a religion for males. It is a patriarchal religion But then if you're looking at in unitarian sense, you can you can see the easy jump to want to include that into uh his understanding of christian theology, which is obviously very wrong And so I I think there are very valid points from rachel on those things Rachel could tell us a lot about uh, we kept lady wisdom out of the temple and we've been basket cases ever since I wrote a book about that, didn't I? I wanted I wanted to get that last point in To read Peter brown peter brown's biography of augustin the role that wisdom played in augustin's conversion Into christianity is important. So anyway, I thought that was a really interesting conversation I think they're they talked about following it up with another conversation about the logo. So i'll Definitely check in on that Let me know what you think my time is about up. I have a two o'clock appointment but thanks for watching and more later
