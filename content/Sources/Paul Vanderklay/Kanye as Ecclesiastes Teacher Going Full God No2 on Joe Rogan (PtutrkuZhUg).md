 Hi, this is Paul Kanye was on Rogan and folks were all over me about the conversation. It's fascinating and Kanye as Peugeot and a number of others have noted have been fascinating to watch lately Kanye's God Kanye's God is big bold and personal and even though Kanye speaks like few others with his like Like few others with his normal talk his God talk is pretty much black evangelical in Terms of how he frames it the way he talks now this type of talk When white folks do it Usually doesn't go real well, especially in a public space But black Evan the black church is usually treated very differently in public You know you'll see You'll see in TV shows and movies the portrayal of white churches versus black churches is very different You know black churches are shown as hip cool fun white churches as Hypocritical boring dead Unless it's highly liturgical and highly symbolic And then maybe there'll be a sense of awe or or Halloween will come up and they'll do You know they'll do Halloween type things and in those types of churches now is this different treatment of outspoken God number two black Christians sort of the soft biggest bigotry of low expectations I thought Kanye's treatment of of Race just just the language he used was just just Fascinated me in terms of I mean watching Kanye talk is sort of like watching Twitter in a blender Just just files through things so so rapidly and compare that to again when Matthew McConaughey was just recently on Rogan and Answered his question about the black church and the black church answered some questions about his religious beliefs and that got Segmented out into a clip because Joe Rogan has his main channel many as the clips Just just notice the difference in treatment and in the way Matthew McConaughey thinks he can talk and now Matthew McConaughey and and And Kanye, you know, they're not in exactly the same industries, but they're swimming in the same super high-status Cultural waters and notice all the ways that that Matthew McConaughey sort of dips and weaves and ducks and It just just again the the liberty or Concern that each of them feels with respect to the way they talk about Their their god number two faith is is markedly different So McConaughey's religion seems just as much infused with God number two, but lots of couching it and wisdom and you know, he's he's not gonna go full Chris Pratt and be called out and cancelled on Twitter for You know for Chris Pratt's belief, but you know Kanye not like that Kanye. It's just all there it's all out there he doesn't care and And And Joe Rogan just sort of you know accepts it And then scott adams did a little a little commentary on Kanye's appearance and and scott was just loving it eating it with a spoon So he lauds the interview heavily and gushes over Kanye's redesign of america You know if the time is right and You know, there's a lot of similarity between Kanye and trump on a lot of different levels I don't know some of you will bristle when you hear that People on both sides of the aisle will bristle when they hear that but when you listen to Kanye talk Very trumpish and so it's i'm not surprised that that scott adams is is big on Kanye But but adams almost completely secular washes all the god stuff As if god number two wasn't front and center through the entire interview and and scott adams says hardly a word about it with the exception of Kanye has redesigned church And as I after I watched the interview I thought about Kanye and koala Because last time Kanye really came up on the scene and was in some of my videos you know, I did a little bit of a so i'm a digger as as um Um, you know, I watched uh, I was on an airplane I had to be on an airplane This was pre-covid and so I downloaded a bunch of videos about Kanye, especially biography videos about Kanye and of course Kanye His if you haven't looked into his who his mother was who his father was what life was like growing up for him His long-term relationship with a porn star Um his relationships and rap and then you know on and on and on and on in some ways Kanye is koala koala is the main character the assembler or the teacher Some look at it as solomon and in the book of eclesiastes because what what hasn't Kanye done? Okay, and and Kanye and this is scott adams point and it's enormously important because sometimes when I listen to Kanye so he's got a diagnosis as bipolar and I talked to a fair number of bipolar people and And so, you know, they're usually all excited to talk when they're manic and so there's very much a manic element to Kanye But as scott adams says at the same time you don't just simply dismiss the guy because he has been successful He has dug himself out of debt as Kanye talks about he has started, you know Multi-billion dollar enterprises he has been at the forefront of music and he's done it He's done it by being himself and so Whereas in some ways listening to him talk reminds me of a lot of conversations with a lot of people who are sleeping out of the streets Kanye is not sleeping on the streets. And so You know and and this is where some of peugeot's talk about the fool really Really sticks with me because with a lot of my conversations with people who are sleeping on the streets or people who are in group homes Or people who are spending significant amount of times in and out of psych wards Peugeot's observation about the fool I find dead on right I I will sometimes find people who are the fool saying things that are just so strikingly true and And they can say it because they're the fool because they're the insane one because they're the homeless person But sometimes they just speak the truth that no one dares to speak and so the the archetype of the gesture or the fool I mean, that's that's right on And so look in Kanye's background, you know what, you know, he's tried everything. He's done everything. He's been everywhere And he's and you know, he's withheld nothing And so when you listen to Kanye and where he's at right now with respect to god, it's It's fully eclesiastes 12. I mean the book of eclesiastes you find this this guy who was building things and enjoying women and having children and withholding nothing from himself and and when you listen to how what What kanya is doing with his time at one point joe rogan asked him a question How do you structure your day and and basically kanya? Follows his He follows his heart. He he goes he does whatever he wants to And he is productive in these things and he starts things and he tries things and he fails at things and and again He comes all the way to the end of the book of eclesiastes and basically says fear god and keep his commandments And that's and that's where kanya is at But as as pajot noted in his recent just landed today the commentary video on kanya and his comments on that um, you know just He acknowledges his hypocrisy. He acknowledges his failures. He's just all out there And he's just putting it all out And he wants his kids in church. So, you know some of the things he says I mean they they sound like the most the most conservative christian you can find and here he is on joe rogan Just laying it out and joe rogan's taking him seriously. He's not simply dismissing, you know So, you know in the white house right now, we've got donald trump who's I wouldn't really put him as a coalette creature because he doesn't he is at least some of the first chapters He withholds nothing from himself but at the same time donald trump really hasn't Landed at the end of the book of eclesiastes and and says fear god and keep his commandments. That's just not donald trump but he's paired with mike pence who you know donald trump is Is hated and criticized for how he treats women and in my opinion rightfully so But at the same time mike pence is criticized for for his puritanical prudishness And you know, this is sort of after the obama administration with whatever you think of barack obama's politics as a family man Barack obama is as straight christian Um as you can find In love with his wife apparently and loyal to her and barack obama's worth Worst family sin is he likes to sneak a cigarette now and then but he's the he's the consummate family man And so here we have kanya and of course kanya is married to to kim Kardashian she's the woman who broke ground being famous for being famous and using social media and television and mass media to make a A to make a brand out of herself and really nothing more Not a singer not a designer Not in anything just herself. And so kanya, you know Kanye seems to have that plus his musical gifts and his design talents You know, it's Yeah, it's just all out there There But then of course the church redesign which you know, that's when I first made a couple videos about kanya because The sunday service and and so you're making church look cool again And it's the money and the fame and the status validation And so you've got celebrities and the beautiful people and the elites, you know wanting to get in on that sunday service and it's You have this preacher from masters university coupled with you know, some of the best black musicians from many black musicians grew up in the church and so the you know When I watch all these things come together, it's like Wow, you know, it's just there's the scene and um I don't remember which of the marvel movies but thor, you know, he thor's got to go out there and You know his hammer's been You know, he needs a new weapon to to attack Thanos and so he's going to get the big axe but he's got to go to the dwarves that are gonna um, the dwarves the gnomes, I don't know what they are that are gonna um That are gonna make it form and there's this scene where thor just has to kind of hold the world together or hold these things together And you know, it's a very dramatic scene But you almost get the sense of kanya just takes the stuff and just pushes it together And so you've got the likes of you know Joe rogan, you know, if you watch enough joe rogan you have ideas of where his Spirituality lies or or scott adams who's got very interesting ideas on this neither of them anywhere near god number two ism but both of them just you know watch kanya and Got nothing to say against it, you know, so Kanye just manages to do these things and just just sort of shuts them up Now jonathan I was going back finding his tweets and then oh he just put out a video today on it And it's it's well worth watching art and story and life and and I think jonathan is exactly right that Kanye needs something to bring him focus because Focus because kanya is just taking all of these things and they're just all in a world and and rogan I mean and adams is right rogan's a master interviewer in many ways rogan just you know pulls rogan is Rogan is the kind of interviewer that few network interviewers dare to be Okay, because rogan Rogan just rogan is rogan and he's just going to be himself But he sort of pulls the thread out of kanya and helps give it focus and and sort of land it down to earth So that we can digest it. Otherwise, it's just all of this stuff just swirling around and around and around and You know kanya is kanya talks a lot about steve jobs But but steve jobs was the reducer, you know steve jobs take all those buttons off your phone Take all those buttons off your computer and yeah if if you that that fun new little magnetic Wireless charging port on the back of your iphone. Yeah, your ports are going away you iphone users You're not even gonna have buttons. Um, you know, it's just we're just gonna have this slab like in 2001 space Odyssey with all the chimps around it. That's where the that's where the iphone is going but steve jobs was a was a honer and a simplifier and kanya is a Um kanya is a blender. That's what you know, it's just the whirlwind And and so of course part of why god number two And this gets into you know, i've sort of been You know, I hope my videos haven't gotten too monotonous you know i'm Again, these monologue videos are talking things through and i'm looking for the language and i'm trying to distill and hone and You know the this is the process But but god number two is central in terms of what kanya needs to take all of the discordant Images and patterns and pijot is right He's just all of these patterns and he's upside down and and so god number two is what brings focus And so it's the it's the personhood of rogen that that sort of becomes the funnel through which all of this stuff and Rogan just okay. Here's a thread Here's a thread and and rogen through the interview trying to okay Kanye is composing his symphonies and rogen's just all right Well, let's let's just get a melody here that that we can stop so that it's not just symphony after symphony after symphony now Of course, kanya is married to kim kardashian and today on twitter. I don't even you know She had her 40th birthday party and feeling 40 and feeling humbled and blessed There's not a single day I take for granted Especially during these times when we're all reminded of the things that truly matter and this is the this is the quintessential um Big platform Pablum where you say something that everyone will nod their head and it won't cause any division After and this next one after two weeks of multiple screen multiple screen Screenings and asking everyone to quarantine I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend Things were normal just for a brief moment in time No masks, no social distancing everyone can do now now remember The first word in kim kardashian's Twitter profile is shop Okay, and kanya Is a designer and he sells and he just cut his big deal with was it adidas? and You know wanted to be on the board and it's about selling and so again here it's all of these things and he's bringing them together and Of course, this is the first lady now that it got memed all over the place with some hilarious memes You've got jurassic park. You've got um, you've got Lord of the flies you've got uh lost you've got castaway I even made I even made one of my local meetup But then she you know We danced rode bikes swam near wales kayaked watched a movie on the beach and so much more I realized that for most people this is something that is so far out of reach right now. Yeah private island. I think so Um, so in moments like these I am humbly reminded of how privileged my life is so, you know, it's owning your privilege, but You know, this is the pro. This is the privileged confessional absolution as long as not my own my privilege we can you know there's nothing about in a in a kenosis christ-like way of denying my of you know of Of eliminating the privilege from my life and philippians 2 becoming a slave Being humiliated that's you know, that's christ doesn't just own his privilege and come shining in glory His glory is is masked and veiled But this is very much fits into the long history of the black church And because the leaders You know the the the black, you know The reformed pastor had better not make too much money at church or he's going to be in trouble and the korean pastor had better Be poor but the black pastor had better drive a cadillac I remember when my father's church was uh, my father was a little worried the church wasn't going to make and he was thinking about getting a part-time job to to uh to you know make ends meet at home and I was in college at this point college or seminary and My father, you know was a grew up on the farms and so was used to physical labor And so he had actually thought in paterson new jersey of being a garbage man and in paterson new jersey He didn't have these arms like here we have in california with these standardized buckets to put it into the big truck So the garbage man drives around and the armed is all the lifting and paterson He just had a gang of guys running behind a garbage truck grabbing bags and cans and Throwing the garbage in the back of the garbage truck and my father thought well This would be early mornings and it would be good exercise and at that point my father was Probably around my age. He was in his 50s and he says well Maybe I can get a job with the paterson department of transportation of of Sanitation and I said dad Most of your church is black Do you understand how you would humiliate them if you if they saw their pastor running behind a garbage truck? My father wasn't very much into status but you know, so the leader and the first lady in kim kardashian is the first lady of you know, the Would be the first lady of the sunday service of the of the kanya show is the archetype of success and by You know you had these black churches with with people who were very poor, you know pastor needs a new cadillac, you know pastor that uh stopped payment on his last um Rent check to living stones He got into a place across the street and you know He brags to his church about how he lives in elk grove and has a million dollar home and drives a fancy car And that's the impetus to have the people dig deep deep and give in their congregation Well, why by contributing by purchasing and see this is this comes together in the The shop and sell and design and the style by purchasing by contributing You participate in the hierarchy. You may not have the million dollar home. You may not have the cadillac You might not have the lexus you might not have the ride or or the plastic surgery or all of this stuff But if you purchase kanya stuff if you purchase kim kardashian stuff you participate In kim kardashian just at the low level you can and so then you wear the tag and you wear the The brand and you wear the emblem and and you become you're sucked up into the kanya Principality and the kanya and kim principality and so there's a long history of this and um In the black church and in the consumer society I love towards um the two-thirds of the way through Jonathan as he so often does starts putting words on things that were sort of Creeping in my consciousness congress and then jonathan says it's like whoosh. Oh, yeah, that's right You've just you've just you've just clarified it for me, you know all of the Kanye does not sound humble or anything in the midst of this and and as As jonathan said part of this should terrify us Um, if anyone else said what he said and a lot of the way he talks is just like donald trump I mean if God is calling me to sit to lead the free world as if the kanya is the china's still out there but china and north korea, but God is calling me to lead the free world and as jonathan peugeot said I mean part of that should terrify us, but it doesn't terrify us because He's the he's the jester. He's the fool. He's the upside down. He's the Unpolitician even just looking how he was dressed He's there in a hoodie and of course that has layers of cultures a black man in a hoodie that has layers of cultural resonance And and very few like kanya take all of those images and and just sort of Swing them in I remember listening to um john mcwarder making the observation that in some ways trump is Is is like a rap is like a rapper In his lifestyle and and so you have kanya and trump and so when they were together people people were seeing it through a particular lens Oh trump is a racist and therefore but kanya is right there in the office and kim is getting Uh some some woman led out of jail early and on and on and on and as peugeot says when the world is upside down The fools look like someone who tells the truth and and again i've seen that throughout my life in you know this spiritual gift that I seem to have of attracting the uh I gotta be careful with this because my wife says Of attracting the kind of people I always attract especially in real life in my local ministry I mean my father had that too. We had that in northside we had We would have the craziest things happen around my father's ministry and part of that of course was we were We've always done ministry in sort of the upside down parts of the world And the more upside down or at least on the bottom the part of the world is the more of this stuff You'll attract and then it's on the upside I've got i've got so many stories, but most of these people are alive. I can't tell them Um You know so you know I can mention daniel who's you know a homeless guy that I that I deal with very regularly There'll be times that he says things that I just think are just They're like a bolt from the blue There's just like stark truth in the midst of insanity and this guy unlike connie you know He he lives in the clothes He pulls out of garbage cans and he lives by the Money and the food that people throw at him and on and on and on and he is bipolar and he is institutionalized on a regular basis and he does Take meds for at least a few days after he gets out of the hospital And then it's just back to the street drugs to try to regulate himself. So Should kanya terrify us? Why doesn't he? well Do we take kanya seriously? Well, what does it mean to take him seriously? And we're not even quite sure and so you you see that with rogan all the way through the interview But but I think what what kanya does is is to align Or at least to bring together the hot discordant sacred. So again kanya's pastor Is a white dude and he's from masters, which is the john mccarthur tribe and john mccarthur And I talked a little bit about that with preston sprinkle who went there john mccarthur is I could do a whole video on john mccarthur But this is kanya's preacher and so in the in the video kanya talks about his um His his uh, why can't I think of the word? Um Is You know his preaching which is sentence by sentence and Now there's a long history of that in black preaching And i'm sure that there are a number of black pastors who are really offended That kanya who's way up at the top of the status hierarchy Elevates this guy to be his preacher and of course kanya will bring other preachers in and so on and so forth but um This is what kanya does he he brings together and he aligns and he puts in the same whirlwind The hot discordant sacred and we just kind of watch I mean even look at this still from his sunday services And if you've watched any of his sunday services or at least clips from them, that's what he does. So you have this you have this preacher from masters university, it's sort of a strange hodgepodge between a certain american Conservative, it's not really reformed. It's sort of dispensational. It's secessionist where now what do I mean by secessionist it means that well this the the The the miracles of god are left to the bible times and they've ceased now when kanya Kanye is living big and bold and god number two and god is talking to him and god is working through him and You know kanya will sound All he'll sound black, you know, he sounds black baptist and you've got this You've got this mccarthurite preaching for him. And again, it's just if you the deeper you understand both of these traditions It's just kanya. He's taking these two things and he's putting them together and it's like Those things don't go together. But Kanye's pulling it off and people who should be Talking him down for his hot number two god talk Just all give him a pass And I think this is I think this is actually part of the you know, i've been thinking about in a little bit more serious way the The reemergence of god number one That's really why Jordan peterson lit off what he did. This is again god from below This is god. This is the imminent god This is the god whose glory is seen in creation. This is jordan peterson's biblical series when he speaks psychologically and and again he he wants to He's very modernistic in how he keeps these two things together You know, what do I believe mind your own business? even though he will at times talk about his visions and Especially jordan being a yungian You know jordan is very open to the mystical And and not just not, you know not at all Shy about the psychedelics But doesn't forefront it And and so and so jordan won't close the door completely on what brett weinstein would call the supernatural And I think that's in my opinion something to jordan's credit because Jordan is honest about it more honest than those who are trying to maintain their status by Being less honest about it, but it's the reemergence of god. Number one C.s lewis in miracles makes the observation that pantheism You know, this is what you find with people when they get spiritual but not religious suddenly They they they discover pantheism and and they act like You know, I was a christian but now i'm so much more open and now god is everywhere and in everything and And and just sort of devolves into pantheism and lewis, of course had seen this because this has been going on a long time in the culture Um big at the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century and and and every time you sort of have a christian awakening This kind of stuff comes along with it And and lewis says yeah It seems to fit because the old shoe fits because there's nothing older than pantheism and there's there's nothing more basic to religion w religion worldview as as pantheism It might be new to you, but it's not new to everything else It's nearly the definition of religion w And he said only the john for fake. He put a comment in my last video you know right out of uh Um right out of the lie in the witch was it the line the witch in the wardrobe? You know, it's all in play-doh. What do they teach in school these days? um And and that's basically what lewis says only in christianity and platenism do we see? Um, you know, do we see pantheism finally overcome? now Secularity, which is I think willful god number two resistance are acting and talking increasingly with emergence taking on agency Um, our rule had made the comment in in uh, in and one of the in a comment about you know Emergence is is just basically, you know atheist hand-waving it's how you explain everything which is emergency emergency emergence, but What what's happening is that as again? There's two things that I think are causing the meaning crisis. One is Science is showing us how very strange the world is, you know, it's it's quantum fields that are manifesting particles Well, what else is in those fields? Well, we don't know and so on that hand the this you know The physical world is stranger than we can know but also with cognitive science We're pressing further and further into our own personhood And we're seeing more and more spirit of geometry in our own personhood and we're seeing ourselves Increasingly hackable and understanding and so we're pushing pushing further into the person but the more we do that the more the the more the The personal aspect of emergence is arising and being seen and treated as agency and You know early on when I was working through the verveky stuff You know he he would um You know, he basically would make the point that you know in a sense We're kind of stuck with the language that we have and evolution gives us and and so you find that all over the place always giving Personal agency to evolution now. They say well it has no consciousness Because evolution What is it? Is it a spirit? Is it a pattern? Is it and and if we are persons? And now you know the the irony is that of course while while we're continuing to reduce personhood Which is going to put a whole lot of pressure On this christian human this this humanism that is the legacy of christianity that wants to preserve Um a broad spectrum of people and give them a sacred privileged position the more we sort of break people down The more we're going to be under pressure to sort of give that game up And and that's the fear And you know, I don't see that winestein has any answers for that, although he doesn't want to So we were chatting on the discord this morning and sam made an observation which I thought was was really helpful He said, you know in some ways brett winestein's a gnostic. I thought Well, that's interesting and well how? it's not that he's a That he's not that he's an immaterialist But there's a there's a certain amount of um There's a certain amount of dualism in his world Because well evolution is the genocidal spelling bee And he's also the same guy who's making the point about a repugnant morality. So you have the repugnant morality So what what made the world was it a demiurge? But what is the basis for any morality when success is the outcome of adaptation? In other words, you know morality Becomes indistinguishable from that which survives but you know quite clearly that's not where brett will go with any of this stuff brett's Very much and I thought brett his comments about judaism and christianity were You know that christianity is part of the phylogenetic tree of judaism. But but but basically But basically, um judaism has been you know, memetically adapting to christianity. I think he's dead on right See i'm making a commentary about that video without actually treating the video. Um And so what what tends to happen then is what I think we see not just in brett But in many people who are who are working this now as modernity recedes because modernity keeps those lines fixed As modernity recedes we see, you know emergent moral agency increasingly being I think implicitly assumed in the systems and and that then becomes the the foundation and the grounding for this christian inheritance that they've taken out the christian Justification and foundation for it and they're trying to sort of backfill it in and that's they're using Emergence and all of these things to sort of backfill In from the what was hollowed out christianity in this and and so in that way I'm not I don't know if gnosticism is necessarily the right term But but he's really got a dualism not really manichaeism, but you know, so the but you know many many greek philosophies then had the idea that this this a this world Which is a place of decay is the product of a lesser god now for For for brett weinstein. It's the product of a of a morally lesser god and and now brett suddenly has What he had and again peugeot if you look at peugeot's commentary on brett brett peugeot keeps tagging him you're you keep appropriating you keep appropriating this symbolism brett Um this higher symbol so so so brett would say well that the world seems to be the product of a Morally lesser god and now here we come with our morality, but it just it just well, where does this morality come from? because Biology or evolution or any of these gods that made the world don't give two bits for what side of the human or non-human line you're on or Or you know or any of this? so And so I think what what we increasingly have is you know, oh we're beginning to understand what jordan peterson has pointed out that You're going to keep creating god. He's going to keep slipping into your language You're that that idea of god as whatever it is that's at the top of your hierarchy You're just going to go back to it because it's just simply too deeply built into how we are But then weinstein he's writing a book, you know, I caught this again on chesterton's fence And when you think about this Well, what's chesterton's fence chesterton makes the point that if you're walking through a field and you run across a fence And you look around and you wonder why is this fence here and just looking around you see no reason for why the fence would here chesterton's Equip is leave the fence alone Don't ever take a fence down until you know truly know the reason why it was put up Here's the irony of this for brett weinstein using chesterton's flents so freely and repeatedly in his broadcast Chesterton's fence is implicit agency some conscious moral Willful purposeful agent put up the fence and you can't in the moment standing on the field looking around at the context With a limited lame frame of reference in your consciousness discern the purpose for it But you presume to understand there is a purpose behind it. So therefore don't touch the fence That's his huge point This guy who blithely says, of course, there is no purpose Well, why don't you look at chesterton's fence and say of course, there is no purpose Well, so well evolution has a purpose. Oh my you're putting a lot of agency in that Evolution has a purpose. I thought I thought it's I thought its moral code was a was a Was a genocidal spelling bee It just it just starts coming apart The point is that there is a purpose beyond the found world That you may not have information access to therefore leave the fence up in other words presume conscious moral Willful reasonable intent with the world that you find Well, how will you discern that well you're only going to be able to discern it by actually trying to Mind read well, how do we do that between human beings? We're actually pretty good at that. We're better at it than any other Animal in the world. We're really good at mind reading ourselves or each other. That's the point and that's the point of Recognizing the fence you try to mind read you try to read the mind and therefore understand the purpose understand the agenda Understand the telos understand exactly what's behind the found world Then you're just in full-blown religion Then you're just talking about the mind of god then you're worrying what what's on god's mind eric weinstein That's religion And you know alistair mcgrath it almost sounds like you're trying to start a new religion What are you going to base the religion on and of course jordan peterson basically looks back and says well let's look at At least the most successful human civilization Today in terms of what we think is the most moral and what we might crowdsource and say these are the nations that everywhere else In the world wants to get to therefore we should assume that this is Probably the best civilization in the world. How can what was this civilization built on? It's built on that book and so maybe if we study that book even from a psychological point of view Then maybe we can learn something and perhaps Not lose what we've got Here western civilization is sort of chester tins fence And maybe even be able to improve upon it. That's jordan peterson's main deal But if you're really skittish about god number two very quickly Your god number two is unconscious But still sort of has in the emergent agency And maybe even emergent purpose sufficiently to put up a fence Spirit is the right word as I went into my last long video Spirit is the right word as I went into my last long video Spirit is the right word because spirits are patterns. Look at school spirit. What is school spirit school spirit? Inhabits the walls that inhabits the pep rallies that inhabits the architecture it inhabits the students it it it It it takes on and we human beings were these little repeaters Okay, we're these little repeaters It's like we're in a we're in a mesh network and we take in and repeat but we're not we're not dumb repeaters. We keep We keep changing it and people play the telephone game and people usually mock things like well The authority of the bible because of the telephone game you'll find that usually in the celebrity athas what they don't realize is that There's all this error correction that's going on and the point isn't to get it just word for word to copy it directly like computer code It's much more like It keeps getting improved sort of like the highly compressed story of k and enable that jordan peterson likes to use again and again in his in his talks Patterns are indistinguishable from agency This is where I have the touring test and what computers are able to do is discern patterns and discern patterns and discern patterns and start spitting them out to us And we can't tell is that agency is that not agency we act as if it's agency that's So when when the computer is talking to you? You kind of act as if it's agency, but you hold mental reservation you try and do it Well, how will you relate to those patterns? You relate to those patterns as if you're relating to a person You go full god number two, which is exactly where Kanye and where human beings have gone they get to the point of realizing God number one and then noticing all of the agency and the spirits That are in the world and what's the only reasonable thing to do you go full god number two And that's exactly where Kanye has gone and and so you wind up with both this Self-deprecating humor and crazy boldness and pride at times And and Kanye, you know Whatever you think of trump's politics or his character He takes his best shot You got to give it to him Because you know, hey, what are you waiting for? Why are you playing it safe now wisdom and yeah, you know read the book of proverbs But you know Kanye's takes Kanye takes his best shot. He goes for broke. He goes for the top You know win lose fail doesn't matter he'll go for it and at the end of Kanye's life, no one will say He didn't live And and you think about jesus parables of the talents and you know jesus the king is going away on a long journey and So he distributes his assets to three of his servants and to one servant he gives ten Talents or talents which are these, you know big masses of gold resources to one servant. Let's just use Millions of dollars to one servant. He gives 10 million dollars to another servant. He gives 5 million dollars to the third servant He gives 1 million dollars now in the back of your mind. Well, why doesn't he give each one equally? Well, because he's no dummy and he understands who his servants are and so that the master comes back or the king comes back from the long journey and Calls his guys in I said I gave you 10 million dollars before I left. What do you have to show for it? I earned another 10. Well done good and faithful servant you fiver. Come here. What'd you do? I earned another five Well done. You've you know, you've done well So the one with ten i'm gonna give you more resources because you're you're showing you're doing something with it with five I'll give you more you've shown me you're doing something with it If you come back with ten or fifteen, I would have liked it better and I would have given you more But at least you did and then the third one Okay, I gave you one talent what'd you do with it? well, I I know that you're a tough, you know, and and and of course, you know, you you listen to jesus parables and And he's talking about god And and he says I know you were the kind of master who who reaps where he does not so he's you're a you're a god Is a cutthroat business person entrepreneur and you think certain kinds of christians will hear that and say Bible's not shy about it god, you know Part of why I love god as I read the bible and I it's The again if you've listened to some of my other stuff the diverse excellencies this comes through in jesus He's both more he's both more humble and more audacious Than anyone could imagine You know, he comes as a servant philippians, too, but he but he's you know, the son of man And he's more accepting and that's the part that that we sort of like about him But he's also more demanding read the sermon on the mount and you see all these discordant diverse Excellencies in jesus and so the master and so the servant says well, you gave me one and I know that you're you're you know I know that you're an aggressive business person. So I didn't want to lose any so I I hid it in the field And so here it's back And he says take it And he says take that talent and give it to the one who has 10 and everyone's like well, that's not fair What are you talking to me about fair for and you who did nothing with one, you know to the torturers You know, there's something of kanye in this you know, he's you know I should have more kanye in me He's gonna go for it You know gonna gonna look for a woman's gonna get a porn star You know and you know, it just he's coal at he's he's living life. He's living it with it down Now crash burn wind up at wind up broke wind up in insane asylum wind up, you know, however, it doesn't matter you know Put the hammer down put the metal pedal to the metal floor the sucker Do it all the way, you know, hey Kanye 2024 you probably run against donald trump that year um, but you take your best shot and Knowing you'll likely get taken down and lose And on good friday, jesus looks like the biggest loser and his his his adult male disciples are in hiding and the women and You know young john is there looking at the cross and they all think Boy, were we mistaken when we backed him? But you bet on easter and you know, that's what kanye's doing and You know part of part of this is what i've been trying to look for the language for because And it all comes into god number two in many ways because If you're talking to an empty universe If you're talking to mere emergence without consciousness that you can't really fully relate to You know, you can go to the grand canyon and look at the grand canyon and be filled with awe and understand Um, you know the that that that little river could cut that canyon over immense periods of time And it's just wow and you go to glacier or you go to yosemite national park and you know Or you go to yosemite national park and you go up into glacier point and they have a big display there about how glaciers cut this And sheared off half dome and you've got the other domes and and you go up on top of sentinel dome and it's just glory But you can't talk to it Well, you can talk to it people talk to it all the time. It's not unreasonable to talk to And and people come there to sort of sing its praises But how much better is the world if it can talk back how much better is the world? if if the world is not only alive and enchanted but if the world is actually relational and You know again, I just played the video yesterday jordan peterson, you know the discovery of the future Well, how much better if if you're bargaining with the future if the future can talk back? Well, it's terrifying Yes, I mean eric weinstein's right it's terrifying you have to think about what's on god's mind and if you go anywhere near a calvinist Say yeah, it's all up to god and um, you know, you don't have any coins to purchase your way in But yeah, you say what but the bible is all full of these other ideas about about challenge and even just the parable of the talents What about that? Yeah, that's exactly the point You don't have any your arms are too short to box with god You don't have any you don't have any way to manipulate or control god. So go for it Just do it. Yeah, but it might hurt. Yeah, you might wind up broke 50 million dollars in debt and you might wind up in the assain asylum where they're pumping drugs into you to numb your mind and and you might wind up Living khanye west's crazy life, but That might be an upgrade to the boring Grayscale life you're living we say well, well, I see lots of people living sort of on the edge. Yeah, but now suddenly Kanye west's full god number two starts to make sense because it isn't pure chaos Because what khanye is doing is is really In an aseem to leave sort of way in a jordan peterson sort of way looking behind him and saying, you know, peugeot says khanye's, you know just intuitively Intuitively into the patterns. Well, okay, so The world is full of patterns which patterns do you put at the top of your hierarchy? How do you relate to them? You should relate to them with the spirit of finesse. You should relate to them personally Well, well which patterns should you prioritize? Well turn around and look in the past and see which patterns have brought people where? And you know if khanye's, you know You know white supremacy and and yada yada yada about american history. I mean again, it's just Is he is he right wing? Is he left wing? Is he is he is he what is he just just round and round and round And round and but but how then do you find your way through all those patterns? Well, you look back and you say you look back because that's where you'll see the patterns You can't see the patterns into the future because you can't see them yet So you look back and you see that fence back there and you say Boy, if I can get further back to the people who built that fence, maybe i'll figure out What pattern that fence is manifesting? That's wisdom now what's going to happen to khanye, I don't know but he sure is fun to watch and I almost didn't make this video because They're watching alex jones on joe rogan today at the discord server in a watch party and Oh, I I got I can't turn on the discord server during work hours. I get sucked in This is why you go full gun number two, it's the only reasonable thing Otherwise, you're just sort of you're just sort of like the kid who stands you know when when our kids were young we used to take them to the city pools and You know get them swim lessons and my youngest would Stand on the side of the water and each other now all my kids have been lifeguards since then because that was a great job from the city and so we kind of pushed them into get the lifeguard training and then you know and then hey be a lifeguard and so My kids there's their summer jobs and some of them all school year jobs and continuing jobs have been lifeguards But you know, my son was just just standing outside the pool because he was cold and it's like, you know Toss the kid in Why because you can stand outside the pool and watch everyone else swim or you can get in the water And going full god number two was getting in the water and kanya kanya stopped playing and kanya did full coalette kanya You know made money lost money designed this design that did drugs You know, you name it kanya did it and he had the highest access to the best of it. And now he says Fear god and keep his commandments and you know, be the ten talent guy don't sit around and yeah, it'll be a bumpy ride, but We probably could all use a little bit more kanya in us. So anyway, there's my commentary on this
