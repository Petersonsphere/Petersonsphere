 Hi, this is Paul. Just wanted to make a short announcement that I'm going to be helping the Alameda Jordan Peterson meetup kickoff on July 14. This coming Sunday, it'll be at the Alameda Christian Reformed Church in Alameda, California. We'll start at 4 p.m. The host is Mark Hoffman, who is a friend of mine, and he's the pastor of the Alameda Christian Reformed Church, and he's graciously offered to have his building used for that purposes. It's not his building, it's the church's building. But I will be there with a few people from the Sacramento meetup, and I know there are some people from San Francisco who will want to be there. So a new meetup July 14, kickoff 4 p.m. Alameda Christian Reformed Church, you can go to meetup.com and just search Alameda Jordan Peterson Meetup right there in the San Francisco Bay. If you come, I hope to see you Sunday. Thanks a lot.
