 Hi, this is Paul. I finally have time to start digging into the gift that David Fuller gave me with his interview with Jordan Peterson and the Kingdom of God quote Peterson starts out by saying I wasn't listening and I could have Fallen from my chair when he said that like not listening. I've listened to this guy for I Can't tell you how many hours over the last year, but at the same time I one of the things as I Learn as an avid listener is how poor of a listener I am the more I listen the more Carefully, I listen the more I realize how much I miss so going over some things and And in fact, I just got an email this morning where someone brings up exactly what I put in my put in this video So let's let's take a let's take a listen at what I missed Got a couple of minutes left So this might be quite a big question but just come back from the US where we interviewed Paul van der Kley Christian pastor who's been doing quite a lot of Videos about your your thought He one of his questions was he says he he sees a real sort of stoicism in your thought So pick up your cross and drag it up the hill his question is But before I before we get to the question, I'm sure some of you have heard this multiple times as I have One of the one of the interesting things that I've noticed if you look at my conversation with Job It's entitled the book of Job on my channel and Job mentioned his He grew up in a in a Dutch reformed context and stopped going to church And nobody Job tells his story incredibly. Well, that was one of my favorite conversations that I've done and Then he he he became an atheist and then the nihilism, you know, it really began to bother him So then he explored Buddhism and then he explored stoicism and when he said that I thought my goodness stoicism stoicism as a Living faith today Really took me by surprise, but then Following Robert Wright's two channels meaning of life TV and blogging heads dot TV I got to I got to him via watching McWhorter and and Glenn Lowry and Been listening to him listening to a lot of Robert Wright lately and I noticed that Robert Wright has this interview with a Another university professor who has in some ways Did some ways resurrected stoicism as a living faith now these faiths are secularized One of the things that you immediately notice with with Buddhism at least as a religious person With with Buddhism in the West is how secularized it is and Andrew Sweeney and I talked about that in the conversation that we had A couple of weeks ago and Stoicism stoicism classical stoicism Already had a leaning towards secularity as I think Buddhism does which which in a sense makes them much more ready at hand Towards the kind of appropriation. I don't mean that in a pejorative sense the kind of appropriation that we see happening as secularism Secularism As we continue in this secular process and and that's actually what I'm gonna be doing quite a bit of talking about in this video because in some ways Peterson is a Christian Analog to the secularist Buddhist and the secularist stoic the contemporary secularist Buddhist and the contemporary secularist stoic and One of the things that I noticed with with Peterson was this as Was this alignment with some of the reformed emphasis on total depravity My conversation with said Helima that came out in that conversation and and I immediately noticed it at first our cultural our cultural Habit tends to be a triumphalism where we Imagine that through and this comes through very clearly with Sam Harris where we imagine We can with reason and science achieve anything and everything what that approach tends to Turn let's use willful blindness tends to turn a willfully blind eye towards Is the human factor let's let's concede for a moment and I'm not a I'm not a climate change Skeptic personally, and I know some of you will react to that in the comments, which is fine. Make your case I'm not a climate change skeptic, but what I am is a skeptic. I'm a political skeptic. What do I mean by that? I am skeptical about what we can accomplish in terms of Working together as a people I'm not skeptical in terms of what science can achieve science achieves what science achieves its Mechanistic it's once you take the subjective out You can create hydrogen and oxygen from water predictably What I am far more skeptical about are what people will do with science Because the human heart is Deceptive and I think one of the one of the greatest Tolkien is is having his way with our culture When when you listen to Galadriel even comes into the movies of the Lord of the Rings even through the book The book is better, of course, but comes in through the movies that the hearts of men What do we do when we get the ring? Well, we are we are in that sense children of Sauron and a little bit later in this video I'm gonna talk a little bit more about Jonathan Peugeot's Monotheism part to talk where he is trying to translate New Testament language into contemporary speech and he has to make a second video because I Imagine could fully imagine that a lot of people got lost in the first one So so why is Jordan Peterson? Similar to a stoic. Well, am I being faithful to classical stoic stoicism or the contemporary? Manifestation of secular stoicism in that probably not But there is a when I listen to actually when I listen to a lot of Jordan Peterson and many of others have had this experience When I listen to a lot of Jordan Peterson, I hear my mother. What do you mean? I hear my mother. Well, my mother was a She was a children of Friesians She was a children of poor Friesians who all they did was struggle uphill and one of the things I remember quite clearly growing up was You'd get the message in the the Friesian It's not really a Dutch community. It's a Friesian community because the Friesians are a separate Group from the Dutch and if you go to a place like White and so Massachusetts There are many Friesians there and their culture persists one of the If you had to put something on the wall Which would never put on the wall in an American culture because it wouldn't look good The the saying would be no one wants to hear you complain Now as now I'm years past Listening to this message. I think about the stoic Within the Friesian reformed community that for generations had suffered hunger and poverty and You work from the time you get up in the morning every day is struggling uphill yet you would imagine that if the contemporary if the contemporary critique of Religion were applied to them it clearly gets them all wrong because Their their religion was just as dour as their As their lives were the religion was by no means escapist Except that what what happens is that the darker you see the world the more? illuminating grace is Now this is this is where I'm bearing the lead because I will play through the Peterson thing, but this is this is where The conversation gets very interesting with Peterson's answer on the city on the hill But I wanted to explain the stoicism comment a little bit more and flesh it out a little bit more that that wasn't That wasn't really a critique. I understand that Hearing a Christian minister critique in this conversation Hearing a Christian minister critique in this culture will inevitably sound like Base Tribalism speaking and we're gonna talk about that when we listen to the Billy Graham thing Oh the longer I talk the longer I know this will be a long video And of course you truck drivers out there won't mind but the stoicism is is is not so much a Reflection on classical stole stoicism or its contemporary rejuvenation But this this more Simplistic common Association between stoicism and let's say a stiff upper lip. So let's let's listen to Peterson's answer What's at the top of the hill? He doesn't hear that Well, that's because he hasn't listened to the times when I've been talking about it Because I've said it repeatedly I Have been listening, but I haven't heard and and so I will I will take maximal responsibility For me not hearing because when I go back and I listen to things that I've heard many times I Say, oh, yeah, he did play it. So let's let's keep going uphill with your burden towards the city of God That's the that's the story. What does that mean the city of God to you? Ah So now David, okay, that's let's let's Now Peterson has to become a preacher. Well, why what do preachers do know people? again, just as my colloquial association of stoicism with stiff upper lip preaching has a colloquial association with admonition and scourges What what preachers and in a sense prophets? Usually major in is explanation and contextualization How can I take this term which in this case city of God? How can I make this understandable? To people in this time and place and again if you listen to Jonathan Peugeot's goddess Santa Claus monotheism videos part one and part two This is what poor Jonathan is trying and I've I'm terrifically sympathetic to him Because I know just how hard this is and so Peterson gives the Peterson gives the let's say the repetitive answer or the rote answer or the dogmatic answer of city of God, okay Jordan now explain this to people in 2018 in Language that they can associate with and apply Well, that's the challenge I Would say that that's that he also does look tired here. That's a place where everyone bears maximal responsibility and speaks the truth now it's important a Proof text without a context is a pretext for sliding in your own agenda here and so I've got to be careful here because this comes at the end of a 30 at least a 30 minute interview with David and Knowing how Peterson stacks up his schedule the guy is the definition of a workaholic I mean he works flat out. This is exactly what he says he does and so this could come at the end of the day No, no offense to with all due respect to David. He's and David will probably acknowledge us. He's the likes of David even with his 23,000 subs is a It's not too high on the on the hierarchy yet. So David is probably getting an end-of-the-day Interview here. I may be wrong and go ahead and correct me if I'm if I am wrong, but Peterson does look tired here and This is one of the hardest answers he has to give So But but also back to the context piece if you listen to the whole interview and then listen to this answer all of us speak from within contexts and So you have to you do have to answer understand this answer within this context. Well, let's let it play That's what it is What's the responsibility You're responsible for the suffering in the world You're responsible for the malevolence in the world and you're responsible for the veracity of your utterances now now this is This is opposite Of so much of what he's trying to fight and it's opposite of the wave that he's been seeing and this is a reason that Conservative religious people are especially conservative religious Christians are flocking to him now a number of you have sent me the Desiring God Podcast on Peterson and there was recently One from Whitehorse in now most of you probably don't know what I'm talking about with respect to Desiring God That's what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the Talking about with respect to Desiring God that's John Piper's outfit Whitehorse in is Is is Michael Michael Horton's outfit these are very conservative reformed Christians and And and they are Not they're they're more conservative than I am on with some of with some of the The Postmarks that are used to identify the colloquial right and left and the reformed community But but again for for a University of Toronto psychology professor who was basing his justification of biblical authority upon Darwin the the interest and Enthusiasm with which this community or let's not say enthusiasm Let's say there's there's a degree of caution always but They're not railing at him in the way that they might let's say rail at Someone like me in the Christian Reformed Church that does things like ordain women as elders and pastors Their treatment of him is noteworthy and important and telling Because what he is doing with this responsibility kick and we heard this through David Fuller's interview with the Zen master Is We are responsible for the evil of the world now if you if you take this and compare it with What's going on in terms of the culture war? in terms of the Identitarian critique the The facile use of patriarchy or white supremacy in our cultural conversations Again if you listen to the Zen master conversation with with David Fuller that I listened to yesterday and and you and you hear Jordan Peterson's Commentary of how you should feel when you visit a holocaust museum or Auschwitz Peterson's Peterson's critique is when you go into this place You should in fact appropriate the guilt and not appropriate a A self-serving Historical bias that says this is everyone else's fault now David Fuller I think i'm with David Fuller on on the critique of Peterson in that when he really gets railing against social justice warriors He in a sense Betrays some of this own position where If you can if you can go to If you can go to Auschwitz and say I Did this If you can historically appropriate it to what degree don't we also need to say when we look at The the rise of let's let's call it Neomarxism in our contemporary critique to what degree am I responsible for that? That that that that that that that that that that Gets it's always more difficult on your heart to Take responsibility for your contemporary enemy than to take responsibility for past sins And and this this just shows the complexity of it because Peterson could could justifiably say well, i'm not responsible for the left's Hijacking of the university and giving up on the project of edge of training our children With a classical education having them read Plato having them read Aristotle having them learn latin having them understand Their own history and see right away. We're getting to questions of identity and community and tribe so so this is very difficult, but but what he does here is What he does here is Say here on the city on the hill what we're dragging the cross up. This is a this is a path of mortification Which is a term that you would be that medieval that that christians would be using Throughout their history now now remember what a religion is Now i'm not i'm not redefining peterson's definition of religious, but what a religion is a religion is An intentional long conversation Maintaining a canon a dogma so that we can in fact converse with people productively Over thousands of years this this is how we in fact keep community with our ancestors to put on a little Jonathan Pajoh hat this is how we in fact Maintain the cloud of witnesses and maintain the communion of the saints By being able to converse with our Church fathers Now americans are particularly bad with this because americans want to live in the moment and americans are even even christian ones are Of it have a deep belief in our secret sacred self, but but this is what religion does religion has us conversing with with augustin and john calvin and And and chrisostom and See now peter now, of course, jonathan pachaud would go into the eastern fathers, which regrettably I know far too little of Origin tertullian iranius so on and so forth so This this is what we're doing now peterson is saying, okay, we're we're pulling our cross up the hill and In the city of god, you're maximally responsible for the suffering. You're maximally responsible for the malevolence and you speak the truth That's what it is Now we're going to get into this and we're going to revisit this a number of times because For all of the care that peterson uses about his words He's using some synonyms here which are not bad synonyms he's using city of god and in fact kingdom of god and To show what a bad listener I am just yesterday was pointed out that Multiple times in the video when I talked about peter kreef's book, which is between heaven and hell I said between heaven and earth now my watchers inside my head and The commenter said that's a freudian slip and I think he's very much right because If I were to sit down with peter kreef the the title of this book Which he may or may not be responsible for given what editors do and what publishing houses do The difference between heaven and hell and heaven and earth is a very important difference Especially in the context of that little dialogue that peter kreef does But these these freudian slips these synonyms the kingdom of city of god kingdom of god city on a hill That's of course I used that in a previous video This is of course john winthrop sermon a a puritan minister That that gets into the american mythology about what america is We are a city on a hill and and this is very much going to get into the question of western civilization and christendom And and whether it's actually over in terms of the christianity that formed jordan peterson Even as a young boy growing up into in the mainline Canadian church now let's okay, let's So let's let's dive in yeah, all this is introduction It's really bad preachers two long introductions the city on the hill. Okay now maps of meaning So so right away after I made that that video someone does a quick search of maps of meaning and comes up with two references to the city of god and See even I even get the I even get the quote wrong in my powerpoint This comes after this diagram that if you've watched maps of meaning and if you've read the book is is Is important for peterson and actually peterson calls this three questions. So i'll just read the quote Our answers to these three fundamental questions and these are the three questions Our answers to these three fundamental questions. What is What should be and how should we act now that what is question a little bit later? i'm going to go to a response video done to my conversation between me and andrew swinney on note in the note in the note in the network Where we're going to get into norther fry and what is because norther fry says and norther fries Is quoted extensively in the notes to maps of meaning Once you ask that question, what is you fundamental? What is god you fundamentally change the assumption of You fundamentally change god in your imaginary. Okay. Now when I say every time I say in your imaginary I'm appropriating language from charles taylor Which may or might not be helpful to you because how many of you could actually read that huge book? What is what should be how should we act modified and constructed in the course of our social interactions constitutes our knowledge That's really framed especially after you listen to norther fry on this Constitutes our knowledge insofar As it has any behavioral relevance constitutes our knowledge from the myth from the mythological perspective See, so this is why i've got some Kind of questions with our note in the note in the network guy in terms of How self consciously and strictly is peterson appropriating norther fry in this? I don't know Bear in mind peterson also wrote this 15 20 years ago, so or 30 years ago because it took 15 years to write that book The structure of the mythic known what is what should be how it can get from one to the other is presented in figure one That's this figure The domain and consular elements of the known the known is explored territory a place of stability and familiarity Is the city of god as profanely realized? So now think about his conversation with um mcgillquist and I still yet have to read mcgillquist's book Book It isn't an audio book yet I hope it does come because I can just get through books quicker that way because I can listen to them while I drive and Wash dishes and do all kinds of other chores But here city of god is identified with known territory and again if you're listening to peterson a lot you want to understand the two sides of the brain um Explored territory and unknown territory here city of god and again peterson talks about this often city the city is the known space It finds metaphorical embodiment in myths and narrative describing the community the kingdom or the state such myths and narratives guide our ability to understand the particular bounded motivational significance of the presence its present experienced in relation to some Identifiable desired future and allow us to construct and interpret appropriate patterns of action from which the confines of that's From within the confines of that schema we all produce determinate models of what is and what? Should be and how to transform one into the other we produce these models by balancing our own desires As they find expression and fantasy and action With those of the other with those of the others individual family and communities that we habitually encounter How to act constitutes the most essential aspect of the social Contract the domain of the known is therefore the territory we inhabit with all those who share our implicit and explicit traditions and beliefs Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy This is If you apply this paragraph to the book maps of meaning itself What you might take away would be that What you act embodies Peterson says of all the time it's pragmatism what you act embodies your axioms and what he's trying to do here in maps of meaning is Is use Contemporary Now northrup fry would say third phase and again We'll get you off to listen to the note of the note in the network video to to understand Northrup fries v phases that he gets from veiko third phase language To describe something that first phase language Mythological language did better and again This is this is deep in terms of what jordan peterson is saying jordan peterson is saying that the bible Articulates this stuff in better ways than this capacity of language can that's where he says the city of god has profanely realized Now, what does he what does he mean profane? Well, there's the profane and there's the sacred. Well, what is the profane? The profane is the secular That's a synonym And so what for peterson is the city of god now? Okay jordan, how consistently are you using this language? I'm beginning to have my doubts, but I will I'm full of grace. I will forgive you I'm partly full of grace because I know how much I own mess up in these videos our testimonies to how many times I own Mess up so that's on page 24 of maps of meaning this on page 153 with a very interesting biblical quotation The hero is narrative right the hero is narrative representation of the individual eternally willing to take creative action Now i'm going to be preaching on jona this week and jona one and two and I am going to be Contrasting jona with a hero is the book of jona a hero story or not? And the answer might be interesting for some of you and if you listen to my rough draft for sunday this week, you'll You'll get some answers The hero is narrative representation of the individual eternally willing to take creative action endlessly capable of originating new behavioral patterns Eternally specialized to render harmless or possibly beneficial something previously threatening or unknown It is declarative. It is It is declarative representation of the pattern of behavior characteristic of the hero that eventually comes to approximate the story of the savior Behind every particular that is historical adventure explorer Creature revolutionary and peacemaker looks the image of the son of god another Now now he's using son of god and then then he's going to quote the quintessential son of man passage uh Now I am a believer in a literal age to come and I am a believer in the continuation of the ego and the person into the age to come translated and transformed And so perhaps what we will have in the city of god in the kingdom of god is that When we've been there 10 000 years bright shining of the sun we've known bright shining as the sun We've no less days to sing god's praise than when we first begun so maybe what one thing I will do in the age to come is Jordan peterson and I are going to have a long conversation about this book And jordan peterson will probably say Now am I putting jordan peterson in the save tribal camp? You can twist that around in the comment section if you like I'd have a long conversation about this book and peterson would probably say yeah I wrote it when I was young and I was trying to translate mythological language Phase one language into three phase three language, and it doesn't really work that well and Yeah, I think i'm understanding what peterson is doing with this book the Archetypic or ultimate example of the savior is the world redeemer the messiah Now again, the messiah is the messiah Now again given my training Giving my training in biblical studies. I can't look at these words with innocent eyes I can't look at these the definition of messiah without understanding how the gospels are the Are the record of jesus redefining of that word for his context for his people The archtypal or our ultimate example of the savior is the world redeemer the messiah world creating and world redeeming hero social revolutionary and great reconciliator It is the sum total of the activity of the messiah accumulated Excuse me accumulated over the course of time that constitutes culture The great father I can see why peterson spent Peterson spent spent agonized over every phrase in this book. The book itself is tortured The great father order itself explored territory the domain of the known In the meta stable society, however, the father Though healthy is subordinate to the son All fixed values necessarily remain subject to the pattern of being represented by the hero in the city of god this time capitalized What kind of editing did this book get I wonder I know it's being reformatted for kindle which I think will probably be a good thing In the city of god that is the archetypal human kingdom the messiah eternal eternally rules, okay Then he quotes daniel 7 now daniel 7 is a tremendously important passage Another thing that I want to do in the age to come maybe maybe they'll all seem dull to us by then But but get nt wright and jordan peterson to sit down and talk about daniel 7 Jordan peterson has spent his time as a psychologist and Nt wright has spent his time as a biblical theologian I saw on the night's the night visions and behold one like the son of man came and came with the clouds of heaven and came To the ancient of days and they brought him near before him And there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that the people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion Which shall not pass away and the kingdom that shall not be destroyed now pay attention to son of man there not son of god Jesus comes and jesus is son of man and son of god and if you ask people today what does son of man mean They will say something like well that means he's the son of a human being Son of Mary the otoko says the orthodox like to say yeah, i'm learning Now What's interesting about the daniel 7 passage is that this is a son of man and now we get into layers of interpretation because there's the the authorial content layer the author the Authorial intent layer of daniel 7 in which son of man describes him as a person but then there's the prophetic layer of daniel 7 where jesus then appropriates this term son of man probably because it had already been appropriated or at least the The rough draft of its appropriation was present in the culture that jesus was engaging In second temple judaism Where jesus identifies himself repeatedly as the son of man and does so as a veiled reference to mazaya And when people read the synoptic gospels matthew mark and luke and they say things like well jesus isn't representing himself as a divine figure I have to say then why on earth is he using son of man and why on earth is he doing that? Understanding full well What his audience that his audience would understand that phrase as in daniel 7 As in that this is the man that will bring in the kingdom that will bring in the kingdom of god that will bring In the city of god and this in its multitude of layers and textures Weaves together the meaning that is in the gospel of matthew mark and luke now john uses eternal life And paul uses in christ which we will talk about a little bit later, which will be very important for understanding jonathan peugeot's Little videos of trying to be the preacher Now This gets interesting because okay, so this is the language that peterson is using. All right city of god A little bit later. I'm going to play some from his easter message where he uses kingdom of god and this this synonym which is a Justifiable synonym is important So listen to peterson Talking about the tribal question about his belief in god with margaret hoover On firing line, which is pbs's attempt to not be quite so liberal Yes, kbie is my station. I'm going to start it at 15 18 18 William buckley who was the original host of the show was the Prominent television personality of the modern american conservative movement and hosted the show for 33 years one of his guests was billy graham And i'd like to show you a clip from one of those appearances and then get your response. Sure. Let's take a look Today we propose to focus on christianity specifically on the Okay. Now what's interesting here again is that? Is that if you go very early in my videos one of my Analogies of jordan peterson and the jordan peterson phenomenon has been billy graham and I have contrasted billy graham with jordan peterson Partly on the question of institutions now here's young william f buckley talking to young billy graham and Now 1969 is not 2018 in terms of Christendom 1969 is the height of Mainline christianity Or at least a little past the apex perhaps because the 60s doesn't really begin until 1965 ish It doesn't really get rolling until 1968 1969 and there we have the roots of the culture war there we have the beginnings of the breakdown of the Alignment of church and state in america in the cold war configuration Where not unlike the avengers? the united states Dwight david eisenhower whose mother was a fiercely religious woman read David brooks the road to character in the little chapter he does on eisenhower his mother is a fiercely religious woman And eisenhower is a nominal christian, but when we have to go to cold war With communism we inscript god to the degree that we print him on our money and we insert him in the pledge We draft god to fight a principality and power Of the neo-evangelicals Billy graham very much being one of the most prominent if not the most prominent leaders of that movement now i'm Presupposing a ton of church history that most of you probably don't know anything about sorry about that Jordan peterson does that to me with psychology all the time so It's at this moment that we begin to see the separation of the neo-evangelicals Of the neo-evangelicals not really begin but we we see the The current seeds of our of the religious right where the neo-evangelicals Differentiate themselves from the mainliners and this is the the the differentiation between god one and god two Where chuck colesum will have gone to church all his life in a mainline episcopal church But then through the influence of a number of individuals Find god and jesus to be very real to the degree that he will appropriate the language of a personal relationship with jesus And it's that appropriation that sam harris really covetous and it's this appropriation that evangelicals want To do a redux of charles colson here this is what the Now i always use the evangelicals and some of you who are evangelicals who embrace me Which is wonderful because this paul vanderkley an evangelical Depends what you mean by an evangelical do i believe in the bodily resurrection of jesus yes Do i believe in the apostle's creed in a very literal way yes do i expect the second coming of jesus christ yes So in that way i easily slide into the evangelical camp because according to the measures of Evangelical ism I qualify But my roots are with the dutch reformed And via john calvin we have our connection to the church fathers and so on and so forth so My roots are pre-evangelical and And so in a sense i take a step back from evangelicals And so in a sense i take a step back from evangelicals and i critique them and in some ways the christian reformed church is a It's not it's not mainline and it's not evangelical and in fact the current war going on within the christian reformed church is Whether it'll be mainline or evangelical I don't think the mainline is going to win because i don't think there's enough stuff in the mainline. There's enough strength in the mainline And and one way to understand peterson is And i'm going to get to this later if there's ever a later in this video because it's going to go on for hours At the rate i'm going Peterson is almost a redux of the mainline but not aligning with their culture war assumptions And that's why Peterson is a hot topic in the christian reformed church And this is why even people who have solid credentials in terms of crc left like sid helaman myself when we Don't criticize jordan peterson like the political left does Some on the crc left get very concerned Boy this gets complicated but also fun and interesting Anyway, so it's fascinating that margaret hoover and again now here's a thesis that I have That cat wants to be let out but the minute that cat is let out this dog and this cat will ruin my video So kitty you stay inside Cats are evil. I can see it in their eyes. I've just alienated all the cats lovers I don't believe cats are evil. I have one in my house right now, but i'm trying to get rid of it. Anybody want a cat? Anyway too much adhd I don't believe it Margaret Margaret hoover chooses buckley and Buckley and graham at one level because there's a facile association with peterson's Demuring on the god question in a literalistic tribalistic way But that level is connected to far deeper levels Because there are there are There are alignments and associations that continue to go down And that's what makes this conversation interesting and and so in a sense I suspect i'm not trying to take anything away from margaret hoover I doubt she has followed any of this as closely as I have But in but in a sense lining it up this way is I know all the unions out there will call it a synchronicity, which is Fine as a as a reformed christian. I'll call it providence Got to be careful about facile associations anyway For its decline I should like to begin by asking dr graham whether any scientific finding or Development during his lifetime has either strained his faith Or rendered it more difficult for him to preach the christian gospel I don't know if I can possibly do a better imitation of the monopoly man anyway Reverend graham Let us know what you think Let us know what you think No, I would rather say it has been the other way I know I talk like a southerner I have a smooth way of talking and right away you have the the lines of the culture war Following the lines of the civil war and the north and south Notice how often? well And now now now i'm channeling john mcwater who isn't dead, but I think that uh the scientific achievements of our generation Have tended to confirm the christian faith and I think that this is true and can be uh substantiated by statistics among Polls that have been taken place among scientists You know that 75 percent of all scientists that have ever lived live now And of the now pay attention here How do we know what is truth this is a very democratic approach to it that we're going to count up all the sciences Scientists and believe how many of them believe in god and how many don't This is the same justification for climate change that you know, what percentage of scientists believe in climate change now i'm not critiquing that evaluation i'm just noting it i'm noting how How this is so deep in our culture and so deep in our bones that truth is that which the majority embrace now again If you get into the culture war conversations Or what is a majority but a tyrant? Isn't democracy the tyranny of the majority and and aren't the court supposed to protect the minority and now we're getting into countless Countless you see there's layers to all of this stuff. You can't speak a word in your culture And not appropriate and not not express that which is deeply beneath it and Obviously what the job of clinical psychologist are is to try to expose some of these things that are beneath it but none of us have anywhere near as much time in our life to To expose these things which is why action Speaks louder than words that 75 percent about 60 percent say that they believe in a personal god And when you okay now when he says personal god now we are Outlining the boundary between the main line Religion and the evangelical religion because this is what this is what chuck colson does with his With his conversion from being nixon's hatchet man To becoming an evangelical christian who must tell the truth in the court even if it means he's going to go to jail Now if that doesn't sound like jordan peterson city of god quote what does We have scientists like dr. Elma ingstrom of rca and you have dr Wernher von braun and many of these scientists who are out teaching the christian faith This was not true when I started when I started The number of scientists believing in god at that time was estimated to be about 25 percent And I think many of the great scientific achievements have tended to confirm The fact of god in the minds of many scientists and lead many of them to a personal faith I want to ask you about your personal faith Now Now here's something interesting why lead off with this clip and again margaret hoover is doing something that I don't know if she knows what she's doing because boy, there's a lot of interesting ways you could ask peterson about that clip and I What does that clip have to do with this conversation at all unless margaret hoover very much wants to bring up william f buckley the the hallowed days of the of the Of the conservative elite where now the conservatives are no longer elite, but we don't even have conservatives that talk this way we have conservatives that are cute and blonde and and look like they come from from the fox news set and pbs is trying to not be so Trying to not be so So monolithic trying to be a little more pluralistic, so we'll give a A a cute blonde woman that looks like she's from the fox news set her own show on on pbs And we'll we'll have her talk to dr. Jordan peterson but what's fascinating about the juxtaposition of billy graham and peterson with respect to talking about scientists is that The tribe now you got to be careful here because the the the elites of the neo-evangelicals that occupy christianity today will not be anywhere near as I kind of classic against blue church evolution as well. Let's say the word fundamentalists will on the other side They all have their own in-house wars to fight, too Peterson's approach to science is I mean Peterson doesn't see science intention with the bible peterson sees peterson sees his science as Justification for the bible and that's responsible for for part of the big flip That's happening via jordan peterson and those who rejected the bible because Of evolution maybe not directly maybe not directly Of evolution maybe not directly maybe not personally maybe not self-consciously But that's what's been in the imaginary and this is exactly what peterson is flipping Peterson is saying I believe in the bible because of evolution and not in a simplistic concordistic Rehashment of genesis one, which is what we've normally seen but via peterson's Psychology and his study of piaget and his study of jung and Boy, this is complicated, but boy is it also fun. Okay jordan. Let's have your answer because I don't know Now let's let's again give a little bit of mercy and grace to jordan peterson here. He's on a set He's doing one interview after another like a madman Man and so He who who knows if he even heard anything that buckley and billy graham have said I I don't know how much jordan peterson knows about Billy graham when I asked him about c.s. Lewis. He said a christian apologist which meant he hasn't read anything about He hasn't read much of anything from c.s. Lewis and he probably knows next to nothing about billy graham and he probably Doesn't understand all of the interesting connections between billy graham and himself in some weird way This is just too much fun Christians who watch you have listened closely over the last two years about whether you self-identify as a christian or not And the national review has which was also the publication that william f buckley founded Has written about you the following That the effect is that the intellectual idol of millions of people is punting on the most important question in the world It is a question of literal metaphysical truth before this question of psychology peterson has said that This quote too is so interesting the most important question of the world The neo-evangelicals won the war Against william f buckley and won the war either that or became a coalition with them Where the religious the religious right? joined in with the elitist right in order to try to Hold off the ascendant The ascendant culture which was the culture that arose in the 60s and so whereas Chuck coles and chuck colson again epitomizes this transformation and carl rove and george w bush You know figured out how you can employ this and and donald trump continues to play from that book You know, I don't know if donald trump really cares about who sits on the courts, but as long as he keeps sending conservative justices to the courts evangelicals will vote for him and And christians on the right now. Let me say something here 48 percent of people who identify as christians in america Vote democratic. Okay. Now if you watch the news If you watch the mainstream media On both sides fox is part of it the other the alternative mainstream they they tend to Create some facile associations that I hear echoing in emails that I get from many of you I think the christian church is about as split as the country, okay? and This is part of what makes peterson such an interesting figure in this. So let's continue with liam warner's quote that he Behaves as if god exists, but he lectures as if he doesn't It would be helpful for his fans and himself if he addressed the heart of the west crisis and meaning god. Yes or no Peterson's gonna answer what he always answers But why does liam warner think that this is the heart of the crisis Is he an evangelical did billy graham win the day did william f buckley do the Do the two sides of of chuck colson have they come together have they integrated their Have they integrated their evangelical self? This is what's playing out in the intellectual dark web in terms of the conversation between peterson and And sam harris, but in some ways it's playing out on the other side Why not take on this question of the existence of god Take it on This is exactly what he's been talking about you watch the biblical lectures. This is all about the existence of god He just can't get to a short answer Which is exactly what he says he's not punting Because it's not something to reduce to a sound bite Fundamentally, but your lectures are two hours long. This is true But when you're talking about the most his lectures are the answer to the question We just don't understand what he's saying Important questions that people have ever asked and two hours isn't very long apparently people will watch them So I'm not I'm not prepared to I'm not prepared to say things in any other way than I've already said them You know there it isn't obvious what belief means People think that what they believe is what they say they believe. I don't believe that I believe that what people believe is what they act out and so I said I act as if God exists That's a sufficient statement as far as I'm concerned such a stubborn northern Canadian if you watch the If you watch chasing the dream my sister show that's my that's my brother-in-law there without his shirt on who's you know? fixing up the house with with whatever's handy he's from Brandon, Manitoba and And you know, I talked to Julie and Julian's from Manitoba and these these northern Canadians they're they're a piece of work and you know if you push them They're just gonna push back By their fruits you shall know them What's the old saying yeah, it's old because it's in the Bible and who says it Jesus, you know What's so funny about Peterson here is he's he's very careful about this game because he could have answered this question Well I'm dragging my very heavy cross up the up the very long hill to the city of God or the kingdom of God or the kingdom of heaven By your fruits, you shall know them. I'm quoting Jesus doesn't say quoting Jesus He says the very old saying now is this in Peterson's head or does he intentionally decide? Well, I'm not going to reference Jesus who actually gives this quote or I'm going to take it away from Jesus so as not to make it a religious quote because Because boys and girls we are still living in Christendom and The culture war is a Christendom civil war that every Muslim or person from another culture recognizes But we can't see it ourselves That secularism is a late stage Christianity that's what it is and that in many ways atheists are in denial and what Jordan Peterson is doing is Bringing this thing back around same idea Right. It's it's a matter of action and a matter of commitment it's not a matter of me parading out my my My explicit statements about a metaphysical reality that's virtually impossible to comprehend See again, he could have said well, let me quote Jesus By your fruits, you will know them and he could have said well pretty much every time Jesus the son of man and son of God uses all this language and maps of meaning Why won't he use it on this stage? Well, he's got his reasons and we're gonna get into those note of network in a little while Because it's all about language You Risk when you reduce and I'm not willing to do that and I'm not interested in providing people with easy answers including me so There's a question of whether you're working it out yourself, of course, and everyone who's honest is working it out themselves. None of us have Incontrovertible knowledge about what transcends our understanding, you know now now to To the unions out there who love to say We don't believe we know Did you hear what he just said? Because in this way Peterson and I are on the same page now you might say well Vanderkley Europe You're a Christian minister. Don't you believe? Yeah, do use the language of believe? Yeah, if she would ask you would you punt? No, would you sound more like Billy Graham? Probably Why is Peterson? Why is Peterson giving this answer in this way in this context That's very interesting No, like I certainly do think why I've learned things I've learned that the deeper I go into the biblical stories and into religious mythology in general cross-culturally The less I see any bottom you can go in it into it forever And and I've learned an immense amount doing that and is he saying that the Bible is inspiring? I think listen to his answer and think about this When you think about you know dig deeper below the words, okay So when you say well the Bible is inspired. Well, what do you mean by that? You mean that the the the the ultimate source of the Bible is from God. Okay. Well For a Christian isn't the ultimate source of the entire creation. We're in from God Yeah And isn't the fact that as we go in deeper and deeper into the Bible we're in from God And look at particle physics as you're going deeper and deeper into into the nature of matter. We discover that it just keeps going Yeah, well, why is that? Well, what why is it that that seems to happen when we go into the Bible? Well, what does it mean that that a book is inspired? What does it mean that the book is called the Word of God? And so again, you know, what is all this? How does all this language work and why do we choose the words and the language and why do we appropriate the Associations that we do in a particular context for a particular means towards a particular end Much of it has transformed my life. So and and I also believe that Much of it has transformed my life now again, you could Translate all of these words into evangelical language Well to quote Jesus by your fruits, you shall know them So I'm not so as I'm not as interested in words as I am indeed and to quote Jesus I'm not one jot or tittle will will disappear To quote Jimmy he could be he's quoting Jesus all throughout this thing. He's but but but not not Peterson he's using his This is this is the fruit of his theology this is his life's work This is what he's been doing all of his life now to what degree is this self-conscious? I mean if if we were to switch chairs and I were to become Jordan Peterson shrink I could turn around and say well, okay Jordan. Well, why are you choosing the words that you're using here? What what are you afraid of? What are you afraid of being associated with? Who are you afraid of being associated with? the The that the West is grounded on the metaphysical Presupposition that human beings have a spark of the divine in them and I don't think there's a Let's retranslate that line Well, the West is founded that human beings are made in the image of God in the Imago Dei He could have appropriated Christian language spark of the divine. Well Where is that coming from well it kind of comes from the Quakers well now you're into Quaker associations and True a way of saying that and I also believe that it's true Now what that means with regards to the ultimate metaphysical realities that that ground the entire world I I I dare not say because I don't know so I This is the Church of Jordan Peterson It really is and it's a it's a church of one I should look up that whatever Crazy name he gave to this church and they Peugeot and I are talking tomorrow We'll see what we talk about tend to try to say what I know and to leave the rest alone And and there's plenty I don't know and plenty I can't talk about So but I'm talking about what I can I'm not interested in joining a club All right, I'll sit in the therapist's chair again I say okay Jordan, what are you afraid of in terms of joining a club? Regardless of what the club is so Hmm, what are you afraid of in terms of joining a club regardless of what the club is Are you afraid of being accountable to other people? What are you afraid of in terms of joining a club regardless of what the club is Are you afraid of being accountable to other people? Well, that would very much make you a westerner I'm not going to make statements of reflecting a certainty that I don't have so I think you've got quite a bit of certainty But again, I think the the question is tribal language. What is your approach to truth? I try to My approach truth You know if you wouldn't do so if you wouldn't work so hard maybe you'd be a little bit more arrested for some of these Things now one of the things i'm picking up from peterson back when he did the lafayette interview When I read that when I watched that I was reading him. I thought He seems frustrated and angry and perhaps the setting is hostile. I totally misrepresented that because the questioner then chimed into my chimed into my Chimed into my my video on it and said no, i'm a huge fan And when in the conversation with david fuller people said well peterson is is angry with you I was like that doesn't matter if he's angry with me or not Peterson and I don't have a personal relationship. You know, we don't we don't even know each other but I think a lot of what happens here is this is this is peterson working hard and thinking hard Because she she is he is he is he is being very You don't when you interview someone this is exactly the kind of person you want to interview because he is going to try to Tell you the truth as best he can and he's going to work hard at the answer and this is exactly what he's doing here And I think at the end of it he'll say this is fun because this is how he is This is what a good conversation is this is free speech this goes down to the heart of who he is and what he is I try not to say things that make me weak Right and it's I didn't know this but you know, what does that mean? If you pay attention to what you say If and with and I mean pay attention to it if you pay attention to how the words make you feel then you can tell when you're saying something that Is founded on a rock and not on sand and that's what you should do Uh, uh You just quoted jesus again That means you have to pay attention to every word you say and so So and there's a rule here. The rule is something like this. You can plot your way through life You can plot and scheme your way through life. You can do what's expedient. Let's say instead of what's meaningful from 12 rules for life Or you can say what you believe to be true and you can take the consequences And that as far as i'm concerned, that's the fundamental call to responsibility Did you hear that do you remember what he just said to david fuller? There's the kingdom of god He's answering your questions. He's telling you exactly what he thinks. He's not using the language That certain communities use he's making up his own language. This is what peterson does But he just quoted jesus and he just basically gave you his definition of the kingdom of god Why are you afraid of being weak? Well, it's the weakness that I was referring to well, it's it's it's it's It's see and I think margaret hoover's question here Here And it's not a bad question but but you can hear these questions being heard by the different tribes because Now we're we're living in the age of trump This is trump is our principality and power. Okay? And and when someone says well trump is not my president. Well, he really is Well, I didn't vote for him. Well, whether or not you vote for him doesn't make him your president Why because you're still a citizen of this country and if you acted as if trump isn't your president You would probably have to leave the united states and renounce your citizen and try citizenship and try to become A citizen of whatever country you believe adequately reflects it and if in fact You play that out. That's exactly what people do in terms of their churches Which speaks deeply about our culture fear? It's essentially fear of hell If you make yourself Yeah, i'm listening now jordan i'm listening now it's fear of hell i'm beginning to understand your language Is he answering her question She would probably walk away from this interview and say he didn't really answer the question. He punted again He's not punting. He's talking peter sonian He's quoting jesus all along and he's saying what is weak weak is hell What is strength strength is heaven? Archetypal weak life is very hard If you make yourself weak and you suffer stupidly because of it You will become bitter And once you become bitter you will become vengeful and after vengeful there is no limit That's one of the things I learned from studying totalitarianism He's talking about hell Go back and listen to him in how many places when he talks about hell talks about literal hell Talks about totalitarian governments In in a strange way Peterson is continuing to fight the cold war and again if I would sit down i'm not a therapist i'm a pastor So i'm not going to sit in a therapist chair i'd say you know now jordan I know the area you I know the time that you grew up. I grew up in the same time When you were a young boy the world was fighting the cold war we we appropriated god just as the avengers appropriate thor To try and fight against the principalities and powers of the evil empire or the evil kingdom Okay, the evil empire is not what ronald reagan said Didn't ronald reagan on his his last speech given his president president talk about this shining city of the hill Well, all the doors open will trump close the doors We're still living in christendom boys and girls In the 20th century Because I studied it from the psychological perspective. I wasn't interested in the mass movements I was interested in the motivations of the cruelest oschwitz guard What was he up to or the or the person who went and shot up the the elementary school in connecticut? What was he up to exactly just exactly where did he dwell and why? It's like well weakness made him suffer Stupidly and that made him cruel and that was just the beginning and so That weakness that's just if you make yourself weak by engaging in deceit if you fail to take responsibility then you transform yourself into something that cannot bear to Endure the structure of existence and you will torture yourself And that leads to very bad places You can almost hear cs lewis's definition of hell if you read the great divorce right in that answer It's just in petersonian very bad places Um, you've said that you don't Now if peterson were to say well if you're a bad person you go to hell Well, that's common religion and many people would have understood it. This is petersonian He says things differently and didn't self-identify as a conservative as recently as five years ago But I think it's fair to say there are many on the left Who are fearful of you? And your message now and I wonder if you have a reflection on why that is Because they have every reason to be He's a call he's a social he's a culture warrior Why is he a culture warrior because the religious and the political are not that different? Don't say that vanderkley. Well, remember I'm a religious believer in a political skeptic. Oh, why do I say that? Because I have a great degree of skepticism about what the political will do And whether the political will usher in the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of god or the city of god now pay attention to peterson's Individualism why I'm not a fan of collectivists I'm not a fan of people who put group identity first I'm i'm not a fan of people who would dare to identify as marxists after what happened in the 20th century I'm not a fan of university professors who think their job is to take impressionable 18 year olds and turn them into political actors Now peterson puts on the prophetic mantle This despite the fact that they're not educated so The collectivists and I don't care whether they're on the left or the right by the way because i'm no fan of right-wing collectivists either So the right level of analysis is the individual and that's what the west got right So are you a political centrist? I'm not really political. That's the This is the funniest answer. Um Um Again, he's he's not lying. He's telling you the truth thing is that and what i've been doing We're talking about marxism and fascism and the left versus the right Yeah, and you talk about you're talking yin and yang and women and men and this sort of balance And daoism and buddhism and I wonder if well at some point the political political gets so out of hand that it's no longer political It's philosophical or theological but there's lots of places where the political level of analysis I can only use go back to and again note in the network. I guess this was at the an ein rand institute I can only use theological language when i'm talking to people about good and evil Why and again, we're going to get down to that video. This is the right one people who analyzed Deep people who analyzed what happened in the soviet union people like victor frank Of course, he concentrated more on nazi germany, but it doesn't matter and alexander solzhenitsyn noted that One of the reasons those societies could manifest themselves the way they did was because individual people were willing to lie about almost everything And they considered that the fundamental issue That it was the moral failings of each person at the level of the individual that was actually the cause Of the totalitarian catastrophe and that's not political So in other words the individual brings on Not the opposite of the kingdom of the kingdom of god or the city of god, which is hell It's the individual that brings on hell and the individual brings that on Via deceit and again peterson has said this over and over and over again. That's psychological or philosophical or theological It's not political. It's a matter of it's a matter of your relationship not only to your conscience But to your soul and we don't teach that properly and that's why i've addressed this as a psychologist And that's why i've addressed this as a psychologist I only got dragged into the political because my idiot government thought it was okay to put to demand a certain form of speech She liked that she liked that in the name of compassion and that was a no-go zone as far as I was concerned So i'll take responsibility for my words But and and i'm not willing to have someone Wave a moral flag and then tell me what I have to say. That's not happening Okay So Why lead off with william f buckley? and and billy graham Oh that has more resonance here than margaret hooper knows but again this gets back to what i'd said in a lot of my earlier videos in terms of What are we up here and we know this from the psychologist? What are we up here? We are and actually jonathan pacheau gets into this in his second Uh santa claus god video ontology video that You know, we are Our listeners are in here and they're giving us ideas and we don't know why we're putting forth these ideas We are not transparent to ourselves. We are not conscious of our motivations We are not conscious of what we are doing We are doing things that we're not aware of and peterson is doing that too and as peterson says again and again he's trying harder and harder and harder to be as As in control of himself as he can and if you talk to the the buddhists And and their meditation and what they're trying to do. There's an interesting there's an interesting tension in buddhism in terms of If you decide to get rid of your ego What is deciding to get rid of the ego Well, it's you Well, if you're trying to if you're trying to eliminate the illusion of their self You know think about this via decart if you're trying to get rid of the illusion of yourself Well, what what exactly is trying to do that? Well, isn't that you in other words if you actually achieve it? Isn't that in an ironic sense? the ultimate victory of the ego Because it wins Because there's something in you that decides you want to take on the project of eliminating the illusion the illusion of yourself So you don't get away from you you can't get away from you that was um That was decart's Insight, I think you don't have to finish the sentence Once you have an eye. Well, i'm going to get rid of the eye. I'm going to get rid of the eye Well, i'm going to try and not imagine there is an eye The eye's still there So billy graham comments about scientists sets up the american evangelical tribal individualism approach Billy graham is fighting a internal christendom civil war against the mainliners We're going to count the scientists. We're going to see how they identify truth is found in this democratic process We're going to try and get jordan peterson to self identify as a christian so he can be counted And he can be used in terms of this ongoing christendom civil war peterson won't play this game He doesn't see the need to play the game. He doesn't like the game now Just this morning. I read an email from someone who said peterson in part four Which I had covered before of the message Of his easter message talks about not the city of god, but the kingdom of god now remember these are synonymous These are synonymous for peterson and As I get into augustin and plato We'll get into We'll dig deeper into some of these ideas But listen to all of part four again now having heard his answer given to david fuller and see what you think The cross easter message one Abridged from wikipedia The ark of the covenant was a lidded gold-leafed wooden chest Containing the two stone tablets of the ten commandments The ark of the covenant was a lidded gold-leafed wooden chest Containing the two stone tablets of the ten commandments According to various texts within the hebrew bible it also contained eren's rod and a pot of manna God was said to have spoken with moses from between the two cherubim on the ark's cover The biblical account states that the ark was created a year after the israelite exodus from egypt thereafter the gold-plated acacia chest was carried by its staves while en route by the leviates in advance of the people When on the march towards the promised land or at the head of the israelite army In transport the ark was concealed under a large veil made of skins and blue cloth Carefully hidden even from the eyes of the priests and the leviates who carried it When at rest a portable building the tabernacle meaning residence or dwelling place was set up to house the ark It was built of woven layers of curtains along with 48 boards clad with polished gold standing like vertical blinds Solomon's temple in Jerusalem Superceded it as the dwelling place of god some 300 years later Commentary There has to be a bridge between the finite and the infinite There has to be a place where the ephemeral meets the eternal There has to be a bridge between the knowable and the unknowable And there has to be bedrock at the foundation The ark which is the portal to god is to be carried on the shoulders of those who are holy So the portal to god what does the ark create what does the ark represent What does israel become with the presence of god Dwelling in its midst now if you read the book of exodus and you read the last chapters of the book of revelation One of the things I went through exodus in my sunday school class a number of years ago I spent 75 weeks on the book of exodus why on the book of revelation why The book of revelation in some ways like a good conclusion for a book ties so much of the bible together now You might look at that and say well. That's a horrible book to do that because the book is the book is so mythological Well why does the book of revelation do that and why does the book of revelation do that so well well Revelation has a lot of exodus in it Because it's it's Representing Exodus is a first draft of the city of god To touch the ark is to risk death Why isn't it to be touched well go into a museum and what can't you do in that museum you can't touch the paintings You can't touch the artwork. Why not? What does not touching? Create in our community it creates the sacred it communicates the sacred when a child goes into the museum And reaches out his hand That's the most natural thing in the world for that child to do is to touch the painting and his mother will slap the child's Hand down don't touch the sacred has been built into it Sam Harris There are holy things that cannot be touched except at mortal risk Except at mortal risk Think that through those things that cannot be touched are at the very foundation of the community Those things that cannot be touched are at the very foundation of the community again slow it down Think it through why is that you don't have a community without the sacred? The ark must be placed at the center of the temple The temple or the tabernacle just go to your study Bible if you can find one and look at a map of You can see it see it represented in picture Israel is camped around the ark the ark leads it why? What is axiomatic The people following the ark have determined to journey together toward the eternal promised land Now again if I In the age to come I'm gonna study art history Because look at I'm not gonna keep the cursor open look at this person look at how they're dressed Why are they dressed like this well they're not you know, we're not looking at the Exodus around let's say 1200 BC look at how they're dressed look at how he's dressed. Well, this is the Well, what is this why is it represented this way The city arranged properly around the ark of the Covenant is eternal Jerusalem There's a city of God Something must be axiomatic or everything shakes and falls You cannot have a community without which without that which is axiomatic Think club. I just watched their video on and Peterson and Sam Harris or Peterson and rationality rules dude and What's axiomatic for the celebrity atheists? Reason Rationality Materialism you cannot have a community without that which is axiomatic The axiomatic cannot be expressed fully in words instinct There's a difference between Peterson and Harris the axiomatic cannot be expressed fully in words now We're gonna have to get into this Jordan with respect to your behaviors The axiomatic untouchable and unshakable is what makes communication in words possible You can't talk unless you have the axiomatic well why well what is language dependent on language is dependent on community We've already asserted you can't have community without the axiomatic. So there must be something deep down below us If we're actually to be able to communicate with each other at all The axiomatic is a spirit a process The go quiz process theology well God has process Yes, and no a living force Its manifestations, however are concrete that is the transformation of the spirit into matter So what do people do why are our actions The best teller of that which is axiomatic in us because it's by way of our actions Do we incarnate the axiom? That is the generation of the tablets of stone The Ark of the Covenant contains the rules that are derived in the first order from the axiomatic principle That principle is the spirit that made the rules manifest The rules manifest that spirit is the ultimate inhabitant of the Ark and the rules the result of its action That spirit is the creative logos The Ark of the Covenant and the temple are replaced by the Cathedral at the center of the community the Cathedral is Now we're talking a medieval town here where the Cathedral is the center of the community and it's the cross Of course the middle II the the Medieval's Acted this out the cross in architectural form The cross is where the transformation takes place The transformation is the incorporation of the body of Christ So what is the town Well the town is the city of God God is the principal and the Principality is the town Textual form the cross is where the transformation takes place The transformation is the incorporation of the body of Christ That incorporation is a dramatic ritual So when Margaret Hoover asks him why won't you tell us what you believe he says I act it out Christ is he who transcends death by voluntarily accepting death Christ Isn't this his comment about the city of God? He says I act it out He says I act it out Accepting death Crate Isn't this his comment about the city on the hill? He who rejects the kingdoms of this world for the kingdom of God Isn't this why Peterson says he's not political Christ is he who speaks the truth that creates the habitable order that is good From the chaos of potential that exists prior to the materialization of reality Christ is he who wields potential as the sword that cleaves death Christ is he whose radical acceptance of the conditions of life defeats the hatred bitterness and Vengefulness that the tragedy and malevolence that taints being otherwise produces He defeats hell That's those are the definitions of hell he used in the Hoover interview Without the acceptance of death bitterness rules This is exactly what he said in the Hoover interview. Hello hummingbird and hell triumphs That's the totalitarian system where hell triumphs christ is the potential of man and woman It is said that man and woman alike are made in the image of god And that god is he who uses the eternal logo to represent the world God is he who uses the eternal logos to generate habitable order from the chaos of potential this is the If you listen to what he's saying here, isn't he saying christ reigns Isn't he saying jesus is lord? Isn't he saying that this jesus has the power? Well, how does this jesus manifest his power axiom? This is the diamond at the center of the world This is the spirit in the arc that is untouchable This is the bedrock of the culture that brings peace and prosperity and that respects the dignity of man Isn't this our culture? Isn't this our culture? He is trying to save. This is the great truth This is the responsibility whose acceptance allows each of us to live despite the catastrophic fragility of our limited being Our likeness to god gives each of us a value that transcends the finite There's the imago dei Individual and society alike are charged with the ethical demand to respect that value This is not only the presumption that grounds the idea of the rights of man It is the presumption that lays upon each of us the ultimate responsibility That is the inevitable corollary of those rights We must Face the chaos of the future Employ the logos of which you are apart Now he's turning preacher to transform that chaos into the habitable order that is good Speak the truth embody the truth Onward christian soldiers marching unto war with the cross of jesus going on before Except impossibly the limitations that make being possible Dispense in that manner with resentment Hatred and the desire for infinite and unbounded vengeance and all the cruelty and evil that accompanies it That's hell remember remember the hoover interview pick up the cross of your tragedy and betrayal Tragedy and betrayal accept its terrible weight Hoist it onto your shoulders and struggle impossibly upward toward the kingdom of god on the hill Really up Hoist it onto your shoulders and struggle impossibly upward toward the kingdom of god on the hill Except its terrible weight Hoist it onto your shoulders and struggle impossibly upward toward the kingdom of god on the hill And accept its terrible weight Hoist it onto your shoulders and struggle impossibly upward toward the kingdom of god on the hill He is acting out his gospel. This is what he's doing. He keeps telling us exactly what he's doing. The alternative is death and hell. Part five. There it is. There it is. This is what he said to David Fuller. You stumble uphill with your burden towards the city of God. That's the story. What does that mean, the city of God to you? I would say that everyone bears maximal responsibility and speaks the truth. That's what it is. And what's the responsibility? You're responsible for the suffering in the world. You're responsible for the malevolence in the world. You're responsible for the veracity of your utterances. In the city of God, you're maximally responsible for the suffering. You're finally maximally responsible for the malevolence and you speak the truth. That's what it is. What do Peterson's actions say? Contemporary cultic behaviors don't matter. This is where he and Billy Graham would not agree. Ancient cultic behaviors were the axiomatic foundations of the society. This is where you can get into Jamie Smith. Jamie Smith is a professor of philosophy at Calvin College. Just wrote another book. He's been doing a series of books. He talks a lot about cultural liturgies. What do our cultural liturgies suggest to us about what we believe and who we are? I'm going to pause the video because I want to pull up a... So I just pulled up an article from the Christian Century. Now the Christian Century, for those of you who don't know the different tribal elements of the church world, Christian Century is a mainline organ. And you can see right away, can we talk about guns? A conversational guide to the editors of Christian Century. And by your fruit, you will know them. And so they want to talk about gun control. Well, here in the Christian Century, Jason Michelli, who was a pastor in a Washington, D.C., in a church in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., writes really a very penetrating review. I think of Jamie Smith's newest book, Awaiting the King. And Jamie Smith has made a name for himself by talking about cultural liturgies. And what he's saying is that, you know, we act out that which we believe. Now Jamie Smith, if you follow him on Twitter, not a Peterson fan. I've got my own interesting history with Jamie Smith on Twitter. Jamie Smith is part of my tribe, and he's got quite a bit more status in my tribe than I do. But I won't turn this into a critique of Jamie Smith. Smith does a lot of good work. He's dealing with he's dealing with how our us, how our us and John Howard Yoder. And that's the Anabaptist wing of the church versus the Kiperian wing, which is the tribe, the sub tribe that I belong. He's talking about how our of us is resident aliens versus Jamie Smith's now Awaiting the King. Basically the heart of this interview is that we are formed. Christians come to the church formed by secular liturgies. Okay, full disclosure, I'm a card carrying how our mafia moved by his vision of the church forming Christians into a contrast community. But I'm also sufficiently appreciative of Smith's work to concede a point that he doesn't make explicit, but that it necessarily falls from his work. We, the church, are not anywhere near sufficiently forming Christians to achieve either Kiper's or how our of us's vision for public theology. We're playing chaplain and cheerleader to people whose faith is being formed elsewhere shaped by one another who just might be the enemy. Now, Peter's, why do I spend more time talking about Peterson than Jamie Smith? Because I, oh, the dog. Hang on. Jamie Smith. Jamie Smith is addressing the church. Jamie Smith is facilitating a conversation within the church about our formation. Peterson is not living in the church. Peterson is not addressing the church, even though a lot of us in the church are listening. I don't find Jamie Smith breadpilling a lot of unbelievers. It's not a knock. Most preachers preach to the choir. We preach within the church. It's not a knock. Jesus came to the Jews. I think the reason I'm paying more attention to Jordan Peterson than Jamie Smith is I think Jordan Peterson is actually doing more. I got into this thing because it began to dawn on me that it may very well be possible that Jordan Peterson is the most effective evangelist of our age. It's a heck of a thing for someone who doesn't associate with the church. Now, I say that with the church, but I'm not saying that it's not a good thing. Now, I say that with a degree of trepidation because within our culture, there's a consistent belief that the church is unnecessary. And I don't share that belief or I wouldn't be a minister in it. We also have a belief that the church is post-christendom, that the cathedral is no longer sitting at the center of the culture. And that's true. The question is what does sit at the center of the culture? What happened in the wake of the Reformation when perhaps what happened in the Reformation was that the church was finally displaced from the center of the culture and in the piece of Augsburg where the faith of the prince dictated the faith of the community. That of course led up to the bloody wars, post-Reformation wars, which then set up of course Thomas Jefferson and John Locke and the belief in a secular, non-religious society, which is what we're in. And in a sense, Sam Harris and others are asking for the complete elimination of the religious, which in my opinion is simply laughable because all you do it is push it beneath the surface, which makes it no mystery why of all people, of all professions, a psychologist comes along and says, maybe you should look under the hood. Maybe you should ask yourself what's really going on down deep below the surface. Maybe you might want to talk about that. Maybe you might want to find some language that addresses that. Well, what kind of language may we be able to use to address that? And again, Peterson in the four, he was in there with Rubin and two other guys, and Peterson says, I find when I'm talking to patients, I need to use theological language. And this is exactly what Sam Harris is trying to exercise from our community, theological language. He wants theological language to be a no-go zone. Margaret Hoover basically puts on William F. Buckley and Billy Graham and says, come on, Peterson use theological language and he says, I won't do it here. Why not? Did he make the right decision? Probably because here's the irony. She's not having preachers on her program. Well, she may get Tim Keller. He's reached that kind of status, but, or maybe Rick Warren. Remember the drama? If you don't know it, look it up. Barack Obama had Rick Warren pray at his first inauguration. In his second inauguration, Giglio, I think that's how you say his name, who was not sufficiently woke on same-sex marriage, was deplatformed, was disinvited from Obama's second inaugural. It's a minor point, but church people saw it. Church people are paying attention to these things. Why? Well, Peterson says, well, it depends on how you act. Well, here's the thing about the medieval village. Everyone acted with respect to the symbols. That's what made it religious. You say, well, I'm not going to I'm only going to use this religious language in certain contexts. Okay. Contemporary cultic behaviors don't matter, but ancient cultic behaviors were the axiomatic foundation or expression of the belief of the community. Preachers are liars. I already did a video on that. Yes, we are. We're also thieves. And I'm looking to rob Jordan Peterson blind. Preachers are liars. What game was Billy Graham playing? He was playing a game of inside Christendom culture war, trying to take people who were sufficiently illuminated by God number one and open them up to God number two. That's what Billy Graham was doing in 1969. What game does answering the believe in God question play? Peterson is playing a different game. He is trying to promote God one and saying, I'll leave to God number two out of it for now. I'll be an open agnostic on God aspect two. Now, a new Facebook friend since the the dawning of my Jordan Peterson video career I won't he doesn't use his name here. I won't dox him. He might come into the comment section. Node in the network he has a little as a little YouTube channel. God bless his little YouTube channel because he's he's doing exactly what I'm doing in terms of working through the Peterson stuff and he's doing his homework and he's he's digging out the roots and he's finding Northrop Frye all over the place in terms of Jordan Peterson and it makes perfect sense. And so he did a response video to myself and Andrew Sweeney's conversation and before that he had a missing link video where he goes into more details and it's I'll put the I'll put the channel in the comments if I remember. If not you know you're probably listening to this go ahead and dox yourself and out yourself if you want because you're doing good work. Because basically what what he says is that well Peterson is getting this stuff from Northrop Frye who gets it from Vico which is not without its critics if you look at reviews of of Frye's book that are still on the web. But what he's saying is that there are we've had different again this is another schema to what degree does it correlate or reflect the truth but there we use different languages to articulate different things and and we're in a third stage language which is which is a concrete level. Now what's interesting is that there's associations between these languages and psychological development too. So so in some weird way Peterson is able to bring Northrop Frye and Piaget into the same conversation and Maps of Meaning is what you know if Maps of Meaning is the love child between Northrop Frye and Jean Piaget. Don't get too literal with that one but this is what Peterson's doing this is what he's been doing his whole life he's trying to put his world together. This is what we're doing we're trying to put our worlds together and so you can't not talk about God and in that Margaret Hoover is right you can't not talk about God. Why? God aspect one you're always relating to God. Well what do you mean by God? God aspect one Christians say regularly there's no escaping God whether you think he is watching or not. When you read in the Old Testament the fool says in his heart there is no God. They're not an atheist they're saying God doesn't see God doesn't see us when we're doing these things. No one will hold us accountable. The city of the city on the hill when I when I first listened to this from Peterson I thought yeah we go up the city of the hill for judgment day where we have to take maximum responsibility for everything that we've done. You can't come up with a better analog for judgment day and you can find this in Chick Tracks and only you evangelicals out know out there know what Chick Tracks are and if you want to look up Chick Tracks just go ahead and google them. There are all these little cartoon tracks that have been given out by evangelicals for the last 30 40 years and yeah just go ahead and look up Chick Tracks you can find them on the web a little funny little corner of evangelicalism but you know Chick Tracks major in judgment day where there's the big screen and there's the glowy dude on the throne and there's all the people and all of the things of our lives are exposed. You can find this in the little baptisty church that you grew up with and this is judgment day this was Peterson says the city on the hill and so when I heard this I thought yeah we go up to the hill and this is Peter Kreif's Between Heaven and Hell. I get the title correct this time where you've got C.S. Lewis, John F. Kennedy and Aldous Huxley and they're in a moment is it purgatory they're in a moment between see this is why I keep saying between earth and heaven I'm not a universalist but between heaven and hell because John F. Kennedy who is embodying nominal Catholicism modernistic mainline Christianity the mainlinist version of Catholicism from the 60s Aldous Huxley that is that is that is representing the community that has appropriated Eastern thought and secularized it in order to apply it to America because if you take Buddhism out of China or Japan and or Tibet and you bring it to America it is a different thing and Orthodox Christianity as Lewis continues to try to repristinate Christianity and explain it to an audience and go ahead and and read Lewis's reflection on the years that he tried being a lay preacher to RAF pilots who were battling who were who were waging the battle for Britain in the air. We're not that far from 1963 the year I was born and the year that Lewis and Kennedy and Huxley died. We're just half of an old man I guess that's me. Christians say there is no you there's no escaping God and this is what Peterson is we we thought God could be disposed of but here comes Jordan Peterson and no no if you look at Matthew 11 and Jesus is asked about John the Baptist so so Jonathan Pizzo says Peterson is Cyrus. I think Peterson is more John the Baptist. Peterson is really a John the Baptist well who is Jesus well Jesus is Jesus for Pete's sake. I just saw oh it was it was the White Horse Inn article written by Truman Carl Truman I think writes for First Things quite a bit good writer good thinker. Is Peterson a sign of the end times? Well if you're a Christian we've been living in the end time since the resurrection of Jesus but there's a John the Baptist quality to Peterson and and if you look at what Jesus says about John the Baptist in Matthew 11 and it's interesting that my take on John the Baptist is John the Baptist never really quite got Jesus but but there's but then Jesus reflects on himself and how how poorly he's received and and this is this is Peterson he's he's too religious for Sam Harris but he's not religious enough for the church or the Christian community. This is interesting this is so interesting. Does the cultic matter to God to Sam Harris? Yeah. Jordan Peterson we want you to say I believe in God. I believe in the Bible. I believe the Bible is the inspired word of God. Jordan Peterson won't you please say it? Jordan Peterson says no I won't. We keep going around the triangle. You can find that in my video on the office. He keeps Peterson keeps teasing us he's not he keeps Peterson keeps teasing us he's not teasing us he's not playing with us he's telling us the truth. Peterson's working this stuff out and so evangelicals will he join our tribe? Will he will he and the Catholics will he become Roman Catholic and the Orthodox? He's already Orthodox and he doesn't know it. Fun fun fun. Here's the craziest thing I think probably the most telling thing about Peterson's answer in the in the in the rebel wisdom video that um Peterson in a sense on the top of the hill expresses judgment day but there is no grace. Now this gets into a lot of really long running deep conversations about the meaning of the cross. If you take responsibility for the benevolence that you've dealt out in the world is that sufficient? What does it mean to take responsibility? In a way Peterson is talking purgatory. Well what does that mean? Well purgatory in in medieval Roman Catholic theology is the place where you finally pay for your sins. Now as CS Lewis will will remind 20th century Christians everyone who goes to purgatory eventually gets to heaven. What a church historian will remind is that the entire indulgence business was set up and that's what Luther attacks and the Protestants take out purgatory because it's not found in scripture and the purgatory lingers because we don't really know how we get from sinful human being who not only is responsible for the benevolence in the world but God calls us to account and in the Protestant Reformation we say it was at the cross that that accounting gets done and so in many ways what the Reformation is is another chapter in the ongoing conversations about medieval theology. Reformation is late medievalism just like secularism is late Christendom. Now it's imagined by Sam Harris and others that secularism will simply yield the Star Trek universe where there's no getting rid of Christianity there's no exercising this demon Sam and Jordan Peterson is the expression of that. There's no getting away from it there's no there's no leaving mythology and stepping out into pure science and Thomas Nagel is more right than you are I believe. Your life is the answer to the God question. Oh my battery's running low I'm not plugged in outside I gotta wrap this up. Your life is the answer to the God question. How confident are you in your answer? The Sermon on the Mount suggests you'd better make a sober assessment of yourself and your biases make you an illegitimate just judge of yourself. All the children of Lake Wobegon are above average. The church following Bill Hybel's recent standal gets reminded of its insufficiencies and I'm keeping my eyes on the sorting yourself out guy and I saw his travails and I watch him and I think I've had how many conversations with individuals as a pastor who struggle with exactly what he struggled. The city of the city of God is judgment day and Jordan Peterson is Israel he's a wrestler with God and Jesus is Israel and that's the point of the gospel of Matthew that Jesus is Israel and just as Jesus Israel lives its cruciform life Jesus lives the cruciform life and completes and fulfills it. What we're looking at are the boundaries of the principality. I can't believe I'm running out of battery. We're looking at the boundaries of the principalities and the city of God it's not Augustine will have the city of God versus the city of man well what does that mean? Who is the principality? And Augustine will say the city of God. God is the principality. Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven or will enter the city of God but only the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven. It's actions right? Who does the will? Many will say to me on that day what day? Judgment day. The day when you're at the top of the hill. The day when you are called to account. The day when you are asked to make a record of all the malevolence you are responsible for. Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles yet I will tell them plainly I never knew you away from me you evildoer. The crazy thing about Jesus in many of these stories is that it is in fact his association with us that is the final determiner. This gets played in many different ways in the gospels and I'm running out of battery and I can't go into it. Ah therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice like the wise man who builds his house on the rock the rain came down the streams now I have no idea how this video is going to turn out because I did lose power and we'll see if windows adequately managed the task and I didn't lose the file which I really hope not. I've got my mic sitting on the computer and I'm um yeah it's a mess take maximum responsibility for it. So basically the end of the sermon on the mount Peter and Pajot talks about boundaries of principalities and when Pajot was talking about the being of the tribe of Judah or the tribe of of Reuben well this is what I what I wanted to maybe I'll mention it tomorrow the principality is in Christ Christ is the prince I mean all this language connects all this stuff ties in together. Ah there we are so that's the end of the video two hours probably way too long um yeah let me know what you think.
