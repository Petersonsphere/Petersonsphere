 Hi, this is Paul. I just got back from vacation. Don't know that I'll have any more fresh videos this week We'll see if I have time this week to to do a couple of videos I've got some things rolling around in my head, but tomorrow night in Oakland, California I am going to be doing a new presentation on CS Lewis and Jordan Peterson. It will be recorded I'm doing it with the CS Lewis Society of California and they have they meet twice a month for book discussions and film discussions And so this month we're going to be talking about Jordan Peterson 12 rules for life So I'll be giving about a 40 minute presentation and then there'll be time for discussion So that's June 5 and then two weeks from tomorrow. I'll be doing it again. It'll be a different presentation, but the same topic I'll be talking about 12 rules for life and because it's the CS Lewis Society I'll be I'll be weaving CS Lewis in and out of 12 rules for life So should be an interesting evening 730 there's a $10 suggested donation simply to Offset the cost of the food if you're coming there's an eventbrite link that's down below let them know that you're coming so they can kind of figure out how many people to plan for and If you're in the Bay Area, I hope to be able to see you and again June 5 and the second time at June 19 Different talks at both so you can plan on coming to talk to both talks if you're in the Bay Area
