 Hi, this is Paul. About a week and a half ago, I gave a speech about Jordan Peterson and Screwtape Letters a bit at the CS Lewis Society of California in Oakland, California. And so this coming Wednesday night, I'll be leading that discussion again. It'll be in Oakland. The details will be down here in the notes. Also, the Jordan Peterson Sacramento Meetup is helping start a new meetup in Nevada City, which is northeast of us, closer to the Nevada border, close to Lake Tahoe. So if you're in, let's say, the Reno Sparks area or in Nevada near the California border up here in the north end, come on down. We'll be meeting in the library in Nevada City. Directions will be on the Meetup page. I'll have a link to the Meetup page. Love to see you. The Meetup will be from 3 to 5 this coming Sunday. And then we'll probably go out to eat or something afterwards and continue the conversation. So hope to be able to see you at either events.
