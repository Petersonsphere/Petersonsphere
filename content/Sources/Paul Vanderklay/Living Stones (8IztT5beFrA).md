 Uh Disδή, I would like to speak with you. Your daughter's on the line there, Carol. Alright. This past week we had, or was it this last week? A week ago we had Halloween. One of the interesting things happening with... I'll make sure I... One of the interesting things happening with Halloween and Halloween after that is that it was introduced to the service of the town houses. And when I was in Galveston, I was listening to the government, it was kind of Christian-oriented. The town houses are looking to try to, in some ways, introduce help. And then there's an early telephone message in their presentation. This out in our line, that's their health house tip. And you can have gay, lesbian, suicide scenes packaged, there's cyberjigs, both the media scenes packaged. There's the rape, abuse scene packaged. Third house scene packaged, fourth house scene packaged. Post-birth, abortion scene packaged. And on and on and on. And apparently churches do this to tear kids into the gospel. Other Christians have kind of said, I don't know if this is really the best way to go about ministry. And I agree with them. But there's a lot of polarization actually about how, even in the church. On one hand, there's groups like this who are saying, the job of the church is to make hell as vivid as possible. So that people will want to be fucked and they don't go there. And there are a lot of other places in the church that are skeptical about hell and wealth. Here in this little part of the room, there's a lot of sex on the tab. If that isn't true, I will go to hell and I will be in the physical material, resurrection, the body of Jesus. And the Father says, hell is just hell. There's actually a lot of polarization with respect to God. Most Americans, as I mentioned before, are moralistic, they're the guillotines. And what that would mean is they believe that there's a God who exists in this race and race order. That God wants people to be good and nice. That's the center of all the light, to be happy and to feel good about yourself. God has not prepared me far of your life unless I have a problem and then maybe I'm getting out of my straights. And good people go to heaven when they die. And of course, good people are the people that think like me and I like to go on my side. And bad people are people like Hitler and Stalin and I would really like to die. And so what this has kind of produced in a lot of churches is a lot of numbness about power. We try to avoid it. We don't want to talk about it. But if I want to take the Bible seriously, it's something that you simply have to figure out where it fits in. I see a lot of music that looks at ridiculous images, or sighted. But we don't, I remember reading some Evan Delacan material years ago where the illustration was they say that your toddler, you're trying to get your toddler to do no feel, but you tell your toddler, do you think it makes Jesus happy when you don't eat your cookie or your tea? You don't want to make Jesus sad. And it's like, you're putting this on your toddler when he eats his own meal? How can we find some perspective in any of this? Miroslav Volk, who was from, who endured the Yugoslav Civil War, eventually came onto the faculty at Yale and wrote an amazing book called Exclusion and Embrace. And this is the core of what he said in the book. My thesis is that the practice of nonviolence requires a belief in divine vengeance will be unpopular with main Christians, especially theologians in the West. To the person who is inclined to dismiss it, I suggest imagining you are delivering a lecture in a war zone, which is where the paper that underlies this chapter was originally delivered. Among your listeners are people whose cities and villages have been first plundered, then burned, then leveled to the ground, whose daughters and sisters have been raped, whose fathers and brothers have had their throats slit. I would imagine that any of you who heard this would not be so quick to put together an awful house about war. The topic of the lecture, A Christian Attitude to Violence, the thesis, we should not retaliate since God's perfect non-coercive looks, since God is perfect non-coercive looks. Soon you would discover that it takes the quiet of a suburban home for the birth of the thesis that human nonviolence corresponds to God's refusal to judge. In a scorched land soaked in blood of the innocent, it will invariably die. As one watches it die, one would do well to reflect about many of other present captivities of the liberal mind. His point is, it's pretty much in places where life is easy, things are secure, and everything is under control that we imagine. God shouldn't be upset about what goes on in the world. God shouldn't judge our people. And when we get to the passage we're dealing with today, which is God browning Pharaoh and his army, how dare God act this way? Or how dare we imagine the stories in which God will? Let's look at it once more. If you've been following along, we've been working our way through the book of Exodus, and last week, at the last play, is the forgetful of the first four. Pharaoh has finally released Israel. Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and the Enlightenment and said, Get out from among your people, both you and the Israelites. Go serve the Lord as you have requested. Also take your flocks and your herds, just as you have requested, and leave. And then this family comment of Moses and Aaron, which is enormously interesting, and blessed me too. In his moment of grief, at the heart of what has happened in his land, Pharaoh in that moment wants Moses and Aaron again to intercede under the act. But as we've seen throughout the story, that Pharaoh, who will, under the pressure of the moment, buckle, later when things calm down, will tend to have a second thought. Now what's interesting is that, if you read chapter 13 and chapter 14 of that, the Lord is very specific. And he and Moses get together and God says, Look, if you take Israel out of Egypt and you borrow the coastal road, which would be the main road for Egypt over into Palestine where they're headed, they'll encounter the listens, a lot of scholars debate whether that's what they would do with that. But they also noted there are many prediction fortresses along this way. This was basically the main route. And so the Lord says to Moses, We're going to take them another way. We're going to take them to the southern route. And then again there's a lot of debate. We're here, we're going to get crossed on the block. But the point is, God with a fiery power about clouds by night and a dark cloud by day, He leads the people out. And where does He lead them? Whether He leads them to the distance of the Red Sea or the distance of the Red Sea or the length of the waves of the clean, again there's a lot of scholars debate all this. The point is, there's plenty of room for a landmass to get out. And God leads the people right to the words of the book of Exodus, to the reeds. God leads them right there and directs them to A and M. And He does it on purpose. When it was reported to the King of Egypt that the people had fled, the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people. And the King and his servants said, What in the world have we done? Who have released the people of Israel from serving us? And he prepared his chariots and took his army with him, and he took 600 selected chariots and all of the rest of the chariots of Egypt and the officers on all of them. So again what we see is Pharaoh still, after all the template, after all of the drama that has gone on, after all of the foot-puffing, after all of everything that has passed, Pharaoh still won't let them go. And he still demands that the Hebrews stay and serve him. And again, rather than us, as we often do with these texts, imagine, we get the bad guys and the good guys. And part of the focus on this text is to again remind us what human nature is like. This is what we do and how we are. The Egyptians chased after them and all of the horses and the chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his army overtook them, handing by the sea. When Pharaoh got closer, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified. The Israelites cried out to the Lord, and they said to Moses, Is it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the desert? What in the world have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? Isn't this what we told you in Egypt? Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians, because it is better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert. If you recall what they told Moses when Pharaoh first told them, Brish without straw. And this refrain we will hear again and again in the desert wanderings. And again, part of the point is, Pharaoh and the people are on the same page. They would rather the Lord not lump me with their world. Now if they see, well, maybe I can have a chance at a life I'll go with it, but when it looks, friend, I'm ready to hop on the other side and incide with Pharaoh and be with him in this. Moses said to the people, Do not fear. Stand firm and see the salvation of the Lord, and he will provide for you today. For the Egyptians that you see today will never ever, you will never ever see again. The Lord will fight for you, and you can be still. This is actually one of my favorite passages of the Bible, because you've got Pharaoh coming in on one side, and he's got the main sea over on the other side. We've got interlinks in the middle saying, We give up! We give up! We give up! We give up! We give up! Lord, why did you leave us alone? And the Lord says to Moses, Tell the people, be still. And you will see your God's salvation. You will never again be played by Pharaoh. And as for you, then the Lord will fight for you, and you can be still. Then the Lord said to Moses, and I love this part too, Why do you cry out to me? In other words, you've got Moses acting in between, and it seems like Moses is almost as faithless as the people. And he just wants to stand there, and the Lord says, You're Moses, you're with me. You're going to act on my behalf. You have a heart to fight. And again, this is incredible, because it isn't the case that God just does this, and Moses watches with them. The Lord says, I engineered this entire thing. I brought you to the foot of the sea. I brought the people of Israel here. I knew what he could do with you. I mean, after the whole story, that's not amazing. Now Moses, you have a part to play in this. And I want you to play it, because I want the people to see you in this life, and I want you to see yourself in this life. You are part of this recipe. Tell the Israelites to move on. And as for you, lift up your staff and extend your hand towards the sea and divide it, so that the Israelites may go through the middle of the sea on dry ground. And as for me, I am going to harden the hearts of the Egyptians so they will come after them, that I may be honored because of Pharaoh and his army and his chariots and his horsemen. The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord, when I have gained my honor, because of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen. Now it's interesting to pause at this moment to ask the question, well, why would God do this? Why would he bring them to the sea? We know what he thinks he just would do. Part of it is, we know what Egypt will do. Will Israel ever be safe from Pharaoh? Pharaoh is a superpower. He's got an army. You know, anything about ancient history, Pharaoh regularly marched up into Palestine and occupied this land. This is what superpowers do. And so what the Lord knows point blank is, from the start of this process, it was going to be Israelite freedom or the life of Pharaoh. There was no two-way around it because Pharaoh would demand it. I'm not going to give any Breaking Bad spoilers to those of you who are watching the show and haven't gotten to the end to relax. In Breaking Bad, there's a character called Mike Herman Cracker, and he's kind of the enforcer, operations man of one of the drug lords, and he's working with Walt, who's a high school senior current in Mecca. And in the middle of Walt is, of course, always stealing time in his way, and Mike is shown as a very cool, competent, level-headed trooper. And so Mike, at this moment in the story, tells Walt his story. He says, you know, I used to be a beat cop. And as a beat cop, I'd always get called in domestic violence, in domestic disturbance situations. And there was one situation that I remember There was one situation. If you want to see the video, you can find it on my blog. You can find it on YouTube. It's a great scene, but it's not appropriate for the number of years. He tells a story about, he always got this call from this guy's house named Glory. He was a big guy, about, you know, about 6'5", 275, and his wife was just a tiny little woman. And often, when you go into domestic violence, a domestic justicee would call, and be like, oh, who's this good guy? Blah, blah, blah. Because then in this case, this little woman was scared to death of this man, because he would come home drunk, and he would just beat her up. And they'd get a call there, and they'd grab the guy, and they'd put him in jail for 24 hours until he sobered up, and then they'd let him out. And again, he gets called to this house. And he says, one day, my partner was out of his house, and I got called to his house, and I got the guy, I put him in the back of the SWAT car, and he said, this jerk was driving to the police station, and he starts calling Danny Boy in the backseat. And that just hit me. So instead of going right to the police station, I went left, out to a place in town where no one was there. And I took the guy out of the car, and I put him on the ground, and I said, this is it. This is how it ends. I put my gun in his mouth, and I told him, I'm going to take you out right now. The guy was pleading and crying, and, oh, family, oh, this, oh, that. And Mike, the cop at that point then, said, all right. But if you ever touch your wife again, I will miss it now, miss it now, miss it now. Danny, I'm never touching you again. Two weeks later, he gets a call. He goes over there, and the woman is dead. But Mike tells Wal, you know what I learned? From that day forward, I made a promise. No half measures. I did a half measure when I should have taken the fall. Here's the thing about the Exodus Indians and God destroying Pharaoh's army. All of us understand, Hollywood understands, you watch movies all the time in which you get the fact that, you know what, so often in this world, the weak have no refuge. You know, the storm plows through the Philippines. You know who bears the brunt of that? The people who already couldn't afford to live and lose everything. That is what this world is like. Could Israel ever be saved after Pharaoh had a case with their captivity? Actually, if you're reading chapters 14 and 15 of the book of Exodus, it also reminds me of the book of Revelation. Because all the features are there. You have God waking in with all of his glory and all of his power, and he comes into a situation and says, you know what, never again, Pharaoh, will you save these people. In fact, I've given you every chance. In fact, I have them out of your land, and still you took your army to go and drag them back. I know what you are. I know what you will do. But never again will you play these people. From this day forward, this drama will end. It's like the book of Revelation. It's basically the story of hell, the power, and the ancient country. The song of Miriam in chapter 15 is an amazing song. There's a verse right there in chapter 15 where it says, you will bring them in and place them in the mountain of your inheritance in Israel, and the place where you meet for your residence, O Lord the sanctuary, O Lord that your hand has established in the house of the Holy Spirit, the house of the prophets, the house of the Lord of Exodus, and you get to say, no, wait a minute. They're still over here by the word of God. They haven't gotten into the prophets yet. It will be years before they're established there. It will be years before. How many building have already been built? Years. How many building have already been built? How many have been built? The text is intentionally, you all just enter this moment and clarify heaven and earth all in this moment, right here in the story of the book of Exodus. Just like the book of Revelation. And in fact, you see this again and again and again. You can find it at the end of the book of Revelation. I saw a new heaven and a new earth, and the first heaven and the first earth had so soon existed, and the sea existed no more. And I saw the Holy City, a new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven on God, made ready like a bride, and the body of her husband. And I heard a loud voice on the throne saying, Look, the residence of God is among human beings. He will live with them, and He will wipe away every fear from their eyes, and death will not exist anymore, or mourning, or crying, or pain, for the former things that ceased to exist. This is exactly how I understand chapter 14 and 15 in the book of Exodus. That in this moment, God reaches in and everything is clear, and God finally says, Israel will be a slave no more, even if you want to be, because I have done looking at this crime. Now, if I talk to some folks, they would say, yeah, but a better God could have handled this. I just can't stand the idea of my God, but most asserts that the truest are, however, and so attention is a good news for you, because most of them won't say, but you know what? Pharaoh may have been drowned, and they're now seeing us, but the truest, deepest part of Pharaoh is the water, that in fact, there is water down there. It's just physical death, so the red blood cell doesn't really necessarily have to survive in that part of it. Pharaoh doesn't really go out of existence, so let's play this game a little bit further. What's about that dead Pharaoh, or the soul, or Pharaoh's body that's found in the red cell, that doesn't exist? What kind of situation would God give for dead Pharaoh, or Pharaoh's soul? What kind of situation would make Pharaoh happy? Well, I suppose you'd have to put him in a new, heavenly Egypt, and give him heavenly slaves, and before long, you know what he'd be looking for? Heavenly Hebrews, that he could enslave, that he would run his errands for him, and na-na-na-na-na-na. In other words, if you think about Pharaoh, it's not just that Pharaoh is a bad guy. It's that Pharaoh has made something basic to his identity, basic to his existence, and Pharaoh's demand goes far beyond Pharaoh's little lifetime. In fact, from the scenario of any tyrant, whether it's the white beater from Mike, Herb, and Trout, from Breaking Bad, or any of us. And in fact, what on earth is God to do if we continue to demand to have our way? And to think this through, what you begin to realize is what exactly hell is. Hell is the place where Pharaoh gets to go to be Pharaoh. And either he's going to be all by himself, because it would be horrible for God to put anyone else around him, or he's going to be with everyone else who wants to be king of the pile, and they can all compete with one another and fight over the sprax. Now, post-modernity might come back and say, well, you know, Yahweh is just a bigger bully than Pharaoh, because Yahweh displays power and affects the salvation of Israel's physical slavery from Egypt. But you know, through the rest of the story, in fact, we're going to be looking at Esther during Advent, so we'll take a break from our little Exodus wandering. But in fact, as we saw in this passage, Israel's slavery to Egypt goes far beyond the geography of where their feet are planted or where they fall home. In fact, as the old saying goes, getting Israel out of Egypt is one thing, but getting Egypt out of Israel, that's a lot harder. And in fact, that's true for us too. And this is why Jesus is so incredible, because here Jesus got a lot of attention, because he did miracles. And if you remember the story, one of the first things that happens in Jesus' ministry is Satan takes him away, and as he's fasted for 40 days, Satan says, I feel really hungry, I can see that, why don't you just turn those stones into bread? And then Satan brings him up to a high mountain and shows him the world and says, why don't you just ask me, just bow down to me a little bit and I'll make you ruler of these kingdoms. And he takes him to the pinnacle of the temple and he says, why don't you just kind of sail off there and let everyone see you fly like Iron Man? And once they see that, everyone will say, ooh, Jesus, we'll listen to you because you have power. And the most alarming thing is that Satan says, and the most alarming thing about the story at the end of Jesus' life is that they meet him in the garden, this man who could stop a storm, this man who could raise the dead, this man who could heal the sick, how would he come after a man like that? Couldn't he just say a word? Because if he could raise the dead, it's a lot easier to kill a man than to raise him. Ask any doctor. With Jesus having this much power, why doesn't he fix the world? Why doesn't he look around and say, okay, we've got good people and bad people. All you bad people are killing you all, and all you good people, I'll give you what I want. Jesus doesn't do any of that. And in fact, they arrest him. And in fact, after they arrest him, then it's kind of like, well, he's not smiting us. There's no planes. So let's have sport with him. Let's beat him and let's mock him and let's spit on him. In fact, when they got him on the cross, they start mocking him. You destroyed the temple and said you'd rebuild it in three days. Save yourself if you are God's son. In the same way, even the chief priests, together with the experts in the law and the elders, were mocking him. He saved others, but he cannot save himself. He is the king of Israel. If he comes down now from the cross, we will believe in him. He trusts in God. Let God, if he wants to, deliver him now. And here's the thing. He doesn't come down from the cross. Because for all of God's power that he displayed right there at the Red Sea, for all of God's coming up and, you know, you can watch the Prince of Egypt, that animated show. It's such a wonderful scene when the chariots are held back by the fire and Israel gets out and that Pharaoh's army comes in and the wall slams down and it's a great celebration. For all of that raw power, will Israel now suddenly be good? Does that somehow get Egypt out of Israel? And the answer, as we'll see, is no. At the heart of the pastoral mystery is the descent of Christ into hell. This motif has been variously understood in the Christian tradition, but in essence it means that in the sending and self-sacrifice of his son, God himself has absorbed not only the penalty of sin, but also its eternal consequences, the wailing and gnashing of teeth. Jesus Christ has visited the original, Jesus Christ has visited the original house of hell and this has rendered redundant all-cheap invitations. As John Calvin said, by his wrestling hand-to-hand with the devil's power and with the dread of death and with the pains of hell, Jesus Christ has emerged victorious and triumphed over them, that in death we may not now fear those things which our prince has swallowed up. It is not hard to see what hell is. Hell is the final extension of who we are deep in our hearts. And as C.S. Lewis says, the door to hell is locked from the inside. At some point, God says on one hand, if you want to be a tyrant, you want me off your back, you want me to stop interfering, I'll give you this space. But what I will not allow is for you to prey on others. And so go! Be there! I will bother you no more. But he also excludes all grace and mercy and goodness and joy and pleasure, to those who long to die. And those are three things. So it's not hard to see what hell is, or imagine its occupants go there willingly. Demons prefer earth because there's more sport here. What is in Pharaoh is in all of us. The raw power of Yahweh shown at the Red Sea was not sufficient to change our hearts. It is the love we see in Jesus that draws us to Him, draws us to desire Him, draws us to say, okay, a big bad God I can fear, but this Jesus who would do this for me? This I love. This attracts me. This I want to be like. Him I want to be with. I often challenge people when I say, when I say, if you read the Heideberg Catechism, they have misery, deliverance, gratitude. Which part does the Ten Commandments of people and gratitude say? Misery! I say, no! Gratitude. The Christian life is not running out of fear of God. The Christian life is running to God because we know how good He is, and our obedience comes out of gratitude. Not of hell. As Christians, we don't obey out of fear but gratitude. The only way to avoid self-righteousness is the only way to enjoy. So, I will probably preach more about hell than a lot of preachers, because I don't think we need to be afraid to talk about it. We have to talk about it. But the reason we're here is not simply to try to avoid it. The reason we're here is because our God is so good, and we want to pursue Him. Do we see the Pharaoh that's inside of us? Do we understand that it's the love of God, not the power He displays, but the mercy He shows, that draws us to Him, and if we see that, the life that leads in its way, that's the gospel of the Spirit. For a God who would make this galaxy with billions of stars, and billions upon billions of galaxies, for a God like that, running a show of a fiery pillar and parting the waters would be no big thing. But even in that display, the hearts of Israel were not changed. Something bigger, more dramatic, more unusual would be needed. And that would be that the Master of the Universe would not exclude Himself from our suffering, but make Himself subject to it, so that we could have our hearts, not just our theater. Help us to believe, help us to love, help us to trust. In the name of Jesus, Amen. Will you stand? Will you stand? And all the trees of the field will clap their hands, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands, while you grow up with joy. And all the trees of the field will clap their hands, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands, while you grow up with joy. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make His face to shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord turn His face towards you and give you His peace. Amen.
