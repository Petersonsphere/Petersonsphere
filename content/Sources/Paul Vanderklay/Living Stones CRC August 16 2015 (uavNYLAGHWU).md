 Oh Oh There's an image of Of the kind of people that God can reach We imagine that God can reach people who are well-behaved people who are People who are moral people who are well-meaning the kind of people that see that they might fit in with our picture at church Actually The Bible is not so much about good people who get the good rewards they deserve The Bible is more a story about rebellious people that God surprises and brings to himself When we talk about the promised land a land flowing of milk and honey Most of the time we have images of But it's difficult for us to imagine how Canaan was perceived at the time that Joshua now and The children of Israel are going to come to the promised land The word came in we actually get from the Egyptians I Will do what I want to It operated itself for Windows 10 not as quick with that The canyon we get that name from came in from in fact the The Egyptians because for Egypt came in was Really in some ways the Wild West but because came in this east of Egypt and was the wild least Whenever Egypt was strong and powerful it would observe its influence east and north up into Cayman and It would dominate now the same was true of the Mesopotamian Canyon Whenever they were strong and dominant they would their Their influence to the south and to the west in duke a name and what that being came into me Was this kind of weak area filled with? city-states who are opportunists and so are these little clusters and kingdoms and city-states all within Were used to kind of living on their own and when a power emerged they would adapt themselves to the power So when Egypt was strong they would all follow the barrel and when say a land like Assyria was strong They would all follow these series and when that really made painted into kind of the Wild West now When you when you think of images of the Wild West You think about stories of rough people and desperate people and opportunists this is this is from a website of Wild women of the West and it tells the story of Six different women many of these women at one point or another were involved in prostitution One of the things that we don't realize when we think about the 19th century in the West was that Prostitution was in fact very common and in fact Prostitution was one of the ways that women came out to the West and were involved in houses of ill-repute because many of the people who came out last for men and Men leaving their families or men who had no families and looking for opportunity in the gold rush or in and various ways of getting land or finding their portion and Prostitution was spring up so many of these women that were read out throughout the West were known as somehow one way or another being connected with houses of ill-repute What's also amazing if you read the stories of many of these women was that how many of them Turned their lives around one way or another Any of these women became wealthy one way or another many of these women became powerful one way or another Some of these women actually helped to found churches Eventually, and you would think how would a former prostitute? Go on to found a church Well, the stories aren't that far-fetched As we take a look at how this whole thing begins In the book of Joshua and this is where I Really need my proper point because I want to read it to you and not turn my back to you After The death of Moses the servant of the Lord the Lord said to Joshua son of man Moses a Moses my servants is dead now You and all these people get ready across the Jordan River into the land that I'm about to get to that to the Israelites I will give you every place where you set your foot as I promised to Moses Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the great river that you freeze To all the Hittite country to the Mediterranean Sea in the West No one will be able to stand against you in all of the days of your life as I was with Moses I will be with you. I will never leave you nor forsake you be strong and courageous Because you will lead these people to inherit the land. I swore to their ancestors to give you Be strong and very courageous be careful to obey all along my servant Moses gave you You're not trying from it to the right or to the left that you may be successful wherever you go Keep this book of the law always on your lips Meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything read them Then you will probably you will be prosperous and successful I've been at the manage you be strong courageous Do not be afraid do not be discouraged for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go So get the image Israel is about ready to cross the Jordan and go into Canaan and the cave and came in this the wild And even though a lot of the language talks about how large Israel is Israel feels herself to be small Compared to the challenge before it if you remember a generation ago when Israel was ready to go up and take the land Well spies went into the land and the majority reported those spies was there's giants in the land There's wall sit wall cities in the land if we go in there. They will crush us and take our wives and children of slaves And because of their rebellion they wanted for 40 years in the desert So now they're ready to go in again and everyone's wondering will they go and so God tells them okay? Moses is dead Joshua is your new leader be strong and courageous We saw how many times that was repeated there be strong courageous go into the land God will give you the way So Joshua son of none secretly sent two spies from Sheba Golden over the land he said especially Jericho So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named the ray had and stayed there Now if you read ancient and modern commentaries I Care to fall all over themselves trying to explain and excuse why these men stayed in the house of a prostitute Because that doesn't sound very Christian well It's a little bit more complicated than that and it is If you go Jericho at this point we believe was actually a very small place what essentially it was Was a fortress along the travel routes by way large empires would try to secure the region So if you think about siders for or the other forms of the American West how did these sports function? There were ways for more dominant powers to try to secure the land well what kind of businesses with? would Would accumulate around something like an outpost or a fork well and in Or a house of the repute would generally be one of the kinds of places you would find around the fork and in fact the Term prostitute used here is also the same term also used for an innkeeper Now again we hear that when you go to Motel 6 what you're expecting is that that leave the light on Hopefully give you a clean room to sleep in and maybe they'll be in Denny's across the way But in the ancient world as in the 19th century there were also the other services available Usually for men and there would be women to serve them So the men despise going to Jericho. They're not about to bump with soldiers where on earth could they go? But in fact the only place they would expect strange men to go which would be the in saloon slash House of Ill-Reputed and the proprietor of this establishment was a woman named Reha and so again We might think of her as one of these women from the wild west of America Woman probably worked her way up now to become the madam of the house Who was running the show of the end here at this outpost for called? Jericho The king of Jericho was told look some of these who like to come here tonight to spy out the land So the King of Jericho sent this message to Reha Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house because they have come to spy out the land It's also interesting to wonder about who this King of Jericho was because again from what we know of this time period Jericho was more important than a city and this King was more kind of a strong man Who was probably working for other kings of larger population areas? And so he was kind of the local guy in charge of making sure that Jericho was secure Another interesting thing we also know from the archaeology is that in fact this was a common situation That fires would have forts at strategic places and they would have rulers in these ports and it was a common situation that the innkeeper Whoever it was had to be in alignment with the leader In fact the code of Hammurabi a very famous ancient code specifically addresses this situation If there be a woman in keeper and it's very interesting that in the code of Hammurabi She is a woman so it must have been common for women to run these establishments If there should be a woman innkeeper in whose house criminals congregate well Probably again something like an old West saloon And she does not seize those criminals and leave them off to the palace authorities That woman innkeeper shall be put to death So now we get a little bit of an understanding of Probably who Rahab was she was probably a woman who through savvy and Opportunism had worked her way into having this in Saloon slash house of the review. She was probably the madam in charge of keeping the other women and Keeping the place organized Keeping the place organized That she in fact was needed to be savvy about the political fortunes of Canaan Because if Egypt was coming up strong, she should side with Egypt if a Syria was coming in strong She should side with them. But now she's got a crisis Because she knows these men are spies and they've come to her house and she knows the king of The king of Jericho can arrest her and kill her if she's found to have the spies What should she do? If she turns in the spies and Israel comes through She's a dead woman if she harbors the spies and hides them and the king of Jericho figures it out Then she's a dead woman in other words She's at this moment in a place where she has to make a decision and the decision she makes will be life or death to her What decision is she going to make? But the woman had taken the two men and hit him She said yes the men came but I did not know where they had come from At dusk when it was time to close the city gate they left I don't know which way they went go after them quickly. You might catch up with them But she had taken them up on the roof and hidden them under the stalks of glass She had laid out on the roof so the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the board of the Jordan and As soon as the pursuers got as gone out the gates were shut Not only does the fact that the spies enter the house of their repute and say with a prostitute Leads to a lot of commentator and written in but her lie Leads to a lot of commentator and reading. Oh my goodness. How could this rain have lies? I Think a lot of these questions again assume the presumption that It's only good and nice and clean Law I moral people that God uses but in fact in the grindiness of this situation God is engaging This woman in this instance and in fact she is lying through her teeth Because she has made a bet in her mind about which way the fortunes of the world will go Before the spies lay down from the night she went up on the roof and said to them I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us So that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when it came out of Egypt and what you did to Sihon and odd the dukes of the Amorites east of Jordan will be completely destroyed When we heard of it our hearts melted in fear and everyone's courage failed because of you for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below Now that please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family because I have shown kindness to you Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother my brothers and sisters And all who belong to them that you will save them from death Our lives for your lives to banish your dirt If you don't tell what we are doing we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land So she so she let them down by a rope through the window But how she lived in was in part of the city wall She said to them go to the hills so that the pursuers will not find you hide yourself They have three days until they return and go on your way Now the man had said to her this is the oath that you made us swear will not be binding on us Unless when we enter the land you have tied this scarlet cord in the window in which you let us down Unless you have brought your father and your mother and your brothers and all your family in your house Now the starlet or the language used is different from the rope that they use that she used to let them down And there's a lot of conjecture about the scarlet or the scarlet or made that had been the sign of the red light district or the city of Jericho and That the starlet or the name back that simply been the symbol in that area to let all pastors know This is the place where you can find a bed and a woman to lie with Because if she put the cord out different from normal They probably would have paid attention and this would have been a disaster for her So our question is how do we regard? And I think the deeper question is how do we regard our God? One of the interesting things about being a pastor are listening to your stories and Here's something I know about most of you Many of you have things in your stories that you don't tell each other Many of you have things in your lives that you would rather let stay in it Many of you have made decisions in your past that you look back at now and say, you know I really wish I hadn't done that Many of us imagine when we come into church that we sit among the saints and we do But we imagine that what that means is that all of the people sitting among us are living such good and pure and decent lives That they have never touched anything simple and nothing simple has ever touched them and what I can honestly tell you is that none of that is true and That all the hand-wring that commentators do about rehab We should just give up that game Because there's nothing hard to imagine that ancient spies would have gone to the only place where men were congregating In that form and that things were done and that Rachel slept her way to the top and that she was an absolute Opportunist and here at this moment she imagines. Oh wow Politics are changing again. And if I back the king of Jericho I'm gonna be a loser when the Israelites and their powerful God come to town And that she embraces the Lord. Why? Because in that moment she's sorry for her sin No in that moment she realizes the winds will change and this is the only God that makes any sense and she embraces him and The Bible calls it righteousness What's amazing is that we have Will not just become an obscure story of the Old Testament When we begin the gospel of Matthew One of the things that you might notice is it begins with this long boring Genealogy, which is boring for us, but very interesting for anxious because what the genealogy intends to do is tie people to people of ancient renown to Give Jesus credibility and one of the surprising things that that does Is include women in the genealogy Because generally speaking women were not included and when women were included there was mostly women of such high Spiritual caliber of such high now That they would be famous and give Jesus credibility Abraham was the father of Isaac Sarah is not mentioned. I think is the father of Jacob Rebecca is not mentioned. Jacob is the father of Judah Rachel and Leah are not mentioned Judah is the father of Peres Peres, Peres and Zerah Whose mother is Tamar Remember who Tamar is from a while ago Tamar was the daughter-in-law of Judah Who Judah did not want to make good with his responsibilities towards so she became a shrine prostitute Slept with Judah who obviously visited the shrine prostitute was likely not his first time Became pregnant and Judah wanted to put her to death and Tamar demonstrates that Judah was in the wrong And this becomes the turning point in Judah's story Peres the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Abedad Abedad the father of Meshon, Meshon the father of Solomon, Solomon the father of Boaz Boaz Did you ever read the story of Ruth? Whose mother was Rahab There's a lot of issues with this genealogy, but here's the point Matthew is making Tamar Becomes an integral part of God's plan in the world Rahab the madam of the saloon of Jericho Becomes an integral part of God's mission to rescue the world Boaz the father of Obed whose mother was Ruth the Moabitess Obed the father of Jesse, Jesse the father of King David, David was the father of Solomon whose mother was in fact Uriah's wife who David had killed to sleep with her So you might sit here and say pastor I'm sitting amongst all these good people and you are you're sitting amongst some of the best People I know in this world. There are people in this congregation that I Esteem so highly because I see your righteousness and your faithfulness but I also know that we all come to this story with our own stories and Some of you might say oh, but at least I wasn't a prostitute well You don't know what we're sitting amongst you. You don't know what people have had to do You don't know the back stories in our lives and you don't know what God has called us out of And if Jesus could embrace Ray, what makes you so special? Jesus says this The kingdom of heaven it's like a treasure In a feeling when a man found it He hid it again and then his joy went and sold all he had and bought that feeling Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls We found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought Now the first story of the man who finds a new treasure Wouldn't we imagine that the moral thing to do for that man is to go to the owner of the field and say oh Excuse me. I was digging around at your field and I found a box of gold and because you own the field here it is Does the man do that in the story? No, what did he do? Says oh wow Oh Oh, it's that old field over there. It doesn't really produce so good. I'll give you a 1500 bucks for it Isn't that okay? And you look at this person you say this person is a crook What's the point of Jesus story There's an angle of opportunism in all of us and what Jesus is saying is don't be a Lot of people look at the two thieves on the cross and in the gospel of Luke the one thief on the cross Who spent his whole life? murdering raping visiting prostitutes doing all kinds of bad stuff in that moment And seeing Jesus crucified turns and looks and in a moment of inspiration and insight says Holy cow This guy doesn't deserve what he's getting and in a moment of desperation says Lord remember me when you come to your kingdom and what does Jesus say to him? I What's behind the complaint of that story It's the idea that I'm good Because I want God to forgive me. I want God to include me When you know what it's the same motivation Here's our problem If you imagine you are great has moral superior, maybe you are in some ways But if you look at it how God looks at it The difference is negligible Because compared to God None of us have standing and so even though Saw this opportunity even though Ray have grabbed it God looks to her and says I will include you in my kingdom Even for hanging on to me for a reason that's lousy Now what reason do you have for being in church? Are you afraid if you don't go to church God can't bless you Are you afraid that you don't go to church that God will send you to hell? Are you you have all kinds of mixed motivations and realities for participating in the Christian life? If you're like me, I bet you do And if you're a real purist you might say oh but the only reason I should come to church The only reason I should come to God is is just that of pure gratitude Yeah, that is the best reason But he'll take you as you are The truth is that it is a hard world And most of these women in the wild west didn't have a lot of options And most of these women in the wild west were probably fleeing situations and circumstances in the east That weren't good to begin with and when they found themselves in the West they discovered they weren't strong like a man and The best assets they had were in some ways the most degrading and so they did whatever they could to survive And when they saw opportunities they grabbed them And they survived But somewhere along the line for some of these women they hit a point And they saw an opportunity and they met someone who would love them and not just their bodies They saw an opportunity for someone who would give to them not because of what they would get And they said like the person who found a treasure in the field I can't find a better deal any other way I'm going to grab on to this even If I'm risking my life Which is what Ray Hatt did and they do And God takes them and welcomes them Why do we follow a man who was crucified by the prevailing powers because in many ways not just pilot like the king of Jericho and Said to Jesus look kind of deal with me and Jesus says I will bank on death and Because he banks on death this thief next to him crucified looks at him and says There's something about this man that is good and right and makes all my opportunism Look shabby and shallow And he is willing to take me No matter what I've done and no matter the state of my heart and I am willing to risk everything And follow him and I would suggest to you That he looks for no better disciple The truth is that this world will use you the truth is that this world will use you for its own Reasons and what the gospel in many ways Does is comes to us and says Will you take a risk on this king who is not yet in power? Will you take a risk and bank on him instead of all the other powers? in the form Will you imagine that this one? With this one we may have a chance of love with this one I May have a chance of life And what will you do to secure it? Let's pray Lord may we not pretend we are holier than each other Lord may we lay down some of our sanctimonious heirs Lord may we believe that in fact Compared to your grades all of us are moral failures And we are not prepared to be Compared to your grades all of us are moral failures and you come to us and You open your house to us and you open your heart to us and you tell us this is the best deal we'll ever get Or most of the time what keeps us from you is our pride But maybe we have a little bit of rehab in us That sees in fact that the winds are changing that believes in fact that your kingdom is coming And that banks in fact That when you come You will have mercy on those with whom you will have mercy Maybe bank not on our own righteousness but on your grace and Maybe you see the capital Even if it feels like a terrible risk Help us Lord to believe in the name of Jesus amen You
