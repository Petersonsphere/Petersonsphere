A bike is a picture of health is a good thing my mother who very fondly soiled a c Congregate little bit over the edge of the Butte said so she Imperial USA far above I went over One of the interesting things about being a preacher is what's happening in our world is almost always intersecting with the biblical story in different ways. And people hear the stories through the narratives of our lives. And one of the things that we as a culture in the last several months have been pondering is the relationship between power and sex. There are revelations or the accusations against Bill Cosby are not new. Many of them arose in 2005, but now they're getting traction. And others have pointed out that in many ways a lot of what Bill Cosby's been accused of, Bill Clinton has been accused of. And everyone's pointing fingers at Cosby and Clinton continues to skate in some ways. But when we read the story we're going to read this morning, many commentators will say, isn't this a story about Mary Sack? Isn't this story about Mary abusive? The virgin birth is just a pagan knockoff attempting to give divine credibility to the man Jesus of Nazareth. Or this is just another example of reinforcing male patriarchy. Male deities using women for their own selfish needs against their wishes or welfare. Now it might be the case that your friends don't say things like this, but my friends do. And these are real issues that they grapple with when they read the Bible. And they say, how am I supposed to understand this God that this God is good? How am I supposed to understand this God that this God is good when I read stories like this? How does, part of the issue that we have is that we always hear these stories in a certain context. It's such a shock when people hear the Bill Cosby allegations because they remember during the 80s, Bill Cosby as Cliff Huxtable in this OBGYN who was such a family man and such a good person. But when we begin to hear the stories against Bill Cosby, we hear it in a different way. We say, this is a man with power, who used his power to advantage himself against people who were looking for help or were helpless. How are we supposed to understand this? Are these allegations true? Should we believe them? Should we not believe them? And people will tend to go along the lines where the narratives that they think of. Often I will hear when I talk to friends that, you know, these Bible stories of miracles are so fantastic and strange. But in the ancient world there were lots of other pagan stories and lots of other virgin birds and lots of other miraculous tales. Well, if I would say, well I could tell you the story of Zeus and Laeda, where Zeus comes to Laeda as a swan. And Laeda gives birth to Helen of Troy who was obviously the daughter of a god because she was so beautiful. One of the interesting things however often challenged people will say to me things like, I can't believe the Bible is full of all of these stories just like the Greeks are full of those stories. I would say to them, why don't you actually read the Greek stories? Why don't you actually look at these other tales and see exactly what they say? The story of Zeus coming to Laeda as a swan and impregnating her and then she sleeps with her own husband and then she gives birth to two children, one of them being Helen, one of them being Clemestra. Does this story sound like any story from the Bible? It sounds fantastic and strange and disgusting quite frankly. But go ahead and read ancient myths and then read the Bible and see if they sound the same. C.S. Lewis was a great master of medieval scholarship and ancient scholarship. When he began reading the Bible himself he said, you know, when you read the New Testament, the Gospels, they stand out because they're not like reading about Zeus and Achilles and Virgilis. It's a very different story indeed. In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent an angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, greetings, you are highly favored. The Lord is with you. Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her, do not be afraid, Mary. You have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son. You are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the son of the most high. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever. His kingdom will never end. How will this be, Mary? asked the angel, since I am a virgin. The angel answered, the Holy Spirit will come on you and the power of the most high will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God. Even Elizabeth, your relative, is going to have a child at her old age and she who is said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. For no word from God will ever fail. I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered. May your word to me be fulfilled, then the angel left her. Now many people read this story and say, how can I believe this? How could the story have simply made up to give credibility to Jesus? The difficult thing, however, is that in any Jewish community any story like this would in fact undermine the credibility of Jesus. Because the idea of Yahweh doing things like Zeus was such a repugnant and repulsive idea to the Jews. The Jews, in fact, would be appalled by such a story. And if you read the Church Fathers too, the writings of the second, third, and fourth century, you find that the concept and the declaration of a virgin birth in fact offended many Greeks as well. They understood what myths looked like. They understood that, in fact, if you go through the ancient myths you don't find virgin birth, you find miraculous birth. And you find all kinds of fantastic stories like the one I just described about Zeus and the swine. The other thing is that, well, maybe they made this up to explain Jesus' power. But if you make that argument, you're basically saying Jesus had power. If you look, a lot of people will simply say, well, these are ancient writings. How can you believe in the miraculous? Doesn't science disprove miracles? If you look at this problem, you can see that in fact the modern argument itself is fragile. Because if you say, well, science proves miracles don't exist, then even just one miracle would mean that this whole system of materialism where we say, oh, only material causes make things happen. Just one miracle makes that entire system go away. But one of the clearest things and strangest things about this story is in fact Jesus himself. This guy on the right here is Hercules. And if you were to meet this guy, you'd say, wow, this is an impressive fellow. And if you read the stories of Hercules, you can find him beating the lion or doing great works of strength and power. This woman here is Helen of Troy. Helen of Troy was known to have the face that launched the thousand ships and the whole Trojan-Greek war happened because Helen was so beautiful and Agamemnon was so disturbed that they're running away with Paris. Is this the story of Jesus? Do we find that Mary has Jesus and Jesus grows and he's like Hercules and he does things? The story could be any more different than these three stories. Because you have to ask yourself very quickly, what type of salvation does Jesus bring? If you ask most Americans, what do I really need to make life work? Most Americans would say I could use more money, I could use better health, I could use more influence to get the people around me to do what I want them to. I could use more power. And in fact, when you look at the Greeks, that's exactly what they have. Strength and beauty and wealth and power. Because this is what we imagine our problem is. My real problem is that I'm limited. If I only had more power, if I only had more money, if I only had more influence, if I only had better health, then life would be great and wonderful and I could have everything I ever wanted. Was there a time in your life when you had more money? Was there a time in your life when you had more strength, better health, higher influence? Did that solve everything? Look at those people, look at celebrities who have beauty and fame and power and money. Is life perfect for them? Do they not have problems? Do you find them being enormously happy and completely successful in all their relationships? What kind of salvation does God need to bring to us? This is a modern picture, a modern painting done of the Annunciation, of the angel coming to Mary. And the artist decided he wanted to give it a very modern perspective and he wanted to emphasize the fact that Mary is young and he's a young woman. Mary in our day would still be in school. Mary is in many ways a shy young woman as the Bible says who had never been with a man and God comes to her and says, Mary, I would like to use you to do a great work. Now many young girls would probably say, well what do you want out of life? Well I want beauty and fame and power and security and comfort. And God comes and says, I'm going to be a good husband. And Mary says, I'm going to be a good husband. And God says, I'm going to be a good husband. And Mary says, I'm going to be a good husband because you're going to get all of the things that we want. But I would like to use you in this way. And Mary says, yes. This is not a story that we're gonna tell, this is not a story that we're gonna tell to you, use you in this way?" And Mary says, yes. This is not a story of divine rape. This is not a story of God turning himself into an animal or God somehow getting sexual pleasure through this. In fact, there's no sex in this at all. This is a story of God becoming one of us and God not going to Helen or not going to Hercules or not going to a palace, but going to a girl and saying, this is how I would like to come into the world to set in motion the salvation of my people from the inside out. You see, the shape of this salvation is to save us from the things around us and between us. He must save us from the things within us. Because I can promise you, whoever you are, more money isn't fundamentally probably going to change you in a better way. More better health probably isn't going to change you in a better way. More time, more power. In fact, when we look at Bill Cosby or Bill Clinton, it's in fact their inability to handle power that seems to be the cause of their moral problems. And in fact, most of us, if we look at our lives, if we were to somehow take the restraints off us, in what ways wouldn't we hurt those around us? I'll often have people coming to me and say, Pastor, I'm in a relationship with this person and I want this person to I want to give this person to do this thing. And often what we want is a good thing. But look at a relation when one person has ultimate power over another. Does that usually go well? Edie's smiling over there. She's a therapist. She sits in a room all day long and probably hears a lot of stories of people who had power over others and used them for their own selfish advantage or needs. We don't need more power. The modern world has shown us that more power doesn't help. If you compare the power and the wealth that we have today compared to a hundred years ago, we're tremendously more powerful. Are we that much better to each other? Are there fewer wars? How can we love God and our neighbor when we're so insecure and desperate? To Mary, in many ways, is a proto-converter. She's got the same trials we have. And in fact, God coming into her life complicates it. She's engaged to Joseph and now suddenly she's pregnant and Joseph and everyone else says something happened. Mary isn't what we thought she was. And Joseph, being a righteous man, thinks, I don't want to subject her to the kind of punishment this community is capable of. I'll dismiss her quietly. And so the Gospel of Matthew tells the story of Joseph. But in the end, however, she partners with God and begins a journey of trusting him. And Mary's journey will not be easy. In fact, in the Gospel of Mark at some point, after Jesus has started his public ministry, she's not so sure about him. And she wonders if he's lost his mind because she was probably thinking too, well won't Jesus be kind of a Jewish Hercules? Won't he be kind of a Jewish Samson? Well, sometimes read the stories of Samson and find out what power did for him. Her son will not be a hero like Hercules or Helen, but will do far more in ways that people can't really understand. You see, the core of our misery isn't really figuring out how to mentally appropriate all of this material. The virgin birth, you may have difficulty with the virgin birth. I get that. But what I want you to focus on here is what is our real problem? And how does the virgin birth really make sense within the entire story of what God is trying to do? As I was working through the sermon, I sat down and I was thinking, now what if Jesus were like Hercules? He couldn't have accomplished this salvation. What if Jesus were like Helen? That's not what he needed to accomplish this salvation. What if Jesus were just a man that got elevated? That wouldn't do it. What if Jesus were a God like many of the other gods who came down with power and thunderbolts and these kinds of things and just tried to do things for us? That wouldn't have accomplished it. The only way God can get in among us and do this would be the path he chose. We are users and abusers of God's nature and people. And the more power we have, the more prone we are to this abuse. You may try to annihilate your ego or yourself, but even if you master this, you will not pass through the age of decay. Self-annihilation while addressing the problem of desire does not save the creation. It only takes us out of it. The good news is that God did not try to rescue us from our subjugation by using us for his advantage. But in exactly the opposite, he came into our suffering and showed us that he can in fact be trusted to rescue us not just from the age of decay, but from ourselves as well. See, here's the thing. All the stories of what Bill Cosby has done, he first earns their trust and then betrays them because they learn he doesn't really care for my career. He's just trying to get something out of me. God in fact can get nothing out of us but comes to us to bless. In fact, the two must always go together because if he rescues us from the limitation of death without rescuing us from the tyranny of our desires, our desires will simply continue to destroy us in this world and the next. What happens if you give an alcoholic a winning lottery ticket? You've given him a death sentence because he will drink himself to death. Our problem is not our limitation. Our problem is our heart. Jesus comes to us. He is God with us and by his stripes we are here. He is David's son, becomes the heir to his throne, the everlasting king whose flesh does not decay and who is not corrupted by power. On my blog this week I posted it and I posted it on Facebook too. A really amazing speech given by David Brooks and he starts out the speech talking about two kinds of virtues. He says, you know, there are really two kinds of virtues. There are resume virtues and eulogy virtues and in a lot of our life we want resume virtues. I've done this. I can do this job. I can have this career. I can make this money. I can gain this reputation. I can gain this fame. These are all the virtues that the world esteems for a while. But at a funeral what kinds of things do we want to hear? He was a faithful father who cared for his daughter's well and treated his wife with respect. She was a faithful mother who gave herself for me. You don't hear anybody say my mother had a PhD and earned $500,000 a year and was president of the United States. That's a nice story. But it's the eulogy virtues that we say that's how I want to be remembered that I gave my life for others. Mary could have said I want a strong successful son who was showering me with adoration, gifts and opportunity. I want a beautiful home, successful children, nice clothes and fine food. But she takes a different path. And the question is and we have to deal with this question every day. Which path do we take? Do we really believe that more power, more opportunity will give us the things we want? Or do we believe that God in fact has come to us vulnerable, quiet, unassuming, sacrificially and invites us into this path? I see Mary sitting there with her little baby. Does your little baby care about the degrees that you've earned in college? Does your little baby care that you have all this skill reading English literature and teaching children? What does your little baby care about? That you love that little girl so much that even though you're tired of holding her, you come to church and she needs a nap and so you hold her. And what you see right there is what Mary was asked to do for Jesus and what Jesus was asked to do for us. And then we have to ask ourselves because of what Jesus has done for us, what will we do for each other? Let's pray. Lord, this is Advent. And we celebrate the fact that you have come to us and are coming to us. Lord, may we take in the story. May we receive the grace and may we dispense it to an ungracious world simply out of gratitude. Hear our prayer. In the name of Jesus, amen. Amen. Would you stand? Do the pressure, do the promise, Christ will come again. Cross this time on deep dark place, Christ will come again. Live the world of love is free, through your watching and reading. In the hope that God's gone to you, Christ will come again. Do the pressure, do the promise, Christ will come again. Let your daily actions witness, Christ will come again. Let your loving and your giving and your justice and peace be as by you all the living. Christ is gone again. Christmas Eve, Wednesday 730 service. I always forget what that says. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make this space to shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face towards you and give you this peace. Amen. Do the pressure, do the promise, Christ will come again. Take this over dying purpose, Christ will come again. At her door, cap you lay, and the world is lawfully gaping, through the advent you are willing.
