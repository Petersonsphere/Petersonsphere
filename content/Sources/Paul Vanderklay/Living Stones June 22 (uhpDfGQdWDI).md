I think Gittani made some really good points in his article, but I also was thinking about this as I was finishing up the novel by John Irving, Prayer for Owen Meade. It's quite a powerful novel. But one of the things that struck me in the book was the book is set mostly in the middle of the 20th century during the Cold War when U.S. church attendance reached its peak. That surprises a lot of people because a lot of people would have got American church attendance would have reached its peak during the Great Awakening or during the 19th century, the Second Great Awakening, but actually American church attendance reached its peak during the Cold War. And a lot of people speculate about that because it's also true that when you pick up a coin and when you see in God or you trust on the coins, that motto only came on our coins also during the Cold War because we as a country were standing up to the threat of communism which was atheistic. And so Americans in huge numbers went to church. And the setting of this novel was during the Cold War when Americans went to church whether they believed things or not because this is what good people did. Good people went to church. Whether you believed in God or didn't believe in God very much, you went to church. The Cold War church attendance eventually gave way to what became much more the megachurch. And the megachurch, the first truly 20th century megachurch was probably the Crystal Cathedral in Southern California. And then this was Robert Shuler, he was the senior pastor. This was his ministry philosophy, this I found in a magazine interview with him. Anybody who succeeds is helping people. The secret to success, it means church success here, is to find a need and fill it. Find a hurt and heal it. Find a problem and solve it. If you haven't figured out what pastors major in, it's catchy phrases because those kind of trip off the tongue, you can remember it. Find a need and fill it. Find a hurt and heal it. Find a problem and solve it. What's the hardest lesson you've had to learn in 50 years? The hardest lesson is to continue to stay focused on the emotional needs of the nonbelievers. Dr. Shuler strategically, prayerfully built a ministry that would inspire cynics and skeptics and consider Christ, and he did. His pastoral experience has taught him that all people, the believers or nonbelievers, have this in common, they have hurts. He geared his ministry to address those needs. And Shuler's church also grew towards the end of the Cold War and then into the post-Cold War era. More recently, however, his church has fallen apart because the family squabbles, and now the Roman Catholics have bought his old facility. When I look at situations now in 2014, I recognize that as church attendance in North America continues to decline, there are a number of reasons for this. Before the advent of modern medicine, if you were sick, you went to church and you asked for prayer. Well, a lot of people would say, my friends who are skeptics, they would say modern medicine works better than prayer. So if I pray and go to the doctor, why don't I just cut off prayer and go to the doctor instead? I can pray about my illness, but if my doctor could treat it, I would get well more predictably. The church traditionally, if you go back a few hundred years, a lot of people don't recognize this, really hospitals came about because of the church. Because the church for centuries took on the task of caring for the sick, caring for the poor, caring for the old. The church was in many situations the only institution around, and the church did this work. But today we have social security for the old and disabled, and the social security supports people in ways that the church could not even hope to. Others will note that with problems of addiction, with problems of depression, with problems of mental illness, modern psychology and therapy and medicine have shown abilities to help and to treat people. And so if in fact the job of the church is to find a need and fill it, find a curve and heal it, and address people's needs, many people, I think if you ask your friends and neighbors who don't go to church, many people will look at you and simply say, why should I go to church? What is the church really going to do for me? One of the most famous churches right now in California is, it's not one of the largest churches, because there are many churches larger than his, but how many of you have heard of Bethel Church in Redding? Okay, a number of you. The very famous church right now, it's a church that is majoring in miraculous healing. And Bill Johnson is the senior pastor, and he wrote a book, he actually wrote a couple of books, but his most famous book, his first book was When Heaven Invades Earth. And the basic idea is this, the church is supposed to be the place where the kingdom of heaven invades the kingdom of earth. And Jesus' prayer, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven, comes into church. And so Bill Johnson basically says, there's no reason why any of us should be sick. If we really believe that God has invaded earth, if we really believe that the kingdom of heaven is present, then illnesses should be banished in our midst, and we should be healthy, and our children should be flourishing, and our businesses should be growing, and we should be realizing all of this. And the only reason we're not really realizing this is because we don't believe enough. Now, on one hand, I agree with Bill Johnson that there is no reason why God's power in this world needs to be limited. God's spirit is available to us, God's power is available to us, and there's no limit on what God can do. However, I have yet to see a miracle worker empty a hospital. Why should the sick come to the stage? Why not go to the hospital? Why not heal everyone in the hospital and everyone in the nursing home and have them walk away? If the kingdom of heaven is invading, the invasion to me sometimes seems underwhelming. We in fact read that it was this start with Jesus, that before, Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. News about his friend all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon possessed, those having seizures and the paralyzed, and he healed them. Large crowds from the Galilee, the Necapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and the region across Jordan followed him. You get the image that what Jesus was doing in the Galilee was cleaning out hospitals. And everyone would be healed, at least in some of these times and in some of these places. But it's also the fact that everyone Jesus healed would die again. So how do we put these pictures together and where does the church fit? It's also interesting to note that when Jesus is being arrested in Jerusalem, and his disciples pull out their swords to defend him, Jesus notes, and he will later say this to Pilate, Do you think I cannot call on my father, and he will at once but at my disposal, more than twelve legions of angels? Now it's important to understand that the Roman Legion was the most effective military body that the world had ever seen. It's that part of the world that had ever seen by that point. So when Jesus is talking about twelve legions of angels, he's talking about the kind of military might that they could not conceive of. And Jesus says, I have twelve legions of angels available to me. Then we have to ask the question, why did Jesus not call them? Why? In the book of Exodus, we have this command. We've been going through the book of Exodus and we have the Ten Commandments. And then what follows in the book of Exodus are a number of other commandments. Jesus says, or the Lord says to Israel, Do not take advantage of the widow or the fatherless. If you do and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry. My anger will be aroused and I will kill you with the sword. Your wives will become widows and your children fatherless. You probably never read this for the motion. If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal. Take no interest. If you take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset because that cloak is the only covering your neighbor has. What else can they sleep in? When they cry out to me, I will hear. For I am compassionate. The image you get here out of Exodus 22 is what the Lord is saying is, You had better watch how you treat each other. And if you treat each other with injustice, I will come and set the record straight. Now you can imagine how this is heard for those who are suffering. They say, Lord, I have been taken advantage of. I am being oppressed. I am being enslaved. And in the Old Testament, the Lord says, Be kind to the poor because if you are not, I will stand up for the poor because I am a god of justice. And I think just as many people who are skeptical about the power of God in this world, when they say the hospital heals me better than church prayer, when the social security takes care of me and the disabled better than the church's poultry benevolence operates, that why on earth should I go to church? The therapist can help me deal with my emotional trauma better than the pastor. So where is this God? Why, when he says he looks out for the poor, are there so many poor? When he says, I will settle the score, is there so much injustice? One of my favorite movies is an old movie from the 80s or the 90s, Leap of Faith with Steve Harman in it. And one of my favorite scenes, Steve Harman is a fake, is a fake faith healer. And he is basically conning people all throughout the Midwest with his fake healing shows until at one show a real miracle happens and he doesn't know what to do. And in this scene he is in his worships, he is in the place where they have been holding the revival all by himself and there is Jesus on a crucifix. When I see that I always think Hollywood never pays much attention to Protestants because fake healers never have a crucifix. They always have an empty cross, but never mind. So he is talking to Jesus on the crucifix and he says this speech. He says to the crucifix, I've got a question for you. Why did you make so many suckers? You say love never ended. Well I say love never started. You say the meat will inherit the earth, but I say the only thing the meat can count on is getting the short end of the stick. You say is there any among you who is pure of heart? And I say no, not one. We save ourselves because God seems negligent and delinquent. And so when Bill Johnson says the power of heaven is available to us, there is no reason we should be sick. And I say go clean out a hospital and I'll believe you. Oh but no, no buts. Just do it. But then again I also have to ask, not everybody who goes into a hospital is cured by modern medicine. Many of you know full well there are things in your life that you go to the doctor and the doctor will kind of shrug his shoulders and say I can't fix that. Not everybody walks out of a hospital cured. Many leave the hospital through the morn. We get politics. Does Social Security somehow cover everything and fix everything? You all know that better than I do. We have therapy. Well just because you go to a therapist, just because you get modern treatment for your mental illness, does that mean oh they gave me a shot, now everything's great? I've dealt with enough with that community to know a lot of trial and error there too. The picture gets even more complicated when we don't just take a little snippet out of the Bible and say here this is everything, but when we read the whole book. Last year we looked at the story of Isaac and Ishmael. Isaac of course was the child promised to Abraham and the Lord tells him again and again I'm going to give you a child, he will be your heir. And Sarah and Abraham try every other way to prime the pump so that God will somehow make heaven come down to earth for Abraham and Sarah who are barren and in that culture and in that day they have no future and so maybe my servant will be your son. No. Maybe Lot will be my heir. No. Then Sarah's like well take my servant girl, my Egyptian servant girl that you probably got when Abraham said well Sarah's my sister. Take sleep with her and then have a child through her and Sarah thinks this will fix everything. But very quickly Sarah despises her and wants to put her to death and kill her by the wilderness. But she is rescued and but now the miracle has happened and Isaac is born. Does the miracle somehow make her happy? Does the miracle somehow make her generous? Does the miracle somehow fix Sarah from the inside? The child grew and was weaned and on the day Isaac was weaned they often waited until the child was weaned because they thought now at this age three or four the child hopefully will live. Abraham held a great peace. But Sarah saw that the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, had born to Abraham was mocking. And she said to Abraham get rid of that slave woman and her son. Sarah doesn't even want to mention their names. For that woman's son will never share the inheritance of my son Isaac. Oh Sarah, didn't you bring Ishmael into being by placing Hagar in Abraham's bed? Have you forgotten your part in this story? That honor distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son Ishmael. But it also concerned Isaac. Sarah wants them killed. Well Sarah's not going to kill them. Send them into the wilderness. But Sarah knows it's a death sentence. A neighbor man does too. But God said to Abraham do not be so distressed about the boy and your slave woman. God doesn't mention their names. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you. Listen to Sarah? Because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned. I have made the son of the slave into a nation also because he is your offspring. Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. They set them on her shoulders. They care for attention to the language. It's going to be repeated. And said her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba. When the water and the skin was gone she put the boy under one of the bushes. Then she went off and sat down within a bow shot away for she thought I cannot watch the boy die. As she sat there she began to sob. God heard the boy crying. An angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, What is the matter Hagar? Do not be afraid. God has heard the boy crying as he lies there. Lift the boy up and take him by the hand for I will make him into a great nation. Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. God was with the boy as he grew up. And he lived in the desert and became an archer. While he was living in the desert of Peran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt. Could God have taken a less traumatic route? Why not say, Okay Abraham, take a dozen of your servants and bring them safely to Egypt and they'll all be fine. He tells him to go and he brings it to such, Why couldn't Hagar see the well of water before she put the boy under a bush in despair that she didn't want to see her son die? Isn't that the last minute again that the Lord moves in and saves? And then he tells Abraham again, He'll be a great nation. We already know Abraham isn't real good at faith. He tried every which way in 25 years to make the son happen himself. And now he's supposed to believe that sending them off into the desert with a skin of water and a little bit of food that somehow God is going to do something with this? And then of course as anyone who knows math or the Bible will tell you, Chapter 21 becomes Chapter 22. Sometime later God tested Abraham and he said to him, Abraham, here I am, he replied. Then God said, Take your son, your only son, whom you love, your only son. What about Ishmael? Abraham at this point probably assumes Ishmael is dead. Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering that Amaz and I will show you. Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his gnot key. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place the Lord had told him. Later he will take the wood and put it on the boy's back. And if you read Chapter 21 and Chapter 22 next to each other, you will see that the sending off of Ishmael and the sending off of Isaac are parallel. What about the Kingdom of Heaven coming down to earth? What about this God who defends the weak and the little and the powerless? Where is the justice of God? Listening to Sarah and sending Ishmael away. Where is the justice of God asking Abraham to sacrifice his only son, the son whom he loves? In our 930 Sunday School class we were talking about the journey of Israel. I told them that the journey of Israel, one of the person in the class asked, what does it mean that these are God's chosen people? And I said, don't you understand what Israel is chosen to? It's chosen to suffer in. Jesus, Messiah, Christ, anointed one, chosen one, he's chosen to suffer. You are his church. You bear the image of the cross. Let me ask you this question. Will God, removing every difficulty from your life, answering every prayer and the affirmative, make you happy? If you have a little child and you give that child everything that child asks for, will you make that child happy? What will you do to that child? What does God really want to give you? I think God wants to give me a new car. Maybe He does. There's nothing wrong with a new car. I think God really wants me to get, wants to give me a great relationship. Maybe He does. There's nothing wrong with a great relationship. There's nothing wrong with all of the things that we want. There's nothing wrong with health. There's nothing wrong with prosperity. There's nothing wrong with success. There's nothing wrong with any of this. The thing wrong is with me! What God wants to give you is himself. In fact, not only his presence, but to make you like him. I don't mean to make you like him in terms of a Facebook liking, or to make you like him in terms of I like God, but to make you like God is. Which is love. The book of John, the first epistle to John, from John says, God is love. In him there is no darkness at all. What will it take to make us like that? He wants to give you his best. He wants to make you like him, able to love, able to live, by well being at your expense. And sometimes that takes ghastly and costly and unbearable pain in our lives, and promises that are put off, and difficult roads to travel. It's a cruciform path. It's in the shape of the cross. Love is patient. Love is kind. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It does not dishonor others. It is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered. It keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. The issue is not what can God give me to make me happy. The issue is how can I learn to love my enemy? How can I learn to love my adversary? How can I learn to love the other people that share my home? How can I learn to love the other people that share my workspace? How can I even learn to love the other people that attend my church? What is church? Is it a place where we are spiritually entertained? I found Pastor Paul's message this morning inspirational! Oh good! And I'm happy if you do. But what I really want for us is to learn how to love each other. Because that is the best that God wants for us. Is it a place to further a political agenda? Political agendas are important. They're fine. There are some that are better than others. I get that. But it's not about defeating communists. Here, now, it's Islamic fundamentalism that's the anyway. So everybody runs over to the other side of the room, decides they're going to be an atheist. Okay. A place to have God give you the things you say you want and need? Yeah, a therapist is a better therapist than your pastor is. I'm not a therapist. I may pray for you to get well, but I'm going to tell you to go see your doctor. Is it a place where you learn to grow, to sacrificially love? People who may or may not be the kind that you love. You need to be saved from yourself more than anything else in this world. Because everything else in this world you won't take with you, but yourself is yours for good. Jesus comes and does it for us at His expense. And then the question is, will we become disciplined and generous like the Father? When heaven invades earth, part of what that means sometimes is God steps in and says, I am able to save it all. And then He asks us, are you able to believe Me even when you don't get what you want? Or when things work like you don't think they should, do you still trust Me? Do you still believe Me? Are you still with Me? Let's pray. Lord, your eye is on the sparrow and they drop every day. And we drop every day. And so when things go wrong and when you don't back up the poor and the powerless, when you tell Abraham to listen to his wife Sarah who wants to kill Hagar and Ishmael by starvation in the desert, do we believe you? Do we trust you? Lord, it's our hearts that need to be broken. And Jesus comes and does it not with fear and threats, but at the cost of His own life. Help us to believe that you are for us in a way that we're not even for ourselves. And we believe that you are making us to be as you are, able to love enemies, able to forgive, able to forbear, and may we become like you. This we ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. Do you stand? Do you stand? Do you stand? Do you stand? Do you stand? The Lamb was shed for thee, and now the wind's been come to me. I will stand on the mountain of the Lord, I will stand on the mountain of the Lord, the Chancellor and the King he has to bring my soul a blinding light to you, who's blinded when he's tried for the dream of my life. Quiet! The Chancellor and the King he has will welcome one with friendly wings, because I promise I will live, for the Lamb of God is my Son. Quiet! The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you. The Lord turn his face towards you and give you his peace. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
