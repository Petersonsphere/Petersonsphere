 Hi, this is Paul and this is my Rough Draft for Sunday series where I walk through my sermon to the extent that it's done in preparation for Sunday. This week there was a bit in the news in the Washington Post about the boy who came back from heaven and in 2004 six-year-old Alex Malarkey drove home with his father Kevin in rural Ohio. A left turn nearly took his life. As Kevin turned the car it collided with another vehicle so the boy's skull became completely detached from his spinal cord. Alex did not die and that is the central fact between a long-running controversy that has now led to a lawsuit. Some of you may know that the father supposedly in conjunction with his very young son wrote this book about the boy's trip to heaven. Now a Christian publisher made something like 10 million dollars on this book but things didn't go so well for this family afterwards. In 2012 Alex's mother Beth Malarkey wrote several blog posts saying that her family was not in agreement with the content of the book. She expressed frustration with several people calling and visiting their home over the years saying Alex is just a boy not a statue to be worshipped or a person with some supernatural gifts and he does not go to heaven and have conversation with supernatural beings and whatever visions or experience he has had or has not had is up to him as to what he will do with those. Later this month she claimed that the book's account had been embellished adding the truth is getting twisted, distorted and packaged to be sold to the highest bidder. She also revealed that Alex himself had written a comment on the book's Facebook page in 2011 calling the book one of the most deceptive books ever. That comment was deleted and Alex was banned from commenting after the moderator suspected he was an imposter. Beth and Kevin Malarkey had become estranged since the book was published. This is actually a pretty sad story where the family not only is there the tragedy of the accident and the injuries and permanent damage that this young man has suffered but how this has torn up the family and now he is suing the publisher to have the book, to get the book pulled so that the publisher will no longer publish the book because the boy says none of this is true. And also he wants a piece of the money because he hasn't seen any of the money. And so this is a very sad story and I would imagine a lot of skeptics out there will cheer and say ha, see. OK. But my interest in this is more on the Christian side or really not even just the Christian side but a lot of people who jumped at the book and said aha here we have proof. Now one of the things that I notice as a pastor almost all the time is that people get some pretty basic things about Christianity wrong. Christianity is about going to heaven when you die and evangelism explosion. I think it was written by D. James Kennedy in the in the 60s was a very popular evangelistic technique where you'd go to someone and say do you know what will you say to your God to let him into your heaven. Now I don't think in and of itself that question is a bad one but it does continue to work on the idea that what Christianity is about is going to heaven when you die. Whereas Christians certainly do believe that that Christians when they die in the faith they will go to be with the Lord. This is what the Bible teaches. This is not the end of the story and this is not the whole story. People will also say things like the Bible tells you what you need to do to get to heaven. By B. I. B. L. E. Basic instructions before leaving earth. And I commonly find people believe that the Bible is a set of rules or descriptions that if you keep them you will achieve heaven and if you fail them you will you will get hell. The big part of the big part a big problem with all of this is that you don't need the resurrection for any of this. In fact the resurrection throws a monkey wrench into this because if you'd follow this basic narrative that good people go to heaven when they die well maybe you say well Jesus was a good person and he died on the cross and therefore he went to heaven. In fact this is not a new idea this is a very very old idea and it was really it was really put into what was called the Gnostic Gospels. Now every few years someone comes out with a Gnostic Gospel and peddles it as a suppressed gospel and this kind of gets everyone excited because they think oh yeah the big bad powerful church suppressed these works. Well not all but a number of these works came out before the church had any political power whatsoever and part of the reason that the church never looked upon these books as canonical is because the church looked at them and says it gets the basic story wrong. The story that the Bible is intending to tell is not here are the list of rules if you obey them or if you're a good person or if you are of the right tribe then you go to heaven when you die. That is not the story of the Bible. Now if you look at American beliefs however you would think that the Gnostics actually won. Pew Research Center does a lot of very interesting surveys on religion and public life and a few years ago they did a survey on what Americans believed on a variety of things in terms of mixtures of faith and spiritual ideas and lo and behold they discovered Americans in fact are not getting less religious they're getting more religious. In 2000 in 1990 the percentage of people who felt you were touched with someone who had already died 17 percent in 1990 18 percent in 1996 2009 29 percent it's a pretty significant jump. People who've seen a ghost that number doubled or seen or felt the presence of a ghost or would consult a fortune teller a psychic it's interesting that that number really didn't go anywhere and what's interesting is that this this kind of spirituality that you find in movies you find just just very commonly in America isn't isn't really Christianity. Now a lot of people associate it with Christianity and they associate it with the Bible but it's not really the story of the Bible and one of the big pieces that doesn't fit into that story that is absolutely the center of the New Testament is in fact the resurrection. Now the resurrection is not a story that tries to describe that there is life after death. The vast majority of people both today and in the ancient world believe there is life after death and in many respects both today and in the ancient world people were kind of foggy on what life after death would mean. In fact if you look at the Greek concept of Hades which is not too dissimilar to the the Old Testament the concept in the Hebrew scriptures called Sheol it's pretty undefined it's pretty murky. People commonly believe that something of the person goes on after this life but it was it was pretty up for grabs exactly what that would be. It's only in the intertestamental period between the end of the writing of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament that this much better formed view of resurrection came into being. You can find some of those ideas for example in the book of Daniel in the Old Testament. Now we've started this series on Easter and the church has these things called liturgical calendars and in the church liturgical calendar we are in the Easter time of year and Luke in chapter four begins the story like like all the other gospels the first day of the week early in the morning some women go to the tomb and they're going to finish the embalming that never was able to be completed in a proper fashion because these were observant Jews and they wanted to and they didn't want to violate the Sabbath so they came early in the morning they're worried about the stone they don't find they they find the stone has walked away they they walk in a young man slash angel slash messenger tells them Jesus is not here he told you this was going to happen and then the women go run over to the disciples tell them what happened Peter and John run back they don't see him either and then in Luke as we looked at in last week's sermon we have the story of the road to Emmaus and the road to Emmaus nicely shows nicely well you can listen to last week's sermon nicely shows what the resurrection is intended to mean for well that's that's what Luke is trying to communicate and then Luke ends his first book Acts will be his second book by by beginning to set this up so Luke 24 33 and following they got up and returned at once to Jerusalem these are the two individuals Cleopas and the other person either his wife or a friend they returned at once to Jerusalem they found the 11 and those with them speak again there is often a group of people around them it's not just the 11 and and we know this both in terms of a close reading of the canonical gospels and the study of the tradition and saying it is true the Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon then the two then the two then the two then the two told what had happened on the way how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread while they were still talking about this Jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you now that is a a common that was a it's basically a common phrase of saying of blessing when when Jews would would come together and greet one another they were startled and frightened thinking they saw a ghost he said to them why are you troubled and why do doubts rise in your minds look at my hands and my feet it is I myself touch me and see a ghost that does not have flesh and bones as you as you see I have now if you look at this this frightened which is the new international version renders um to raso as frightened it's in the passive here it's it's uh it's the kind of stunned shock where you see something and you can't get your mind around it and so what's happening here is as luke relays Jesus shows up amongst his disciples and they are shocked and I often a couple of years ago I was thinking about the resurrection and after my father had passed my father passed about five years ago after my father passed I began to wonder I said you know what what if my father showed up again actually there have been quite a few quite a few movies and tv series that have been playing with this theme over the last few years and I don't mean the walking dead where you come back as a zombie I mean people coming back and if my father were to show up at my door or if my father were to show up in the home now I would certainly recognize my father I knew my father very well um I would recognize him instantly I would recognize his voice um and but if such a thing were to happen what would I do what would I think how would I respond and I think it's very much like what you'll hear from first responders and police chaplains when they let's say there's a car accident or this happens in the military obviously if the military chaplain comes to the door of a family of a service of someone serving in the military during wartime he'll come to the door and of course everyone will say once once it once once the person answering the door sees the chaplain there they don't hear anything else it's it's just blank and this is this is almost the sense you have with the disciples that Jesus comes and he shows themself to him now this this in and of itself is a I shouldn't put my phone on the cheap plastic table If there's a resurrection how do you communicate this to it because how do you begin the conversation what do you do if you're Jesus and you well well what point are you making I mean okay so suppose I know some of you are skeptical and some of you profess this but I think in many ways hardly any of us really believe it deep in our minds what does it mean that he's alive again that's that's really the critical question that he's alive again yes what does it mean that he's alive and when we ask that question we're really asking how does this change my life how does this change how I should act how does this change how I will behave from day to day what will be some significant new ways that I act differently now that I wouldn't before let's say let's suppose my my father were to appear to me and and you know first of all I would probably think a ghost I mean that's that's that's simply the human category that you frame it in well I would you know what if I could touch him I you know right away I would certainly ask him what is this what what does this mean now obviously as a Christian pastor he was also a Christian reformed pastor I would say uh dad what does this mean okay once I get past the shock part I want to know what this means what how does my life now have to change and actually a lot of these movies that you watch and tv shows that you watch about people coming back from the dead that is the point of the show what then do you do with the person and again in past sermons I've said you know I would imagine that there would be a great desire desire to take Jesus and bring him to Pilate and say see look here he is see that the marks in the hands the mark in the side the mark on the feet um you know ha well ha what and there's this I should just put this into this I wanted to drop in a quote that I couldn't find I keep this blog so I can categorize and keep all of this stuff that I want to find and here I can't find the quote but there's a I don't remember who it's in a play or something maybe someone someone will think about in the comment section the comment section is better than google so I just want to all you all who comment and add value to this I just have to thank you but you know so there's this great it was in a play or something where where Herod hears that Jesus is a risen he throws a fit how dare he rise you know because the entire premise of how the world works is built on your ability to kill people and keep them dead and so resurrection just upsets the entire world order and so Jesus is alive what does that mean and and so Jesus has to try to convince the disciples then he said to them he showed them his hands and his feet and while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement now now Luke uses joy here as kind of a positive reaction to divine activity um but it's you know that again they're just shocked he says do you have anything to eat and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate it in their presence now obviously the point of this is that he's not a ghost he's real but again they're only just now at that moment they can't comprehend and in fact it's 2 000 years later we're still trying to figure out what this means that they saw this man now in fact the apostle paul will keep working on this and and they're going to keep working on this idea in terms of how they understood um you know Jewish theology to this point what this means for the overall story how this fits in because because Jesus doesn't go and you know do a dance in front of Pilate or show himself to Herod or you know say okay we're going to Rome because you know if Jesus went to Rome well I mean what would happen just play that for it in your mind so let's say you grab the centurion who crucified him the centurion said yep I'd crucify him you say you all get on a boat and you all go to Rome and you all show up in front of Caesar you say aha see um it doesn't work and so actually you know if you're a playwright or you know you can have a lot of fun with this which is what we do with our imaginations and with drama you can have a lot of fun trying to figure out what this means but but so in a sense what the new testament really is about is trying to explain what the resurrection of Jesus means and the creation of the church is really the product of the resurrection in the minds and lives and hearts of the witnesses of the resurrection and everyone who believed past them and and in fact again nt right who's um wrote this huge fat I don't have it here at home who wrote this huge fat book on the resurrection of the son of god you know he basically says this the single greatest piece of evidence for the historicity of the resurrection is the church itself and and the shape of that community and the changed lives of its people and how this moment reverberated through history whereas there were plenty of other Jewish revolutionaries at the time none of them changed the world like Jesus why not and t right says it's because of the resurrection now he said to them this is what I told you why you're still with you and it's like you can talk to people but they're not necessarily going to believe you everything must be fulfilled that is written about me and the law and the prophets and again last week's sermon I went through you know more of those old testament connections the law and the prophets and the psalms then he opened their minds so that they could understand the scriptures now that's well what does that mean and and now where is that in terms of of of Pentecost which is going to come with the Holy Spirit where we see this dramatic change and the disciples what does that mean does it mean that he talked to them does it mean like you know zing some spiritual thing happened it's it's it's left ambiguous and he told them or this is how he's telling them this is how he's opening their mind this is what it is written the Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations beginning in Jerusalem now you can see a little different message this is we're getting another piece of this than what we saw on the road to Emmaus from last week's sermon that that integral in this will be repentance well what do you mean by that now again I think within our cultural framework we tend to take this in an individualistic way and we think okay my sins can be forgiven so I can go to heaven when I die and again if if if that is how you define Christianity you have reduced it to a smaller component than the much larger component that it is but but it's clearly about changing the story and it's clearly about changing the story as understood through the whole scope of the Bible and Jesus says you are witnesses of these things that is the role that the disciples and the apostles will play they will be witnesses they will go out and people will say raised from the dead huh and they'll say yep I saw it and here are the details and here are other people who saw him and if you want evidence of something look at how my life changed now again let's let's run this tape back and let's say I see my father my father shows up to me and you know he's not a ghost he's not a spirit he's not something I dream of but he's alive and what that means is again in Jesus case for the next 40 days Jesus is going to be on and off with his disciples and you know again if I were to if I were to come to you and say yeah my father has been visiting me you'd say okay well you see me in your dreams nope nope he's coming to visit me in the flesh and you'd say um are you have you been drinking um let's see a primary care physician and maybe get a psychological evaluation and you know because this is not normal you're breaking the story now the real question as to whether or not I would be insane whether or not I will I had a some psychotic break from reality will in fact be my behavior because here's the thing people people often say to me well they're crazy well I know I know people who struggle with mental illness they struggle with mental illness in fairly predictable ways now they do unpredictable things but we we see the pattern it's integrated into our worldview and what happens in the resurrection of Jesus is that his resurrection completely changes how his disciples and his followers act to the to the degree that human history from this point on changes dramatically and the vehicle for that change is in fact the church now I know you think well church people getting together and doing weird things like worshiping and singing and and maybe doing some good things like feeding the homeless or maybe doing some crappy things like lobbying against the kind of politics you want etc etc etc whatever you think of it the history of the world changed and and it wasn't along the lines of how the world had changed before it it changed the world to such a degree that what was at the end of the first century kind of this minor heretical Jewish movement in 300 years would become significant enough that Constantine would adopt it and try to adopt that religion as the religion of the empire and it would continue to grow to the place that it is now something happened. Now to fit this in though you want to fit it into the story now again the story this is my Genesis 1 representation the the story of the Bible begins with and the Lord created the heavens and the earth and one of the things that I often tell people is that most of the time when Christians are talking about well Christianity means going to heaven when you die the story gets transformed into heaven and hell but but actually if you read the Bible the story isn't really between heaven and hell the story is between the relationship of heaven and earth and I will tell people things like hell isn't really in the Bible now everyone will gasp and I say that to get the effect and I say in the New Testament you have Gehenna and Hades and I'm not denying the Christian doctrine of hell but what I'm saying is that the main story of the Bible is the relationship between heaven and earth and the story begins like this God creates heaven and earth and Genesis chapter 1 heaven and earth is very good and God fills it with his glory and Genesis 1 is a temple text which means that in a sense heaven and earth is his temple and then in Genesis 2 the garden is is the palace garden of the great king who owns heaven and earth but now the gardeners rebel and instead of just killing the gardeners God does something extraordinary he in a sense withdraws to heaven with his presence so as not to destroy the owners of the rebellion on earth and in fact is in his retreat there's a degree of mercy but heaven and earth are therefore cut off and you see that played out in the early chapters of Genesis with for example the tower of Babel the tower of Babel is an attempt to use political and in their case construction technology to build a staircase to heaven led zeppelin she's building a staircase to heaven why she want to go up to heaven she wants to build a staircase to heaven in order to take control of heaven because as NT Wright notes heaven is the control room of earth and that's why astrology in the ancient world if you wanted to know what was going to happen on earth you looked up into heaven because history moved from heaven down to earth and if you get into the symbolism conversations like our friend Jonathan Pagel is getting into you know what why and for examples for example in the I can't think of those Marvel comic um the Avengers why does everything always come in through a portal from heaven well there's something deep in us about this you know it's either coming from the an in pacific rim from the depths of the ocean or it's coming down from heaven and and so this is the story this is how we tell stories this is how we naturally kind of frame these kinds of stories and so you have the development of Israel and and Israel is designed Israel is in a sense God's landing back into enemy occupied earth and Israel is to embody God's kingdom and Israel does so so poorly God calls down the Babylonians to destroy his temple and that then sets up the exile and sets up the you know the second temple which isn't as good as the first temple and that sets up the whole story until we get to Jesus but as you will find in the Lord's prayer in the Sermon on the Mount our father who art in heaven because that is God's temple hallowed be your name we worship him may your name be great your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven right there in that phrase is in a sense the entire story of the Bible this is the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of God what the whole story of the Bible is about and this is in fact how the resurrection fits in so if you look for example in the book of Colossians in chapter one there's this there's this beautiful song the son is the image of the invisible God the first born over all creation this is the logos at creation and and it is saying that Jesus there's here identifying Jesus with the logos as in John he's the first born over all creation for in him all things were created things in heaven and on earth notice it's not heaven and hell it's heaven and earth visible and invisible it's not just the stuff here it's the spiritual powers and principalities as well whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities and and this was thinking about you know the heavenly powers that everyone in the ancient world were assuming were were governing history all these things have been created through him and for him he was before all things and in him all things hold together now there's way more than we can comment on just in this passage this is an incredibly rich passage and he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead well what is that referring to that's referring to the resurrection he is the firstborn among the dead now the reason they say firstborn is because within the story the the the people that Jesus is talking to all imagine that the resurrection is coming and for example when you get to the story of of Mary and Martha and Lazarus Lazarus or Martha says I know that I'll see Lazarus my brother at the resurrection Jesus says I am the resurrection and the life and so we see here is in the resurrection this then fits into the story he is the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy he in fact now well the Bible says this in a in a number of ways and we're going to see them in a number of these passages for example at the end of Matthew all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me that's what Jesus says now again I often say to people people say well I don't know if I can believe in the virgin birth I say you know okay I understand your skepticism and your pause but you're really going to pick on the virgin birth do you hear what the guy says at the end of the book of Matthew all authority in heaven and earth has been given to me that's a big claim and and again if you get that into your head you have to begin to ask yourself how am I going to live how do I need to behave if I truly believe that is true oh I have an idea of what to put in here as some of you know I made a video this week on Jordan Peterson's conversation and at Lafayette Lafayette College in Pennsylvania and one of the really good questions was you know what is religion and Peterson's answer was religion is however you act you know basically how you express in action your axiomatic beliefs well that's a little bit philosophical language but religion is whatever it is you believe that prompts you to live the way you live and and this is exactly what's happening now with the disciples and and it's exactly what's happening with this this Colossians passage where this well if you believe he's he's risen from the dead and he is the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have supremacy for God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether things on earth or in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on the cross and right there you have the gospel and that's why the gospel isn't here are some rules and if you behave them you go to heaven when you're dying somehow you achieve heaven that is not the gospel the gospel is Jesus by his crucifixion and resurrection inaugurates the new creation and creates reconciliation by which we can join him in the renovation of new things Paul continues on Paul continues on once you were alien from God and were enemies in your mind because of your evil behavior oh what does that mean your evil behavior well you are living out what you actually believed but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you wholly in his sight without blemish and free from accusation if you continue in your faith established and firm and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel this is the gospel that you have heard and that which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven of which I Paul have become a servant a couple of years ago I was having some fun with a group and I asked them about how you know how whether squirrels go to heaven and of course they all you know souls blah blah blah blah there's a trick question of course because the idea is that in creation 2.0 what Christ inaugurates is the renewal of all things it is we're heading towards the new heavens and the new earth and well I remember I remember a story told to me by my father of my grandfather where so my father my grandfather is pastoring all these all these churches out in the prairie during the depression and and one one farmer asked my grandfather will there be cows in heaven now again you got to forgive you some of this language because when you say in heaven people are theologically incorrect and inaccurate because the better question would be are there cows on the new earth okay so are there cows in heaven are there cows on the new earth and my grandfather answered something to the effect of well if you need them to be there they probably will and the reason the reason that this farmer said he was a dairyman like how many other Dutch immigrants he said because there's I I know no other I know norm I know no more beautiful thing than the look in a calf's eyes when it's born I thought wow I've never seen a calf's eyes when it's born but this obviously struck that farmer with a sense of beauty and and he connected that beauty and and somehow knew somehow saw God's glory in the face of that calf and and this is why if you believe the gospel is just if you do good things you go to heaven when you die you have such a reduced gospel that you've almost rung we haven't rung all the joy out of it because there's way more joy in that than believing yeah when you die you're in the ground the joy is bigger the joy is fuller the joy is richer because what we're actually looking for is a new heaven and a new earth and you find this in revelation 21 then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and there was no longer any sea now again there's way more here than I can talk about right near this is this isn't that God hates the ocean this has everything to do with chaos and order I saw the holy city the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband and I heard in a loud voice from the throne saying look God's dwelling is now among the people and they will do and he will dwell with them and they will be his people and God himself will be with them and they will be and he God himself will be with them and be their God he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away well what's the point of that why did something happen to the old heaven no the point of this is the resurrection the point of this is that Jesus comes and they see him in the flesh and he says I want you to know that it's me and I want you to connect me to the old testament and I'm going to enlighten the eyes of your heart so that you may begin to understand the story and this story may frame your life and and the new world will already begin in my flesh and it will already begin in your heart and it will already begin out there in the world and it is coming and we all like the disciples look at him and try to get our heads around what does this mean how does this work and immediately what we what we really want to do is to control it which we can't do we can't even control ourselves then I saw the new heaven and the new earth for I just read that oh then I saw the new heaven and the new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away revelation does this back and forth thing quite a bit with its stories and there was no longer any scene I saw the holy city the new Jerusalem I did read this yep I did this is why I do rough drafts and practicing misery and you'll notice again I am and almost all my sermons misery deliverance gratitude why because this helps me frame this terribly difficult dynamic about what does God do and what does we what do we do and how do our actions and God's actions fit together misery when you see something you can't understand it's doubt and it's stupor and and it's denial and disbelief and not accepting and and this is exactly what happens with Jesus and the disciples because they can't get it around their minds and then they see him and they're they're filled with joy and amazement but they don't know what to say they don't know what to do in fact the entire story of the church can be framed as figuring out what to do now that Jesus is risen and this in the midst of our our half-believing hearts and you'll notice how many times in the resurrection story Jesus tells them you don't believe any of this do you why won't you start believing and and that's probably what we should keep asking ourselves why won't we start believing why can't we start believing and seeing where Jesus fits into the story and and and trusting that all of this is true because if we actually believe this is true we would not have the kind of worry and not have the kind of fear and not have the kind of doubt and not have the kind of anxiety and not have the kind of of of need of anxious need to control because we would know that the story of heaven and earth is finally a story that is far better than what we can possibly ask or imagine this is something done for you that you could not do yourself could you raise Jesus from the dead no can you raise yourself from the dead no you can't do it it's a gift that's why we talk about grace it is something to be received not achieved now i've spent this whole week dealing with meek and how to understand meek and all of this stuff misery deliverance gratitude we we're we're i'll let the door open so my dog could get in and out and i let all the bugs in um we're clueless we we don't understand we're we're faithless we stumble we trip up we our egos get in the way we try to control things we hurt one another we hurt each other we can't keep our word we we we wobble we fail we trip we fall and then our bodies break down and and then we have excuses for all this crap we do this is how we are god out of his mercy sends his son and we kill him and he even uses this to change the story and change the story in a way that blesses us so faith itself is a gift and and you don't choose what you believe and again people will come to me sometimes and say you know pastor but i don't believe this stuff i'll say okay you know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna really crunch down on you for that why because you're not in control of your beliefs you're not in charge of them you don't wake up one day thinking i'm gonna believe in i'm gonna believe in leprechauns you know maybe if you're irish and you believe in leprechauns you do otherwise you don't you don't choose your beliefs but now we're gonna get into jonathan now we're gonna get into jonathan heights rider and the elephant because even though you don't choose your beliefs you do choose how you behave and and and you don't choose what you want to believe but if you begin to want to believe something better if you begin to want to believe a better story you can begin to act as if it's true so that the elephant which is you know all of the stuff that's really determining a lot of what we how we behave the rider begins to train the elephant and begins to retrain the elephant in the light of the resurrection and begins to believe that in fact well as we started the sermon as many people leave my my physical death won't be the end of the story okay but am i left in all these you know books about this person went but he lied and another person went and he was debunked and blah blah blah blah blah no you go back and you look at the resurrection of jesus and you begin building from there and you begin by saying what if this isn't the end of the story what if the the mire and the cloudiness and and all of the ways that i can't put things together now is only you know kind of like a newborn who's trying to use his hands what if in the resurrection i will finally be freed of my sins and freed of this cloudiness and and what if in the resurrection i will actually we sing in in amazing grace 10 000 years and and we've no less days to sing god's praise than when we first begun 10 000 years and we've we've got no no fewer days to sit and talk philosophy or to enjoy sports in a new creation or to enjoy the new creation one that we don't sully or you know on and on and on and on what if i actually believe that how would i live my life differently how would i be more filled with joy how would i be more generous how would i be how would i be not anxious and if you begin to understand this then you go back and you read everything jesus teaches it begins to make sense and you begin to say if i really believed in the resurrection i would be a totally different person yeah that's what i should be that's what he wants for me and here's the here's the thing that someone might be listening to me and say yeah you'd be you'd be crazy but again here's the thing i i deal with a lot of street people and and people who are homeless and people who are alcoholics and drug addicts and and bipolar and schizophrenic and and schizoaffective i deal with that all the time in terms of where my church is and all the group homes in my neighborhood i deal with that all the time if you really believed in the resurrection you wouldn't be that kind of crazy what kind of crazy would you be you would be generous you would you would not be subject to anxiety and worry and and you might say no i can't just choose to believe this and you'd i'd say no that's right you can't just choose to believe this if you want to believe this you're going to have to start to act as if this is true you're going to have to start to live as if this entire story that is in the bible is your story well that's about response how you respond if i really believe this well if there is no response well then you probably don't believe it because the truth is if my father walked into this room and sat down i'd probably put him on youtube then again that's that's something for for people who write television shows and movies to think about but how would you respond if if there's if the resurrection doesn't mean any change in your life you probably don't believe it and i know that sounds harsh and you might say well i want to believe it more well good me too well how can i believe it more by living within the story living as if it's true over time sometimes a very long time to us it begins to sink in the resurrection has begun the renewal of all things has begun it has started it has started in you but is not complete um the apostle paul says externally we are wasting away we are aging the age of decay is robbing us of everything but inside new life is beginning to live and and what does that mean it means again that that i don't have to be worried that i can i can be less anxious because of the breaking down of my body i can be less anxious because of you know all of the things that the age of decay steals from me that this is not the final story and when you think about this i mean just just live into it in your mind live into the resurrection live into the new heavens and the earth live into him making all things new how does that change you doesn't it make you happier doesn't it make you less anxious doesn't it make you freer doesn't it say that even though politics goes wrong or your finances go wrong or or or you have a terrible illness i should put mabel into this sermon yeah i'm going to put mabel into the sermon and you say well who's mabel what do you mean you're going to put mabel into the sermon uh john ortberg in his book the life you've always wanted tells the story of he actually gets it from someone else gets it from a man named tom smith and i'm not going to read all this in my sermon because it would take too long and i've got to stick to a 30-minute window i don't have the luxury of two hours in a biblical series of of rambling although i ramble on youtube plenty um which is why i'm going to ramble now um tells this amazing story of nate of mabel the state-run convalescent hospital is not a pleasant place it is large understaffed and overfilled with senile and helpless and lonely people who are waiting to die this is a true story by the way on the brightest of days it seems dark inside in the smell of sickness and stale urine and i've been in many of these kind of nursing homes over the years and many of you know exactly what i'm talking about i went there once or twice a week for four years but i never wanted to go there i always left with a sense of relief and it's not the kind of place one gets used to on a particular day i was walking in a hallway that i had not visited before looking in vain for a few who were alive enough to receive a flower and a few words of encouragement this hallway seemed to contain some of the worst cases strapped into carts into wheelchairs or looking completely helpless as i near the end of the hallway i saw an old woman strapped to a wheelchair her face was an absolute horror i'm gonna make the text bigger her face was an absolute horror the empty stare and white pupils of her eyes told me that she was blind the large hearing aid over one ear told me that she was also almost half-dead one side of her face was being eaten by cancer there was a discolored and running sore covering part of one cheek and it had pushed her nose to one side dropping one eye and distorted her jaw so that what should have been the corner of her mouth was the bottom of her mouth as a consequence she drooled constantly i was later i was told later that when new nurses arrived the supervisors would send them to feed this woman thinking that if they could stand the site they could stand anything in the building i also learned later that this woman was 89 years old and that she had been there bedridden blind nearly deaf and alone for 25 years this was mabel i don't know why i spoke to her i cry every time i read this story i don't know why i spoke to her she looked less likely to respond than most of the people i saw in the hallway but i put a flower in her hand and said here is a flower for you happy mother's day she held the flower up to her face and tried to smell it and then she spoke and much of my surprise her words although somewhat garbled because of her deformity were obviously produced by a clear mind she said thank you it's lovely but can i give it to someone else i can't see you know i'm blind i said of course and i pushed her chair and i pushed her in her chair back down the hallway to a place where i thought she could find some alert patients i found one and i stopped the chair mabel held out the flower and said here this is from jesus that was when it began to dawn on me that this was not an ordinary human being later i wheeled her back to her room and learned more about her history she had grown up on a small farm that she managed with only her mother until her mother died then she ran the farm alone until 1950 when her blindness and sickness sent her to the convalescent hospital for 25 years she got weaker and sicker with constant headaches back aches and stomach aches and then the cancer came too her three roommates were all human vegetables who screamed occasionally but never talked they often soiled their bedclothes and because the hospital was understaffed especially on sundays when i usually visited the stench was often overpowering mabel and i became friends over the next few years and i went to and i went to see her once or twice a week for the next three years her first words to me were usually an offer of hard candy from a tissue box near her bed someday i would read to her from the bible and often i would pause she would continue reciting the passages from memory word for word on other days i would take a book of hymns and sing with her and she would know all those words from the old songs for mabel they were not merely exercises in memory she would stop in mid-hymn and make a brief comment about the lyrics she considered particularly relevant to her own situation i never heard her speak of loneliness or pain except in the stress she placed on certain lines in certain hymns it was not many weeks before i turned from a sense that i was being helpful to a sense of wonder and i would go to her with pen and paper to write down the things she would say during one hectic week of final exams i was frustrated because my mind seemed to be pulled in 10 different directions with all of the things that i had to think about the question occurred to me what does mabel have to think about hour after hour day after day week after week not even able to know if it's day or night so i went to her and asked mabel what do you think about when you lie there she said i think about my jesus i sat there and thought for a moment about the difficulty for me of thinking about jesus for even five minutes and i asked what do you think about jesus she replied slowly and deliberately as i wrote i think about how good he's been to me he's been awfully good to me in my life you know i'm one of those kind who most who's mostly satisfied lots of folks wouldn't care for what i think lots of folks would think i'm kind of old-fashioned but i don't care i'd rather have jesus he's all the world to me and then mabel began to sing an old hymn jesus is all the world to me my life my joy my all he's my strength from day to day without him i would fall when i am sad to him i go no other one can cheer me so when i am sad he makes me glad he's my friend this is not fiction incredible as it may be a human being really lived like this i know i knew her how could she do it seconds tick and minutes crawled and so did days and weeks and months and years of pain without human company and without an explanation of why it was all happening and she lay there and sang hymns how could she do it my answer i think is that mabel had something that you and i don't have much of she had power lying there in that bed unable to move unable to see unable to hear unable to talk to anyone she had incredible power here was an ordinary human being who received supernatural power to do extraordinary things here was an entire life consisted of following jesus as best she could in her situation patient endurance of suffering solitude prayer meditation on scripture worship fellowship when it was possible giving when she had a flower or a piece of candy to offer imagine in her condition and saying i think about how good he's been to me he's been so awfully good to me in my life you know i'm one of those kinds who's mostly satisfied this is the 23rd psalm coming to life the lord is my shepherd i shall not be in want for anyone who really saw mabel who was willing to turn aside a hospital bed became a burning bush a place where this ordinary pain-filled world was visited by the presence of god when others saw the life in that hospital bed they wanted to take off their shoes the lid was off the terrarium then the turn came with a catch of the breath and the beating of the heart and tears they were standing on holy ground do you believe such a life is possible for a human being that's mabel it's a powerful story it does not compete with a resurrection it fits into the resurrection it's nested within the resurrection now you might say well blessed are the meek blessed are the meek if they're like mabel because she will inherit the new earth c.s lewis and the great divorce has this amazing piece where there's this virtual parade in heaven and and and the the the protagonist says who's this about i don't recognize that woman and the point is this is a woman that no one would have ever known this is a mabel she's a saint she has power everyone in this world looks at her and says no she has no power she's a woman she's disabled she's been living in a crappy nursing home for 25 years no she has power she has the kind of power that most of us don't dream of having well how is that power displayed well if you understand her power you can begin to understand the gospel and if you have any sense at all you'll desire it for yourself well well how can i get that kind of power how can i get my slide what concrete steps do i need to take well look at how mabel got it she got it through suffering so i don't want to suffer well you're not going to have much power will you participate which is retraining through actions and they're not big grandiose actions they're the kind of they're the kind of kindnesses you do to the people you live with they're the kind of kindnesses you do to the people you work with the kind of kindnesses you do to total strangers but in a way that nobody else knows about will you participate will you worship will you participate will you worship worship a dear friend of mine said to me you know i don't understand church you sing some songs and it's hard for me to try to explain but what we're doing when we're worshiping is we're retraining our heart now now if you had a friend who was in love with someone who they would never that you knew they would never get i mean this is a story of chivalry um story of don Quixote um you might say no don't don't waste your time pining after this woman uh it's never going to happen well worshiping is in a sense that pining it's it's where we practice um liturgically communally together we begin to retrain our hearts and refocus and the only way mabel had that power was she was probably that lady who went to church every sunday nobody paid any attention to her yeah some of the other ladies knew what gold she was but if you walked in that church and you looked at her you'd never you'd never pay any attention to her and this is what the bible talks about all the time with with god putting his glory in in cracked pots in broken vessels well that's mabel and and this one this one guy who finally finally wrote the story the story got picked up by another off another pastor i'll tell you we're not just liars we're thieves we steal stories and we and we take them and we promote them because the story this good needs to be told and the thing is you might say wow that's a that's a really unusual story like a miracle you'd be surprised how often i see stories like it maybe not this extreme but saints who no one will ever notice yeah they might have some weird things in their life yeah they might have some ideas that i look at say that's a bad idea they might have some terrible ideas but don't we all have terrible ideas this is what god does well how do you get there will you live a life of gratitude will you participate will you worship will you grow will you follow your master wherever he leads trust loyalty endurance and suffering so do you believe in the resurrection well you think believing in the resurrection is is something that just is something that sits in my head no it's what you act out and it's what you live because if you believed in the resurrection if you believed in the story of the bible it would make it would give you power and now you might say i don't want the kind of power that mabel has and i would understand that because you don't want to suffer the way mabel has suffered and you don't want to be disciplined the way mabel was disciplined and you don't want to devote yourself to that kind of life okay well these are the choices that you make and i have to answer from my choices too but when you get a sense of mabel you probably see glory
