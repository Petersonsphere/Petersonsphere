 Hi, this is Paul. It's been a while. Sorry for my sudden absence. Many of you might have read the note or got word that Last two weeks ago Wednesday. I got a call from my mother that my younger sister had she was watching TV watching the news with her husband after work and he saw that she had slumped over in the chair and He noticed that she was gasping and So he went right over to her and she was unresponsive. He called 9-1-1 the paramedics came they Worked on her for quite a while in the driveway. They were unable to resuscitate her. They took her to the hospital they were unable to resuscitate her there either and She passed away likely almost immediately right there in the chair in her home with my brother-in-law and And There's always confusion when you get these kinds of phone calls at first My father five years ago had passed away in a similar manner. He was 77, but my younger sister she's the one in the the little red the white blouse and Red plaid skirt here in this picture taken of us when we were children she was 53 and her death was a Surprise and a shock to all of us and She lives on the East Coast. So Once I got news I immediately jumped on got a flight and The next day flew out and I've been on the East Coast since and just came back to Sacramento Yesterday evening and coming back is Getting back. This is a holiday weekend in the United States with Thanksgiving Day approaching There's work things that need doing there's family things that need doing The family out East continues obviously with a death like this Continues to be a major disruption. And so we're all grieving and we're all trying to get into the new normal and support my brother-in-law and my mother and my Nephew and nieces She had three children with my brother-in-law So it's it's it's a it's a big deal and that's the reason I've been gone For a while and haven't been making videos quite obviously but as I've been dealing with my own grief and working through this stuff the Kinds of things that I talked about in my channel continue to roll through my head and I've been thinking about mapping I remember when I first saw maps of meaning I thought why maps and so I've been Thinking a lot about maps and thinking about how you'll attempted to map the unconscious and how Jordan Peterson Maps meaning and psychology and so with all the learning I've been doing over the last year I've been doing a lot of thinking on these subjects So for a dive into that I first want to thank you for for your thoughts and prayers many of you have sent me emails or or messages in messages in the comments section On Twitter on Facebook, and I deeply appreciate all those expressions Jonathan Peugeot Sent me a note and and he told Jordan Peterson about my sister's passing and in the midst of his crazy schedule he also sent me a Couple of emails and that was that was deeply appreciated for him to take time out of his schedule So it might take a little bit of time for me to return to normal programming I use this to process. I'll probably be doing a rough draft for Sunday This coming Friday after the holiday this Thursday But bit by bit, I'll get back into it. I'll probably be taking another trip out East my mother and my brother-in-law can use my support and so and obviously that Lien lens to a disruption here on the church side and we'll be figuring those things out as we move forward and Sorry for all the people that got bumped in terms of conversations I had a whole slew of conversations planned and most of them got cancelled and in time we can reschedule And and at some point I intend to return things back to normal in fact, I've got some new ideas for for patreon some online meetup ideas and some ideas for some more formal theological classes that I'm going to give and so I've In a time like this you tend to have time to think and time to ponder and so I've been pondering this channel And and so I have some new ideas that I I hope to be able to roll out One of the things that that I was pondering is why does a close death bother us so much and These botherings are are deep in fact this kind of grief People die from sometimes That's a strange thing if we imagine that we're just these these material animals And and you know if you watch remember watching Jane Goodall watching chimps grieve for the the loss of their loved ones, but for us as human beings What exactly is the nature of our ties to one another it's obvious that it does but it isn't Obvious why it does what is the nature of the what is the nature of the connections? What is the nature of the connections between us how do our mappings impact grief the motivation to share Condolences the shape of these words. I've been thinking a lot about that. My sister was a Christian schoolteacher and She left Classes of middle school children. She was an English teacher she left classes of middle school middle school children in the lurch and and some of these sixth graders came through the Receiving line at visiting hours. We'd probably had over 600 people show up at visiting hours My sister deeply impacted many many lives had over 700 people at her service and at some point once we The the service was videotaped and I did do a I did have a part in that and so I'll post post links at least or maybe More to to some of those things as they become available but these these little sixth graders who are they're just starting Mrs. Johnson's class and and now to have their teacher die and to go past the casket and see what sort of looks like their teacher there in the casket and For them to ponder and then and then need us strangers My my heart really went out to those those little sixth graders that are just kind of reeling from this and She was a tremendously popular teacher in her school Many people came through the line and and said that they themselves had had her pause for a minute get a drink So some people who came through the line had had her when they were going to that particular school and then Their children had had her and she was a tremendously popular teacher She she touched a lot of students and many people came through the lives and the line and and shared those stories with us and it was Left quite an impression and and as someone who's grieving a sister who didn't know That side of her life as much as I knew other sides of her life It was it was a tremendous comfort and it was a it was a beautiful thing While I was in while I was my wife took a picture of me and in my mother's basement because I laughed sometimes my wife and I talk about Some some of the buckos as basement dwellers living in their mother's basement and here I was living in my mother's basement But I was I I started rereading CS Lewis's a grief observe and and one of the things that Douglas Gresham That's the CS Lewis's stepson wrote In the introduction to a grief observed Was was was the note of as always CS Lewis was amazingly careful with his language a grief observed All of these all of these griefs are different and my mother My father passed away about five years ago But this is a different kind of grief for my mother than losing a husband who was 77 years old This is a different kind of grief when my aunt passed away last year my aunt that my mother was close to This is a different kind of grief for me grieving a younger sister rather than my father I'm I'm familiar with grief being a pastor Walking with people through grief in church. We had a a grief share classic Ran through it a couple of times at our church and I led it once and there's a lot that you can learn about grief, but but every grief is different and It's different because our mappings with these other people Are different to my relationship with my father is not the relationship with my sister and and all the differences Are manifest in in this complex experience Of grief and grief is a different kind of grief of grief Tim keller notes in his what I think was probably my favorite book of his walking with god through pain and suffering Notes that people have very different experiences of what they find comforting Some people just want to be sat within silence. Some people want to hear Religious ideas and religious sentiments Um Rehearsed and they find those things comforting other people find talk of god or the afterlife or heaven Or a better place or or something like that offensive when they're in an angry painful place in grief And and it was helpful in in tim keller's book where he noted that as a pastor he's found that That people grieve differently and they find Different things comforting while they're grieving some people You know don't want to see any pictures of the deceased while others wish to surround themselves with pictures of the deceased My brother-in-law with his children was began watching some some videos of of when their children Were young and small and they found that comforting others would find that to be too much and it's it's very idiosyncratic and individual What people find comforting and so often as a pastor i'll i'll encourage people to You know be free with it and explore and if you find something comforting Okay, but if someone is trying to comfort you in another way That you're not finding comforting if you have the ability Be a little gracious towards them because in many cases people are people are well-meaning We've we've developed in our culture a license to be offended and suffering often And and we might want to yell to someone you're trying to comfort me wrong And in fact, that's a long old story because the most famous comforters in the bible were job's friends And job called them miserable comforters. And in fact at the end of the book of job God was quite unhappy with those comforters. So so comforters ought to take a bit of care and and be a little sensitive Um, but but those who are grieving if if they have the capacity You know, it's it's it's helpful to also be Be generous Towards those who who really do want to express um Express their condolences One of the things that I ponder when I when I watch this dynamic are the mirror neurons And psychologists will talk about how when we see pain we feel pain and that's a powerful motivational structure And in fact in the jordan peterson sam harris conversations Those Those mirror neurons Are highly powerful in terms of motivation and I often find that that when people see someone in pain Because we are also experiencing pain then we want to pull back and we want to push away So there's there's a lot of that dynamic going on suffering is contagious And and so often what people do when they come to to bring comfort to the grieving Is that they speak what is comfortable to themselves? And again, this is part of the idiosyncratic nature of grieving and and so again when people come up and they And they have to share what they have to share Their It's probably the ideas that most comfort them when when they're Experienced experiencing and being confronted with the pain that they see in the eyes of the of the bereaved And and to me simple is good oftentimes people come through the line and they simply say my condolences and I personally find that to be to be very appropriate because As with this death there's there's little that can be said It was such a surprise. It was such a shock And and by the nature of it People want to again this the the mirror neuron thing often Props people to try to find reasons for it or holy reasons for it Like god wanted this or god is doing that and god needs this and in my experience those are Those can be rather hazardous things to share because If you've lost a loved one you're not you're not looking out for what god is wanting because pain is Pain in a sense makes us selfish it pulls us in and and it occupies us and we're just Looking for comfort and so often just just a simple expression of My condolences i'm praying for you. My thoughts are with you I find to be just the simplest way for one person to say to the other I see your pain and i'm sorry for you And of course, I don't I don't share the depths of the pain that you experience But but you are not alone in your pain I am I am with you in it even for just this moment or to this small degree And and I personally find that to be comforting and and I deeply appreciate those who those who do so It shares the heart of it that you are not alone in your suffering, especially a suffering that can't be blunted But now this brings into ourselves the maps because We commonly point to a blessed afterlife which is part of our religious mapping. It's part of our cultural mapping It's part of our social mapping and obviously for for many atheists who don't believe in an afterlife it gets more difficult because well You can say at least they're in no pain because if you're an you're an atheist then you know, there is no pain It's it's the nothingness you experienced before before life that that now you experience after there is no experience It's it's not even no experience. It's just null value So so what happens often when when we're processing our own grief And and when we're and when we're people we're trying to console others in grief is that we're we're actually expressing our Internal maps our religious theological social culture maps. It often surprises people when I tell them that as a pastor I I don't really know how to phrase this but I find funerals Often to be more productive and meaningful than weddings now weddings are more joyful in a sense because Here is a young couple in love and we're all gathered here to celebrate their love and to wish them well and that's a that's a wonderful thing, but but funerals as a pastor are tremendously productive because We play all kinds of mental games with our mapping but but when we're faced with death Suddenly we have to get very serious about what we believe And and what we think is true and what we hope for and it's been my experience that often When we're facing death when we're looking into that coffin when when we're confronted with that grave that now we can Cut through a bunch of the facades And games that we play That that we can talk seriously and honestly About what we believe about our doubts And so I find grief and and and this space to be Productive it's a hard space. It's a painful space, but it's a productive space and and for me this gets into something that i've said along the line along the way in my processing of peterson that that will Will exchange will exchange suffering for meaning a meaning is that valuable to us and that important that That now when we grieve We're ready to do some work And and so our our maps our our religious maps our spiritual maps our social maps our cultural maps They they then shape our words and part of it is wrote Um, my condolences to you and your loss. I'm sorry for your loss Um These things these things shape our words and so we have these these liturgies that we rehearse and speak to one another but but it's also part assertion and hope and and so when Sometimes again because of the mirror neurons people will want to jump past the pain When they see the pain in my eyes or the eyes of the bereaved they that that We don't want to feel pain and so well well they're in heaven and they're not suffering and and when we do that where It's it's in a sense pushing back the pain of the other and and short cutting it and so my I'll often advise people not to shortcut the pain If they can tolerate it because again The pain tends to focus us And sharpen us the the difficulty with pain is that it also makes us selfish and also makes us desperate And sometimes the pain overwhelms us Which is which is again why it is good to be around others who are feeling the same grief so that When one is overwhelmed by the pain the other can be there with them in pain One of the one of the things that the the then Chaplain of calvin college dale cooper when I was going there used to repeat In many of his sermons and I probably remember it because he repeated it in his sermons that that joy shared Is joy multiplied? But pain shared is pain divided And so when we're in pain It is helpful to share that pain because the pain is then divided and we are not alone in our pain And again, we know this to be true why it is true Is far harder to know but we know that it is true The pain is isolating and in some ways can be self-indulgent. It is a wound that demands to be nursed My thoughts also go to consciousness and suffering because the the grief is As i've said many times our conscious mind is just this this one Small element of our overall minds and and consciousness is like this cloud That that the space that the elements of the world enter into and recede out of and the consciousness is the place Where all of the various layers of our mapping come to the fore and and so with grief immediately obviously When the first shock comes the pain overwhelms and and consciousness fills or is flooded with that pain But but parts of our mind continue to grieve even while You know our body is our body is is smart I was watching we we grieve differently at different ages Children who are young again those little sixth graders came through the line And you know almost in shock. They don't know what to say. They don't know what to do They stand back and so then then loving adults come around them and begin to train them in the words of grief And and you know, even though I was grieving the loss of my sister Seeing those children come through, you know compassion weld up and and we go from You know, there's kind of a switch that goes and now even in the in the midst of my pain I i'm motivated to bring consolation to that child who is grieving or Or when when I see my mother or my sister or my brother-in-law or or my nephew or nieces Or my children, you know When that when the grief floods in we come together and we embrace and we cry together and we hug And it's hard to know how to talk about that that particular moment of pain and pleasure All mixed together, but there's a solidarity And and then and there's even In some moments can be a joy There's meaning and there's purpose and there's truth in those moments Sometimes grief hides out of sight from the consciousness cloud and You'll be going through through the day and there'll be a picture of lori and oh Or or something will come up and oh bang Or or a song will will come up and it'll open me emotionally And and i'll take a few minutes to to do that grieving work and and maybe shed a tear Or or maybe some anger will come up and i'll talk about anger in a moment Maybe some anger will come up and i'll process that so we walk through this together My wife mentioned she she thought in some ways that my family grieved well and Sure in some ways we grieve well and in other ways we grieve don't grieve well There's there's no perfect way to do this and no one does it perfectly but part of what we've tended to do in our family is we share pictures and we share stories and And we continue to talk about the lost loved one and and we share stories and and we laugh and we joke and then we cry and And for me as a pastor i've seen that at so many funerals where There's laughter and there's sorrow and those two things are are close together when we switch We we go back from one to the other when we can and then a lot of it's dependent on On on the type of humor i tend to have gallows humor and so You know right away when lori died, you know many thoughts she cut the line, you know lori was naughty and when I saw my parents and I saw or my mother And my sister I told my sister I said now don't you be rude It was terribly rude of my father and my sister to just die instantly of of heart attacks with You know no warning None of us knowing no chance to say goodbye often as a pastor i'll i'll walk with families who are loved ones dying of cancer or or old age or or system shutting down or congestive heart failure and there's time to gather family and friends to Say last goodbyes to to maybe heal some old wounds and old divisions But the way my father and my sister went there was no time they were simply gone And so I I told my sister that was awfully rude of them to to leave this way to you know in both cases both of them died out ease, so I hop on a plane the next day and Never had a chance to never had a chance to I see that the pain comes and goes never had a chance to say goodbye And so I I say goodbye to the to the body in the casket at the visiting hours I Will at some point link my eulogy to my sister i'll link the i'll link The written what I what I brought up into the pulpit and i'll link that I put it on my blog along with her obituary And so But again this this gets deeply into our maps and and so Because i'm a christian and because I believe and because I believe in the resurrection and that is That is not the same and belief in terms of her being with the lord now as the bible says it's not the same We don't know how we'll be reunited with one another but Resurrection and I believe that that I will not only see Jesus But I will see my sister and I will see my father and I will see my grandparents and I will see Many of the saints of living stones and I will see them with my eyes and we will be together in bodily form And that thought brings me a great deal of comfort at times when i'm feeling the loss Of us But often grief hides outside the conscious cloud and it interrupts and disturbs Unexpectedly and that can surprise us and we find ourselves embarrassed Even though in my experience People often aren't There's there's no shame in it people understand when you're grieving most people do few people will mock But perhaps we're embarrassed because we've now exposed something of ourselves and If you're high in openness like me and you're you're announcing it to youtube maybe that's not such a big concern but But but that's that's common. We find ourselves embarrassed when When we're brought to tears and when we're feeling the pain or maybe when we're we're expressing anger And that's the last thing and so i'll post my My eulogy to my sister in written form. It's already up on my blog Anger is natural Don't suppress it or indulge it Integrate it work it through I in the eulogy I right after my sister died I got the news from my mother and I was packing to to get an early flight the next day I was already processing john 11, which is what I treated in the eulogy And Jesus comes before the grave of his friend lazarus knowing full well in fact intentionally delaying his his coming to his friends And he's angry And you say well, what are you angry with? Are you angry with the father doesn't seem to be angry with the father He's angry at death Well, what kind of thing is death? Well death in the bible is often personified He's angry at death and he's angry at he's angry at loss and he's angry at what death Does in this world? And he's also weeping and in fact jesus in john 11 fully integrates all of it You know, there's the there's the very famous five stages of grief and you'll learn very quickly that they're not sequential They're all mixed together And cs lewis deals with this and a grief observed and he deals with his his anger and his pain And and all of the various things that it brings into him. This is this is how we are We are not to be embarrassed by it. We are not to feel guilty about it. It's it's just how we are Anger is natural. Don't suppress it nor indulge it Integrate it people often want to push it away because of the mirror neuron thing if If if we're disturbed by seeing a sorrowful person we're highly disturbed by seeing an angry person because angry people are dangerous They'll they'll say angry things or they'll do angry things or they'll destroy things and so we're naturally reluctant and so often people will after my After the eulogy I gave where where I did express anger and I and I wanted I wanted the community that that was experiencing the loss of my sister To to be able to process its anger too, and I needed to process my anger Because we have a right to be angry My sister ought not to be dead those sixth graders ought not to have to stand in line my My nephew and my nieces and my brother-in-law ought not to be missing Not to be missing their their wife and their mother my daughter ought my mother ought not To bury her daughter. I ought not to bury my sister Anger is appropriate Express it But integrate it feel it know it Don't be afraid of it. It's not an unchristian thing If jesus could be angry at the tomb of lazarus we can be angry at the tomb of our loved ones We process it Don't let it possess you And in terms of angry at god people get angry at god all the time The good parent can manage the appropriate anger of their beloved child To be a parent is to have your to be a good parent is to have your children angry with you from time to time The good parent understands anger anger The anger might not be justified The anger might be justified But it's an emotion let it be an emotion Don't let it be a master Don't let it become a house to dwell in I think that's the last slide So I just wanted to do a short video on on grief and loss on where i've been at on why I haven't been doing any videos I'll get back to rambling about jordan peterson and Doing doing the things I do soon enough again, i've i've got some ideas I want to I want to do some virtual meetups. I've had continued to get requests and I can't I can't fly around the country and host meetups all the time. So I'm thinking about doing something as a as a thank you for patreons and and then i'm also thinking about I've been teaching a sierra leadership network thing for a number of years where I do theological and biblical education and so I might do a Do a course in that and figure out how that goes again that'll probably be a patreon thing because one way or another I have to figure out this crazy career of mine and and justify the amount of time that I That i'm spending on this and so more news on that as it comes out, but just again a sincere thank you for the um expressions expressions of condolences And uh sympathy that that so many of you have expressed And thank you for your patience. Sorry for the the gap in the programming. Um, I am myself and i'll Continue to be myself even as I walk through this this grief thing and probably do some videos about What i'm thinking about in terms of mapping and grief as well
