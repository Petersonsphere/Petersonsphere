 Hi, this is Paul. I want to do a video on Chesterton's fence and Christian objections to same-sex marriage Obviously this has been a topic that I've dealt with Quite a bit and those of you who are worried that this is gonna take over the channel If you've been watching long enough, you know that no single thing takes over the channel Sometimes people worry that Jordan Peterson talk is gonna take over the channel or Christianity talk is gonna take care of the channel Take over the channel or not enough Christianity talk is gonna take over the channel. So but this obviously is something that I've been thinking about and For the most part my channel is about what I've been thinking about It gives me a chance to think out loud and do some talking this video isn't going to be quite as rambly as the three-hour video on marriage equality and Hopefully it's a little bit more linear a little bit more organized Actually, it's going to pull together a lot of what I've been talking about over ever since I started making videos on YouTube So I've been watching the debate in the Christian informed church on this topic for a very long time now I was at Calvin seminary in the 1980s. I remember our pastoral care class with Mel Hugen it was a topic that many students were Eager to talk about if you read a book like a severe mercy going all the way back to the 1950s and 60s. It was a subject that many people were eager to talk about this subject has been on The mouths of Christians Protestant Catholic for a very long time now and it isn't going away If you're curious about the Christian reformed churches position and some history of this topic Here are a couple of links. I can put them down in the show notes If you just Google homosexuality Christian reformed church position, it'll take you right there There are a lot of citations to synodical reports But unfortunately that page doesn't have links to the synodical reports I can understand that given that the synodical reports themselves aren't easy to wade through but if you're looking for links to those you can just Google synodical resources Christian reformed church and Find a long history of probably way more reading than any of you care to do Now moral debates get complex quickly to the surprise of many Americans Why are the surprise of many Americans again this really interesting book by Christian Smith where he came up with the notion? moralistic therapeutic deism the young Americans that he surveyed in the 1990s pretty much all imagined that morality was self-evident and They believed that they somehow inherited this from their parents and it's self-evident and that's that and By looking at the polarization of comments on my videos and in general on this topic That's pretty easy to see that playing out on one side, of course same-sex marriage. This is marriage equality How dare you challenge this you bigot and the other side haven't you ever read the Bible? Isn't the Bible clear that this is against God's law you godless humanist so off the polarization goes and Many people are done with talking about it and in the Christian reformed church partly because We had 25 years of this kind of battling over women in office Pauline verses verses this verse and and now there's some of that but not near the level of it with respect to same-sex marriage partly because there isn't as much biblical material frankly and so People have made up their minds and they're done talking and they want to yell or walk away and that's where a lot of people are But I want us to back up and ask the question What is morality because that's come up in a number of the videos that I've looked at And the question does nature answer the question of morality? What do we mean by nature? Well, what is the source history and reason behind the resistance to same-sex? love romanticism morality and That's we're gonna get into Chesterton's fence now for those of you who are unfamiliar with Chesterton's fence Bretton Bret Weinstein and Heather highing have actually incorporated it into their book, which I found extremely interesting It's a notion by GK Chesterton Who said if you come across a field and you see a fence and it just seems to be in the way and you don't See a reason for the fence having built there You shouldn't just take it down because at some point someone expended energy money resources and attention to put the fence there and maybe you shouldn't take down the fence until you understand the reason why the fence was put up and I think this is actually a very helpful question to ask when Christians debate this question of same-sex marriage and This video will be exactly about that Chesterton's fence and same-sex marriage Can it help us here and what do we mean by help? Chesterton's fence idea so let's dive in so I talked about morality a bit in a video that I almost didn't publish because I thought it was even too rambly for my channel And titled progressive Christianity and the generation of luck of luxury moral religion I was quite surprised by how well that video did how many of you watched it and said you appreciated it It's not uncommon for when I finish a video and I sleep on it It's like I shouldn't post this because it's too rambly. I go out on too many limbs but In for a penny in for a pound pretty much the whole channel is like that Should Christian churches affirm and celebrate same-sex unions relationships and sexuality. That's the moral question Well, what is morality? Well, it's what we should and shouldn't do individually and collectively That sounds pretty simple but very quickly you have to ask the question what we should or shouldn't do to what ends and So with this question, especially within a Christian community People in fact many people in the comments will say well the Bible is clear on it and that's their comment and okay you certainly find that argument convincing and a whole group of other people don't find it convincing and At this point in the debate not a lot of people are willing to sit down and sort of wade through Everything that goes into the question of how the Bible speaks and what it says and how we regard it, etc, etc I had clay libel ton my channel a while ago clay has a much more of an affirming open position than I do and Clay is much more pessimistic about as to whether or not the Bible can say anything at all And so therefore shouldn't have anything to say in terms of the morality Many others of you believe completely the opposite that the Bible in fact does speak. It's God's guide for For and again, there's a lot of framing that goes into this, you know, misery deliverance gratitude. That's more my framing Obedience is something that we give back to God out of response for the generosity that he's shown us That's very much my reform perspective Molded by the Huttburg catechism others have much more of a transactional posture where well, this is God's law We should obey it and if we obey it will be blessed and if we don't obey it Well, we'll be punished you can very much find that in the book of Deuteronomy So there's lots here that makes this way more complex than just does the Bible say yes or no now If you're in that camp, I'm happy to leave you there That's fine. I Don't actually think the question about at least in a standard Protestant framework or a Roman Catholic framework or the North odoch's framework I don't think this is a close call when it comes to biblical material as I mentioned to To Nick who I had on the channel a little while ago There's not one single same-sex couple represented in the Bible in a long-term Monogamous really isn't the right word a long-term committed relationship. There's not one and We're gonna get into the argument because people say well Paul didn't know any at that time and there's a lot of reason to believe There were plenty of them around and That idea was not in any way unusual for Paul There's just simply very little material about this and I think frankly the biggest and I'll get to that at the end of the video The biggest the biggest proof text of this is Genesis 1 not any of the prohibitions and any of the other passages But then again many will say well, what does that have to do with morality morality is about what is healthy? What is life-giving? What is profitable? What works and They have a real point because that for many of us is how we construct our moralities Some of you will say well science shows us that same-sex marriage is not wrong Science can't show you any whether anything is right or wrong It might be helpful or unhelpful if you're attempting to achieve a certain goal But should is the line of demarcation between the manifest image and the scientific image and I've made plenty of videos on that Science might be a good at saying what is on a physical level But not what ought to be as a goal is the speed of light good or bad You know There's the fine-tuning argument that basically says that life as we know it would be impossible Unless a whole bunch of little constants weren't set just exactly right in the universe as they are and that sort of begets the multiverse thesis and all of these kinds of cosmological discussions about the existence of God or evidence for Their being purpose in the construction of the universe All of that is too far afield we're talking about morality but morality as I'm the point I'm trying to make is not a simple thing CS Lewis and the problem of pain has begins the book with a really interesting assertion about morality he basically says Morality for humanity is commonly an intuition It's something that we feel now for Lewis after his great war with Owen Barfield He believes that we can in fact derive true knowledge from our intuitions and most Americans on that score Pretty much aligned with Lewis now they'll differ from Lewis because Lewis is a little bit more skeptical about How high a definition we can necessarily gain from our moral intuitions? They are guides to us. They are important for us and in fact, you know I don't like the term objective morality But that seems to be a term that many of you like so I'll use it with reservations Adam Frendit, of course likes this term So as CS Lewis would say our moral intuitions actually give us knowledge about the objective morality that the universe Possesses now, of course Lewis will go a step further and say the universe has this because of its creator And as I mentioned in a previous video if you read Lewis in his book mere Christianity has Beneath it a number of arguments for the existence of God One of those arguments is that if you believe that there is a moral law It is not unreasonable to imagine that there is a moral lawgiver And so Lewis really likes that part of the evidence that he points to at the end In the appendix to his book the abolition of man is what he calls the Dow and what he says is that these moral intuitions Even though they are fallible even though they are subject to all sorts of things cultures and and winds of change And personal biases and everything generally speaking in the broadest possible range They don't differ as much as they as we imagine they might some really basic elements law of reciprocity Jonathan height when we're about to bring in Talks about don't kill don't skill steal. Don't lie. Don't cheat Don't skill steal. Don't lie. Don't cheat These are common things of the dow lewis says He goes on in the problem of pain to say that the great contribution of the hebrews was wedding moral intuitions with numinous intuitions And again, um, I think if you're curious about lewis's argument read the book Our moral intuitions are in some ways dead reckoning They're sort of like a compass rather than a high resolution gps They're sort of like, okay, there's the sun so that's about west And moss grows on the north side of trees and you know all of this stuff Rises in the east sets in the west. They're all and magnetic north versus true north I mean these are all fairly low resolution guides That's sort of what intuitions are Um our intuitions give us knowledge, but they are fallible subject. Um fallible subject to bs-ing Biases history, etc some of this gets I think um, I would love to have seen a conversation between ian mcgillchrist and C.s lewis on some of these things because of course our intuitions mcgillchrist would say come from Our bicameral mind and you know, there's a lot of skepticism You can't really cut these things down the middle quite as much as sort of a bicameral mind imaginary would be but generally speaking There's a degree of opponent processing that's going on between mapped territory and unmapped territory between You know sort of global Bringing in things through some symbolism filtering them through intuition That that part of the mind does and the other part of the mind is sort of this accountant that wants to take things and Nail them down down into little dogmatic specific listicles so we can sort of nail some things down and And the way the brain works is sort of back and forth back and forth with these processes And and this basically is how we can deal with combinatorial explosion explosiveness in the world again. This is all john vervecke type terms Jonathan height goes on from here with his evolutionary psychology And talks about moral taste buds or moral foundations theory and he basically says that there are certain foundations that we Now he's he's writing in the academy. He's an atheist. He basically says that You know, we can find these moral foundations and they're sort of foundations. They're sort of canals I kind of think of them as troughs because our moral Let's say imagine a moral question Reigns down from on high and these sort of gather the elements of the moral Questions and and guide us in our thinking they are Biases intuitions things like that and they're there's you know, again, there's sort of They're in clusters that are sort of opponent processing each other care versus harm fairness versus cheating Loyalty versus betrayal authority versus subversion sanctity versus degradation My wife and I have been watching some past seasons of survivor and it is an interesting show in terms of psychology and Many of these things, you know, the people are People are very righteous when when they've been blindsided or backstabbed or someone has lied to them and they're voted off the island And they didn't see it coming and they're not in the in group I mean this is this is just this is all human behavior that we're very familiar with Now now this operates below the surface but reliably shows up height says across cultures and time and this is of course the the real hope of Using nature or something like evolutionary psychology to attempt to guide our way As we'll get into and as we continue to talk about guide our way into what? it's usually into more dead reckoning and more better or worse and more assumptions about what is good and what is bad because Nature can't answer this question for us Human beings are malleable culturally within these grooves Now There's an enormous amount of circularity that goes on with this and circularity in and of itself isn't necessarily bad there's circles can be vicious or They can be virtuous spirals where we're actually sort of making progress And I have to thank the spiral dynamics people for for that kind of imagery For that kind of imagery so a vicious circle is sort of where you can think of a Vicious funnel or a virtuous spiral something like that But again all of this is imagining that there really is a moral access to the universe That there is somehow a better and worse and it isn't just all simply instrumental towards some Um Mediated good that we're looking for now most human beings sort of work their morality through some Means that have been well known to thinkers for thousands of years we all receive a first draft from our parents and Christian smith notes that and all these interview with young people Well, I think I learned right and wrong from my daddy and my mama Well, that's very true and your brothers and your sisters and the movies and the tv You were a little sponge and you absorbed a first draft and you made an entire world map low resolution But bit by bit by bit by bit by bit you improved it and there's a ton of stuff that went into there Someone did something you didn't like you gets bad something came in that you liked That's good And but you compared notes with others and you were doing this without any con without with very little conscious cognition And you compared notes and you had fights as toddlers and and all of this stuff went in to build that map inside of you And it's right there in you and you only bump into it when let's say you get married and you Suddenly sit down against um next to someone that you've promised to love for the rest of your life And then you decide that they're completely wrong about a whole bunch of things that are important to you But you never had time to ask them because they were they fascinated you in some way And so you decided to jump right into it So that's certainly part of it and there's personal experience, which is of course part of that too so the mappings continue to get updated with personal experience and And but there's a lot going on with those experiences sometimes what works and we pay attention and we we take things in intuitively and so our intuitive capacities and our reasonable capacities continue to grow and develop and all of this continues to be put into us But again, most of this is not conscious at all for us. We're we're simply being molded and formed and shaped by everything that's around us And then there's this question of authority well somehow Authority comes into the picture and what is authority somehow some ideas and and some notions and some books and some people and Some things just seem to have gravitas and they seem right and other things seem less right and we You can think of renais-gerard in this we not only borrow our desires. We borrow our authorities and Human beings have been known to be Very malleable in these things as well and i've mentioned before I think it was young life for a while They had the the cool kids strategy of evangelizing public schools and they knew very well that if they Could go into the school and look around and say, okay, who's captain of the football team? Who's head cheerleader who's the musician that everyone musicians not so much Sorry musicians, I know he didn't get much Much love in high school necessary. Maybe a singer maybe a singer But but who in the class does everyone look up to and if they suddenly become a christian well Christianity suddenly is popular just like if they wear a certain sneaker or they wear certain clothing or they like certain music Suddenly everybody jumps on board You might call that fad or fashion it's got an element of authority to it It's a it's an outweighing of some over others And there's um, this is inherited of course because you pick that stuff up from your parents as well And you picked it up from your community as well um Arche as i've mentioned before means first or foremost or highest It's this greek word that seems to have all of that in there and it's all over the place architect Archetype, you know, it's all this all this first things all this head stuff when you when you hear christians and I was listening to justin briarley and um Mark driscoll listening to that That classic episode as justin briarley and you know Arche head of the family. That's that's all archa talk in greek First foremost writings writings that are old. Oh, this is old or writings that are popular Imagine there's no no what no religion Um on and on and on implicit and and this also gets into my video about hagiography because this is all of what goes in and then once we sort of Get enamored and the the spirit of these things begins to move in us and then we begin to speak and you know it's sort of like talk to someone who Um has found a new author or has met a new a new romantic partner and you know They're looking at they're looking at their archa through rose colored glasses and they can do no wrong and they're doing everything right and They're the key of understanding to the world yada yada yada. That's authority And because somehow this person this person seems to know and be able to manage the world from the inside out They're the author of the story that is swirling around us Yes Now there's a long history to a lot of this stuff and if you go all the way back in my three plus years of video Making you'll find this Uh great courses online and it's it was a good one. I remember I listened to this thing three or four times Uh, philip carrey philosophy and religion in the west one of the things that happens in the During the renaissance is this turn to the text you find people and in renaissance humanism renaming themselves in latin and um, you know digging up and suddenly all this all this garbage around rome is now highly prized and valuable and you know bring out these statues and these beautiful statues and find these beautiful texts brought in from um through through the crusades and learn learn to manage latin like cicero and you know learn the greek of plato and And aristotle gets discovered. Oh my this is this learning is so brilliant We have to bring it into the church even though the church says no You shouldn't read this and good old young aquinas gets at it and think I bet you I can I bet you I can have the church fall in love with this and uh, yeah thomas did he did exactly that so you have this turn to the text and so In the late middle ages beginning of the modern period if you're going to study physics You read aristotle Because that's how you'll learn physics. You'll learn it from the book Now you don't go out and drop things like Galileo and time and all that stuff's going to come later It's this turn to the text now I'm going to talk about two worlds mythology and the mapping of it that isn't going to go away This might be because of the bicameral mind It's another way of saying it's because we're the breath of heaven and the stuff of earth There's lots of way of saying it But this this two worlds mythology mapped onto all kinds of things inside of us and outside of us Is by no means going to go away. You can find it in machu pageau's book about creation Now this turn to the text is in many ways turning towards the upper register of that the the triplet of heaven spirit and mind And even written words, I mean written words are funny I mean the the text on the page or the indentations in the dried mud or Whatever, you know the the toner that adheres because of tiny little Electrical charges to the page as it goes through your laser printer or your photocopier The words really aren't on the page. You can burn the books, but you can't burn the ideas And we're going to talk about this two worlds mythology a little bit more but the renaissance humanism this love of language this love of the classics this Reappropriation of the classical world. This is everything to do with heaven and spirit and mind and it's an elevated world And so we we still love the renaissance paintings because they're they just seem so crisp and clear And in some ways sort of beyond decay even if they manifest a witness to decay within it Now the protestant reformation is of course very much born into that young martin luther is reading erasmus like crazy and there is erasmus now with this new powerful Tool called the printing press and you can lay a greek text even if it's not a very good one and the latin vulgate and Erasmus's notes next to each other and suddenly This text which is sort of descended from the heavens now seems much more of earth subject to decay But if subject to decay also subject to improvement And the protestant reformation is born To the text um to the text and away from such inherited authoritative structures that were clearly corrupt like the papacy like the priesthood Like indulgences all of these things are the they're the corruptions. They're the things of they're the things of earth flesh um matter Instead of the things of heaven spirit mind and so in some ways the protestant reformation sort of expands this gulf and tries to get on the the the right side of history if you will if Well history is bending towards heaven spirit and mind rather than earth flesh And matter now Luther believed that well if we can just get and the protestants have followed luther for a long time Gideons especially if we can just get the bible in front of them We'll put them in all those hotel rooms and some poor person will go to this lousy conference and they'll have a terrible time and they'll be missing or cheating on their wife and they'll be Doing things and that are getting them into trouble and they've made their life a mess and they open the Drawer and there's that wolf in utah. It's the book of mormon But if you're most other places, that's the gideon bible not so much anymore I don't think hotels put them in like they used to that would just kind of be Putting the hotel on the wrong side of history so open up that gideon bible and you read the gospel of john and the light comes in and We sing wesley's how can it be? Bing bang boom luther was certainly hoping that maybe if he makes a real point about this and well the Church really in some ways if they had ignored him they probably would have been better off, but they didn't and He was just assuming that perhaps some some rival edifice will arise out of reason and the text and will purify the church But even lutheran karlstad Couldn't really get on the same page and on and on we go and certainly lutheran's wingley Couldn't get on the same page with respect to the lord's supper So so after all this mess in very broad terms, there's really a turn to this word nature Um, we could say it's a turn to empiricism suddenly instead of reading aristotle to find out about physics Go out there and look at the natural world because it seems everybody reading aristotle has sort of got some similar ideas But you know if you can figure out and you know, suddenly Telling time is a very important thing and learning to do it more and more accurately But measuring the speed of of two falling bodies Well, that's very important. And then of course at some point Galileo is going to say well, you know That discarded image the stuff above the moon is all supposed to be ether and of the heavenlies But it certainly seems like the physics above and the physics below are working in the same way And so suddenly that discarded image is demolished And well, it's rather proven by astronauts going to the moon, right? The same physics above and the same physics below the very the math seems to work better and the math can tell you a lot Luther's experiment failed people didn't agree on the text Um the search for the objective and i'll use scare quotes on that without blushing Now regularity in the testable world is a way of doing theology because you are you are learning to know and love god Number one this god who doesn't change this god who is reliable this god who? Who who who works through gravity and the god who works through? All of the natural processes that well the the The the great, you know the spheres in the sky. Well we won't talk about what's above the moon anymore, but God is working all over the place so we're going to do natural theology and see all of the ways that god works in the world because of course This is the hand of god that's working among us and causing all of this But then of course deism creeps in creeps in and in some ways you have you have nature this thing that goes on its own it's no longer god doing it it's nature and Maybe now we can have the truth Which doesn't change and upon these truths we can achieve certainty and construct mastery of our physical world to our own ends But don't ask us Where we're getting our wanting from or where we're getting our aughts from and in some ways We're basically now at the end of this stage of the story as we see increasingly modernity sun starting to set Let's deal with this word nature and I know I mentioned it a little bit in a previous video and fair number of you had comments on it So i'm going to read for you a little bit from c.s Lewis's book miracles that in many ways launched this channel just as much as jordan peterson did Before the naturalist and the supernaturalist Can begin to discuss their difference of opinion they must surely have an agreed definition both of nature and of supernature But unfortunately, it is almost impossible to get such a definition And that was true In the middle of the 20th century when lewis wrote this and I think it's nearly as true today Just because natural just because the naturalist thinks that nothing but nature exists. That's the definition of a naturalist The word nature means to him merely everything or the whole show or whatever is And if that is what we mean by nature, then of course nothing else exists The real question between him and the supernaturalist has evaded us Some philosophers have have defined nature as what we perceive with our five senses That's the empiricism Galileo dropping things from a tower But this is also unsatisfactory for we do not perceive our own emotions in that way And this is where we're at the beginning of patterns seeing patterns and a peugeotism And yet they are presumably natural events In order to avoid this deadlock and to discover that the naturalist and the supernaturalist are really differing about We must approach our problem in a more roundabout way I begin by considering the following sentences number one are those his natural teeth or He says a set are those his natural teeth are they implants or dentures? Number two the dog in his natural state is covered with fleas But lewis is of course in some ways Talking before we really had all the knowledge we have about genetics and one would say there's absolutely nothing about a domestic Natural about a domesticated dog by definition anything domesticated is unnatural And if you don't believe me get a dog that's been poorly bred and compare it to The wolf that the dog supposedly has been derived from by Unnatural causes human breeding genetic modifications, but the old-fashioned kind that human beings have been doing for a very long time So right there in fact even that sentence is disrupted by technology The dog in his natural state is covered with fleas Three I love to get away from tilled land and metal roads and be alone with nature capital n Ah, that's what the the shrine of yosemite national park is it's Natural is it really to fence it off and have people in uniforms? Keeping you from doing whatever you want in the park In what way is a park? Natural once it's a park. It's no longer really a wilderness Yes Four you do be natural why are you so affected? Oh, there's an interesting one In other words go about how you normally are don't be changed by what someone has said or done Or triggered you there's a fun new word Five it may have been wrong to kiss her, but it was very Natural. Oh now we're gonna remember this whole video is about chesterton's fence and same-sex marriage and again Where it's gonna be a while till we get there So if you want to skip to the end which you can do on youtube you can already skip to the end and listen to some conclusions but A lot of those conclusions are built on this and this last one It may be raw. It may have been wrong to kiss her, but it was very natural I saw her beauty. She looked at me in the eye a certain way me and mrs. Jones Mrs now i'm dating myself and go on to youtube and google me and mrs. Jones We got a thing going on or debbie boone It may be wrong, but it feels so right You light up my life more songs from the 70s all of those things were imprinted in me at an early age Was that a good thing or a bad thing? A Common thread of meaning and all of these usages can be discovered the natural teeth are those which grow in the mouth They do not we do not have we do not have to design them and we meaning human beings They they seem to come apart from Human beings monkeying around with it unless we get at orthodontics We do not have to design them to make them or to fit them the dog's natural state is the one He will be in if no one takes soap and water and prevents it the countryside where nature capital n reigns supreme Is the one where soil weather and vegetation produce their results unhelped and unimpeded by man now again Given how thoroughly we have trampled on this world Is there any place in the world that actually is what we would imagine to be natural somehow untouched by And we really have to get into the question of untouched by exactly what now c.s. lewis in miracles will say reason capital r We might say purpose capital p we might say intentionality. It's all of the things that we Give to ourselves but say there wasn't any kind of spirit or being or any intentional conscious thing That created this world or shaped or molded evolution with purpose in other words Planet earth did not have us us in mind before we popped out of Whatever it is. We popped out of and have to the at this point So completely controlled the destiny of the planet or have we because of course we have time frame to deal with Natural behaviors the behavior which people would exhibit if they were not at pains To alter it and again these pains are Intentionality that well, I put food in front of me and I will eat it All kinds of things I will do but then there's all of this mapping and morality inside of me that says No, just because the bank teller is counting hundreds doesn't mean you can reach your hand through that little slot We can't do that anymore. They've really got the bank nailed down reach your hand through and say i'll take the whole stack Thank you. No bother counting it. I just need it Doesn't work pains to alter it the natural kiss is the kiss which will be given if moral or Or the kiss of the natural kiss is the kiss of the natural kiss Your prudential considerations do not intervene Oops, I did it again to bring things up into the musical 1980s I'm sure those of you who listen to music today can Point many other songs to me and if you have favorite songs drop them in the comment section Just drop the little link to the youtube song in the comment section and be curious what songs you want to post in there And all the in all the exam in all the examples nature capital n means what happens of itself or of its own accord and again We're after deism. So this isn't god working through nature It's far older perception. He shines through all that's fair. You can still find this and in reformed creeds and confessions You can very much find it in historical writings You can find it in the bible god number one is all over the place working through creation But after deism, no, that's nature God is only god number two the person not god number one the Arena god number two is the agent The greek word for nature physis is connected with the greek verb to grow Latin natura with the verb to be born The natural is what springs up or comes forth or arrives or goes on of its own accord the given What is there already the spontaneous the unintended the unsolicited? What the naturalist capital capital n meaning the philosophical naturist naturalist not necessarily the person who's working at yosemite national park What the naturalist believes is that the the ultimate fact capital f The thing you can't go behind the thing you can't deconstruct I would say Is a vast process in space and time which is going of its own accord It has no morality It just is Inside that total system every particular event such as you're sitting reading or listening to this book or podcast Happens because some other events have happened in the long run because the total event capital t capital e Is happening Every particular thing such as this page or this word or what's coming out of your microphone Is what it is because other things are what they are and so eventually because the whole system is what it is All the things and events are so completely interlocked that no one of them can claim the slightest Independence from the whole show We've got layers of causality here None of them exist on its own or goes on of its own accord Except in the sense that it exists it exhibits at some particular place in time that general existence on its own Deism it's the clock it's been wound up. It will go on its own There is no god number one beneath it or around it Or behavior of its own accord which brings which belongs to now he's got nature capital n in square quotes The great total interlocked event as a whole Thus no thoroughgoing naturalist believes in free will For free will would mean that human beings have the power of independent action the power of doing something more or other Than what is involved by the total series of events in other words morality is illusion Because you're going to do what you're going to do. You can watch the matrix they'll Send you down that rabbit hole. I guess a new matrix is coming out. We'll see if it's any good At any such separate power of originating events is what the naturalist denies Spontaneity originality action on its own is a privilege reserved for the whole show which he calls capital n italics for For italics for emphasis nature c.s. Lewis miracles Now we have to deal with this question of two world mythologies one of the one of the things that in some ways Jonathan Pigeot and john vervecki are in agreement with even though they differ on many other things Many ways the difference between emanation and emergence is Modernity or late modernity or post modernity has gotten very unhappy with cartesian dualism what I mean by that Descartes imagined that there not only do we have matter or physical substance that we are able to track and measure and watch and Manipulate and do things with but there must be spiritual substance out there somewhere doing things and that division between Physical substance and spiritual substance has proven to well it helped Descartes out of some of the messes that he was wrestling with But it's proven to be a little bit of a problem and so Jonathan Pigeot in many ways through his symbolism is pushing against duality and john vervecki with his With his non-reductive physicalism and just watch my conversations with him and jp and myself is pushing against cartesian Dualism we want one unified system through which to see the world as c.s. Lewis said no heel tapping What did he mean by this because I believe it was one of lewis's nannies who was an ardent Spiritualist because at the end of the 19th century Everyone was really interested in ghosts and there were plenty of people who were playing all sorts of games taking all sorts of money to have people encounter the ghost so Lewis was basically pointing to that in other words when we get into the laboratory We do not imagine that any spirit is about to manipulate the findings of the physical experiment that The things in the lab will go on their own They will not be altered and if there is a difference between what we anticipated and what we arrived at We ought to be able to account for that difference through some sort of physical agency or Some human mind because again in our system. There are no minds or agents or spirits above humanity that's non-reductive physicalism So the spiritual substance is not available for physical examination and well we do a lot of experiments in labs and we seem fairly satisfied with a lot of what we come up with so Maybe that means there isn't anything up there and I guess the amazing randy still has his million dollars. I don't know We want a single system that we can control that we can account for that we can manage everything with and through that we can somehow Suit this world for what we call good or morality or moral goodness But unfortunately, we're subject to it and this is part of the meaning crisis. I want to be its master and I'd like to be master of you, too If my heart really gets its way But you're like I don't trust you that much And you probably shouldn't Because the problem is i'm not exactly sure what the master of me is because i'm I've got a consciousness congress and i'm plenty conflicted and i've got questions and one day I feel this and next day I do that and the things read roman seven the things that that I say I shouldn't do I do and the things that I say I should do I don't do Who can save me? Well, if you don't believe in jesus Because I guess you got to save yourself Or maybe a doctor or maybe a guru or maybe a pill or maybe something else But it's got to be within the physical realm within this locked universe because yourself well You're buffered There's nothing that's going to impinge upon you from above. It's all been built into you within time and space And therefore there is no god and there is no spirit above human beings But pachaud weighs in and says well, wait a minute we are patterns seeing patterns and if you're ever driving Through open country in a four-wheel and you see an animal and you want to take a picture of it and the camera's going like this it's like Well, you can't stop the car to stop the car would mean death And so the camera shake is built into all of our perceptions of the world out there We are pattern seeking patterns and so the shake of our own patterns looking at well the the the the the The trees seem to be shaking. No, you're shaking The camera the picture's all blurry or pattern seeing patterns and there's two moving targets So you've got you've got a cheetah running across the african plane and you've got your camera And you're trying to keep up and well, we have image stabilization and yeah, that's all that stuff has limits We are patterns seeing patterns, but the camera shake makes it hard to control my neighbor as myself even if I have trouble controlling myself So this two-world mapping endures, I don't think it's going anywhere and I think you know, most of us are ready to say That the spiritual substance I'm not in fact I'm quite certain I don't want to get rid of spiritual ontology And in fact a lot of my project has been attempting to map as best I can some spiritual ontology from below such a school spirit But it just seems a little bit hubristic to imagine that There aren't any spirits above us and given How we see human beings relate well, then I know this is a bone of contention Some of you especially if your name starts with k really get upset at this point only some of you whose names start with k I'm just thinking of a particular individual whose name starts with k And if you're in the community if you're in the the comment community He'll probably present himself So we've got this issue. We've got these two worlds mapping and they're not going away We've got heaven spirit and mind things not subject to decay that the greeks paid a lot of attention to And we've got earth flesh and matter things subject to decay cs. Louis notes that every instance of love Will be ended in this world by death or betrayal But love itself the word the idea the form the thing way up on high Love everlasting. Well heavens are everlasting and spirit and mind these things don't decay they govern they rule they move the trees they're all up there that's not going away for human beings because Now you might be skeptical in terms of the ontology of some of these things But in terms of how they work in us psychologically, and I think this was one of the big Lessons learned by the jordan peterson phenomenon. These things are not going away. In fact, they can't go away without us Not being what and who we have come to know ourselves to be And people trying to dismiss them Seem to as cs. Louis points out again and again in his book betray themselves and he talks about hg wells, you know Suddenly my sam harris is a is a common one, you know, all of this stuff is just projection It's all between our ears You don't act as if it is Vulnerable to mind and spirit yet also now via science Demonstrating its power to shape minds and spirit for many deciding who get to go to heaven in other words Well, a lot of the religious people say what you do with matter matters for if something of you mind spirit and in resurrection body Will make another appearance on this earth or the next But now suddenly we're asking questions that physics really can't answer Now brett weinstein and heather highing. Oh, he put her name first. That was very chivalrous of him Maybe she wrote most of it. I have no idea the last gasp of modernity is evolutionary psychology for A guide to life and that's sort of what we've been seeing in the idw space Modernity is really just too handy to not keep around in one form or another If we're not going to go into a vicious whirlpool, but rather have a virtual virtuous spiral Well, according to the integral people modernity is going to have to be folded into our continued journey of knowledge and so a lot of the fruits of modernity the imagined objectivity Are things we're going to need we're going to have to be able to agree That At certain elevations water boils at such and such a temperature and water freezes at a certain temperature And and and and and these aren't things you just throw away They have become they have been built into the systems that we are dependent upon when towards the end of I don't remember which matrix movie it was the Neo stands looking over The this vat these vast machines underneath zion that are keeping the little Rebel tribe alive and whatever the dude is and whatever his post is who waxes eloquently about How we and the machines are going to have to make peace with one another? Well in some ways that's sort of where we're at with nature that Can't live with her can't live without her Because every time it seems like we corner nature and really get her under our technological boot We discover that nature seems to have a way of saying. Oh, you think you got me now Well, how about I heat up the planet a little and let's see how smart you are Let's see how collectively you can make bricks and build a tower to the heavens. Shall we? Maybe Since we no longer believe in letters from heaven divine revelation If we can discover natural man, maybe we can get beneath Our tower and build it right this time Maybe we can discover natural man and then perhaps the straight stick What the essence of man woman humanity we don't even know what to name ourselves anymore We I mean i'm serious about that we don't I don't even know how to write that sentence without someone objecting Oh, come on now. It's chest feeding you bigot Okay I'm just trying to keep up I'm not getting any younger But because we quickly see we don't like what we're finding we immediately claim that we can choose To ignore our genocidal spelling bee programming. This is the brett weinstein circular trap Where on one hand well now via evolutionary psychology we can see the processes that have developed us But then we evaluate them morally. He never tells us where he gets his moral yardstick from We can evaluate them morally and we can simply decide to no longer do that There was once a jew named paul of tarsus who wrote roman 7 And his experience in roman 7 is a pretty universal experience the good. I would do I don't do And the bet the evil that I don't want to do I do Who can save me from myself? I don't just choose to step out of my genocidal spelling bee I don't want to do that Leave me from myself I don't just choose to step out of my genocidal spelling bee any more than my windows computer Isn't a mac one day when I open up the lid? Apple logo not on this lenovo. It ain't gonna happen But somehow I can just wake up and deny my genocidal spelling bee programming and decide I know what's moral I will go off into the world I Every time he does this, I just kind of leaves my mouth open What is natural but notice how authority has come into this authoritative but subject to moralistic revision This with regard to sex Because if there's any power that seems to take over human beings Christian or non-christian Church leader or governor of new york or president of the united states on down to human history There seems to be few things pot more powerful than sex I remember reading in one biography of gautama the buddhist at heart to gautama the buddhist that If he had had another desire stronger than sex, he never could have achieved enlightenment It's the big dog. It takes how many of us down? To kiss her was so natural This is a biggie You're just going to transcend it And for that reason sort of born that way really held the stage for a long time Even if it's passing We can't decide what side of nature What side of the natural and scare quotes line sexual desire is on Oh, no, certainly this is hardwired. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of wiring There's a lot of evolutionary development too And there's a lot of culture It was it's bret weinstein who more eloquently than most talks about these two tracks the genetic track and the culture track and then he seems to forget the implications of what that has to do for morality and how he can sync it up with evolutionary psychology or biology They're living in two different word worlds wilfred cellars that should be like I don't know some magic word that Expelliarmus or whatever they say in harry potter We can't decide what side of the law of the natural line sexual desire Procreative activity or mating should be on Do we have a choice or not? Did ravie zackariah have a choice? Did bill hybels have a choice? Did bill clinton have a choice? Did governor cuomo have a choice? Brett weinstein is the clearest is also clearest that human beings have two tracks The sex track seems all up and in both of them I think one of jordan beaterson's best work in 2018 was the Some of his stuff on easter. Why? Well, because when he talked about sacrifice he talked about the future and he recognized very early on that The culture track is all up and in the genetics track by now We have indeed been shaping each other and even though the genetics track is very slow and the culture track is very fast with every successive Fertilized egg We continue to tick those things along With every new school with every new idea with every new book with every new video we continue to tick those things along and It's deeply impacting impacting status hierarchies and status and mating is a very big deal Brett knows that heather knows that jordan knows that I think they're right He talks sacrifice and mate selection and nature sort of goes out the window at least nature bereft of culture when it comes to human beings Natural human being singular or in community is like searching eight billion people for the essential human being Go ahead and try i'll wait There's eight billion of us to go through now And some are coming in and some are leaving at the moment. Is any single human being in this world the essential? archetypal Quintessential human being and how on earth would you tell you've got exactly the same problem as asking? Well, what should the speed of light be? Morality normativity It's the quest of the essential human or sexually Or sexual the essential human sexuality and natural can't get you there if you want to keep human agency And the manifest image Not gonna go Now again, what's this video about? I have to remind you because we've been going on a while Chesterton's fence and the christian objections to same-sex marriage all of this stuff Has been going through for a long time. So if you go to the crc's human sexuality page There's a lot of history now My argument for many years now if you've been listening to me for a few years is that I don't think we would see The embrace among many Non-christian and christian people of same-sex marriage that whole idea without christianity and the apostle paul Same-sex marriage is born of christianity now some of you who are watching the video will know that I have A little a little little picture down below with a red pill and a blue pill Because a bunch of these points cut both ways The culture war in the west is a christendom civil war and I was delighted When I heard tom holland say a similar thing, that's his definition of culture war. It's a christendom civil war it's the ongoing working through of I have to deal with The subtitle of the book How the christian revolution remade the world I didn't recognize this and I was out my monday's meetup and someone put holland on one side and peugeot on the other I thought oh boy You just made me do more thinking But dominion what what what what what? What what what what what same-sex marriage is born of christianity there's no denying it the only question is Is it orthodox or heterodox? Marcian was born of christianity Pelagian pelagius was born of christianity arminius calvin luther augustin Houston Robbelle Can't think of the prosperity preacher in houston just describing that way. Oh, no my best life now Oh those silly little mental blocks The apostle paul radically reordered roman assumptions about marriage and equality in the book of ephesians submit to one another out of reverence For christ and then he goes on and he doesn't duplicate the verb It carries through in greek Something the crc fought a lot over between 1975 and 2004 But watch tom holland and tom wright talk about what paul did in the roman world somehow radically love was what the Inferior did to the superior and then when in ephesians he says men love your wives As christ loved the church He scrambles This hierarchy And they don't know what to do. I actually when I was listening to mark driscoll talk to justin briarly Driscoll, you know, he didn't grow that church because he was an idiot and a putz Now he's got some character issues that caused its fall but You know, there's a lot of people There's a lot of people myself included who would agree with a lot of what driscoll would say there He wasn't anywhere near the the straw man person that I had heard of but never even never actually heard that said If he came to the christian reform church and wanted to be ordained Um at this point from what I know he wouldn't have my vote anyway People who complain about paul and women can't recognize an upgrade when they see it and they won't take yes for an answer Now you might say well i'm comparing paul to well, okay comparing him to what? Why don't you compare him to? His day and appreciate that radical Equality that jesus sets in motion paul begins to apply and disseminate in the roman world But he still has a hierarchy husbands love your wives as christ loved the church Wives submit to your husband as to the lord now if you understand their hierarchy What paul says is enormously subversive tom holland understands that anti-right understands that But most of us picking up our bible. This is horrible Horrible Well, what are we going to do with paul How do we read him? Do we read paul within his context? Do we read paul? Symbolically do we read paul against our present context? How are we to decide how are we to figure out what the bible is saying? Now basically what happens with same-sex marriage and again marriage Plenty of same-sex activity. We'll talk about that in a minute in the ancient world, but why would you marry? Your same-sex partner that's just crazy marriage is for the creation of legitimate heirs That's what it's for Today marriage the definition the word has been redefined marriage is an ideal We are expressing we're an expressive culture. We are expressing and pronouncing to the world That we have idealized our relationship and it now has a degree of sacred Authority and everyone should back off because we're married That's what it means here Is that what it meant 2 000 years ago? Does the change in definition matter? I think it's something to keep in mind That's what it means. Same-sex marriage debate is born from christian history much of the communal motivational power Of including and affirming same-sex marriage comes from the deep christian moral intuition of caring for the weak Again tom holland's dominion that first chapter is an amazing chapter How on earth is it that Someone who is crucified as a slave Would be declared to be god Have you never read philippians 2? To us we just read it and it's normal When it was written You can hardly imagine something as unthinkable that God would come and allow himself to be murdered When jews and muslims protest We should have some respect for them It's a really hard thing to think about it's just familiarity for us that makes it easy Recently, um The woke preacher clips on twitter And i'm thinking about making a commentary because here's a guy who's been in the world for a long time Here's a guy who? founded grew a mega church Went same-sex affirming which basically destroyed the mega aspect of his church And it's still out there and it's it's a very interesting thing But he so he's on he makes a video a year ago and says the slippy slope is real Once I opened the door to same-sex marriage Church Well now we're all living our best life now and trying to get there spiritually And it's a heck of a video to watch And I've read all the people that are like Oh, there's no slippery slope. This guy says yeah, the slippery slope is real We ended up a non-church and now he's a non-preacher And the little group of people that he gathered together. Well, their website is very interesting again. I thought of playing a clip from it It just seems This is doubtful. Maybe I will now through the miracle of youtube We became an open the largest evangelical open and affirming church And from there we really made a lot of shifts and all of a sudden I think we were something like a a progressive christian church. I don't know what we ended up You know a not church or some sort of interfaith spiritual goulash. The slippery slope is real This is Ryan meeks founder of the church in seattle 2015 he announced that eastlake would be queer affirming Comparing the bible's teaching of homosexuality to jacro Has brought the church much positive national press from time magazines upworthy plus others The faith community can evolve As he announces retirement he rejoices and actually the whole youtube video is really quite interesting to listen to When I think back at the The many many iterations of what eastlake has been. I mean you think about any point in time at one point you could have called us a tiny fledgling church plant and then we were a purpose driven church health award winner in 2006 and So, you know, he goes through I mean a bunch of stuff that i'll probably get to in other videos I mean he goes through the whole the whole seeker thing we were one of outreach magazine's fastest growing churches in america and we were a Multisite evangelical mega church and we're a hologram church. That didn't work That's one of the funny ones Um at one point we became an open the largest evangelical open and affirming church. I cannot bear To move forward in my life A part of a faith community or my friends are not welcomed See and that is So again back to high on god This is deeply part of evangelicalism This soft inclusion This is deeply part and this this mercy This mercy for our sex the sexual minorities in our midst that feel this way through Through no fault of their own That's powerful and compelling To both serve and receive communion Have equal welcome into the community of christianity of following jesus from this point forward We're going to keep doing what we've always done as we aim for jesus As we aim for the embodiment of the kingdom among us reconciliation renewal and restoration for the flourishing of all people Why can't we just change that one little thing? Surely that won't make a big difference or maybe The reason it makes a big difference is because of the bigotry of the masses maybe they're insufficiently evolved or maybe they're they're not sufficiently moved by the spirit of god or maybe They're you know, maybe they're too old and we just have to wait for a generation for them to all die out and let All of the young people who have been raised on the media of today who will think nothing of it. I don't know That's where we're headed to jesus to the kingdom. That's not quite where they got though To the beauty and the work of christ in all things and from there We really made a lot of shifts and all of a sudden. I think we were something like a progressive christian church and then We were a rapidly declining church And I don't know what we ended up, you know a not church or some we became so, you know the whole thing is is just fascinating and again, i'll put the link to the whole video in there because His whole basically this is his goodbye talk to This is his goodbye talk to the church because he's not doing it anymore So then of course I you know, I wanted to find the church. So All right, we'll go part of my So then you can go down to eastlake And then they've got their current services and right at the beginning of all of their current videos they have their They have their their little Their little promo about who their church is Welcome to eastlake We are an inclusive faith community dedicated to the free search for truth and meaning Seeking and again, I mean all these things I could say I think these are my estuary groups in some ways the free search of truth And meaning well, absolutely i'm down i'm in you would think that if you put this out there People will rush to it, right? To live out a more just and life-giving spirituality. It's so funny when you show images like this And it's like well, wait a minute. Are you really secular? Have you really stripped away all of the religious? you know crustaceans that have gone to your hall or Are you just nervous about the christian ones and the the other ones are are chic and cool and we can let those in It's just marketing after all isn't it? in the modern world We see faith as less about doctrines and dogmas demanding total agreement But a life to be lived enjoyed and given away to others And again, I mean you could if someone had the desire to do so I am 100 certain you could go through and take all find all these little catchphrases of things that i've said I mean Isn't christianity not a list of propositions but a life lived out I mean the dude in 2015 said they're just making this tiny little change and And but now well, this is the change What unites us is a growing awareness that life is a gift and love is the point We get all of the language has been sort of well It isn't a gift from god or the god of the hebrews or you gotta get rid of all of that because then you're excluded See at some point and this is where a lot of the other videos are saying well There is an essence to your new church Is it christ or is it something you got to through christ? Or at least the christ that you had and christ eventually became Incidental to this other thing that you were chasing Welcome the life is a gift and love is the point We welcome the entire human family regard See and this is see when when people talk like this this is when the inner troll comes out because it's like I am very close to people I could send to your church and you would not want them there for more than 15 minutes And you surely wouldn't want them opening their mouths if all means all I hope you're ready for all because I've got names Regardless of race age creed physical abilities marital or economic status gender identity or sexual orientation So what's that on her nose? Gender identity or sexual orientation Why is her nose a different color it might just be a mistake I i'm just curious and maybe someone in the comment section say no that's because and then you teach me about some New thing that I can't possibly know So if you are curious and have come to see If you are tired and have come to rest If you are grateful and have come to share If you are journeying and have come to grow If you are wounded and have come to heal If you are joyful and have come to shine welcome home That is well done they put a lot of time and a lot of work to put something quite that slick, I mean branding marketing I mean You just captured the zeitgeist In a really, you know, it's a minute That's hard that's really hard and you know Mega churches have gotten really good at this And so, you know as I said in my equity justice versus merciful accommodation what starts out as just human mercy and someone's like That's it. I find this often with with some people who are well We don't which shouldn't we care for them? But very quickly people turn around and say hey I don't want to be the object of your charity or mercy I deserve justice I deserve Acknowledgement I deserve equity so I don't want your stinking charity Okay, and quite frankly Most of the time they don't want your stinking church either If you're if you're calling sexual minorities the weak And that was an argument that I have plenty of books on the subject. Well, these are these are the weaker brothers. Oh Well, that's not equality is it? You know where this sort of goes in terms of a hermeneutic of suspicion I'm not saying anything about nick. Nick was absolutely delightful here, but It what I hear cynically from people is the naive mythology of mean old white dead christian tyrannical church leaders that's Why chesterton's fence is there? They wanted to control the bodies of gay people They wanted to control the bodies of they wanted to control bodies. They wanted to control bodies Well, I like controlling my body I haven't found myself terribly successful at controlling the bodies of anyone else And the it's sort of a subtraction story that gets told You know, why can't the crc just stop fighting about same-sex marriage Back before we had science and stuff. We thought gay people were sex addicts and child molesters Some of these guys wrote the bible from that bigoted posture But now because of science and nice jesus and stuff We know that we were wrong that they were wrong and so we can dismiss what they wrote and finally Progressively get closer to the eschaton That's a rather cynical Articulation of the generally speaking the most common argument I hear from people It's not so much an argument. It's much more sort of a justification It's 2021 for pete's sake as if the calendar tells us what you what we should do Sometimes it does plant your crops How did these ideas get written into the bible in the first place? That's kind of a hard question And I don't think anybody has a good answer for that And this is exactly where we get to chesterton's fence because here we find this fence here We find these seven clobber text and here we have genesis one, which I think is the foundational text now a new atheist would say that's arbitrary uninformed motivated by bigotry, but Where does the bigotry come from? Why well I it's just obvious because I see bigotry all around me. Yeah, but you're living now Don't you have to find this bigotry? 2,000 years ago 4,000 years ago 10,000 years ago 100,000 years ago. Isn't that the project of evolutionary biology and psychology? Is the bigotry But now we're sort of into brett weinstein's circular trap again if it is natural well, then we can just Step out of it. Just like my lenovo computer is going to step out of The windows operating system and one day say nope. It's mac today paul I don't think i'm going to see that I think I can turn this computer on every day until the computer or I die And it will be windows every time That's what we mean by programming Was this fence of use in the past that's a good question and I have heard zero Now I haven't heard everything obviously so let me know in the comment section I've heard zero people answer that question I want to know i've got some ideas actually To evaluate the fence you first need to understand its history where it came from even if you're talking within the whole show Here's an idea that i've had inhuman That's in human times in earlier times when tribal population Tribal population growth was so essential for the power against rivals with same-sex sexuality a luxury good That was seldom afforded in other words You know just read the book of samuel or the book of judges The the wife why why was the wife who has many sons celebrated well because those many sons good daughters are good, too But sons sons can work in the field sons can wield swords sons can tend at the gate Sons can keep the midianites and the philistines from raiding your camp if at least we get iron age technology Sons can decide whether or not the family thrives over time Sons and human muscle power is really really important and if we out procreate your tribe we will dominate you and Genocidal spelling bee of the genetic code we in fact will inherit the earth Those who procreate inherit the earth. This is an idea that has Nearly completely fallen out of favor in terms of weird people weird western educated industrial On and on I didn't write it down. I don't remember the r a democratic is the d the r Someone will write it in the comment section or it'll bubble up in my brain a few minutes from now Procreation was a matter of life and death for your culture verse tribe And same-sex sexuality is basically wasted and someone who is only having sex or Doing sexual things with a member of the same sex You can do those things until the cows come home and you are not going to have a son You are not going to have a baby You can see this in the bible You know hannah cries to her husband, you know Or her husband says to hannah. Am I worth am I not worth five sons to you? Panina is lording it over hannah hannah says no and so she goes to the tabernacle and weeps bitter tears And the lord hears her cry and gives her a son and she does the audacious thing of giving him back to the lord What's all that coming out of it's coming out of the Realization that it is be fruitful and multiply and have dominion over the earth up to and including your neighbors or You're going to be a sad note of history And in fact the really good genocides are the ones that have left no record You know when the europeans got to the americas they discovered the winning of the winners of all the genocides Because all the other genocidal groups. Well, what are these groups? Well all these other groups we track culturally because if you take out the culture layer you look around and say homo sapiens One is as good as another I guess just like the mice in the field Unless now suddenly you're labeling them and differentiating them and you have an endangered species list That we don't work that way the greatest threat in the ancient world was to be cut off Does same sex? the same sex Sexuality make any sense in that world. Maybe that's a source of the bigotry I don't know. That's just one I thought of i've never read it in a book I've never thought of it at all. It makes sense to me. Is it true? We can't test it in a lab It seems plausible But maybe that's the source of bigotry and maybe today. Well, we seem to have enough people but then again Let's just imagine that all of the democrat help everyone who votes for the democratic party Stops having babies and everyone who votes for the republican party keeps having babies Do you think that'll have any impact in the elections of 2040? Who's to say Palestinians and jews africans and europeans Westerners have just sort of said Making babies isn't important anymore. There seems to be lots of us. We need fewer people in the world Oh, okay Are you volunteering to get off? Well, maybe if they blast me into space to mars How many volunteers do we have for that one-way mars mission anyway? I mean this thing gets weird quickly and i'm not someone who believes that you know People should start having babies. I am someone who believes that over population or you know, I I don't know Read the alchemy of air at the beginning of the first world war There was a real crisis and at least in the alchemy of air whoever whatever scientists put that math together said Well, maybe the carrying capacity of the world optimally was three and a half or four billion people at the beginning of the 20th century It was less than that and part of the reason germany was in trouble and looked longingly at poland and ukraine and belarus Was its land was so poor and worn out And why was that little war fought in in south america next to the coast? For bat droppings the great bat droppings war Well because they needed fertilizer and then suddenly you have the fixation of air and we can draw nitrogen from the air Because we're surrounded by nitrogen and not a drop to put in the soil and now you can fix nitrogen and now we've got nitrogen all over the place and we can refresh fields and we can Blow up buildings in oklahoma city There's a lot going on here In the ancient world for them to say, um, just the productive orifice, please There's a just so story I suppose but i've never heard anybody tell it maybe that's chesterton's fence, I don't know is it Answering the natural question always leads round to the winestein circular trap It can't tell you whether or not it is moral unless you assume Morality is fundamentally an instrumental adaptation for the genocidal spelling bee and then once again, you no longer have morality We only develop morality so we could outcompete our neighbors Wait Then jesus morality really seems strange Because no you're supposed to you're supposed to love your neighbor. And in fact The christian story has a man Who says he's god dying for his enemies That doesn't seem anywhere aligned with this genocidal spelling bee at all You lose morality in other words The morality maps onto heaven's spirit mind all the time psychologically for us. It's just right Oh Is it right now? alvin plantiga um veritas forum just published a little clip of alvin plant alvin plantiga basically in short sentence completely disrupting moral relativism because it's this Classic alvin plantiga move once you make the statement that morality is relative Well, you've just made you've just mapped onto heaven's spirit mind You've just broken the rule you're trying to establish Morality either morality is or it isn't those are the only two options Because it maps onto heaven's spirit mind eternally psychologically, it's just right It's always been right. It's never been right to eat your children Well, what if you're starving in the ukraine because stalin has you know, taken all the grain for the cities It's still never right and when you listen to brett weinstein Listen to brett weinstein declare his ability to go from windows to mac overnight that's You'll never get me to do that. Oh, okay And hey, i'm not doubting you lots of people have been stubborn like that in history and we count them as moral heroes But the whole idea of morality begs heaven's spirit mind Eternality that's the mode that we go into mentally It's wrong and it always will be and it doesn't matter what it would get me. It's always always wrong That's the game we're playing So give up on that dream and you lose humanity C. S. Lewis the abolition of man But then well, how can we account for the bible because if we And we do this. Well, you know usury When jesus says if they ask for your cloak give it to them Well, i'll give you my cloak, but I want your cloak. I want my cloak back and I want a shekel And then i'll give you my cloak john calvin says no because they need your cloak you should give them the cloak out of mercy but if you say I want a talent of gold And i'm going to invest it and i'll return your talent of gold. You say hey, wait a minute You're gonna earn money from my talent of gold Why don't you give me a talent of gold and a little bit of interest besides? Jesus tells a parable about that doesn't he? Maybe we have to get into Maybe we have to account for the bible. Isn't that sort of what i'm asking from this video? Give me an account Tell me Show me chesterton's fence with respect to this argument Now this is modern biblical scholarship and if you want a really amazing demonstration of it watch christine haze's lectures from yale university on the bible now warning It's only going to be the hebrew bible. It's not going to be the new testament And she'll explain why But she goes through and will walk through the various sources the thinking behind it the community Um ezekiel kalfman israelite religion biblical religion the deuteronomist It's a it's an amazing presentation that she walked through but Recognize what she's doing. She's deconstructing this and in a sense It is in some ways just the legacy of luther because the bible doesn't come from above so much. But well luther This stuff gets complicated It's a product of the whole show Unless we fudge by saying the bible of faith. Well, this is the jesus of faith You can find that on pbs and that's sort of like hail decart We have the the substance down below and the substance above and it's like hey, wait a minute Did you just snuggle in the discarded image? Rene de cart you just called it spiritual substance and put it somewhere other than above the moon Surely different communities were in conflict I'm sure they were But what is the source of their conflicts? evolutionary psychology geography natural resources psychology It's about Is it about fruitless sex versus sex that makes babies that can grow crops and win wars? Is that the reason? again, we're How can these questions be answered and again? Evolutionary psychology will not give you evolutionary morality Evolutionary morality it can't So Let me make sure I didn't skip women in office same-sex marriage What were the biblical authors thinking and why and i'm not one to say that that's unimportant if you want to read the bible and interpret the bible the What was the authorial? Intent is an important thing to look at and historical questions matter And so, yeah But this then we kind of get lost in the trap of the quest for the historical bible because well We have the bible of history and the bible of faith and we got another cartesian dualism here Now the too long don't read it is sort of what we do because well sexuality in the new testament just on crc voices You know We got some really smart people on crc voices and they give me great ideas and they give me good book references as if I didn't need to buy more books Understanding the key text by william loader. He's in the affirming camp Well, then i'm not going to read it. Well, he's in the traditional camp. Oh, i'm going to be all over it Well, why well because I like to have my biases confirmed oh Is he furt or again it that's all I need to know So I can keep up my tribal reading chart up to date But then there's the ancient world and again part of what's made tom holland so fascinating to watch is Boy thermopylae The greeks versus the persians In these little books where I saw those noble spartans standing up against persia and tom holland and dominic sandbrook and tom holland says well america's Kind of this persians really What's going on there and the more he digs in well sort of in the victorian era, you know when they found pompe in the modern era, they you know took all the sex stuff and put it in a warehouse because Can't have people thinking the romans were pervs That they had pornography all the over the place Can't think that One can't be too careful in their reading or their archaeology because well the ancient world like to get it on So, you know There's all well the apostle paul didn't know any committed same-sex couples. Well, he certainly didn't know any gay marriages because That would have been unthinkable and the whole idea of marriage in the ancient world was very different from marriage in our world and and and So someone points me to plato's symposium and I start I start I read the relevant texts and oh, that's interesting I was like I should read some more of this so start at the beginning and you know Socrates is going down to the wrestling club and you know, they're all going to talk about love and parental love and all sorts of love but You know, hey Anybody have any crushes in here? They're all boys It's those youths those youths those youths are not really kind of people We think our children are people but the ancient world Their sons and daughters. It's here's the thing. It's really hard to mind read And imagine ourselves in their thought processes when Again, we've got earth flesh matter and heaven Keep my order right heaven spirit mind And there's a lot that goes into this and we know that you know You find in the symposium all these things about well before they get whiskers Well, you know the romans had a thing about hair They didn't like hair and if you know anything about how the roman sort of bathed You put oil on and you get a you get a scraper and you scrape off the dirt And and romans will just look at the art. Look at david, you know just hair nicely on top of the head maybe a little bit below but Greek ideal well Once we start getting whiskers they start getting white and we start to can and you know But we like our people undecayed carved in marble beautiful youthful ideal That's not That's their whole worldview put together in some ways art always is an expression of that Gen sex and general morality was vastly different from our own just just You know, there's a there's a terrific I was reading an article on the internet from harvard about you know sexuality in the symposium and It's pretty wild stuff because you know the They're talking about the the poet and his lover as one of the sections and he says, you know this This this chasing after youths before they start growing beards That isn't the best kind of love a better kind of love is once they come into Once they come into manhood and then you know They approach these things the whole time in different ways from us and No christianity to contaminate it. No judaism in sight It's just people but then again was that Normal. Oh, i'm sorry normativity. There we are again While anthropology will answer the question if we if we extend the data set Part of the reason we have the histories we have Is because one of the few ways we can get into the minds Of people who've been dead a long time is if they could write Our two worlds mythology mapping continues to dog us We want to know the mind of the past and if we know their mind will have a sense of their morality Not just the matter and how they left it and Whatever remains remains and unless we have a lot of writing and you know what having a lot of writing isn't necessarily helpful Because the more if they just have a little bit of writing then we just keep projecting onto it But if they have a lot of writing and we keep reading it Well, then we realize just how distant they are now we're back to tom holland land We realize the speed of mind and how it changes and the limitations of reading ancient minds over the gap and that of of course keeps Academia and scholarship really fun. We can have new interesting insightful refreshed creative ideas about what exactly they were thinking and why they were crushing on the youths and And how they regarded boys and how they regarded girls and what their morality was just read the symposium It's you know, it's play-doh. It's socrates. It's it's great stuff to read But you start reading it and you have this kind of thing in mind and you begin like, oh wow Do we really want to go back there I mean that's tom holland's Crisis is is that really? Well, we have we have morality now Now from where To what degree is human sexuality nature and nurture Oh, we've used those categories for a while but We our resolution is far too high to Really have those boxes be so discreet Can you answer this question? What can this duality tell you about morality? We've got jonathan height and moral taste buds and c.s. lewis intuitions and brett and heather doing evolutionary biology and making statements about well What we find is really ugly, but we'll go from windows to mac just like this Our sexuality seems far more complex and fluid than anything else we find in the animal kingdom in nature Which should indicate that it has culture track All over it to a degree that we have no idea especially because how far back do we really have writing? These are not questions we are going to answer For the most part most christian progressives argue as such Argue as such Imagine the line can be held at two people for life instead of male female for life. That's sort of where this This megachurch pastor went. Okay. Let's let's just start with communion Made by usually aging weird westerners Now you have to keep your eye on the patterns Looking for the patterns and my eyes on the patterns are watching them and so we got There's a lot of shaking going on And and what i've noticed is that for the older generation this makes perfect sense because if you read for example the 1973 report from the christian reform church It's very much tilted in terms of born that way Because before that there was a regime of well It's because they weren't mothered properly or or something like that And so, you know It was the mother's fault or the father's fault that their kid was gay because that was nurture And so what we usually do is we overreach each time and so it's all nurture and then it's all nature It's all nature they're just born that way and born that way really sort of kind of cleaned up the playing field because well and and suddenly Because the civil rights movement was happening metaphors responding to race relations Which I have known not a few black folks who find the appropriation of the civil rights movement in this cause rather offensive Because they say you know when I walk into a room There ain't no cover in my skin color And the history of oppression that has gone on and the bigotry and all of those layers there of morality so Really you're gonna really compare this to the lynchings of jim crow. Ooh moral equivalents. Oh paul. Don't do that. Don't go there But born that way is going away and Andrew sullivan for example isn't happy it is and you know part of the reason he writes what he writes is he's saying They're destroying everything I tried to build and it hasn't been in u.s. Law for a decade yet What's supplanting it is the secret sacred self Because we already have a sense remember Evolutionary psychology and biology is the last gasp of modernity. What comes after modernity? Well, it's my Oh you the one thing your religion is what you won't deconstruct your religion is what you want to deconstruct Your religion is what you can't deconstruct the one thing that I can't deny It's a new cartesianism is my lived experience Okay but living goes through time so When are you what? Well, what's authentic to me is how I feel it mirrors my secret sacred self and that secret sacred self is always evolving Well, that makes some sense, you know If you if you think about it because your the zeitgeist is evolving and you're aging and there's there's lots of patterns going on It's really hard to find each other. But born this way is going away And we've had a time. It's sort of like well winter and summer. We had a time when oh Your gay kids are your mama's fault or your daddy's fault And then we had a time with Well, your gay kids are the are the fault of your dead relatives and all the genetics that got or its birth order or it's Or it's the amount of testosterone that the baby was it's your body and so it's involuntary. It's natural Okay, and again, i'm not skeptical about anything. I don't know this. I just read it but now it's like no, but Just like going from mac to windows you can evolve It's not only your right it's your duty To continue to mirror the secret sacred self to to self construct and manifest that which is true for you now So but the old guard still assumes a rather static human sexuality of let's say 95 percent People locked in as hetero and three to five percent same-sex attracted or bi But now how does this work in history? Well, why was the julio claudin dynasty so queer? I mean again, I read in I read dynasty over my last break and Claudius That strange man only liked having sex with women didn't he understand that penises were for pleasure procreation and power That's what a penis is for Come on claudius get with the program sleeping with only girls You don't know how to really run an administration you probably were murdered by Let's say I gotta remember which one we're down to nero Why couldn't the rest of the and here's the chesterton fence question Why couldn't the rest of the church recognize the goodness of the three percent of gay couples in the church in the first century? Who were filled with the spirit? I've been going through the book of acts and this revolution in terms of the question of circumcision Is so profound. I mean it grips the book of galatians and in many ways It's one way to understand the sort of the the the shape of the book of acts If you could overturn circumcision And you have at least three to five percent of the people around you living without stigma In the roman empire From whence comes the bigotry against gays Tell me show me Tell me why to take down chesteron fence i'll listen to you because for me in many ways I would love nothing better. I really would because it would make my life in northern California with the friends I have and with the church that i'm trying to help survive It would seem to make it a whole lot easier, but everything that I look at when I look at it says And I find The advocates Of evangelical save sex marriage frankly lazy What do you mean lazy? They've made all those books. I know But you need some new arguments because some of the real arguments. I don't think you've dealt with and This is one of them where are The same-sex couples that paul affirms. No, he didn't affirm them because he didn't know. Oh Because things have changed. Oh If they could overturn circumcision, then the obviousness of the goodness of gay christians filled with the spirit should have been evident enough Now i'll give you the best christian argument because i've got a consciousness congress and there are days when it's like I mean you can I wrestled through this on my blog years ago and I wrote different posts and I remember when I wrote The post was like there are days that I feel like no just Forget this fight Just affirm and fly the flag and move on and my life would be so much easier The best christian same-sex marriage argument as I see it is you've got to ride the pauline egalitarian train all the way to the present Make a pragmatic population control argument. Well, maybe You know The stigma against same-sex couples was because they needed population growth in order for a community to survive So it's sort of a biological evolutionary argument So you take egalitarianism you take that argument? And perhaps add some speculation about no marriage and being given in marriage in the eschaton from jesus in the gospel of matthew Boom, there you go Why would I why would I give you that argument? I think it's the best one that i've heard. Why haven't you given me a better one? Maybe i'm giving aid and comfort to the enemy and so some who are on the Traditional side of this argument aren't going to like this section of the video But if you're at least an hour plus, I don't know how long this video has been into it. You probably Pretty much know I I'm like this But there's still a lot going against it and I have three plus hours in my why marriage equality means the death of the protestant churches And our psychology is too weird To help in many ways we we don't know enough. We don't have enough of the ancient world. You can't do the math I think it's just giving us false signals and I I I hear what thing and i'm selective about it And i'm like, I don't know i'm not a scientist. I'm not a psychologist. I'm not an anthropologist I'm not any of those things But me like how many of us have to somehow make our own mind because well, here's the question of the day Genesis and sexual dimorphism is a really tough thing to get over I'm just saying men and women are different Are we only different because of culture Well, if you listen to brett and heather again one of the little tidbits, I love listening to him. I like those guys Well, why are men bigger and stronger than women well that brett says is perhaps because In ancient populations males competed with other males for sex and so the men would be larger Sounds reasonable to me I don't know here we are. We got to make a choice Christian god of redemption Is a man of the world Here we are we got to make a choice Christian god of redemption is the god of creation There's no good god an evil god. There's no good god who created heaven spirit mind and an evil god who created earth flesh matter Give that up and I think you give up christianity Where our low rates of same-sex behavior are result of generations of stigma Was that a positive thing? now The downsides, of course are the suffering that have been highlighted in the debate over the last 50 years and I think they've won the day I think we are no longer We no longer want to stigmatize we want to accept into our community as this is how they are They didn't choose this way, but born this way. Well sort of but it's more complicated than that So what do we do about it? That's really hard and neither am I I I was hoping for more from the human sexuality report, but any report by committee is a really hard thing And there's just sort of Variable positions to deal with in that do you take sort of the hard line position hard line positions aren't of themselves Not bad things to go. We have hard line positions in our society about a whole range of things and i'm glad they're there Softer positions aren't bad either because Human sexuality is variable and people do evolve and we should have mercy and How on earth should the church? regulate all of this stuff That's the question Are we starting to see tremors of a transitional stage with massive gender dysphoria this concerns me Because maybe the stigma just sort of Corraled people into channels. We have the really big one and the really little one and but we've known human sexuality is very fluid and And and very subject to all sorts of variations and and we don't even we I I suspect we we just don't know the half of it But maybe that basically two channel system was a good one. Well now we're going to blow up that binary We have no idea where this goes We really don't and that on top of how many other technological differences there are On top of how many other technological disruptions it's a scary world Conflict i'm going to use this word in scare quotes is natural and those of you who watch my rough drafts for sundays and Especially if you keep up with the sermons on the on the church channel The progressive crew to cruciform nature of christian revelation through the church I believe that in fact We learn as the church goes forward and I subscribe and believe in the divinity of christ As many have said you find the trinity in solution in the bible. It's not there as such the church comes up with it later Oh, you're protestant. Yeah, i'm the kind of protestant. I am I'm not a wholly different religion. I'm just saying There's some things that protestants would like to continue to have ongoing dialogue with with the roman catholics and let's throw the orthodox in while they're here now But over time we learn and hopefully this is something we will learn through over time people drop and then the progressive christianity and the generation of luxury moral religion and again, i'm working on the george ancy book and Thinking about doing commentary on that. Shawn mcdowell george ancy conversation because Well, you've got the spreading apart of conservative christianity and progressive christianity And chances are good one is going to drop the label and I think actually one side has been dropping the label for 100 years And that doesn't mean that there isn't plenty of conservative christianity Deconstructing no, there's plenty of that too and it doesn't mean that conservative christianity isn't changing all the time in ways that they're not even Conscious of no that's evident to me too And I apply that to the roman catholics and the orthodox as well. It's all a very live scene Over time people drop the christian label and disappear into the contemporary cultural background noise They stop fighting they stop caring The church is an obsessive curator it's one of its largest adaptive advantages part of the reason I think Part of the reason I continue to promote that people in fact become christians And commit to churches is because actually I think in the west this has been one of the most profitable ways by which we can not only Pass through conflict but do so productively because we're leaving so many ideas of mind out there in the world For our descendants to be able to go back and think well, what was paul vanderkley thinking? I'll be judged by history But again, i'm also a conservative christian who believes i'll be judged by my god And that my history will go on After my hopefully loving family puts me in the grave And i'll answer to my god for this video and for all the other videos that i've made that's not That's a scary thought where there's much talk there's much sin i've talked a lot The good news is that this too will be sorted out one way or another to one degree or another The bad news is we'll all be dead The bad news is we'll all be dead unless you believe in the resurrection in which you'll just be gone from this world and Maybe we'll know more when we get to the other side In some ways protestantism is working as designed designed or did we just kind of fall into this? What do I mean? You have differentiation of experimental tribal communities taking radically different stands on a variety of issues in real time The roman catholics tend to do it all in house. They have their orders and monasteries and you know Their dynamics are different and the orthodox they're They're different too. I don't know enough about them to comment on them But what protestant bit protestantism basically does is you have this whole laboratory of experimental communities And so you got the pc usa trying the affirming thing And the united methodists are fighting over it And the crc well, it's our turn to step up to the plate and here we are You're just at the plate for a few decades Will this kill the crc? I don't know will it birth another denomination? Well, it has in the rca the alliance of reformed churches or reformed alliance dot org whatever they are, um My friends dan ackerman and tim vinck leading that So yeah, lots of stuff is happening, but protestantism is kind of working as it's always worked and it's a mess But we're playing with it and when you look at the eastlake guy Who resigns from ministry on youtube? He's out down in escondito. He's in escondito. He's in um, ensonada. I think he's in mexico And he's talking about the new path that he's going to take. Well, this is protestantism. This is this is how it works And it's a mess Consumerism is working You get to choose which team to join And you get to change your mind and opt out of one and into another and you get to deconstruct and you get to do All those things that's working too In a few centuries, we'll see what churches are left standing and what they believe and what they look like and what their practices are That's the way this works That's the way it always has worked Maybe the reformed and the orthodox have some points the lindy effect and we see protestants being flailed about and the roman catholics like Are you going to ordain women? Are you out of your mind? And you've got guys like um Like jamie smith at calvin that says i'd love to be roman catholic, but I can't deal with their stance with women in office Okay. Well consumerism protestantism Americans love to have choice and america is all about the protestants and protestants Really love america Whether they fly a flag or not They love the choices it has and of course, you've got some of that and britain and canada and australia and the netherlands and germany and All of the places y'all listen to me from So here we are. We're doing it. We're riding the wave. We're in the middle of it But my challenge to all one body and my friends and those on voices i've raised this challenge all the time is Chesterton's fence Tell me why the barrier was put up And we'll have a better idea of why it can be taken down Was the barrier put up because those tribes in israel needed? To multiply and have lots of sons and so same sex that same sex Activity was stigmatized Was that why onan was stigmatized? Is that why you had all of these other things? I mean you can tell me that story. I won't yell at you you But Nobody seems to be interested in that We're seem to be marching to the eschaton and we all just seem to know this is right except of course the other side That says we know it's wrong. Okay Well, let's have a better conversation I think generally speaking the burden of proof should be on the change side but We don't seem to do that either churches just Protestant churches tend to be democracies of such and if you if you have enough people Gain the idea together whether they got the idea from will and grace or or from watching the suffering of their gay brother They still get to vote and they vote for pastors and pastors keep their eye on the flock and On and on and through and through and this is the way we go The account for chesterton's fence Account for chest and since chesterton's fence and you have my attention More than imagining that mf4l Male female for life to two people for life is an inconsequential adjustment I'm looking at the data You know the eastlake guy comes up and it's like that's data. That's data Trying to use social bullying Backed by western implicit protestant consumer liberationist imperialism. There's some fun words for you That doesn't impress me I guess i'm stubborn but i'm also open-minded and so I've i've i've challenged a couple of crc ministers who are more on the progressive end if they want to join me in a conversation I'm happy to do so Now I know it's my channel and they might get shellacked in the comment section and who knows what would happen? But you know, I you know, my conversation with nick was absolutely lovely. I I didn't know who he was going into it he was just a rando that Sent me a lot of emails. And so finally because he said you sounded a little annoyed when I when When I suggested we have a conversation I wasn't really annoyed. I wasn't annoyed at having a conversation with you I just sometimes don't know what to do with all the Requests for conversations because like a crazy man, I basically let anybody onto my channel But I like being crazy. So I have to deal with the consequences. So Yeah, let me know where's chester Satisfy chesterton's fence. I think you would I think you would forward I think you would forward the conversation and forward the debate now the christian reform church is going to have a vote at senate 2022 I imagine and Like we usually do we'll make decisions and we'll live with the consequences And whether it holds together it doesn't hold together. I have no idea but I don't want to go into fall 2022 Not having at least done what I could For us to have a better conversation and a better discussion so I don't know how long this video was But thanks for watching leave a comment Love to know what you think
