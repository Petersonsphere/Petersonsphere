 Okay, so where do you want to begin? Well let's start with the marriage discussion and you know like all the things that all the people that you had were talking about where it was really great just to hear that young people and I've I mean I had that kind of mentality too like kind of not knowing what marriage is and I feel like I didn't really know when I was married I remember saying to people like how does it feel you're married now? I mean because I lived with my husband before we got married and I was kind of like yeah it's just the same you know and it wasn't until after you know he kind of left and all that stuff that I realized what marriage really was and I did read Tim Keller's book at least I read three fourths of it I haven't read the last bit of it but I thought that was really good to help me kind of get a deeper understanding of what marriage is and that God has really been teaching me that it like kind of like he says like it's it's a tool really for another tool for us to die to ourselves and really fully embody love to another person and which is why I'm still standing for my marriage and for my husband's salvation I you know it's just I feel convicted about it like if you know like if if Jesus can like stand for us and even though we had our backs turned to him then I can like stand for my husband you know and pray for him love him even though I'm super offended by things he does and I've had to die to myself multiple times with many different things you know so at this think that marriage is really just kind of a sacrifice of yourself for another person it kind of makes you into a better person by doing it it's a great thing go ahead no no you're doing fine I again it's just because of the ambiguities here I don't know to what degree I mean if we decide to share this or part of it I mean because people you know the first time we talked you you shared your story quite a bit more and you know it's been a couple of years now and you know we haven't spoken we haven't spoken for a while so you I don't know how you would I don't know how you would want to articulate a little bit of your story in a in a way that people could both understand and then appreciate your comments okay well yeah so I was kind of raised in a Christian home kind of like a non-denominational probably the charismatic sort of Christian home and the vineyard if you know yeah and yeah but then in college like most people I couldn't hold on to whatever I had growing up like the materialism kind of hit me and I couldn't in college like I wasn't anything for me to stand on with my faith in a sense like I didn't really understand it and so I kind of just let it go in college and into colleges when I met my husband he's not a believer but you know we we got along great and we fell in love and we've been together since college that was back in 2005 ish 2004 ish when we met so and you know and then we were together through college and then out of college and then you know we always wanted to get married but we lived together first you know because we kind of I wasn't practicing being a believer and he had no faith so and then we got married in 2011 and yeah just living together whole time and then we bought a house in 2014 and then in 2016 he went on a work trip and it was only for two weeks but then when he came back he told me that he was in love with the person that he wanted to work trip with and at that point I was about a month pregnant and so that was a blow and so and I feel like in that it wasn't just that moment but the subsequent year maybe even two or three years after that there was a quite a bit of unraveling of a worldview for sure in the first couple months and when Jordan Peterson talks about the bottom falling out dropping into the chaos in the ocean I definitely felt that I felt like I don't know like you everything you ever kind of believed or thought kind of just fell out from under you like what is love what was that we had who are you you know just all those questions and honestly it created in me kind of this I felt betrayed of course my husband but also by the world like all the lies of soulmates like because he's like oh worse me and this other woman are soulmates and I was like what does that even mean and all these that must have felt like a real slap in the face yeah the years you had been together and that you married yeah I really did feel like all the things the world says about about true love and finding the one and follow your heart and just do you and make yourself happy and like all these things that are antithetical to the Christian worldview which I had kind of just kind of gone along with before I could now see behind it and just see how much harm those lies can cause people and how how living by them kind of lands you in this place of like oh shoot I don't know just it just kind of back stabbed me and so you know I came back to church pretty quickly like that happened in January February 2016 and then by June when I was like in my fifth pregnancy I went back to church and crying and the whole thing but it was it felt like the right thing to do it felt good it felt safe and everybody had told me as as the world will like oh just take care of you just do your thing just screw him you're gonna be good you know move on but all I wanted to do was to repair the relationship he was not into that at all we tried a little bit but he was in it and I can't make him yeah so eventually he moved out on his own he lives with other women now still with the same woman that he met or a different woman same woman as far as I know I don't ask a lot of questions I've learned along the way to like just kind of like like God do whatever he's doing with him and just focus on me I can't control him I mean that was the other thing that kind of crashed down around me like between a year you know the year after it happened was that I have the illusion of control went away that I have no control and accepting that and that was that was tough I was really hard you know I tried like try to get him into counseling I tried to appeal to his friends I tried to appeal to his mother like I you know I could yeah I tried to punish like well you're not gonna be there for the birth and you're not gonna you know like yeah whatever I could do yeah to try to control yeah they all didn't work yeah yeah eventually it was just like okay full surrender I can't do anything you know and why did you go back to church tell me more about that well in that period so it happened in January and I was just kind of lost and confused in February and I feel like I tried a couple other things I went to a meditation weekend that did nothing for me I was just like I can't do this I went to forgive me like a Reiki thing like in Hawaii that did nothing for me and I I could remember the feelings of kind of belonging and strangely enough serenity that I felt when I was kind of a believer even though I didn't really know that I was but I know I had experienced God to a certain extent like going to church camp and you know things like that but I never had a good handle on it I guess you might say didn't really fully understand it I just kind of assumed because I grew up in it I didn't know there was anything different really so I just kind of thought well probably everyone experiences that like I didn't I didn't know what it was yeah but I did like I remember going to that Reiki thing I was with these people and they said have you ever experienced like a peace or like just like a free felt good and I strangely enough I was like well yeah like when I was a believer when I was to go to church like in worship and I never like I felt more one with nature it's strangely enough when I was a believer with God when I would sit in nature and say like God why you built this is you all created all this like I felt more connected to it than I could ever get back to when I wasn't because I like a lot of people in my generation I think you live for vacations and trips to try to kind of fill that gap and like oh I'm gonna go out nature and hike and I'm really gonna like feel it and I try to you know like we would go on hikes and we would go out and I would try to get back to that place of serenity but I don't feel like I ever did like I did when I was with God just for like one better phrase and so anyway I was trying all those things like to feel some sort of peace and feel some sort of control when everything was in chaos and I was just like I think I gotta go to church I think I gotta go to church and I had told one friend what was going on at the I didn't tell that many people at the time it was happening because ultimately I wanted reconciliation and I was like I can't go around badmouthing him to everybody if I want reconciliation and that took a lot of restraint because we worked in the same place and she worked in the same place we all worked in the same place and it would be very easy for me to tell people oh this is what's happening look at what he's doing look what she's doing outcast that feels sorry for me that would have just been stepping on my own feet so to speak because it was just him warm at me so I had to just keep my mouth closed yeah and then so yeah so I did tell one friend and and she was going to church and so I was like I need to go to church with you and so I went with her and another girlfriend that both did say her same church and I just started going back there and you know like the first or the second time I went with them I went to the front and was on my knees crying and they're like what's going on exactly so yeah I was doing that and then I switched to going to another church which actually is my parents church which you would have told me I would have gone to my parents church like eight months before I've been like no way but I I was feeling like once a week wasn't enough for me I'd like when you're in the you know in those times you need more yeah and so I wanted to go to like a midweek group or some sort of Bible study and I couldn't find one at the church that my friends were going to and you know nothing was going on at there like they were fine so they didn't they were like you know we want to join one but they've been wanting to join one for months and they hadn't so I just looked up one that my parents church and I found one where the pastors some of the pastors of prayer at my parents church are actually running it out of their house and it was like five minutes away from my house it's funny how that happens with God and like I just emailed them was like hey I need to come to this life group they're like yeah come on in and there I showed up like you know six or seven months pregnant and they were you know they were a great community and I automatically just got plugged into community and support yeah and praise God none of them told me I told them my situation and none of them said oh just leave them they're like no we're gonna pray for him yeah and I'm super grateful for that because yeah I know that a lot of even church Christians will tell you just like now forget it it's just not meant to be yeah and I yeah I was glad I was really grateful that they kind of came alongside and they prayed with me yeah now you've been you've been living this life now for a long time yeah now it's been whenever 20 2016 so yeah it was five years yeah five years and along the way there's been a lot of growth a lot of changes a lot of eye-opening like you've been part of that journey you and Peterson like just I don't know crazy revelation about the world and the way things are and I think what fueled it was that kind of betrayal by the world it just just like what is going on what are all these lies and they make me mad they make me mad now like I really don't like the way the world talks about things and I'm like that's totally a lie and people believe it you know like when people talk you know just like for instance for example when you know young women in the workplace so many young women that I've worked with are like I don't know if I want to have children like I don't you know like I just like my life and I'm like you like your life like this like a playing like a field like you get to do so many things and it's very selfish but when you have children your life just goes deep it's just like it's just this depth of of living that you can't get without sacrifice really you know yeah and I try to encourage them like no you want to have children you do you'll be a great mother now a lot of people would hearing your story imagine you wouldn't say something like that because well because someone might say hey now wait a minute you you are a month pregnant when your husband left at least left the relationship to a significant degree whatever happened physically but you now have you now are a mother of a child with and you're sort of co-parenting with this man at a distance who's not your husband that's very complex they might look at you and say how how how does being a mother help you isn't that just a sacrifice and you're not getting all of the the Instagram moments of a happy family and a lovely marriage yeah but it yeah but it goes back to that that like I I'm grateful that it happened when I did have a child because having her has given me a whole nother sense of meaning and like a way to like propel myself to being better and a reason to be better I'm part of I call it standing you know for my marriage is is kind of a legacy aspect for her you know like I could have been very easily been bitter and angry and bad mouthed her father yes but instead because I felt convicted by God and you know because he loved me first I don't think it's hard to explain it I decided to choose love instead the Bible does say love always wins so I'm holding on to that that I can show her through example a better way through then the way the world would have you react yeah the selfish way and it's kind of it's it's kind of like a challenge but that's worth it you know it's kind of like it's issued me this challenge to do better because of her and I want to meet that challenge and I just keep thinking that I want the happy ending you know in a sense and I can't get that happy ending I can't write that happy ending only God can write that happy ending for our story and that you know for her when God writes that happy ending whatever it looks like that's kind of like added into her story like you talk about I mean like we're our own biographies you know our own stories but we're also our parents stories and where we come from stories and you know she won't really remember this time that much no to a certain degree but and that when it becomes part of our story becomes part of her story in legacy you might say yeah and I feel that's like a great gift that I can give her you know in a sense now I think a lot of people if we ever share this video a lot of people watching this video would look at you and say you're stupid because they would say hey look you're a young woman you have a chance for love why don't you be more selfish and you know he left you no you know this is no there's nothing there's nothing on you against you know there's no tag against you I mean and why don't you you know why on earth would you continue to stand for a marriage that your partner doesn't want they would look at that and say this is stupid this is they would I would I would bet a lot of people listening to this would go as far as to say you're not being fair to you I think that's exactly what they would say to you about the decisions that you're making what's your answer to that well I feel like that's what Jesus does for us you know many times in this process I think I've called out to you know cried God or whatever and been like you don't know how I feel and then I go oh you know exactly how I feel and you've walked this road before and I feel like he's been like my constant companion because he might well there's other women that are walking the same path that I've been connected with which is great yeah which which is something that would surprise a lot of people if they just sort of look at TV and the media and things but if you are actually in churches other places networks what you say is very true yeah and but he's been a companion because he he's walked this path before and done it so well that and I feel like he's given me grace to do it you know one thing that really has you know propelled me to is I can't I don't think I mean I can think in my delusional moments that maybe he's happier or maybe that he's fine or whatever but I can't think I honestly I I believe that he's doing something out of his own woundedness you know and making a decision that anybody even someone in the world would say is is a mistake and I can't help but think that someday he he will be regretful and I when I see the regretful him in the future like I just I'll break down a cry because I feel like the only thing that closes the happy ending off for both of us is if I turn away you know like if I if I say screw this I'm gonna choose selfishness I'm not doing this anymore I just kind of closed that door to reconciliation and I don't know what you know restoration that that I so desperately want for him and myself and I kind of keep it open because I still want it because of my daughter and for his future self you know yeah because I know the person that he is right now it may be a little delusional you know deceived and that the person that he was wouldn't have wanted this and I just feel like the person that he is later will be the one wouldn't have wanted this necessarily it might just be something that has to happen to so we know you know maybe it's something that we needed to walk through but yeah if if he never comes back would this still be worth it for you yes why why I'm grateful that it happened strangely enough because of the the revelation that I've had the growing that I've had because of it the depth of understanding of what love really is of what marriage really is the freedom that really comes from dying to yourself like I don't I couldn't have had all that if I hadn't gone through this so I'm very grateful for it I have asked you know God like don't jerk me around like that you know like you know but I've also had to you know come to Grim's like well if he never comes back with that his choice and I just know that I I lived the way I was supposed to you know and I loved deeply and yeah and I you know I showed my daughter a different way than bitterness and fighting and things like that you know I'm really sorry to ask you such hard questions but I think they're important because not every story in this world ends happily and I know that and I I deeply respect I deeply respect the choices that you've made because you know you have it would have been so natural and easy to turn to bitterness and retribution and anger and to mobilize all of your resources to hurt his reputation and to I mean because that's that's the program people normally follow it with stories like yours that's that's the natural course and you have turned away from that course at great sacrifice to yourself and you know I would never want to discourage you from that path because it's it's the godly path I mean you are doing the right thing but it's a very costly path and I also know and I think part of the story of Jesus is that in this world doing the right thing doesn't necessarily pan out I mean they hung them on a cross that's the story yeah yeah I watched your video when you were discussing that with Jordan Peterson I was like that's it's very true that's the story and you know obviously if you're not and this is what I emphasize to people that people like to people like to follow the story of Jesus kind of all the way up to the cross and then they get skeptical about the resurrection and when they do that you lose a huge piece of the story because it's really hard not to look at the story without the resurrection of Jesus and say oh that's a lovely story how noble of him but in the end he's a loser and the resurrection changes that dynamic completely and so I look at and you know this is what we talked about before too I look at your cruciform choices with respect to what happened to you and I look at it and I say you are you're embodying the way of Christ that is a costly path and you are paying the price and so I you know I it's that's always the way it is with the cruciform path when you watch people walk it part of you just longs for something better for them but you know the cost but yeah you know again every time I talk to you about this there's no turning back with you you always say no this is the path I'm gonna walk it I'm gonna walk it in faith I'm gonna walk it in trust and if if if God in fact you know sometime in the future gives me the desire of my heart I will praise him and if that doesn't happen I will praise him still that's what I hear coming from you true yes it's a huge thing and I was gonna ask you if you've seen the movie a hidden life I haven't yet a number of people have said you should watch it but I haven't seen it yet oh my gosh it's really really slow that's what I know about his movies but it's it's it's so beautiful it I make I work in film right so my job is is story so whenever you talk about story I get all excited okay because I live in that world of story and when I've learned so much from Peterson and Peugeot about story as well it but the hidden life there's not so anyway to say I don't there's not that many movies that I'm like oh yeah I love that movie I'm really skeptical and I'm really critical of like almost all entertainment movies but this movie had me crying it was just so beautiful but it because it's the store it's that story is that it's the Christ story in a man's life and it's just like the cost to follow Christ in this world is so heavy it's it's it's so heavy yeah and and that's what the story is about it like you say doesn't when people like I remember reading reviews of it because it doesn't necessarily end well for him but it's such a triumph at the end it's such a triumph because he didn't give in he didn't give in and his life is a conviction on everybody that he encounters and it's it's it's I don't know it's just amazing it's really slow but it's really beautiful but it's it's drawn out because you could see him wrestling with the cost of it you could see him wrestling with it with his wife the townspeople with everything you know but he can't go against his conviction like you just can't there's a really great I won't spoil it for you but there's a really great monologue by this guy who's painting the church and you'll like it you'll like it just just be patient I told I told my wife last night well I was I was looking at a review on YouTube while she was trying to get some work done next to me and and then I said here's the funny thing about even even with spoilers here's the funny thing about movie reviews for a good movie a movie review even with spoilers doesn't ruin it because the movie continues to be a revelation with a bad movie you can spoil it because it has one trick and there's the trick and then you're done so that's you know I've you know maybe we should talk about storytelling because I've been talking about storytelling a lot lately because I've been I've been thinking about so so with you know part of my scheme about Peterson is that with his sort of with his his ceiling that he tries to hold because of his evolutionary scientism and such he he he really resists and speaking as a scientist piece against psychologists over there always says he really resists sort of defaulting to more broadly longer-term Christian ideas such as revelation that that the God of the universe could represent himself in a human being of course Christians say that is Jesus Christ definitively and that in some ways that definitive revelation of that definitive image expresses revelation at a higher degree than we can necessarily build ourselves up to I think that's that's sort of my shorthand understanding of general and special revelation now having said that Christianity has always asserted as the Apostle Paul does in a number of places in the New Testament and I think as the psalmists do that we can in fact have have a knowledge of God by looking at his revelation and and that's in the Psalms the Apostle Paul says it and so I've been thinking a lot about Jonathan Peugeot's parasitic storytelling video really got me thinking about revelation in terms of because if if a story is true let's say true in the way that a bicycle tire is true or true in the road in the way that aiming can be true the true or a story the the more reciprocal broadening that story should have and that's why you know and I know whenever I say this people that's why certain kinds of storytelling have reciprocal narrowing because you know there's I don't know what you think but I've watched my share of bad Christian movies where you know the end of the movie is wonderful I'm a Christian minister and I believe the gospel of Jesus Christ and I'm I want more people to come to Christ but certain kinds of Christian movies are just like these little one-trick ponies you know that here okay so they became a Christian we're all happy movie done it's like you could have told me that movie in three minutes but good storytelling actually tends to be reciprocally broadening and it illuminates it illuminates more of the world as the story is told and so and sort of you know I'm I'm doing a lot of thinking lately about okay why is that because that's that seems to be what I see in storytelling why why is that and if in fact that is the case how might we then in a sense grow in our knowledge of God by pursuing storytelling yeah well that's why that's what I'm thinking about lately and why I've been talking about storytelling so much so yeah I don't know if you have any thoughts on that well I've tons of thoughts on storytelling just well like because you talk about storytelling like everything is narrative and for whatever reason God has wired us to really respond to narrative and like but within narrative there's so many I don't know good when you listen to people that really like Peugeot and other people that really break down like elements of the Bible like so it's like a you know like even Peterson like it's just this little paragraph but there's so much in it based like even like when you know the Hebrew and the stuff like that like and they know the customs you can unpack this thing that like tells so much it's really amazing and it has implications on so many things but the well the narrowing comes from like you said in your video yesterday about it feels preachy you know it's like there's a foregone conclusion that you're trying to hammer over people's heads and like I just feel like that's just you know kind of propaganda or lack of a better and it kind of just tells people what to think instead of asking questions and not really forming a complete answer you know a lot of times when you're coming up with a movie you put I think the best thing to do is like pose a question that this movie is kind of pondering you know like what is like can trust be restored after betrayal like you could do a movie about that question and like explore the different answers to that within characters and then you would explore here's a here's a character where it didn't quite work and here's a character would kind of work you know you would explore different avenues of that it's very hard when you're coming up with stories because I spend time in the story room to really limit yourself to that question because it's easy to get caught up in like oh well maybe it's about I don't know just trust or maybe it's just about I don't know maybe that's love it's hard to like narrow in on like no no we have to kind of stay within this parameter otherwise it gets too broad it just goes out but it's very easy to go to get brought out I often I've made this diagram here it is sitting in front of me but so like I don't know if you could read it it's backwards is it backwards to you no it's good plot character psych and theme meaning bottom meaning so a lot of times I feel like when when I'm in the story we end up talking about plot which is like what happens in the movie but and that's motivated by character right like the plot is like what the character does but and that's why I wrote psych next to the character because that's psychology which has really been Jordan Peters and it helped me like how do characters how do people see the world they see it as a place in which to act and make decisions what they believe but all that points to meaning within the story because ultimately you're a story in it is telling you how to that's why people like stories how to behave in the world telling you how to act in the world and the story whether it starts out with a point of view or not I think sometimes it's dangerous to start out with a really distinct point of view because that's where you get into that propaganda territory but you're evoked ultimately saying something about the way in which to act not because you're telling it but because you're showing it and at the bottom is theme and meaning and when you change things on the top which sometimes happens in filmmaking process you'll be like oh well the character will just do this and it's like well that character wouldn't do that the character you set up wouldn't do that in this scene that I you've just lost me I don't care about them anymore because they don't behave how are you and being safe and when you change things in the plot you automatically change the meaning too because you're changing the character so you're changing what the movie is about and sometimes the theme is moving all over the place and we're not kind of holding course I think it's the director's job writers job to hold course into like generally like what the what you're aiming at but it's it's very hard to do that with thousand voices and things going on in your head that's really true and that was really helpful for me because you know my my idea is that what story is is this sort of massive lossy compression algorithm anybody who knows anything about computer graphics understands that some kinds of compression are lossy and some kinds of compression are lossless now lossless compression has improved lately because computing powers improved and all that but at the beginning we mostly had a lot of lossy compression and so you know that's where you get Jordan Peterson's resolution resolution analogy where is this high resolution this is low resolution and often the difference is loss and lossiness well well storytelling I think narrative is is a an incredibly powerful compression algorithm by which we can take worlds and put them down into you know very limited elements and you know part of with filmmaking part of what's powerful about filmmaking is that it is a very broad canvas in that you have image and now especially with computer graphics there's you know there's a lot you can do with images you have music you have dialogue you have plot you have all of these elements that can be brought together to a movie but like you said part of what you need with a compression with a compression algorithm is also a degree of discipline where in some ways and this is the same for sermons which I'm really bad at in a lot of ways because the death of most sermons is too many disconnected thoughts and it's the same for movies oh for sure but you're I think you said that very well that when you start out with a distinct point of view that can I like if the point of my sermon is this so sometimes writing sermons you write down your point first if that's the point first you could that could be the death of the sermon because you you know well there's the point but it's right there and and in a sense the goal of a sermon or in many ways in a bigger canvas the goal of the movie is to and flesh it's not just the point but the world has to come to that point in the process of the storytelling or the sermon or whatever you're doing so and it's it's a that doing it well and and we're not even exactly sure we know when it's done well and we know when it's done poorly but to say why and how I mean it's it's I mean there's books everybody in Hollywood is trying to figure that out you know like yeah there's classes and books every couple years is a new one have you read this method of storytelling and you know from Joseph Campbell to the Save the Cat I don't know there's so many so many that people read to try to like get a handle you might say on it but it's it's very elusive uh oh the other thing that I wanted to talk about uh was so I read have you read Tolkien's on fairy stories yes so I was reading that and what really stuck out to me was enchantment versus um magic I should read that again it's been a few years so keep talking so the this idea of enchantment which he distinguishes from magic which I never really had before but like and then I also listened to this uh YouTube video called the it's from it's about C.S. Lewis and it's about the other magician other magician and it's talking about science as the other magician and in the there was that idea that alchemy was a thing and that that's kind of magic and and when you talk about trying to grab get a handle and control things like magic seems to be like science like it's very much trying to wield something trying to control something where an enchantment when Tolkien talks about the magic of the elves it was an enchantment it was like an inviting sort of like come participate but it wasn't let me control you and you do this thing right and I feel like if you think about I don't know the kingdom of heaven or god he's very much about enchantment and the other way the world's way is very much about magic like control and um I don't know it's just something I've been thinking a lot about lately it's it's interesting I never thought about that because another thing I'd like to think about a lot too is like the loss of wonder and in the current age and um and how everybody is just dying and aching for wonder in their life but like you talk about the scientific age has really sucked all the wonder out of life and um there's something to losing control that gets you wonder like when you're a child when you don't control everything and when your their parent says come with me we're gonna do this really fun thing and you just kind of go because you trust them and they take you and it's like the most it's so everything is so much more wondrous when you're a child because you have a loss of control but you have trust and um so when you're in that place of uh enchantment wonder life just seems so much better and it feels so much more exciting but when you try to control everything when you try to be certain about everything uh there's a lot of wonder lost you know and people talk about magic you know like in a wondrous way but it's magic is actually not so wondrous it's more about control yes and so a distinction between the two is kind of interesting yeah no i think that's i think that's very true and i think that i think that gets at this reciprocal broadening versus reciprocal narrowing because enchantment gives a broader world so the magic of the elves you know rope with the elves their rope is more ropey and you know they can the knots hold better and they can untie and they're smaller and lighter yet they're stronger the clothing covers more the clothing does what clothing is supposed to do better and and that's this broadening effect whereas magic like technology is all about confinement okay and in a sense what you do i like to i like a i like to think of this with the language of power over versus power through so power over if i have power over someone there i restrict and constrain their agency right but that's not the kind of of power god gives god's power is power through so that i through the holy spirit i actually have more agency not less and you know the the discipline is self-discipline which is different from you know the constraints of another on us because constraints of another on us is about our weakness whereas self-discipline is about our strengths exercising strength self-discipline actually makes us stronger yeah empowers yes it empowers right so no that was really that was really helpful and um yeah oh hang on a second i got the i got the alarm repair guy here hang on just i'm gonna pause so the alarm guy is here so there's a lot there's about to be a really big noise come through but that's okay we can keep going do you have a meeting at three no i don't i don't okay so we gotta let we still have more time okay uh so yeah so that's another thing i've been thinking about enchantment versus magic and i really should try to read i don't know more more barfield but i haven't plunged into that barfield's hard he's he's not the writer lewis's lewis lewis is great writer oh my gosh he's a great writer and and lewis can take really difficult ideas and make them clear barfield doesn't quite have that same gift but barfield and you know barfield you know barfield really has a handle on on this movement from original participation to loss of participation to final participation and in some ways that because every story is a journey you know nt wright in nt wright has like nt wright has his middle brow books he has this kind of every believer books and then he has his technical books and his magnum opus in the technical books actually begins with the treatment of story oh i should read that yeah it's in um uh the old is it the uh it's the people of god book so he's got these the series of five books but um that was that was one of the first when i started reading nt wright and i started tackling that first book of his you know that was one of the things why why is this testament scholar talking about story and and so you know with barfield every good story you know has this journey in it where and there's lots of different ways that people talk about it you know norfolk norford thride talks about you know the u-shaped story um and and what's interesting what's interesting with barfield is that the final participation is in fact and this is true of the of the christian story we begin to we we grow in a capacity that we on one hand have sort of lost but because of the loss we now have it in a way we could not have had it without the loss right and that's because you know part of what christians struggle with is the question of well lord why did you let these bad things happen you know and every christian struggles with that why did you let these bad things happen if you are sovereign if you're in control why did you let these bad things happen and and even in even in asking the question we we we would like to imagine that the answer is something that would satisfy us and is small enough that we could understand it and and i suspect i have suspicions that those two things aren't the case and and part of those suspicions are because of the shape of the book of job because in the beginning there's a simple little story by which we all know why job is suffering even though he's the best man in the world and at the end of the story god could have said well you know i was had the court in and the accuser came in and i had a conversation i said have you considered my servant job and i mean the end of this book of the story could have retold the story in the beginning of the book but it doesn't and god never bothers to explain himself to job even though the story has explained itself to the audience already which leads me to believe that at some point we will grow into an answer that we at this point cannot really comprehend or or adequately embrace that's my suspicion yeah and i think that the definitely the i think there's kind of like micro examples of that like in in life like kind of like learning to trust god you kind of have to like open up a space for him to work in your life where you kind of let go of control and then you you kind of step back and let him do his thing and just kind of trust and go along with it and if that and i've done those small things and then you know, continually, like in enough time that you can see it working. So I suppose you have to have this experience so you know that that pattern will be like, it scales over time, like, or over, you know, lifetime or in different situations, that that same thing will happen in another situation, you know, and that at night it might be satisfactory, but not the way you thought it was supposed to be satisfactory. You've kind of surrendered your, the way it has to happen, you know? Yeah. Well, I think that's right. And it's part of the hubris of sort of the straightforward view that modernity offers us is the implication implication that we see things as they are and we can see all there is. And neither of those things are true. Right. And so built into a lot of our complaints are those two assumptions. And that begins then to set us up to live only within the very narrow parameters of that, which we can see and that which we can comprehend. And that is a much smaller world. Yeah. One we actually enjoy. Yeah. And one time I don't know if it was you or if it was another, you know, pastor I was listening to that that defining that definition of what is good and what is bad and what it has to be is kind of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, right? I mean, it's like, I say, this is what it should be. And if it doesn't fit into that, then it isn't, you know, it isn't good or it is bad, you know, and kind of taking those parameters off kind of opens things up to seeing things different. And it also gets you back to that wonder because you're like, I could be surprised in a good way this way. Yeah. No, that's very true. That's very true. Well, what else do you have on your list? This has been delightful. And I'm really happy with this conversation and I hope that we can share it. So. I don't think I've said anything that is gonna get me into too much trouble. What is, oh, I had this other thought about the, as God, as the solution between the harmony between chaos and order kind of goes back to that wonder thing. So if you think of it visually, like if you're walking through a dark place, that's pretty chaotic, like a room you don't know and is unfamiliar, but the solution would be someone that you trust, that you love, that can see in the dark, that you can hold their hand. Yeah. And that's kind of how I think of it. So it's still kind of an adventure, it still kind of gets you on this journey, your own hero's journey, so to speak. I think that's one of the reasons why Peterson has done so good is he's kind of enticed people to engage with their own hero's journey. Yeah, yes. And, but yeah, anyway, God is like the ultimate mentor if you might, in that hero's journey. Well, and I think, and this is what I think a lot of, why a lot of Christians, I don't know if they would know what they're doing, but why a lot of Christians long for Peterson to, in a more over way, embrace the hero, and of course, Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the hero, is because in this world, many hero's journeys are sad stories. I mean, I love reading history, and there are many tragic stories in history about people who have set off on a heroic journey and lost. And Tolkien, of course, writes these journey stories, because the first story is about Bilbo's journey, and then the Lord of the Rings is about Frodo's journey, and of course, the journey of the whole world too, but there are many, in this world, there are many heroic journeys that just end in crucifixion. But what I think, part of what happens in Christianity with Christ is that even historic journeys that end in what looks like, again, and it's really important to understand that the cross looks like to everyone who's observing it, the complete loss of Jesus, that is in that frame, in that story, crucifixion is the definition of loss of Messiahs. Messiahs are killed by Rome, that's the story. And what Christ then does in his resurrection is give hope for all crucified heroes. And so, we've seen Peterson on his own heroic journey, and it's not over yet, but I think part of why many Christians long for him to embrace the resurrection and the resurrected Christ is because that finally changes even tragic heroic stories. So, some of other, oh, there's the alarm, it's not too bad. I'm trying to close the door. Christ ultimately, I mean, that's in many ways the function of the resurrection, but now if the Christian story ended on that first Easter Sunday, that would be a great story because Jesus would have won. And that's usually where movies sort of end. But in the time between the first Easter Sunday Jesus' resurrection and our resurrections, what he affords is all of this much more story-making. And he invites our story into his that we may follow in his footsteps. And that's basically what the apostle Paul says in Romans 6, we are baptized into his baptism and into his death, and then we are raised with him in resurrection. And so, I think I'd love to see Peterson be able to embrace that story. And therefore in a sense say to the world, you may kill me, but my victory is bound up in the victory of Jesus Christ. That is a powerful thing because what that means is that we can in fact set off on journeys that almost everyone in this world will look at us and say, that journey is bound to fail because many good efforts in this world are bound to fail. But in Christ, we can embrace journeys and heroic efforts that are bound to fail and die in the process, having the world look at it like failure. And in him finally, you know. There's a victory. Have the victory. Right. Did you, you know that word, you catastrophe? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, sorry for the little sermon there. No, no, no, I love it. It's great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What else I wrote here? Oh, I wrote about how I really just you and Peugeot and so many people you have on your channel. I just think it's really great how it feels like there's a unity among denominations, you know, kind of the denominational walls kind of crumble and you just kind of come together. I just, it's a very heartwarming thing. I love, I love watching it. I think it's great. And there's so much about going back to like some of the early like Peugeot does this, like he talks about, I haven't read all those things, like the early church fathers and all those, I'm sure there's a wealth of knowledge in it. I've put some books in my cart, but I haven't ordered them. I haven't read them. I'm a really, really slow reader. It's easy for me to watch YouTube videos. I just rely on you and him to like inform me. But it's interesting how relevant those older ideas are, or they're coming back. And there just seems to be something between the old meeting the new. I feel like there's like a re-enchantment you know, of the world, like between that old idea, like when Barfield talks about these different ages and like consciousness, it feels like the old and the new need to like kind of come together and make a new, a new understanding, like a new consciousness in a sense. But it feels like we're like at that place. I'm gonna hear you guys all talking and stuff like that. Well, I think that's true. And I think it is, I think it is happening. And it's, there is sort of a cyclical aspect to it happening. I mean, it has happened in the past. I think, you know, Lewis and the Inklings, Lewis and Tolkien, that very much was sort of a blossoming of it there. And we've been, you know, we've been sort of energized by that blossoming. Now, hopefully we will be able to do our part and offer something that the next generation can continue on. And, you know, Jesus, that's built into the gospel in the promise that, you know, the gates of hell will not finally prevail against his church. And by church, like you say, one of the really gratifying things of this journey for me has been, I've been deeply enriched by my experience and my conversations with Roman Catholics and with Orthodox Christians, you know, those beyond my own Dutch Reformed tribe. And, you know, finding deeper commonalities between us that perhaps were sort of covered up by the, by a lot of the debris of past bickerings and warfares. So. Yeah, forgot how similar we all are actually. Yeah. We just have different names for the same things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so may that continue. Yes. Well, thank you so much. I'm not gonna mention your name because I don't know if we have, and that way gives you a little bit more anonymity, but. Oh, okay. I just don't want to, I just don't want to raise any difficulties for you because, you know, we all have jobs and relationships and networks and stuff, and not everyone can be as open on the internet as I am. I'm a little bit older and so in some ways I have less to lose, but. But it's always so good to talk to you. I'll just end the recording here and that way I can. I can properly thank you.
