 Hi, this is Paul. I don't know how many of you caught that John Vervecki was on unbelievable with Justin Briarley which I immediately clicked out and when I saw it because John is not I Thought he was in I could totally understand why Justin had him on the show, but John had to really Shrink his argument down to fit it in and I thought this was actually one of the best articulations of John's argument that I've heard It could be that I'm just More and more familiar with it ever taught after talking with John and after working on John stuff for quite a while But for Justin's audience, which is sort of a radio program audience to have John understood in that Context is interesting now his other guest was a bit more Who Justin usually has on the program now? Overall, I Thought that I didn't know how well the two conversations came together I think John presented his his body of work very well and I thought the other individual too. I didn't I've never sewn Rob Hari Amari I had never heard of him before and since then I've read at least the samples of Kindle of his two books. I didn't buy the books yet. I had a bad bad habit of buying books I don't finish and so at least I start with the sample But it was what I thought was interesting about the program was Who these two people are and how they've come to Their own positions. So what I'm gonna do is actually sort of reverse the order between them and We'll first sort of I'll play a little clip of John and what I thought was a really nice succinct Explanation of his project and then actually I gleaned some some quotes from you know I'm Ari's Amari's book So I thought this was one of the one of the best brief summaries of John's work that he's done and just the way it is the more Venues you're in the more you have to sort of distill it down The better and better you get at sort of just putting it right there on the table And I thought it was really tough for Amari to have much perspective on On what John's been building in this little corner of the internet and pretty pretty tough on Justin too again This was a pretty you know, just thinking about it from Justin's chair this was a pretty ambitious show to try to pull off in terms of bringing a broadly general audience into some kind of awareness of Of John's work again, I think Amari's work would have been more familiar For a lot of Justin's audience now you know a lot of unbelievable there, you know, there's a fair amount of People cheering for their home teams and unbelievable and that's not just Christians. It's also skeptics and atheists and Justin has rightly developed a reputation for being a a very fair Host for these kinds of conversations. So But but again as as we sort of get at as as modernity as we continue to sort of get beyond modernity the the setup of of Justin show which really rose in the heyday of sort of the atheist theist debates You know Justin's really trying in some ways I think to pivot the program because the public conversation is really pivoting So once John laid the groundwork, I thought this is the part that you know, potentially could really connect with the audience Okay, so cultures across cultures and across history people have figured out this perennial problem of self-deception And so so the first party talks about self-deception and all of the things that go into self-deception and basically there's Commitorial explosion. It's very difficult for human beings to know the truth, but now Truth we're gonna have to of course contextualize within John's four P's self destructive other destructive self deceptive behavior and What they've done is they've created the college now again I always think of these gain insights I mean part of why I do this thing is because when I listen to things even repeatedly new insights come up There is I think implicit in John's Perhaps I'm thinking about this implicit in John's project a an Optimism about Humanity and I don't say that in a in a detrimental way even as an Augustinian and a Calvinist but This we there is self deception. There is self destruction and that's very much the Augustinian But you know, even in Augustinian anthropology is very balanced on one hand. We are rebels. We are self destructive We are self deceiving but we are also Children of God and Image bearers of God and so in and I think a balanced Augustinian anthropology There there are both of these things at play and and the idea is that we in fact You know, we have to deal with Augustine and Pelagius. We in we in fact have a capacity to to know things and to know the truth the You know, the image of God is not completely obliterated from us to use to use Christian terms Logies of practices because this is a complex dynamical state done is they've created Ecologies of practices because this is a complex dynamical system. You can't just intervene on it But I'll just start believing this or you know, we get do it sometime just that you know If if if that's all it was we wouldn't need to go to therapy In other words, we're not transparent to ourselves life isn't straightforward. We don't all just collectively naively See what's wrong and all collectively naively Do the truth we have this we have humanity as we know it Just stop doing that that doesn't work, right? And so we need very complex Ecologies of practices in order to deal with that self-deceptive behavior and and in many ways World cultures and world religions and traditions of wisdom and ancient wisdom. That's the topic ancient wisdom in the meaning crisis Ancient wisdom was afforded to individuals and populations so that they in fact could Be as we might say just in the most general of terms. We could be better people we could have better civilizations We could have better societies. We could do good to one another and You know holding and so this is where we sort of get into this dead reckoning It's better it's better not to do Jenna from genocide than to do genocide Even though human beings have been doing have been genocidal all the way through human history It's better to love than to hate. It's better to give than to receive I mean, there's a there's all of this wisdom that of course not just in Christianity not just in Judaism But in the Eastern religions, there's all this wisdom And so you have these ecology of practices and communities that that are all there to address self self-deception self-destruction other destruction and Then they need to be situated within you know a valorizing worldview Okay, when he says a valorizing worldview that valor it's mean a worldview that affords Evaluation a worldview that values things such as you know, let's preserve our life rather than take it. Let's Be kind rather than hostile. I mean there is a hierarchy So if you want to listen to it in Peter Sony in terms there's a hierarchy of values and these communities create these hierarchy of values and they Instantiate them in moral codes. They instantiate them and in practices They instantiate them and are they instantiate them and all sorts of things and it takes on flesh within these communities in these communities And participation in these communities afford wisdom and these in fact are what has allowed human beings to Grow populations together establish cities with you know with millions and millions of people to establish civilizations that are productive and and not simply self destructive then they're never perfect but they're there you get a sense of progress and improvement throughout the scope of human history because of these Cultures and religions and wisdom traditions and all of this I mean, he's making a he's made basically what he's doing here is making a very broad case for civilization when you have that when you have an ecology of practices that's designed to Ameliorate that foolishness that self deceptive self destructive behavior and enhance that connectedness that meaning in life Right so to really try and shift so we get a much more of the connectedness and much less of the self deceptive Across in that domain general manner and that is situated within a tradition and a community that Valorizes it with a supportive worldview That's wisdom and here's so there's a definition of wisdom the issue for various reasons Historical mostly that I go in this series our philosophical and cultural history What has happened is we have lost a worldview? That has a proper place and valorizes an ecology of practices for the cultivation of wisdom in the enhancement of meaning so the and and he would argue that Part of what has happened in our system Predominant worldview is the scientific worldview and as a cognitive scientist This is the problem I take as my central task in cognitive science The scientific worldview has an explanation of everything but how science is possible So it's got this wonderful explanation of atoms and solar systems and galaxies and even living things and blah blah blah blah But what about ah what about the act of doing science? How do we make that meaning how do we crew because science is a process we shouldn't confuse science with its claims Science is a massive ecology of practices for overcoming self-deception. That's what the scientific method I think is properly understood now now it's it's sort of nice to compare what John here does with what Krauss does I've had Krauss in the last few videos because Krauss John's critique on One hand he would say with Krauss science is this amazing process by which we can in fact And I'm gonna add some words here that we can in fact Get become more aware of certain propositional truths out there in the universe Okay, prop science is very propositional But as John just said what science can't do is account for itself It's it's unable to do that and that's where Krauss would probably That that's where Krauss doesn't really have an answer How is it? How how is it that we are able to do this? to speak of it pictorially we have this scientific worldview in which we as Meaning-makers and as the generators of science do not have any proper place or home And so what you're seeing and what you've been seeing over time. I think it sort of starts in around the 11th century What you're seeing over time is people increasingly Feeling you know disconnected from each other from the world From themselves even and so you get a whole bunch of symptoms We've got the rise in Suicide even suicide independent of clinical depression right now, which is a very that's a very telling sign Loneliness epidemic it's just right we have the mental health crisis which most people are now acknowledging depression anxiety disorders we have we have That the the the addiction crises the opioid crises we we have the virtual exodus people now Explicitly declaring that they prefer to live in the virtual world rather than in real world And I think that that tells you what and those who are just doing it without the explicit declaration They're finding something in that world. That's missing from the real world But you also have what I would with Christopher massive Petra And I call there are positive responses you have the mindfulness revolution you have The revival and growth of you know, how this thick wisdom philosophies like stoicism The the you know what motivated my original series the attempts by the West and it's not going Great to try and import Buddhism into Western Society so There's a bunch of other things you like I'm talking too long But but but there's a whole I try to give you the explanation of the symptomology And I think actually that was a that was a terrific way to go now I think if this conversation this conversation could have gone better if Amari had You know 50 hours of prep so that he could have understood John and he didn't have that and I Imagine John didn't have time to read both of Amari's books. I think they could have had an interesting conversation, especially around Aristotle But on a on a show like this it's it's difficult to get there again part of part of I think the challenge that we're facing is I Don't think people appreciated all of what went in even to these atheist Theist debates that were going on There was so much that both sides could sort of assume even though there was sort of a often a talking past each other with a conversation like this There they're quite apart from each other and so to actually Be able to have them come together and talk to one another is a pretty big challenge Okay. Well, let's let's switch here and take a look at Take a look at Amari's work now as he mentioned here He had done his first book is in fact sort of a spiritual memoir from fire by water My journey to the Catholic faith and he spoke about us about that just a little bit in there And then I want to pull off some I want to pull out some loans As you said, I was born and raised in Tehran Iran and moved to the US when I was 13 about to turn 14 But already before I left Iran I had declared myself an atheist because I just associate with God with the God of the ayatollahs and their you know judicial floggings and amputations and so forth that now this is key because in some ways John verveky's personal story is similar to many of the kinds of people that we're talking about in this Talking within this little corner of the internet raised in a Christian home Rejected the faith by virtue of a whole variety of things and in his own words it was not a It was not a healthy or productive little Segment of Christianity that he was raised in and of course myself being a pastor I I know this I find people who were raised in very dysfunctional Christian homes And it's not at all unreasonable that they would not only when they leave the home They would leave the faith and and John isn't making those kind of claims about his home, but This is this is the kind of thing now here We have an individual who was raised in Iran and I've actually over the last few years Had the opportunity to know a few individuals who sort of fit into this and some of them have been on my channel You know Persia if you if you follow Tom Holland all I mean Persia is one of these more one of this one of these truly Remarkable world civilizations that in fact has a civil civil Civilizational thread and legacy that goes all the way back to antiquity now of course Islam came through and it's a very complex Story, but it's a it's what it's one of the truly great world civilizations is Persia and of course what happened since the Since the revolution the Islamic Revolution of course what happened before that was was modernity and the Shah and during the during the Cold War the United States wanting to very much have Iran be a buffer against The growth of communism well Iran didn't go communist It went a whole new way And this is and I think even even that part of the story is a big part of this whole story because Part of what the rise you know at the end of the First World War you can there's this book that I mentioned every now and then about the basically the The storytelling of the religious aspect of the First World War At the end of the First World War many people believed Islam was going to simply Cave in and die, but it didn't a new force in Islam really took hold and that's been There's variety of ways to try and name it but of course Iran has been one element of resurgent Islam the other of course in Saudi Arabia, so you've got the Shia and the Sunni versions of it But so this individual is is raised in Iran, and he you know I just I would just only I only I didn't buy the whole book I just read the sample on Kindle And so you know there are elements to his story in terms of why? In Iran he would you know have the particular story he does And then came to the United States more or less took a path that Isn't that exotic and I wrote a spiritual memoir before the current book about my decision to become a Roman Catholic and It's it's not It's not too exotic for a 16 year old to read thus folks are through strut and read Nietzsche and a little exotic I know some who have done it, but it's it's a little exotic think that he's the first one after Nietzsche to hit upon the idea that there may be no God and therefore human beings don't have creatureliness and therefore Human nature or nature as such has no norm and therefore you can remake the world as you please Whether in a kind of Nile in a kind of nihilistic direction or as I in my case You know briefly becoming kind of Marxist Radical and then through a long process of Reading I came to believe first of all in a God and then in a personal God and ultimately in the God of the Bible as I encountered him in the Catholic Church The hardest was to just to come to believe in a personal God and Now these are all really telling again I haven't read as men more but these are really telling little stopping points and and in some ways it seems And there's quite a bit of mention of CS Lewis in some ways It seems he sort of followed along the breadcrumbs of someone like Lewis a little bit different Of course Lewis stayed in Anglican I'm Amari went to Roman Catholicism But there are I mean you could sense something of a meaning crisis in there But it's obviously on a bigger canvas because of his coming out of coming out of Iran My particular path. I don't I don't think we talked about this in our previous conversation station Justin, but my path to coming to believe that there is a God is Is the one that CS Lewis Recommends as it were in his near Christianity, although I hadn't encountered it at the time and in some ways a manual conch as well and that's the Proof by way of the conscience that is that there seems to be some interior voice that we all have that urges us to Eschew evil and to do good and that into your voice Tends to mirror what seems to be kind of an objective order among all peoples and there are differences at the margins but all people's you know revile theft and and murder and rape and And so there's there seems to be some objective moral order in the world and that in its and its dictates Mirror or reflect You know the conscience as we experience it the moral conscience and to me ultimately that came to be you know proof for the existence of a God because If there is a moral order than it hasn't as an author and there seems to be This order around me both a moral order and a natural order that couldn't be accounted for otherwise and I would grant you know the kind of You know Richard Dawkins of the world and others that you know that voice that I hear and call the conscience is a product of thousands of years of you know evolutionary development in our species or that it's you know millions of synapses firing in the brain I would grant all of those as answers to empirical how questions, but I Couldn't grant them that they answer Why questions which are questions of metaphysics and of course with with Krauss I played that that section on how and why it's a philosophy and also of theology proper of revelation And that the two needn't be in tension with each other and you can grant that the Empirical science answers the how questions, but it fails because it's not designed to answer ultimate questions So My initial read on him is he's in some ways inhabiting sort of the the modernist frame in this And I want to be very clear that I'm not I'm not saying that's a bad frame to be in It's like all the all frames we have it's got its strengths. It's got its weaknesses But when I listen to him and when I read some of at least some of the quotes that he had in here I mean it seems to illuminate the story. This is from his spiritual memoir I thought I was American before I ever set foot in the United States when I first arrived at my adopted homeland Just before I turned 14. I spoke English fluently with an American accent that I picked up from the movies It's precisely these issues that Various Islamist revolutions took place. I mean these were some of the issues behind The attacks of 9-eleven the Iranian Revolution are because of the pervasive influence of modernity and the pervasive influence of the West all around the world that they basically saw that modern modern European colonial secular culture with its cultural power houses and and evangelistic tools like movies were pretty much Conquering the hearts and minds of their people and so in many ways the way they chose to fight it was to put up high walls and to just take it head-on and That's very much what you have with Islamic fundamentalism and fundamentalism is the correct word when I talked about Christian fundamentalism before fundamentalism is often a complete denial and a pushback of modernity and These kinds of fundamentalism as with Christian fundamentalism, it's simply a frontal denial of certain aspects of modernity and say we are not accepting these propositions we're going to maintain our propositions and As I said before Pentecostalism is a little bit different because Pentecostalism is a denial of modernity in in other frames so If I suffered an exile sense of loss, I don't remember it for while stilling stilling still living in the ayatollahs Iran I'd given myself over to the American idea the journey across the Atlantic ratified what I already concluded in my heart in the Western imagination moreover the individual matters as an Individual again by contrast the emblem of the Iran of the Iranian sensibility Was the young boy who during the war with Iraq had strapped himself with grenades and dashed under the incoming enemy tank To earn his spot on giant murals around Tehran and have his story recounted on state television The model boy had consummated his devotion to nation and regime in one irrevocable act of self-negation Can you blame me for preferring Luke Skywalker to Indiana Jones? now one of the things that often Americans don't think about is American worldview tends to be very Myopic and self-centered so in the American consciousness there was the Iranian revolution and we wouldn't have paid any attention to that if it hadn't been for the hostages and Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and that whole story and then America just sort of took Iran off the map. They were bad guys. They burned presidents in effigy. They burned American flags and What Americans paid no attention to which was a significant thing for? for for the Islamic Republic was the war with Iraq because and Americans especially later paid no attention to that because Saddam was in a sense our guy in fighting Iran and that that Iran Iraq war was a huge war with tremendous loss of life and Americans for the most part Didn't really pay much attention to it and we were sort of you know American government was sort of cheering on Saddam didn't really want Saddam to win But didn't want Saddam to lose either and so that of course sets up then the the Iraq Iran war ended and of course Saddam invades Kuwait and then that sets up sort of the whole other thing and Iran has just been out there that sort of comes up in blips and you know We're gonna have a war there and now you know straits of Hormuz and all these kind of things very Spotty in the American consciousness, but of course if you're Iranian The American government and American policy and all of these things are of course regular parts of your life Well, you can see though in here already is that in many ways the evangelism properties of American secular modernity was already doing what it's done not only in the United States not only in Europe but but all throughout the Middle East and Deeply impacted him as a as a child and you can read he goes into where his family was with respect to the Revolution and he writes about that you can even you know, you can pick up a lot of that just from the sample That's on Amazon Jump forward a little bit later. Well, the Iranian way was irrational and again You can you can see he had already been formed in sort of the Western Secularity which of course would lead to his atheism at some point But then he becomes a Catholic I became Catholic after concluding that Catholicism is true Now that's really interesting. He didn't say because Catholicism worked now. We would say that too, but because it's true That's a very modernist perspective. It's sort of the way that a modernist chooses their religion and their worldview They sort of put them all out there and they decide which one is true. It's very much what CS Lewis did and again I'm not complaining about this. But what I am saying is that a majority of Americans don't choose their religion this way After the fact they might decide that it's true. It might be a post hoc rationalization or justification But I would argue that most people move into a religion Find that it works and then justify it by being true. That's much more the elephant and the rider. I Became Catholic after concluding that Catholicism is true my accidental circumstances Muslim-born Iranian American These aren't accidents because I mean this again These are rather essential to the story. I would argue How would I permit my conversion to be reduced to politics and identity and I'm not reducing them to politics and identity When in fact it had been sparked by the opposite idea that is there that there is such a thing as truth, okay again This is a very modernistic approach to the world That truth is eternal and universal and isn't circumscribed by politics history genetics language Geography identity it's almost a definition of a monarchical vision It's you know truth in its essence. That's again. This is a very modernistic approach to Going about being a human being Meanwhile a few of my more secular friends wondered out loud if I wouldn't have been better off with one of the mainline Protestant denominations Of course because in some ways The mainline denominations for a long time have been secularists at prayer. Okay Now I I don't want to offend any of my any of my mainline viewers. I'm not being disparaging but in terms of how I'd say blue church secular Americans Look at Christianity. Yeah, the mainliners are the good people We don't really understand why they go to church We cheer them on and we love it when evangelicals go and become mainline because then they start voting for the correct party and they start holding the correct views on all sorts of social issues and they stop fighting about Evolution and abortion and these kinds of things but that doesn't mean we're going to your church Because why would I spend a perfectly good Sunday morning? Going to church when I could sleep in have coffee with friends go do yoga or whatever I mean, that's the perspective How could I reconcile my self-proclaimed classical liberalism with Rome's hard teachings on divorce homosexuality the ordination of women and the like The question lurked behind these questions I suspect was this had I found in the Catholic faith a way to express the reactionary longing of my Persian soul Albeit in a Latin key. That's a great line. I am and I think he's exactly right. That's probably what they were afraiding Oh instead of you becoming an Islamist terrorists terrorists. You're going to become Just a new fundamentalist but a really Latin fundamentalist you're not going to be one of those guys who buys a pickup truck and puts an American flag on and votes for Donald Trump and won't get a vaccine and you know all these all these Caricatures that they watch in the news. You're going to be one of those you're gonna be like the like the Supreme Court justices the conservative Catholics that get on the Supreme Court So but again, I'm not trying to set up straw man's here. I'm just saying these are the stock These are the stock players usually in the American media zeitgeist and That being said he approaches his faith in a very modernist frame It's true therefore Again, it's deductive. This is true. Therefore this will go. I am NOT casting Aspersions on that culture or that approach to rationality I think it's perfectly valid and legitimate and many of you live that way. I'm just saying many many many many people Don't think or live or work that way. It's far more intuitive They find what works and then they sort of justify it the elephant cuts the path the rider Creates the talk Now both of these individuals are dealing with sort of dead reckoning navigation in some ways I think that's what we all do. We're all looking for truth and whether you grew up in Iran and You know by virtue of your growing up and the treatment of your family and all of those things Did not develop a taste for the ayatollah's way to a great new world but in fact Found yourself much more attracted to the kinds of culture the individualist modern culture that you found that you find in America which of course led him into atheism first and then later led him into Catholicism John Verbeke, of course is a very different story that's behind it You have truth proposition You have truth propositionally, but then the other three P's of verveke's P's come into play Procedurally participate participation and I say I can never remember all four I even wrote them down today Skepticism about our own capacity to inhabit truthful models available will make meaning its own access and a compass And this is where I say most people are not going to sort of approach these problems deductively Let's establish capital t truth and then work our way down from there Most people are going to do it inductively and I think in that way meaning they do what's meaningful and Not what's expedient and jordan peterson's one of his 12 rules for life life They are going to appropriate. They are going to approach it in terms of Meaning as a compass meaning as a gyroscope and again, this is part of the reason I think peterson lit a fuse under the culture because suddenly Well peterson will tell you're looking for the truth, but you're going to use meaning as a compass for finding the truth now Again, if you look at kraus meaning is sort of a fiction that's found inside your head and you project it out onto a world of Objects and verveky is not going to go there. He's going to say that meaning is sort of Transjective it's it's something that we generate between us and the world between us and each other in Community with our experiences and and this is this is sort of how we go about this now It's interesting if you go back to jordan peterson's question to answer when he gets this question Do you do you need god for a meaning in life? That's a fairly modernistic framing of the question Peterson of course will you know, what do we mean by god? Yada? Yada? Yada? I made a little video about this one of the things that he talked about in there is proximal meanings You can gain meaning by being a soccer player and kicking the ball in the goal and having the cheerleaders go up, etc, etc You can have meaning in your hobbies. And in fact Um Amari Mentioned that his grandfather after the revolution decided he was just going to shut down his world Be involved in his little hobbies do translations of the books because he knew i'm not going to be around forever Not going to bother fighting this wave in iran. I'm just going to Settle down lead a quiet life devote myself to my hobbies of a meaningful life doing this but All of these proximal meanings are good they're necessary They're part of life. They fill up our lives in a lot of ways. This is also sort of krauss's approach Because he'll say even though he'd say no you're projecting your meaning onto these proximal meanings They're good enough. You can sort of fill up your life good enough. You can have an enjoyable life You can have a fulfilling life fulfillment. I think is far more a function of meaning than truth You can have a fulfilling life and and everything will be fine now there's a big symptomatic Undertone to john's work and I don't mean that to submit to to dismiss it because he very much Frames this in terms of truth john's overall project as a scientist and now trying in some ways to To not be limited by modernistic science by recognizing not just propositional truth, but trying to integrate more fully perspectives of truth, which are of course part of his ecology of practices for wisdom For you know cultivation of truth because when he's talking about self-deception and self-destruction. Those are very much anti-truth But the symptomology of the meaning crisis the emphasis is really very much on the therapeutic and that's where he sort of ends What he puts in In that little clip that I showed you Questions that you're going to have is how proximal is much of this truth and underlying a great deal of modernity since car day car and others Is of course a deep skepticism about the degree to which we can know truth and this sort of launches the The the little continual feud in this little corner of the internet about is Is the universe fundamentally personal? Or is it fundamentally objective? Let's say but I don't want to trigger that right now Now jordan peterson when he talks to john vervecki very much keeps wandering over into culture war things and john keeps saying I know the culture war is out there. It's not the emphasis my emphasis is an ecology of practices so that individuals can discover Self-transcendence can can do all these things in in many ways john vervecki's goal is very similar to jordan's goal is that Even though john isn't using these words by the ecology practices john does want to help people to Clean their room and order their life and limit the self Deception and limit the self-destruction and try and keep going that going with that peterson of course and john doesn't disagree with this Then kraus doesn't disagree with this nearly almost nobody disagrees with the fact that when people stop Having or stop inhabiting a robust religious space they become increasingly susceptible to Ideologies that become their functional religions and they're often not very good religions And john in his question and answer on my channel I thought did a wonderful job of articulating his position with respect to that he did some of that articulation with jordan in their conversation and He would agree that part of this is is part of his project because he obviously wants to give people a better platform than just becoming an advocate or a A person who is just promoting their particular political agenda Because you can find all kinds of meaning in that but we should pause and say why is that political activism so meaningful? And I think it's meaningful because of scale And and this again, I think is one of the huge challenges and john and I have talked about this and he's mentioned it before one of the huge challenges that his product that his project has because Scale is an enormously different difficult thing to deal with because you know even for For john coming on unbelievable. He has to try to bring his argument down into a tiny little package and deploy it well Traditional religions have many many many many many many ways of deploying their package at least deploying many little camel's noses Hopefully to get the rest of the camel into the tent and we can see that in Amari's story because he seems to and I hope i'm not getting him wrong Which is my initial impression he seems to for the most part be inhabiting a a fairly modernist frame now we talked about Derry da and fucault and in fact, there's a quote that he had with respect to those that he looked at, you know after It makes perfect sense you know, he sort of Goes into his atheism via marx and dary don fucault and eventually I think probably sees the shallowness of that again. I haven't read his memoir and then finds a much richer ecosystem in roman catholicism, but again the sort of the order of operations Let's use that mathematical language the order of operations that he works through Is very much a modernist order of operations and again, i'm not saying it's a bad order of operations I think it's a perfectly legitimate order order of operations, but that's where it sort of sets right now in the worldview landscape Of course Rod hair had I think i'll have to pin it one of the best comments on The video that I released today if there's no room for why neither is there for why not and that's exactly the Moral problem that kraus is going to have because all of these moral issues are generally Navigatable through the why issues and also the salience The salience landscape and your salience hierarchy are very much going to be determined by your why issues That that's really going to set the set the values of Of your community that you know, why do roman catholics fight so hard about abortion? Well, there's some big why issues in there Every community why did the ayatollah come so down hard on America because america is the great satan because america is the satan that is that is luring in iran's young people Into their way of life via media three of movies via Baywatch was often an example cited the old as long the osama bin laden days, you know on and on and on And You are really missing the big meaning rocket engines of a fully functional world view If your whys don't scale all the way up Why are we here? The love god and joy forever first question answer of the shorter westminster confession Iran used those big rockets because they had islam which was a fully formed world view a fully formed ancient religion They could deploy it and it could go to scale very quickly now, obviously not perfectly obviously never catches everyone You have a defector in amari who eventually goes to another one of the big historic ancient wisdom traditions And of course jan verveke wants sort of a mixed martial arts of wisdom traditions. But again, it's it's a very challenging project How long can you keep working from a facsimile of christian morality and this is where some of the big questions of the modern western project of Post-modernity really get engaged and so when you look again at the work of say tom holland and douglas murray These are the questions they have both of whom tom holland again increasingly inhabiting a little bit more of the christian ecclesiastical space Douglas murray still standing a little bit outside but both of them seeing the dynamics of it here and saying How long when the culture sheds christianity as the global? Forum will the moral and that the assumed moral imagination erode And that's obviously a very big question Can't we just keep the old systems going Probably and I would argue that all along the way the orthodox and the roman catholics and magisterial prodding protestants always continue to Keep their systems running if you look at let's say the american air force You've got b52s out there that are older than their pilots. Well, why because those b52s? They keep retrofitting they keep tinkering they keep adding new electronics They keep redesigning so I think he's a great example of these old systems that are still going very well But a lot of it depends on who we is and again what was nice about this conversation with these two stories Understanding their trajectory at least to this point was not difficult to was not difficult to see Philosophy keeps moving beneath the surface and we saw that with brett sockel's transubstantiation book Individuals can live meaningful lives in many systems and this is a point that john vervecki keeps bringing up that when they do for example psychological studies on religious traditions Many many religious traditions continue to effectively provide meaning and essentially Well-being and community and a lot of this wisdom making for the individuals now this is where You know, we've got say jonathan peugeot and me and john vervecki I mean peugeot and I are both sort of on the christian side if we're going to drive divide the line that way But i'm sort of on the vervecki side when it when it comes to I think the taking away of I think the taking away of What's happening in our culture means that it's very difficult for some people like john vervecki like tom holland like douglas murray To inhabit some of the old systems now many of you have gone into inhabit some of those old systems and again I congratulate you. I cheer you on I encourage you I support you but I also think even if you say Rb 52 is as pristine as it was when it rolled off the assembly line in 1956 And I say I don't think it's just that I think your tradition has been updating and econ and accommodating and figuring out a way to keep that old aircraft in the sky And to keep it effective and to keep it from falling into obsolescence now again via the lindy effect Old world views can do this islam rebounded Amazingly in the 20th century It's a pretty remarkable thing transformation that happened within islam. Is it a positive one from my point of view? No, but it's still pretty amazing Because these old systems, I mean the systems have to be multi-personal if you have big picture ranges They will tend to afford that much more of the totalizing scaling world view possibilities For the individual And I have a I gotta get off I gotta get off this because I have a zoom call right now But we want systems that scale they need to scale across iq They need to scale across cultures They need to scale from individual to small group community to bigger community to City nation state country world forever. They need to scale that large and I think for the welfare of the world a pluralistic world They need to be at least as devoted to the welfare of the out group as the in group and again, you know No mystery here. I think christianity does all this But I think these are the requirements for Addressing the meaning crisis and what we need and again, I think the ancient modern is really critical because of as Um the seem to leave notes the lindy effect So, all right, i've got to end this video and get on a zoom call for so thanks for watching and leave a comment
