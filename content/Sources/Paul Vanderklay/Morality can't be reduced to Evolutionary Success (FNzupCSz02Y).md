 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to do a little bit of commentary on this conversation between Adam and Glenn Schribner. Now Glenn is a pastor, evangelist, does YouTubes out of the UK and many of you know Adam. He runs the Think Club channel and Adam and I have had a conversation in the past. Adam is a very interesting guy because he's really a sociology nerd and he's an atheist so he spends a lot of time poking at the anti-theist, which I think is it's just kind of fun to watch them go at it, partly because Adam himself is an atheist and I'm sure a bunch of the anti-theists want to take away Adam's atheist card but that is who he says he is. And so I thought this and but Adam as an atheist is a very interesting one because unlike many of the anti-theists, he has a high regard for religion and he sees its practicality, he sees its benefits, he himself just doesn't believe it. He's a materialist and he yeah, that's where he's at. So I thought this conversation was a very interesting one and they touched on a couple of things that I wanted to get at. Part of it was this grounding of morality, which is an interesting metaphor. It comes out of kind of an evidentialist, foundationalist theory in terms of knowledge that we have should be even the metaphor of this should be grounded, built up and and that's what keeps it from being relativistic. Now Adam believes that morality is grounded and this is where he's obviously found a lot of inspiration and support in the work of Jordan Peterson because Peterson's work is morality from the ground up and 3.5 billion years of evolution watching ourselves, watching each other. We built this a priori platform within us and from that platform we have figured out morality but in ways that we can't necessarily articulate and so that then gets expressed by poets and by artists and by great works of literature and so this this morality problem isn't something that we ourselves master because it's not something that we ourselves as individuals have constructed, but it's something that we sense and feel imperfectly and and so we represent it in different ways and different stories and different laws so on and so forth and and Adam with all of his background in sociology now seeing Jordan Peterson articulate this so well very much sees this then as the source of morality this in terms of my Abolition of Man videos that I've been doing on CS Lewis. That's the Dow and and it's not something that we can articulate it's something in a sense we bear witness to, we express, we sort of know it and it's it's in this way that that Adam finds many of the celebrity atheists or as he calls them career atheists to be to be cop-outs in that they like the rest of us have a sense of the Dow they have a sense of this this moral realism but they you know they simplify it they codify it in simplistic ways and and so I think Adam's perspective and Adam certainly will Adam's Adam has the ability to comment on on whole ranges of videos You'll find Adam's comments think club all over the all over the internet with these kinds of discussions and so he'll probably weigh in here, especially since I'm talking about him directly but So that's so that's kind of the formulation and Peterson is out there and whereas Peterson I would categorize as an open agnostic and actually I'm going to do a second video on another video by Noah Plumb That Adam also did a response video to but I thought there were some important things in that I'll do that video today or tomorrow, but you know Adam's perspective Peterson is more of an open agnostic Atheist you know that gets into the whole thing of what does Peterson really believe and then the question does it matter in terms of this conversation? So but but Adam is he's an atheist That's that's where he's at and so I thought this this conversation with Glenn and hopefully I'll do a conversation with Glenn probably in a week or two Will you know I thought this conversation was quite easy quite interesting But but here they're getting into this business of the grounding of morality and and as I play this I want you to pay attention to the language. I want you as as they speak I want you to to think about what the word rational means in this context and what evolution means in this context So let's let's listen in on a little bit of this conversation the the The grounding of the morality is an interesting question because that you did I mean you brilliantly explain this in the video where you do the trousers thing and and haven't met I'm not sure it ever really even answers Like where his morality comes from I don't think he's familiar with moral foundation theory I don't think he knows that his morality is basically I mean if you if you observe him you can see that his morality is mostly a liberal progressive Morality based on care harm Which is what now when Adam says care harm he's noting that Jonathan height in his work has these five six ish Moral taste buds care harm are the two that progressives tend to focus on Conservatives tend to fill out the plate a little bit better and round it a little bit better But but progressives tend to to really focus in on care harm almost exclusively from the others But Jonathan height lays out in the righteous mind He doesn't know this and if you if you said to him, you know You're moral your moral intuitions or what's driving the ship he would he would probably bristle at the idea of that most antitheist do but the the I Mean height lays this out in the righteous mind that the grounding the grounding in a deity is a good way to ground moral ethics just because it has the force of You know people are gonna are going to stay in line now when you hear all of these value judgments in here It's a good way to ground moral ethic. Now. Now, what do we mean by good in that phrase? It's it's a Practical way. It's an effective way now now you might wonder. Well, why are you picking at all these words? Well Well, I'm a pastor and pastors at least part of our jobs are exegetes and You know if you go to my blog leading church comm Which is basically a link dump So you'll find all kinds of links there that you disagree with and there's all kinds of links that I disagree with when I find The link that's interesting. I dump it on my blog But you know, I say I'm a word gardener of the age to come now What does that mean? It means I pay a lot of attention to words and so when Jonathan height and and Adam here says well this you know Basing it in God is a good way. What's an effective way? It's a practical way it but what I want us to see throughout this video is that all of this language and This is a point I've made on many of my previous videos all of these all of this language implies a telos and And so if you want to evaluate you want to really discern and understand what a given system is really driving at The certain it's telos discern its end discern what it says the purposes what it says the reason is Where it says it needs to go and and as we're gonna see evolution seeks Survival. Okay. What survival of what you get into Brett Weinstein and you know this this enzyme seems the Perpetuation of its code at the expense of every other rival code. So let's let's keep listening You know, it's you're more likely to stop cheaters which is the the evolutionary problem in in putting people into these groups is You know bringing cheaters and slackers in the line The idea of a God is a very good way to bring cheaters and slackers into line But it's a very a very mechanistic way to do it Mm-hmm So I guess I mean I guess one question would be within the Darwinian frame Yes, you can say that perhaps Christianity is has proved itself to be adaptive to the West But then you would also have to say that Hinduism has proved itself to be equally adaptive to The Indian subcontinent, right? Right and then What do you do at that stage, you know, so, you know with the British Raj There they are in India. There is the practice of sooty, which is the burning of widows and it's Surely within the Darwinian frame you have to say that the burning of widows on the funeral pyre with their husbands Has proved itself to be adaptive to that, you know that culture We in the West tend to think differently What is it that makes us say that does not make us say well each to their own What what is it that sort of you know, there's that famous case of the I mean you could make the argument rationally You very much could because you could make the argument rationally. Okay. Now now what does Adam mean right there by? rationally because this is this is all of these worldviews have their languages and the words function within those worldviews and they They function differently within one worldview as within another worldview Now when you when you say you could make it rationally I think what Adam means here is that you could make the argument that burning a widow on her husband's funeral pyre works within that context towards the end of bolstering and strengthening that culture Specifically against its rival cultures. That is what it but that is one way of understanding what it means Rationally and and in that sense rationally is a conditional good. It's a good that's framed within a context. It's a good that's nested within a world now what you're also going to hear especially among a number of the career atheists that rationally becomes a View towards good in itself now if you've been following my videos on CS Lewis's book miracles Lewis uses the word that way sometimes and the career atheists use that word Sometimes and in that sense when you use that word When you use rational in that sense, it's within the nested worldview of let's say rationalism now I don't mean rationalism necessarily as a rival to Christianity because obviously CS Lewis was both sort of a rationalist and a Christian but for for Lewis reason was Witness to the presence of what naturalists would call the supernatural Lewis would say well That's that's part of that's part of God shining on this world but but again now pay attention to that word how it's used in this conversation because you could make a case if you're looking at it from a a Group unifying Perspective the the idea that burning a widow on the funeral pyre would foam it I mean the idea that that would foam at conflict within the group is Seems Seems like a pretty good case to be made your now What's interesting though is that I'm getting of course all of these practices just as Burning a widow on the pyre of her of her husbands of her dead husbands under dead husbands funeral pyre and And the British stopped this obviously and now on the left you know as well this is just another example of of colonial of a colonial impressive, you know of Moralistic colonialism where you're just you're just forcing the morals of your of your group on that which is why of course Glenn brings this up because it's just a great example of well, it's a You're in a bind because if you say well that that's part of this this colonialism That's oppressing the Indian people with the with the culture and religion of the West But most people in the West would also believe in women's equality and then Glenn basically has you in the trap and saying well How how do you? How do you justify women's equality upon what basis what is this is really good to the grounding? How can you ground that now now Adam is is making the the argument here about? That what morality does is bind people together in teams and religion does well as bind people together in teams And of course he gets this from Jonathan Haidt who makes this point very very well But then the question is okay Is there such a thing as a morality that stands outside of and can in fact? critique and push against that which is Towards survival and we're gonna get a lot deeper into that question as we get through this video You're also limiting your resources by thousands of years up to that point Well, I I I think there are moralities that are adaptive that there are better Moralities, I think see and again when better morality towards what end towards a Darwinian end Moralities are constantly competing and they're competing in whether or not the group survives The group that adopts any kind of moral framework either has a survival advantage against other groups or doesn't so And right there I think is is really the the definition of morality that that Adam is working with and I think that's a definition of morality that is implicit in A lot of what Peterson is doing The question is going to be here in the West is That really our definition of morality is that really the definition of morality we want and I'm going to ask the question does that definition is that definition of morality? Really fully functional get the back to the grounded all the way down Now let's look at definitions and I talked about this a little bit okay rational It's often used as that which relates to non religious reality and you'll hear Sam Harris and a lot of the career atheists use Rational in that way to be rational is to and that again They have a correspondence view of truth and so to be rational is to act in a way that Corresponds to this correspondence view of truth and again I'll say CS Lewis is not really is not opposed to that way of thinking and it's it's that reason that Lewis is such a fun Conversation partner in this because he's he very much comes out of the modernist world That that Sam Harris continues to express even in this post context where post modernity Works quite strongly so so often rational is used is that which relates to non religious reality And so when you listen to the career atheists listen listen for that use of the word You'll hear Sam Harris use it in that way a lot as will Matt de la hunty and I haven't listened to a lot of other Career atheists or celebrity atheists it's synonymous basically with their idea of truth and so often when they use the word Rational you could just swap that word out and put the word truth in Burning widows is rational if it pursues a particular end now This is a second definition and this is in a sense what the definition that Adam was using if it pursues a particular end if it gives its tribe a Survival advantage over its rivals, okay such a useful adaptation for a culture to achieve some competitive value over a rival culture Now I didn't they didn't actually use the word revolution Evolution in the little clip I played but if you listen to the whole video, it's a pretty long video I should say it's a long video. I mean I give you longer videos for me, but it's That the word evolution will come up and in this context evolution has also some Definitions it often implies that this is a particular this particular adaptation affords a competitive advantage Within an environment and against a particular rival. That's what we understand by Darwinian evolution that that certain adaptations allow certain groups or certain organisms or certain species or subspecies or even getting back to Brett Weinstein's conversation on the rebel wisdom channel that that even a particular string of DNA Wants the death of rival strings of DNA even in Brett Weinstein's now pay attention to the use of the use of the comparatives here, even if a rival string of DNA Functions better in terms of respiration than the other now morality now Right. What is morality morality is a communal art. This is this is this is how prep how Being should act how community should act. It's a communal art morality if acted out consistently affords that community advantage over rivals such as such as communities that practice female equality out compete again against others that don't and Jordan Peterson makes this comment often that those Societies which because of their moral assumptions about male and female roles those societies effectively take women out of the workplace the Academy many other realms and those societies are impoverished for removing women from those roles and so Jordan Peterson would argue that male female equality and Peterson would stipulate that in terms of Equality as equality of Access not equality of outcome which he defines as equity that helps certain Civilizations certain societies that practice this out compete other societies that don't Now and a little bit later They have a very interesting part of the conversation where they they play this out with respect to Nazis of course because Nazis are just the greatest and the worst illustration that you can almost always bring into an argument the the Cost-benefit thing is what nature is doing the the Nazi argument that you're making And this now again pay attention to what nature means here because you have nature Evolution this is and when we use nature here. We want to use it as a in a sense blind system of Selection now Jordan Peterson might call this God number one in some ways and CS Lewis will see nature as our sister, but pay attention now to to this argument I'll back it up a little bit. This is the the Cost-benefit thing is what nature is doing the the Nazi argument that you're making And this is Jordan Peterson all the way when Jordan Peterson talks about Darwinian truth he's talking about The the Darwinian framework is constantly adjudicating the truth value of moral statements because the people that make those truth those truth claims survive or or Annihilated from history based on the validity of those truth claims So so this is where you get into Jordan Peterson's pragmatic or Darwinistic understanding of truth now this for Peterson and we've talked about this before this really comes out of the it's it's most clearly stated in Jordan Peterson's trans liminal 2015 videos where we because of Because of how we are and how little we can know and how little we can represent and how little out how poorly we can track with truth and this gets into some of the Don Hoffman stuff to How poor we are that that which survives? Well that that's kind of the definitive proof of Truth because you can't I often say ontology is its own justification You can't argue that well this particular Biological mechanism is Functional because that animal lives and reproduces you might look at the koala and say Boy, there's a lot of issues with that koala But you know what it's still here and you might look at the the Norwegian rat and say well You know there's issues with the Norwegian rat, but there are spectacularly There are spectacularly capable Species and you can't argue with that truth and so this is where you get into Jordan Peterson's Darwinian truth now what from where I sit the Nazis lost the war and they have been their truth claims have been proven incorrect so Materialistically we can very much say that the where that moral framework leads is No more Nazis So so I don't have any problem saying that they're incorrect that they're wrong that they lost yes who lost the war buddy But only because they lost so if they had one yes And you but you want to you want to play this you want to play this game too? Which is which is what if they won the war well? What if horses evolved wings and could fly around like Pegasus is like there's so there is There is the real world that sooner or later we have to contend with so I I would make the argument that they couldn't possibly win the war Because their moral framework was untrue was incorrect nature adjudicated that it did I Would argue that if another Nazi regime came to rise it would play out exactly the same way because the the Darwinian framework is always out there adjudicating truth and the way that it adjudicates truth is Think of it about it if the not if the Nazis did rise up again. What would happen? The world would the world would beat them down. I'm pretty I'm pretty certain of it And we've made war illegal War is illegal now Yeah, now this is a really fascinating. This is a really fascinating clip So now I realize I'm doing a clip of the clipster there, but it's It's a really fascinating argument in terms of the Nazi regime of the Nazis that well, this is Darwinian truth that they lost the war and having read I read Timothy Snyder's bloodlands a few years ago, and it's a fascinating book in the in showing some of the Counterproductive what we look at upon as counterproductive ways that the Nazis were committed to their ideology of Improving the race by exterminating the Jews and the Slavs and and other people that they thought you know, they're eugenicist their eugenicist mission of improving the race and others look at that and say You were giving yourself a survival Disadvantage by devoting so many resources to killing the Jews if you had just let the Jewish thing go You know, maybe you could have won but now we're getting into the question of definition with Adam Could the Nazis be Nazis without their anti-semitism? That's a really interesting question because it asked the question could could they have risen to the top of Germany without? leveraging the the engine of in-group out-group racism against the Jews Was it I just read through Peter lightheart's really fine summary of Of Renee Girard, which is just on his blog post on on on on pathion pathios that that web platform that has way too many ads and not great ads either but This gets into the real question of What we're talking about with respect to Darwin and what we're talking about with respect to definition and survival because What you're really Boiling your moral system down to is that which survives so so so what aspect of Nazism Lost the war was it their progressive Was it their progressive rate progressivist racism that basically said well We were bettering the race by getting rid of Jews and and other substandard Races because again, I in past videos I've laid out each of these each of these Worldviews each of these religions Even political ideologies has their telos they have their goal and the imagined the imagined goal of the Nazi Theology if you will was the betterment of the race by the destruction of the Jews and other groups And it's important to continue to remember those other groups as well That was their worldview so Their worldview was the purification of the Jews and the Nazis Their worldview was the purification the racial purification of humanity whereas Marxism had the worldview of social struggle and social and social purification of humanity and materialist equality, okay, I Was I was watching David Brooks and David he always every Friday does this conversation with Shields and Brooks on PBS NewsHour and And Brooks was saying, you know the Democrats always wanted to this is ironic because the the Republican Party at least an aspect of the establishment Republican Party has been known as as plu, you know as as plutocrats that they're the the party of the wealthy the party of money and But Brooks goes on to say yeah But you don't understand people vote because of social issues and it's these identity issues that they vote on much more than than just running on the election and whereas Democrats want to talk about well, this is what the government can do for you and David Brooks just looks at that and says you're not understanding how human beings work and what motivates them to act as they act and and so in a sense here we have a Similar dynamic of the question of okay. What what motivated what were Nazis at their heart was their anti-semitism just a byproduct of Nazism or or was it at its heart? And so therefore you have the question Well, what exactly lost the war for the Nazis if they had in fact loved the I mean the the Jewish population of Germany and Austria and that part of Europe was some of the Flat-out most brilliant most capable look at read the alchemy of air which is a fascinating book about the fixation of nitrogen and and a very sad story about a Jewish man who wanted to fit into the mainstream I've got all this Jewish enough in my head because I just finished Andrew Clavin's beautiful memoir Loved that book But so what exactly is the aspect that of the Nazis that Illustrates the Darwinian truth that both Adam and Jordan Peterson are bringing up in this conversation Now here's the thing you've got time and context with all of these and this is where I think the This monarchical clean room that materialism Also tends to have implicit in their system shows its weakness because At any given moment you can stop and say well, this is clearly The dominant group and so if you look at Germany at the end of and in 1941 beginning of 1942 you could look at Germany And say well, they're gonna take over the world and now if you pull that into your morality Conversation you're probably gonna say something to the effect of well Germany is more moral than France whose but they just kicked and and this is the different definite. This is the difficulty of this Method of looking at morality because it's it's time dependent We cannot evaluate any of this history apart from history. We're always standing within the stream Recognizing it relatively speaking against the other aspects. So huge proto birds dominated the planet for a time We call them dinosaurs and and you'd have to ask the question was T. Rex the moral king of the world Now you might say well, that was an animal. It doesn't have morality Okay, but now we're beginning to see the weakness of this approach to grounding morality upon evolution Nazis and Marxists beat out their competitors locally. So on a world stage You might look and say well, you know Nazis lost therefore They don't have grounded proper morality see but what I'm saying is that Grounded proper morality see but what I'm arguing is that you've actually changed the definition of the word morality because we have deep within us this idea of ought and if you're going to Get rid of that idea of ought and the separateness that I think Glenn is actually again because he's a Christian Glenn is actually pointing to I Don't think you're using the same your words have the same definition Morality as Adam is and morality is Glenn is and what they're really talking about. So let's So let's change the frame and let's look at Germany only and say well in that context was Anti-semitism defeated no anti-semitism defeated the communists in Germany and defeated the old guard in Germany and Nazis rose to the top of the German pile now Adam takes a step back and says ah, but they lost the war and they would lose the war every time Well, let's imagine that another planet somewhere in the universe has humanoid type species Let's say Adam and Crick were correct in that somehow aliens came down and planted human beings here and You know spaceships roll up on us and they've got swastikas under their belly This could be a fascinating science fiction and well, maybe Nazis lost in this world But Nazis won in another world and Nazis continued to take over all over the universe Then you would have to say that Nazis are moral and this gets into Matt Dillahunty's argument that well If you if you argue and I think that Dillahunty and Adam talked this is where Dillahunty would go with Adam He'd say well what you're essentially saying is that which wins is moral But that's not how we use morality Especially not in a Christian frame if you for example read the beginning of the book of Revelation we're gonna get into eschatology here because Often, you know think about This is my father's world this old Christian hymn Although the art seems off so strong God is the ruler yet So so Christianity has this idea that morality is somehow Outside the system and that morality has gravity that certainly pulls the world But again CS Lewis's definition of how we are we are rebels holding out against God and his morality And if you read for example, Larry Crabb Larry Crabb is a Christian psychologist who's written a number of books is an Evan is an American evangelical Christian When he reads Genesis he says part of what happens there in Genesis 3 in the rebellion in the garden is that We say to God we want to be the ones to define morality not you Okay. Now now this is where God number one and God number two in the question of God's ontology God as person or three persons God Acting in the world now takes hold of the world Now takes hold because well We're having a moral argument with God about morality And in fact, I see the I think we see this played out all the time Not only in career atheists that say God is not good but in all of our rebellious hearts when when some Bad things come thing comes into our life. We look at this and say I don't know if you are good God. How can I trust you? And you'll hear me bring this up in my sermons quite a bit C.S. Lewis writes the problem of pain in the in the 1940s 1950s where he's very much taking a philosophical approach to the problem of pain And it's all it's a wonderful book. It's all nicely wrapped up and put together But then if you read a grief grief observed when he himself descends into the pain after watching this Surprise in his life the surprise called joy of all things and you know, God is an amazing author so many ironies and When joy is is is taken from him by cancer And and and Lewis who's this been this You know one of the outstanding christian witnesses apologists verbal apologists philosophers He nearly loses his faith He nearly loses his faith Because his wife dies of cancer and that is such a vital and important thing to think about Because on one hand we can have all of our philosophy over here But on the other hand it has to be lived and and being lived means being lived in this world of tsunamis And cancer and heart disease and death and bankruptcy and alcoholism and brokenness and and adam a little bit later in this video Or say part of the part of the thing that jordan peterson brings to these conversations with the celebrity atheist is peterson is a Psychologist so he sits in a room with people who suffer Because you cannot keep that out of the equation and again That's part of the poverty of the monarchical vision clean room that has this world of objects You you have to sneak suffering in there too because objects don't suffer they just are but we do suffer and and so So then this question of morality well Well, how can we know what is true and and we desperately want Morality to be out there because we desperately want to say although I suffer and die and on a Rational level I can see that as part of this Ecosystem and perhaps part of what the world needs the world needs me to age and die so that others can But you just it just doesn't necessarily work because another part of me says No, I I was not I was not born to age Legs were born legs were made for the purpose of dancing eyes were made for the purpose of seeing ears were made for the purpose Of hearing and that in fact these purposes These joyful purposes Will not be Always lost and and that is the god number one slash god number two full picture of christian eschatology that materialism just can't finally deal with because all legs in this world Will be crippled and fail all eyes will lose their sight all ears will lose their hearing And so therefore the purpose for which eyes and ears and legs and hearts and loves were made will finally Be dashed and destroyed in the cold death of the universe And this is why purpose is fundamental To this and why morality? Can't just be wedded to survival So huge proto birds dominated the planet for a time was t-rex the moral king nazis and marxists beat out their competitors locally Were they the moral king if we just expand the frame or change the time does morality change? That's pretty much the definition of relativism each moral kingdom of this type rises and falls Let's imagine imagine a eugenic super race Let's imagine the eugenic super race pulls off their evil ploy to wipe out the rest of us who's us pay attention to us Homo sapiens without genetic modification or without much They the the eugenicist You know, they're smart and they launch themselves into space and they're up in the satellite and they they let loose a biological bomb and it wipes out all of regular natural born homo sapiens So that they can now come down to the planet because they are so smart They've engineered the they've engineered the germ to once it loses its host it dies out So they just they just sit in orbit for another six months until we're all gone and they come down to the planet and they repopulate darwinian morality says This is good in genesis one fashion Now we say well, it isn't good because it wasn't what we wanted see and I think this definition of morality Then gets boiled down into that which is good for me or that which is good for my tribe Or that which is good for my subset because when you take a step back and say ah see we Maybe enter we intermingled a bit but we replace the neanderthals. We subsume the neanderthals Therefore it is good I think we're using a different definition of the word good But isn't this what we say darwinian evolution is just without mind Now I don't think this even works for darwinian evolution and the reason is the metaphysical club, which is one of jordan peterson's recommended books darwin's fundamental insight as a Biologist was that among groups of sexually producing organisms the variations are much more important than the similarities Okay natural selection his name for mechanism of evolutionary development that he Codiscovered with alfred russell wallace is the process by which individual characteristics that are more favorable to reproductive success are chosen in quotation marks, of course Because here again our language betrays us that we can't talk About these things without choice. We don't have the language for them without in effect personifying evolution Is the process by which individual characteristics that are more favorable to reap to reproductive success are chosen because they are passed on from one Generation to the next over characteristics that are less favorable. But again favorable to what end? Darwin regretted the word selection suggested That that the word selection suggested intention again This is a hallmark of what and and I don't know that darwin invented this. I think Society just got to the point that darwin was there at the tipping point Ah, we don't need god to govern this process anymore. It happens on its own Okay, and this is where you get into nt. Wright's assertion that this is epicureanism Continuing to recycle back you have epicurean reincarnation as it were Darwin regretted the word selection suggested intention natural selection is a blind process What do you mean by blind? Mean it has no telos it is not looking into the future and saying we want to get to this It's just stumbling along blind. So even in the word you use of the word blind here You have a metaphor that's being poured out Natural selection is a blind process because the conditions to which the organism must adapt in order to survive are never the same It's haphazard. Let's use that word In periods of drought when seeds are hard to find finches that happen to have long narrow beaks good for foraging Will be favored over finches with broad powerful beaks More of their offspring will reproduce More of their offspring will reproduce or survive and reproduce This is the process of imagine morality if we're going to pin morality to this You would say that those finches are good But now again, i'd say we have two definitions of the word you have one definition of good being that which achieves its end Well, it's end towards what its end towards survival or that which achieves this other quest towards how we all Intuitively, I think understand the other definition and sense of good to be In periods of abundance when seeds are large and their shells are hard the broad beaked finches will hold an adaptive advantage Finchness, this is the key thing right here Finchness is a variable Not a constant and I think that's at the heart of this problem with understanding morality as darwinian competition because That which survives ness is the variable And and we slide we smuggle around with this with the slippery use of the first person plural us we Who do you mean by we? well our eugenic or our ai or our cyber descendants that replace us are they we Is it my racial group? Is it my? religious tribe is it my National group. Is that what we is and now if you pay careful attention always follow the we Always follow the us and ask yourself when someone uses that word Specifically, who is we? specifically who is us Because that's where all the slipperiness is happening Finchness is the variable not the constant darwin thought that variations do not arise because organisms need them Which essentially is what lamarck had argued he thought that variations occur by chance Okay, now what's by chance? Well chance is that which is so complex. We as human beings can't track them But materialists assert by faith that there's no such thing as chance that it's it's billiard balls all the way down And that chance determines their adaptive utility in all seasons It happens that some finches are born with marginally longer and narrower beaks than others Such as children of the same parents are not exactly the same height in certain environmental conditions a natch a narrower beak Will have positive or negative survival value, but in other conditions, for example when seeds are plentiful and finches are few Um, it may make no difference the selection of favorable characteristics is therefore neither designed nor progressive There's no morality No intelligence divine or otherwise Determines in advance the relative value of individual variations and there is no ideal type of finch or essence of finchness Towards which adaptive changes are leading but notice when we use this language in terms of us in evolution we assume our usness and But even in the case of the nazis we're not even exactly sure what is the essence of nazi Morality So then we get into eschatology which is end things which gets into purpose goals That which survives nests always wins And by definition of darwinian morality, that is what is more moral. But again, this is always dependent on time when and context in other words Morality then gets by definition Relative because The moment that you make your decision well You're stuck in that moment and and I think that's part of the way that this naturalistic approach to the world Falls apart it it it really and I think this Based on a lot of the other videos that i've made You've got naturalism as the problem of time Because well according to naturalism itself time is running out and in the end in the cold material energy death of the universe Nothingness is good because nothingness wins Nothingness survives and I think this is I think part of us knows this in our head that Hey, we we Suddenly we're we're opening our door to you know, um David benatar And his you know ought better to not have been born I don't think it's moral Whatever succeeds us homo sapiens will be our moral superiors. This is not generally how we imagine the word to be used Now this is from this is from um Andrew clavin's book, which I just finished today now bear in mind If I liked a book and I just finished it. It's I'm very I always fall in love with the last book. I read that. I really liked but I really enjoyed this book This is part of of andrew clavin's process He he wanted to go to full-blown atheism, but he drew back Why? Because he was reading the marquis de sade Marquis de Sade. And as he read the Marquis de Sade, he saw in a sense full-blown atheism and he said, I can't tolerate this definition of morality. Why should I do what's good for society? What is society to me? None of this elaborate gain theory nonsense where we all benefit from mutual sacrifice and restraint that only works until no one's looking. Then I'll get away with what I can. If there is no God, there is no good, and sadistic pornography is scripture. But the opposite is also true. That is, if we can see that one thing is morally better than another, it can only be because it comes closer to an ultimate moral good, the standard by which it's measured. An ultimate moral good cannot be just an idea. It must be in effect a personality with consciousness and free will. The rain isn't morally good even though it makes the crops grow. A tornado that kills isn't morally evil, though it may be an evil for those in its way. Happy and sad events from birth to death just happen and we ascribe moral qualities to them as they suit us or don't. But true, objective good and evil, in order to be good and evil, have to be aware and intentional. So an ultimate moral good must be conscious and free. It must be God. So we have to choose. Either there is no God and no morality whatsoever, or there is morality and God is real. Either way makes sense if you're speaking strictly about logic. I didn't reject Saad's outlook on logical grounds. I rejected it because I found it repulsive and I knew it wasn't true just as I know that one plus one always equals two plus one, though neither I nor anyone else can prove it. So too, I know that a Nazi who tortures a child to death is less a priest who gives a beggar bread. And that is so even in a world that is all Nazis everywhere. And the chain of reasoning that took me finally to Christ, accepting this one axiom that some actions are morally better than others, and I would insert here not just because they enhance survivability within a certain frame, is the only truly non-logical leap of faith I ever made. Hardly a leap really, barely even a step. I know it's so. And those who declare they do not are, like Hamlet, only pretending. After reading Saad, I abandoned atheism and returned to agnosticism. I couldn't quite bring myself to follow my own logic to its conclusions. That is, I couldn't quite bring myself to accept the existence of God, I knew the road to hell when I saw it and I chose to go home by another way. And again, I can really recommend Andrew Clavin's book. Now, I saw Andrew Clavin talk to Ben Shapiro. I don't watch Daily Wire. At some point, Mr. Reagan's going to do his, going to edit up the conversation that he and I had. I'm not really a political conservative. And so I don't find the partisan bickering, I find partisan bickering distasteful even though I sometimes get caught in it. But I really enjoyed Andrew Clavin in both his conversation with Ben Shapiro and in this lovely book. It's a lovely, lovely, lovely book. I really enjoyed it. And maybe it's because he grew up on Long Island nine years before I grew up in New Jersey and so there was enough cultural reference between us. I didn't grow up in a self-consciously Jewish home. My family had subverted its Jewishness before, long before I ever grew up and we even knew about our ancestry as Jews in the Netherlands. But that's part of my ancestry of the Dutch and there too. But yeah, it's a lovely, lovely book. And I think it's a wonderful book. So the good and that which survives finally come together. What do I mean by that? Well, again, you've got Matt Dillahunty's, what if God is Satan? Well, what is good? That which was overflowing joy and goodness made the world. That same joy and goodness will finally overcome all process of lesser joy and goodness. So in the end, in eschatology, what remains? Well, it's joy. It's the joy in the eternal creator. Again, I'm a Christian, Trinitarian God that overflowed into the creation of the world. We rebelled against it. Nature rebelled against us and we're working through that process right now. But in the end, we will go back to joy and goodness. Not the heat death of the universe, but whatever it is, the great author of creation has planned for next chapters. Well, how do I know it will be good? That's trust. How can I trust this author of the universe that in the words of one of my friend, my God kills puppies and grandmas? Yeah. This gets into a lot of Christian theology about God's will, God's intention, God's allowing, so on and so forth. Can't go there right now because I want to wrap up this video. But I can trust him because again, he sends his son and because he writes himself into the story and he's a Christian and becomes our victim so he could become our savior. So and that I think is good and I think it does finally triumph and I think that's essentially what the book of Revelation is about. So Adam, great video. Glen, great conversation. Look forward to talking to you and I hope the rest of you have enjoyed this.
