 Hi, this is Paul. I'm gonna pick up where I left off. This will be part two of wave two. Jordan Peterson and Russell Brand commenting on their video starting at about minute 28. Sitting here just like, yep, I'll just... that was... but anyway, that's fine. Not so much because you said, you know... And I, one of the things I love about this video is the interchange between Jordan and his daughter. It is just charming, endearing. You get a sense of the father's love for the daughter, the daughter's love and respect for the father, the legacy of good parenting. You know, not perfect, but it's just good to watch. Before we did this podcast, we were talking about mentors and you said that you're... one of the things that you've done is to pick someone to imitate and to pull yourself towards them by that process of imitation. And then when you got close, you pick someone else to imitate or to compare yourself with. Compare myself with. Sure, but it's the same thing. The comparison is the same thing because when you compare yourself to someone, you start pulling yourself towards them unless you get envious and resentful. Yeah, before we hopped on the podcast, I was just talking about how I have, like I consistently have... I'm getting a lot of opportunities with the podcast I have, but I consistently have my dad to compare myself to, which I think is fine because I have something to aim towards and it's kind of something to get to. And that's what I've done throughout my life is, hey, you know, that person's really smart and interesting. Trying to achieve what they're achieving. And then once you get there, you pick somebody above you. And the problem is that means you're always kind of unfulfilled, but it also means you're always growing. So that's what we were talking about. So that's also why Jung pointed out, for example, he believed that the book of Revelations had been tacked on to the New Testament because the Christ in the Gospels was portrayed too much as a figure of mercy, whereas in Revelations Christ is portrayed primarily as a judge. And Jung's explanation for that was that every ideal is a judge. Now, I like his idea that every ideal is a judge. I think that's right. Now with respect to the book of Revelation, tacked on, agency, the whole question of the process of of Canonicity in the New Testament is obviously a big topic that I'm not going to get into. A couple of comments on the book of Revelation. Revelation, singular, the apocalypse of St. John. The book of Revelation is, in my opinion, a retreatment of Hebrew prophecy in the light of the Revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus presents himself sometimes as a judge in the canonical Gospels and sometimes the Father is the judge in the canonical Gospels. And I don't want to get into the relationship between Jesus and the Father with respect to the Trinity right now because that's another large conversation. Because the Son and the Father, Jesus obviously identifies as the Son of God and it's helpful to think about what that meant in the context of that day because the Prince, and Jesus actually leverages this in a number of his parables, where the Prince comes to the land representing the Father because the Prince is, in a sense, the King and the New Testament plays off these images in many different books and in fact looks back to Psalm 2, Psalm 110, a bunch of other Psalms to continue this conversation. The idea that Jesus is too kind in the Gospels, I look at as sort of a, I can understand where people get that from, but it's sort of a modern meme because Jesus is too kind until he isn't and then everyone complains and that just demonstrates that even while we're reading the canonical Gospels we're projecting onto them, especially, and this isn't true of Jung so much, but especially since the counterculture in the United States, we're projecting this idea that the Lord of the Old Testament is somehow this deeply judging, distant Father and Jesus is this up-coast kind and cuddly Son. Well that only works if you don't read closely because you can find verses of tremendous pathos and kindness. Look for example in the book of Hosea where the Lord is just crying over his lost son Ephraim, how I can't give you up. So there are many, many passages of kindness and tenderness of the Lord in the Old Testament. Just read Genesis 3. There's cursing but there's great care and concern and you can find many places where Jesus is, you know, whenever he takes up the Son of Man mantle in the Gospels I believe he is pointing back to the book of Daniel. Now as I said the book of Revelation is a revisiting of Hebrew prophecy in the light of Jesus Christ and another deep theme in the book of Revelation has to do with empire. The subject of the relationship between Christianity and empire is enormous. Tom Holland, Dominic Sandbrook did I thought a very interesting episode on empire and the rest is history. Yuval Harari I thought had some very interesting treatment of empire in his book Homo Sapiens. Empire especially since the counterculture sort of has a dirty name and that is, that has been continued in some ways by contemporary, you know, by the critique of colonialism but part of the reason that I've contrasted Christian nationalism and Christian imperialism is because empire is not so easily resisted if you imagine that there is a right and there is a wrong and there is an ultimate judge and so the question of empire is dealt with in the book of Revelation as it is dealt with much more subtly in the other books. For example the, as I've been going through the Gospel of Luke and Jesus marched to Jerusalem from chapter 9 all the way into the events of Holy Week which is this week in the Christian Church, my sermon last week on Palm Sunday has a lot to do with empire because on one hand Jesus receives the praise on Palm Sunday as being correct. He is the king and the sign above the cross, King of the Jews in three languages, is posted ironic and mockingly but again the way that it's taken, the religious leaders demand that it be taken down, Pilate I wrote what I wrote, and even Jesus on Palm Sunday on one hand receives the praise and some of the Pharisees say you know pipe you know have your rain in your rain in your base and Jesus says if they are not if they're not singing my praise then the stones, that's the stones of the temple, the stones of the temple will cry out in recognition of the King of Kings, of the Son of God, of the and again Jesus riffs on this in a lot of his parables and so he is the king but the specific type of empire and the means of empire that they wish to promote Jesus continually resists. That's a huge theme in the Gospels that Jesus resists the label, the public label of Messiah even though he accepts it in many ways what he does is he accepts it but he disagrees with how empire is pursued in this world. Now the book of Revelation is very complex in that because of course Jesus rides into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday on a donkey and people always look at that as humble and that's true that is from the Hebrew prophets as well yet it is also in the line with David if you read the book of Samuel David and his princes all ride donkeys. He doesn't come in a warhorse which would be much more of an imperial animal but then someone in the comments says oh but in Revelation he comes riding a warhorse that's right and you've also got questions in the book of Revelation of audience so one of the the book of Revelation begins with churches seven letters to seven churches in Asia Minor. This stuff is endlessly complex. Someone made a comment that I should do commentary on the Bible like I do commentary on these videos and I don't have life enough to do such a project. So Peterson's point following Jung perhaps is that a judge is an ideal is by its very nature a judge. Now we get into questions of agency and personification and a lot of these types of issues but it's a I think it's a very good point and I think it's a very powerful point psychologically. And the ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge and you could say the ultimate ideal judges your soul and because that's virtually the definition of the ultimate ideal and so the ultimate ideal is something transcendent and divine that judges your soul. Now again we have questions of agency in this and to what degree is the arena agentic and to what degree is agency actual you know agency personified and personal so but that's but in these psychological categories some of those distinctions don't matter anywhere near as much as we think they should. Now what that means about the way the universe is constituted again I have no idea but but but the higher the ideal the more severe the judge that's clearly the case and that should make you quake I think it does when you're conscious when your conscience assaults you in the middle of the night for things that you've done wrong it's because you're waking. He often goes back to this you really have the sense watching Jordan that he is driven and and that comes actually through later in the video once Russell Brand drops out what a driven life he's led and in his very stern self-criticism he even critiqued that in your boots morally because you failed to live up to this ideal there's no escape from that not not not truly I don't believe there is. How are you two managing to conduct the intimacy of a father and daughter relationship in this new medium? You know having two children my two little daughters myself I love them so dearly they're children they're not adults of course but I felt like it made me like fantasize a little that you know I wonder if I'll work with them I wonder who they'll be I wonder who they'll be. The idea of bringing your relationship into this space has it been challenging for you Michaela particularly when you hold your father up in such high regard and such high esteem and I know you've been through a very challenging times of family and thank God that you're both well now but how is it to find yourself in this sort of situation that has a sort of a public dimension to it? This is a second question and you know this first question he asks well I know it's your interest it's your podcast but and he's kind of taken over the podcast in a lot of way but again he's doing so really well because the first question was the first two questions were I thought outstanding and and this is I think an outstanding question too and obviously for him it's personal because he now is watching I think some some good fruits of achievement between Jordan and his daughter and again as a pastor you're often called in to situations where things haven't gone well and and I think this even gets into the point that even existence you know so so Russell can see that you know now obviously would Michaela have a podcast if her father hadn't become a YouTube celebrity no no but he is and so she has and I you know why should why should any of us blame her look at the parents of some of the most famous actors I mean Hollywood is itself this this broad family business too you find that all the time so but I think it's a delightful question and part it's part of what makes this whole video really charming because you to go back to Jordan's point about an ideal even if the ideal isn't forefronted Russell Brand seeing I'll use the word glory Russell Brand seeing some of the glory of the relationship between Jordan and his daughter elicits in him a desire for glory and so he asks himself how can I parent my daughters to the point that they might be able to do something like like Michaela is doing now now again you know even what I said about Michaela and her success well she could have blown it by now and I haven't watched a lot of her conversations but the ones that I have watched I think you know she's growing in it and and again it's no no it's nobody's fault that they're young and inexperienced and so what do you do well you go out there and you do things and you gain experience and you take the advantages that have been offered to you a part of the how shall I say it part of the miserliness of the whole privilege backpack is and David Brooks pointed this out in a in a piece every parent wants to give their children whatever privileges they can and to look on that and cast dispersions on that it's a there's a real problem and in fact even supremely wealthy people let's say Bill and Melinda Gates who have you know made comments about there they want to hand their children privileges but we all also understand that some privileges are in fact also liabilities and so they don't want to hand their children billions and billions and billions of dollars their children will of course be enormously privileged and enormously wealthy but you also know that handing your children billions of dollars is also a liability and so the same for Michaela Peterson having now a famous or notorious father is both an opportunity and a liability and and make of it what you will um yeah it it hasn't been easy I mean for my entire life especially when I've gotten older I've said yes to every opportunity that kind of came my way just to see where it would take me and I think that's something I learned from my dad just say yes to everything and see what happens I started like formally working for him in 2018 because I'd already built his kind of social media platforms just the profiles on you know Facebook I knew how Instagram worked and I was like Instagram's a new Facebook like switch we got to get you a profile there so and then I started like simple with I was cutting YouTube videos and just making clips and then I was booking theaters and then I started coordinating between companies or agents and it's been complicated with family it hasn't been it's not all fun and games and we get into serious work discussions where we're we're talking about I don't know maybe producing something and whether or not that's a good idea and it's I don't really have a comparison so I don't know if it's more stressful than working somewhere else like the other places I worked when I was a kid I was working at like a hockey rink and as a waitress and I I was working at a club at one point and it's not like that wasn't stressful so I'm still working in this position so apparently I like it and most definitely you know again Peterson Inc Jordan decided to go with family with respect to a lot of this Russell I'm glad I mean someone obviously cut it that they had all three they had all three cameras going to probably four cameras one on him one on her one and one that's panned back and then the feed that's coming from Russell but you know maybe I'll maybe I'll actually maybe I'll actually clip this because this might make a might make a nice might make a nice thumbnail yeah I do things I do things very I do things really challenging you've taken a fair bit of public flak I would say for people who because of what's happened to me over the last couple of years because of people who doubt your motivations and yes you know and who feel that you might be exploiting me which I would like to state very forthrightly is not the case quite the contrary you've been of tremendous help but it's difficult this is this is just a lovely video about father-daughter relationships it's just beautiful I love it keep those boundaries straight I mean the problem with working with family members is you run into dual relationship problems and you know many ethicists think those are best avoided completely and there's some real wisdom in that but that doesn't mean it's unethical to enter into a business relationship with a family member but it does mean that it's fraught with difficulties it's difficult to be a father and also supervise Michaela's role in my business affairs for example because it isn't clear when I'm one and when I'm the other and it's I suppose not clear to her when she's daughter and when she's employee there there are definitely benefits though I found like part of the reason I thought that I was good at the role I'm doing was because I was more comfortable pushing dads on on decisions that I really believed he should do pushing much harder than somebody else would push like me for example like you would push she's less she's less agreeable than me so quite a bit like yeah this is a fun video I could do I could make congratulations thank you it makes getting along with people hard but it's it's entertaining yeah it was tricky I I mean I think I like it I've been I wonder forgive me interrupting Michaela I wonder when the conversation has a he he's taken over this podcast entity to move into areas such as archetypes and when there's such strong opinions are being expressed whether or not you feel like it could be exposing just because of the good Jordan your clinical background and the type of conversations that you evoke eat and I'm just talking about the actual conversations himself let alone the sort of secondary component when other people start to evaluate stroke judge this stuff exposing in what way what are you what are you thinking about you mean violation of privacy I reckon provocative more like if someone like I feel like if I was talking to my mother or father it's difficult to imagine my little innocent albeit potent children like but with a parent like I feel like that if my mother or father was talking about sort of archetypes and psychic energies and parenting like I feel like that but I could potentially feel like hey you know that that sort of that territory is not entirely academic and not a time and not solely rhetorical but is in this context is empirical and I know I think the very fact that you're doing it evidence is evidence of a great deal of a trust and rapport simpatico between you I just wondered if it like I think what you want about Russell Brandy is fun to listen to how how it feels now that you're actually doing I think I can I can answer that okay I've got an answer to so at least from my perspective people are people have asked me is your dad like he is on YouTube at home and the answer is yes like you know generally speaking you don't get a 90-minute sir like sermon like speech with nobody sermon interrupting but we've been talking about the meaning behind the biblical series and myths and yeah talking about you know what do you want to do in your future since since I can remember so it's not something new at all and it doesn't seem uncomfortable because that's how I was raised and it doesn't having a public component doesn't make it jarring it because there's still a distance right like even even in 2016 or 2017 it was there's a distance between reading about in a newspaper it's weird like you know you walk down the street and dad was on a newspaper and I'd be like that's that's jarring but at home it's not jarring even doing podcasts like this it's intimate right it's just us three so there's the public element but it would be maybe it would be different if it was in front of a crowd but it hasn't really seemed less you've had a different experience I think we're both relieved and pleased to be doing something together yeah that isn't intensely focused on like fatal or or highly painful illness yeah that because that's just it's just been non that's just been non-stop for her way too long way way and so this is a break from that it is very strange but we're in a strange world I'll never get accustomed I don't think to the degree to which I've become public and that's something I wanted to ask you about I mean you got famous and then there's nothing more appalling than it's interesting because he he pursued Matthew McConaughey now of course Russell Brand and Matthew McConaughey are more famous than Jordan Peterson and this does get into a theme that I've picked out a little bit before in terms of Peterson likes to talk about you know that let's say the social media is YouTube podcasting YouTube and podcasting are sort of halfway between mass media and social media but that versus the the mass media platforms and I still assert that the the mass media platforms despite the the pegs that they are being taken down now are still enormously powerful and many of those who do grow who blow up very big on social medias do so because of mass media and people get out try to get on the Bachelor or the Bachelorette in order to become influencers etc etc Joe Rogan of course got his got his start in mass media which didn't hurt his his success in in podcasting and YouTube people who are notorious or well-known whining about their fame and I don't want to do that but but it but it's still something I so of course I'm living with women right now used to be that my daughters were in college and my boys were home and so we were living with men and so we watched a nodding hill the other night I love Hugh Grant you got I enjoy Hugh Grant movies we're watching nodding hill and of course that hill that that movie is about Hugh Grant is a small bookshop I always I always smile every time Tom Holland talks about Dominion on sale at better bookshops and I'm like do you have book shops in the UK here in North America they've been decimated by Amazon but where was I going with this I distract myself fame of course Julia Roberts walks into his bookshop and they become lovers and eventually married spoiler alert it's a rom-com where do you think it's going but yeah fame is this funny thing where we sort of want it and then once you have it do you really want it it's a tool you can use but it's also a cost that you bear along with you know all this go back to what I was talking about privilege earlier thing interesting to note and to contemplate it try partly to get a handle on it's very it's been very difficult for me to reconceptualize my circumstances given that I became well known when I was relatively older you know it happened after I was 55 and it's strange strange to understand that the conversation that we're having you know is going to be watched and listened to by some hundreds of thousands of people or perhaps more than that over time it's uncanny in some sense and and surreal I just don't understand those numbers so it doesn't like I can't I can't understand those numbers yeah well you've grown up with the reality of YouTube for example like you've grown up in a world where you could be a TV producer as well as a TV consumer I mean when I was grew up when I was your age even a bit younger than that when I was in my teen years we had two TV channels it wasn't long before that that you know the United States only had three and certainly there was never any conceptualization that any particular individual could become a TV station or a media center and so it's a very so lately I've been talking about platforms too and the relative platform of the church versus others and the proliferation of platforms you know cable TV network television to cable TV to on and on and on and on and on and of course Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame a foreign reality for me and I guess I do have some sense of the numbers perhaps because I've done so many live talks and I've seen very large crowds and in any case the reason that Michaela and I do this in large part is because well we're curious we wanted to see how it would go but I we also we're also seeing if we enjoy it and I'm happy to be here doing something like this with her it's a real privilege I close back to you know it's very interesting on Twitter when Peterson sort of reached out to Elon Musk and people on Twitter are always saying well Jordan should talk to you and it's like well maybe he will or maybe he won't when you're climbing a ladder you tend to look up and Michaela was just making that point that you look up and you try to climb up the rungs and we have in in social media all of these metrics and so let's say Andrea with the bangs or Sam Adam or Mary Cohen or the meaning code I have more subs than they do so I'm up the ladder but Jonathan Peugeot has more subs than I have so he's up the ladder and David Fuller just was on trigonometry and that was on Twitter and so I chatted with him on Twitter a little bit and he Rebel Wisdom has 200k subs so they're up the ladder and Matthew McConaughey of course opens his YouTube channel and very quickly has hundreds of thousands probably quick soon into the millions of subs again the relationship between mass media and social media and so you have all of these platforms and pastors have have long had to a degree these questions of not fame so much but a pastor is sort of this minor celebrity in a very small pond and the dynamics of the pastors kids so we're not I'm not we're not unaware of those dynamics in the pastoral ministry a small-town mayor let's say or something like that so the dynamics tend to scale but as Michaela said these numbers they they sort of begin to boggle your mind so figuring this stuff out is a very interesting thing and now of course you have the proliferation of potential platforms you know having children I always I don't even have a joke I don't even have a joke right now I suppose too this has been enhanced by my ill health in recent years but I always feel that it's a privilege to spend time with my children as the old preacher saying goes nobody on their deathbed looks up and says I wish I worked more what do they say I wish I'd spent more time with my children I wish I'd spent more time with my family and I have some sense of how fast time goes you know I've always had a very acute sense of the finitude of existence and so and this is a good hint for people who have children but with regards to your family members at all is don't take it for granted no every second you get that isn't painful you should cherish yeah I'm on land oh you came up with a joke that's good I felt like I took it as an expression of your love for one another just as a with the content that I he has totally taken over this conversation watched and I imagine that would be the motivation given the trials that you've endured with regard and then this is of course entirely speculative that what preceded it in the rather unique certainly unparalleled cultural position that you Jordan had occupied leading up to the period of abstinence and it's a accompanying medical complexity and I know that you know but that's just Tammy and I know that then Michaela I know that sort of health issues have been quite prevalent so I'm familiar with you and I'm familiar with your work and I sensed that it would be it was a sort of a culminative expression of love and gratitude and warmth and an opportunity for you both to be together and it's very heartening to hear that it's that with regard to your sort of inquiry about the nature of sort of public life for me I as I'm the older I get the more I recognize it was in there an unsophisticated attempt as perhaps all early grasps at the grail must be of trying to heal the seminal wound of seeking some kind of value of trying to impose some kind of myth in a myth world some pursuit something of value to chase meaning crisis after and and then increasingly discovering on as various points in the journey arrived at that it couldn't fulfill me now I was sort of comparatively old also like I'm you know wasn't like 16 I was like 30 when I sort of became well known when I was like to make films in America and things like that and I always felt that there were I'm sure numerous but at least two streams running one this sort of like a need for validation and approval on a scale that could only indeed be provided by YouTube numbers Michaela I'd need to see that speedometer clocking up 100,000 200,000 they can never be enough never a high enough number this is the the that lies at the root perhaps of all addiction this constant requirement for more than no way of healing that wound not materially at least it's interesting how you know as he's talking I get the sense of reciprocal net the relationship between reciprocal broadening and reciprocal narrowing and of course John Verveke talks about this in episode 13 of awakening from the meaning crisis and how on one hand you've got Russell Brand saying I had at my heart no end of emptiness that no amount of numbers could fill boy there's a point about human condition and in that in that sense the you imagine the reciprocal broadening of of ever ever hungry fame is also then at the same time sort of a reciprocal narrowing where it's all about the numbers I need more I need more it's an addiction and an agency is is just continually diminished by this but some of that's actually some of that's even actually healthy Russell I mean one of the things that we do constantly is to evaluate our worth by the responses of others and you know if that's all you do that's a mistake and if you're doing it in a false way that's also a mistake because then you're getting and again what is that what is the false way and what is the true way the true way is to say okay I'm getting input in terms of Peterson's talked about this before you know how to price things he talked about and and sometimes free isn't the best price because it doesn't give you the input you know of the value so that you can sort of step up and increase the value of what you're doing but the gaining as a consequence of doing something that isn't real but like the person who cares nothing for what anyone else thinks is actually a psychopath not a saint and so it's easy and so you know again back to verveky stuff you know you have opponent processing in this where okay you're getting feedback and all of that is good but you need to have another opponent in there so that it doesn't run amok and your reciprocal broadening becomes reciprocal narrowing and it becomes addiction and you lose agency and and of course part of what's compelling about the Russell Brand story is that that is exactly what happened to him he he lost agency and he had to then suddenly he needed an opponent processing and it strikes me you know often comment about the 12-step program you know there needs to be there needs to be a higher power higher than what higher than everything because you're you're in a sense competing against everything and and that's what needs to put a put a stop to you see for that mechanism to go astray in a world that's so dominated by social media because you know when when when before social media if you were a teenager it was really important how your peers responded to you and and it should have been because that's part of apprenticeship you're socializing yourself against the group at that point and their opinion should matter you use them as a proxy for your parents to escape from your parents it's crucial even though it can go too far but now that's elevated to such an immense degree it's like how it's like it's like pornography or cocaine if you know it both pornography harnesses the sexual drive and drugs like cocaine hijacked the the incentive reward the pleasure circuit and that they're unbelievably powerful they're unbelievably powerful and it's not surprising that you'd be addicted to watching the numbers rack up I mean I can see that and it's and experience it as well it's it's almost impossible to avoid wanting to see the numbers climb and to some degree that's egotistical and it can really lead you astray but to some degree it's just the natural workings of a mechanism that is actually there in part to keep you socially acceptable insane this okay so I've been muting my mic so I can take a sip of my tea and not have to listen to the the the ice warble around in the in the glove and the tumbler and then I forget to unmute my mic and so I I'll spare you the content in the attempt at lip-reading but now I have to go back and do commentary again on this section the trials of avoiding editing cocaine and pornography it's difficult to locate comparably potent influences when it comes to more positive attributes along now what's make sure I'm on here and recording yes I'm making noise good it's being recorded so part of what's happened with human beings in my second commentaries always different from the first is that there's been a scaling up and and and perhaps what we're seeing and cocaine and pornography and social media induced fame and let's say 16 and 18 year olds being recruited into the NBA or the NFL and the fame and the temptations that they Russell Brand is saying you know or the fame in terms of a comedian and all the temptations in there you know Russell Brand is saying well what about you know is are there are there greater and greater resources available to us and again in the 12 step program you have God you have the greatest of all possible resources and built into the gospel is again Jesus leading the principalities and powers and triumphal procession and again triumphal procession you're looking at Rome and a Roman triumph where after Julius Caesar conquers Gaul he leads you know Lee he leads thousands of slaves in bonds through the streets of Rome demonstrating his supremacy that's demonstrating his glory and power over these principalities and powers and so the point here is that there are available and and those are the resources available to us to oppose now the heightened resources as our capacity grows our temptations grow and we need other we need another power again 12-step language higher than ourselves to deliver us from these principalities and powers alongside my like craving for you know attention etc and and perhaps and warped ordinary anthropological drives for acceptance was always a vocational urgency a devotion like an untapped or at least misguided devotion to that was always present there now this I think also exposes some of the weakness of Jordan's generic meaning and responsibility message because these things can be employed in good or evil directions Jordan Jordan sort of truthiness internal gyroscope of do what is meaning not what is expedient it's not a bad little handle but it is not ultimately a sufficient little handle because you can find in responsibility and meaningful you know things that point you to not great ends and I feel that so many of the things that I've heard you previously discuss chime with this if they do not express this exactly that the problem of not having a shared public myth is that everything is up for grabs for a quiet being anointed with that status without a clear depiction of God God as ideals God as a shared standards and again he is he is picking up on Jordan sort of minimalist God then why not just pursue fame why not just pursue cocaine nothing means anything anyway and I only sort of more back to the meaning crisis or recently with you know in my case it's sort of a spiritual program through the 12 steps through mentorship through the obligations that having people that are relying me for their own recovery as well as being a father these I wouldn't call them secondary I'm sure their primary characteristics but they were secondary in my own behavior have been bought to the forefront have been realized actuated and like that to your point earlier about sort of mentorship is not that they just exhibit the divine and that it's you know it's only relevant in so much as it may activate the divinity or sublime energy in their mentee I see it's beyond that I see it somehow as a kind of symbiosis a kind of osmosis a kind of that isn't ultimately the optimistic view of life one of oneness one or okay symbiosis osmosis again a symbiotic relationship is there too but they're joined osmosis is a semi membrane where one there's transference to the other and that I do think to a degree of vervekis observations because vervekis always sort of back and forth that's that's a lot of the the the motion of vervekis vervekis system now oneness and now we're again we're sort of knocking on the door of neo-platinism and and so part of what's brand is very broad and very open but there's a certain slipperiness and lack of definition in this too where there's just all just just throw it all there in the sink of love that separate that we are not ultimately separate then then then then then figuring out okay in what ways are we and in what ways aren't we so you want to you want to pursue that definition for there is recourse to the universal there is a possibility of me in admiring another person or adoring another person imbibing and taking on these attributes if the ultimate reality is separation separateness and I sometimes I think that takes us back to the discussion about the so-called Christian transformation of the idea of God I've had Jewish friends of mine point out that the God of the Old Testament gets a bad rap from Christians to some degree and that there's a lot more love there than then you might presume if you viewed the New Testament as a transformation of the Old Testament God into the God of love but we'll leave that aside I think it's a valid point but we'll leave that aside the quest if you're if you're mentored in a particular direction well here's what here's how you might conceive of it is there something that all mentors share in common well you would say so because they're all in the category mentors and then you might say that well whatever all mentors share in common is the pattern of the divine again that's almost by definition now then there's a deeper question which is okay if that if what all mentor sharing common is the pattern of the divine is that a real pattern and the answer pattern of the divine it's an awfully big pattern what aspect divinity itself divinity as top of the hierarchy that to some degree as well you'll find that out by acting it out and it seems to me that the answer to that has to be yes I mean if we're adapted to the world and if we pursue the fullest extent of the possibilities of our adaptation through mentorship then and if that improves the quality of our life then it seems that whatever it is that mentorship is pushing towards is is real in so far as it works in the world now does that mean it's materially real or objectively real I don't think that reality is bound completely by the categories of objective and subjective I don't think that captures the entire essence of reality what he says right there's actually pretty key and foundational with the Peugeot conversation and with a lot of part of why he's he plays a materialist in the lab you might say so but I don't believe that our instinct towards mentorship is a delusion I don't believe that our religious instinct is a delusion either even though all instincts can go astray yes and when you saying that this idea of Christianity being that you know if we interesting always got the crucifix tattooed to his bicep I didn't know that interesting we live in God's light or we aspire to God's light or if we embody God's love then this is beneficial I was thinking how as a paradigm it's comparable to the Taoist idea that you are bringing the path into being as you walk it that you are creepy oh and he's got Ganesh on the other bicep and always the white t-shirt with lots of bread what is that that reality is interacting with your consciousness that your belief your perception the manner in which you behold and enact your life influences life becomes life is life and in that tradition and let me tell you I've no belly anything about it it's sort of presented in a more gnostic way it's sort of somewhat more opaque it's more minimal as one would expect to house does it is within that culture but this is the central message appears to be the same that there is no objective that these categories of objective and subjective perhaps have to be simultaneously held perhaps opposed perhaps are interchangeable that reality is being reality is being believed into being through our consciousness through the agency of our consciousness certainly we can never know what reality was someone asked on Twitter how would Jonathan Peugeot and Russell Brand talk well that would be a conversation I would be interested in listening to and here right now he's talking about attention which is a was a big piece of Peugeot and Peterson's conversation separate from our consciousness is well I don't think we would ever sacrifice if we didn't believe that reality was in opaque to our beliefs because we we we sacrifice because we believe in the possibility of a better future being brought into reality by our actions and it actually seems to work I mean it's quite remarkable we can imagine something we can strategize toward it and it generally it manifests itself well enough so that we don't stop doing that and it is quite it's quite remarkable that that's the case on that note I hate to break this up because whose podcast was this is Russell Brand's podcast I'm gonna pause here because I don't remember if they say anything decent before the third part of the podcast which is actually again quite lovely because it's just Jordan and his daughter all right there's a little bit more I have a book coming out on audible which I'd love to talk to you about you know further about the finding the sacred in the everyday rather rather grand title revelation you'll be pleased to hear like like where I'm just talking about I personally can't live and again back to those of you who just watch obviously the video commentaries of Jordan Peterson stuff get more views than the Paul van der clay monologue conversations or the conversations with randos that I do but you know platform here does Russell Brand start a church that doubt that made that conversation I have it in a in a clip I've done my abandoned clip channel maybe I should make an even tinier clip so that I can just quickly insert into all of these because that observation that in the 19th century Russell Brand would have started a church he doesn't he has a YouTube channel he has publishing and he has followers and this also to a certain degree gets into the Peugeot Peterson conversation where you know Jordan well Jordan has fans and Peugeot I think exactly right says it's not a church you're because the problem with fans is that you're at the top of this fame hierarchy with your fans that's actually not what you need and okay so maybe you get a degree of accountability that if you if you cross your fans but we call that you know being captured by your audience and that's not a good thing again and again in the Gospels the crowd the audience Jesus will not be captured by his audience and Jesus will not wield the crowd for political ends which is what many would desire and so part of how a church is different than if you are the head if the church is yours and you are the head of your own church you have a real problem someone someone on Twitter said well well if Jordan starts a church then then then Paul and Jonathan Peugeot will be priests and it's like you really don't understand where Jonathan and I are coming from and this thing because we already have a master and it's not Jordan so how I find it in a post secular world but when you were just talking just then sorry to interrupt my own heart I doubt like where I'm just talking about that I personally can't live without sacredness present in my ordinary life and how and what's interesting about that is okay what is sacred that is that is the the intrusion and the privilege of the owner of the author of the ultimate and how that ripples down and organizes us into a hierarchy because sacred is pretty much at the top and common is down below and profane is against but you know to have the church of Russell Brand he would be sacred but he's basically saying how in life he needs the sacred he needs something above himself in order for he himself his own little hierarchy that is him to be properly arranged and it's for that reason that your fans can't be a church because you need something above yourself you need something outside the system and and we see that in in Viktor Frankl's observation about you need something outside the camp in order to survive the camp you see that in Jordan Peterson's political observation in the first biblical lecture where in Christianity the king is accountable to the God and so that's why if you're if you if you are the sacred thing in your own religious platform you will undoubtedly go astray how I find it in a post secular world but when you were just talking just then sorry to interrupt my own heart out but I was thinking that perhaps much of the dissatisfaction polemicism and fragmentation that we're currently experiencing is a result of people not feeling that agency not feeling like this this like the ability that you say to manifest your reality through the practice of certain principles it feels like that we're having a sort of an externally imposed nihilism that you can't influence reality but you can't impact reality these swathes of disillusioned disenfranchised dismissed people it just but but the same thing comes if if there isn't something sacred that is above you and so what tends to happen is that in is that we locate the sacred in and of ourselves and that is insufficient by virtue of what he just laid out there must be something above you you cannot be your own saviour and Lord you cannot be your own God you are not capable of that I don't let the coffee break ladies out the cut to me when you were talking just then I think you can influence reality that's what I've decided it's too weird other doesn't make any sense otherwise it's the simplest explanation called agency we all know that so when is your when is that book coming out Russell I think it's in March which probably might be so far into the future as not to exist in this sort of social space that we currently occupying so that's why I think this is probably January early February that they're doing that so in March how long have you worked on it I worked in it for a couple of years of like leading up to and during the pandemic do we still have March is March still a thing are there do we have equinoxes now or equine I what is reality now well hopefully we'll return to something more approximating normal reality when this pandemic ceases to exist God willing I'm so happy I'm so happy to see you looking so well and to see you both together as a family to father and a daughter and it's very comforting for me as a father of two daughters to see you working together well and to sit and to see so many of the principles that you have espoused and beautifully articulated and manifesting in you Michaela it's a real privilege to meet you both thank you thank you Russell Brand very good to see you again Russell I forget to see you I've got your email I'll be in touch I've got both your emails you have a you have a remarkable capacity to to dig into things thank you thank you very much that's a beautiful compliment from you yeah well it's quite striking I remember the last couple of times we spoke I was struck exactly the same way is that you have a very fast mind and it goes very it goes down a long ways thank you thank you very much that's a wonderful compliment we faith but we're earlier in the day and I made the giddy life choices to have children my 20s I would stay up now with pornography on another screen and cocaine on the back of my hand chatting into the long hours but perhaps if those were the choices I made I wouldn't find myself in this esteemed company well have a good night no yeah have a good night good night beautiful conversation so yeah so there's another half hour of Jordan and Michaela and we'll see if I do commentary on that I'm this is like a holy week for me and I always try to take a day with my wife this week if I can because for some reason the California the Sacramento Unified School District always takes this week for their spring break and it's like doesn't help me and my wife because I've got a busy week and she's got off so maybe we'll maybe we'll take a little day trip tomorrow I've got the conversation I did with Rafe Kelly which will which is coming up and that's already on his channel that was a terrific conversation I have another conversation with a small podcaster who's a it's got a small podcast he's a student at Trinity Seminary and that was a great conversation so those will come through the channel at some point but I wanted to get these these commentary videos out fairly quickly because that's that's usually the best way to do it so thanks for watching leave a comment
