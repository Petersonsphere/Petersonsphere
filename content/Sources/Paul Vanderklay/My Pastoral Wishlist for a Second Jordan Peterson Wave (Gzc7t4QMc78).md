 Hi, this is Paul. This morning on Twitter someone sent me a list of tweets, we're connected with other tweets, you know how Twitter works. Someone responding to a drawing of Michaela Astride Wall Street bull, something like linkage to the book of Revelation, kind of selectively cropped the photo so that Michaela's Instagram comment underneath was just that she thought this was kind of funny. But it kind of launched the Jordan Peterson is a grifter, Jordan Peterson is a hater, blah blah blah blah blah. And then the small account, which is now locked, tweeted out, hate to break it to y'all, but Jordan's not coming back. It seems likely he and his family stepped into something that most of us only fearfully speculate and theorize about. There's a degree of truth to that. And usually if just as a very small account, been around a while, it looked like nothing, you know, no reason to believe that this person had any insider information about Jordan or anything like that. But it's interesting how when you speak a certain, when you speak to something that's out there in the zeitgeist, how it gets picked up. And that's just the way groups of people are. And I think in some ways, for the number of people for whom Peterson really shook up their world and helped them and improve their world, this tweet just spoke to their fear. Jordan's not coming back. He's not coming back from this. Now the court of public opinion again is always the court of public opinion. Jordan Peterson is a hater. Jordan Peterson is a grifter. He's in it for money. This tweet showed up in one of the streams that was around this. Peterson never believed any of it. That's why he was selling it. Truth is free. Look at his past work at the UN, his massive collection of communist art, his daughter and his own condition for the efficacy of his self-help. I look at these things and they don't ring true to me. Everything I saw from Peterson, whether agree or disagree with his actions or his statements, never struck me as a grifter at all. I don't begrudge him the money he made. No one forced anyone to buy his books or to support him on Patreon. It just didn't strike me as deceptive. My read has always been that he's sincere and the center of his mission was to help individuals. He was a clinical psychologist that was part of, you know, he's had an interesting mix of things that he's done over his life and if anything he seemed sincere that he really wanted to help individual people and that came through again and again in just multiple conversations that I've had with people. I've had just by virtue of having this little YouTube channel, I've had lots of conversations with a lot of individuals that had known him before he hit it big. You know, just listen to Jonathan Peugeot. Jonathan Peugeot is a stand-up guy. I've not seen anything. Again, with people's ideas and opinions, go ahead and feel free to debate or vary, but I've never seen anything but honesty coming out of Jonathan Peugeot and Jonathan knew him before all this craziness and again when my sister died unexpectedly, Jordan sent me a note, just a little note. Jordan did not have to do that. The little section of my channel is nothing compared to the numbers of people that follow Jordan Peterson. I remember when his book tour came to Sacramento, a bunch of us from the Meetup went and you know 3,000 people go to the event and our little Meetup has usually a couple of dozen people and maybe you know a couple hundred people on the mailing list, but Jordan Peterson did not need to take time out to send me a condolence note about the death of my sister. That's not the act of a grifter. I'm not that important to Jordan Peterson's business future. There'd be no IDW if not for Jordan. I'm convinced of that. Not to take anything away from any of the other individuals. Many of them have their own solid careers and missions as it were in their own right, but you know Sam is in some ways the biggest name. Sam Harris, Joe Rogan of course, maybe bigger name, but they do different things. Ben Shapiro has his politics. A bunch of the other individuals, they'd be you know minor Twitter celebrities with you know followers in the hundreds of thousands perhaps, which is a really big deal, but there'd be no IDW if not for Jordan. In 2017-2018 there was real buzz around him you know to have what David Brooks say about Jordan, what he did, and just Sid Helema in my denomination. I did a couple of conversations with a director of the office of faith formation. He was a university professor at at Dort College and at now Dort University and now at not Regent, but Redeemer University in the Toronto area and working for the denomination. You know when I talked to Sid and in a lot of ways a lot of Sid's own ideas you know further to the left of me in the denomination in some ways, you know Sid had nothing to gain, had a lot to lose in fact by saying the kinds of things about Jordan Peterson that he did. And Sid is a man of in my opinion of utmost integrity and Sid talked about going to a Jordan Peterson event in Toronto and just the buzz that was there with Toronto or Western Michigan, I don't remember, but you know that was my experience as well and that was a significant wave, that was a significant moment in the culture. Whether it will have lasting impact, I suspect it will and the book tour was remarkable. You know I complain about the due thought decadence of it, a little too repetitious. There were some issues there in terms of you know some things that Dave Rubin would often open it in a way to get the crowd going in some ways that I thought weren't best in the, weren't best for the movement, but we've all got our own opinions. The biblical series changed lives. I remember when I was preparing for the Australia talks that I gave and recognizing how many of the conversations that I had gone through and how many people testified to the improvement of their lives watching those videos and again you call him a grifter. He gave those videos away free on YouTube, didn't monetize them and in the early days YouTube would have easily allowed him to monetize them and that could have been a significant source of income. Didn't monetize them, let all of the little clip people do their things. Now again in hindsight you might say well all of that you know just added to his popularity but you know no way to know that and so you know the grifter thing just never has really stuck with me. We're getting a little far away from it now that there's enough of a fear of some hagiography going on that that we romanticize the moment and romanticize it but it was a really big deal and there today and this has been a theme in a number of my videos I've been spending more time looking at Eric Weinstein's work and Brett Weinstein's work, Eric's particularly lately as he's really upped his visibility and and I think has his his portal podcast is is doing some significant work and I've you know some of the some of the more recent episodes particularly with Ross Dalfett and JD Vance I thought have been have been really quite good and there's I haven't listened to all of them yet there's some other ones with some names I didn't recognize but there remains a gap in terms of what I would say would be the spiritual aspect of the Jordan Peterson moment. Shapiro is too political I just when Ben Shapiro talks the politics it's it's hard to divorce him sufficiently from the politics just in terms of the way that that he's created his public persona you know could Bishop Barron step into that gap Bishop Barron has high status he's certainly got the the academic and the intellectual chops but he's you know you look at someone like Jonathan Haidt too Jonathan Haidt you know deep deep respect for Jonathan Haidt and more I think Jonathan Haidt does better than any of the members of the IDW in terms of talking as a non-religious person respectfully about religion but you know Bishop Barron's got his niche and Jonathan Haidt has has his niche and it was it was the the willingness the willingness to go a bit off the reservation that let Peterson do what he does and again Eric is doing some of that but I don't see Eric really filling those shoes. Jordan Peterson outside the church didn't scare away skeptics but unsettled other skeptics in just the right way and that mixture I don't know if we'll find in anybody else and so I think that's why this tweet just you know really grabbed a bunch of people sort of in the gut and that's why it struck a nerve and I often talk about the first Jordan Peterson wave from Bill 16 October 2016 to really summer 2019 when the you know the resolution of his of the at least the the emergency over his wife's medical condition and then the attempt to withdraw from this drug himself so we're in the trough right now and might there be a second wave maybe this time the time is different I mean October 2016 you know that was coinciding with the with the with the election of Donald Trump and the election of Donald Trump whatever you think of his presidency whatever you think of Donald Trump that was a pretty significant moment for the I think the the left that imagined we had arrived at the end of history and the election of Donald Trump basically signaled no we don't know the future yes the future is going to be far scarier than than we can imagine and it'll be interesting looking back on the Donald Trump presidency with a few decades right now a lot of my videos I'm paying much more attention to the Cold War and the Cold War is getting sufficiently in our rear view mirror that maybe now we can gain some perspective on it and the the last video the video that I put out yesterday the unnecessary pastor of the IDW video Julian made I thought a really insightful comment on that video so I pinned it to the top of the video about we are we're only now I think in some ways really beginning to appreciate what happened in the Cold War with respect to how we used God the idea of God Christianity and the role that it played which in some ways set up the counterculture in the 60s and those of you who saw my conversation with Tom Holland I'm very excited for Tom Holland to do some work in that area and I've been I've just always got so many books that I'm I'm working on right now but but these are a lot of the things that are going through my mind you know I'm finding Eric a lot of fun right now and helpful in terms of what he's doing but I really don't think he will be able to do what Jordan did so I decided to kind of make a open letter video of pastoral advice to Jordan Peterson I don't know that Jordan will see it the only video that I I know Jordan saw or at least paid any attention to was the one I did on The Office that was fairly early on he tweeted it out and Jordan Peterson that's where I learned that the different social medias are really silos just because if you get tweeted on one thing doesn't mean a video is necessarily going to get a a big jump so I I thought I know again whether or not Jordan sees this I have no inside information I don't have a personal relationship with Jordan I want to say that off the bat I know because I've done a lot of videos about him and you know shaking his hand at some of these events and you know had some brief inter very very brief correspondence and and interchanges with him in most cases nothing longer than a tweet or two so I have no inside information about his health or what he's working on or anything like that I want to say that all up front so that nobody tries to read anything into this because there's there's nothing I'm working on except what is publicly available out there in terms of his videos and just the conversation on Twitter and on the Discord server and so on and so forth because usually when something's out people run it to me quickly so I can take a look at it so this is an open pastoral letter of sorts and again as to as to Jordan I've got nothing but every time I shake his hands I'd say thank you because his work and the work he stirred up the communities he stirred up gave me nothing but opportunity and over the last few years have provided for me some of the richest learning communities I could ever want and the bridges of meaning Discord server the comment section in my YouTube channel the local meetups the correspondence that I'm sent I've just been richly deeply blessed by what Jordan stirred up and the kinds of people that I've come into contact with so what Jordan Peterson has done for me has been nothing but blessing and for this I owe him a debt of thanks and appreciation that doesn't mean I don't critique his ideas or some of his decisions or what he does and you'll hear some of that critique in this open pastoral letter but that's how I feel about it and you know if you do stuff on YouTube or Twitter or any place on social media you're before the court of public opinion and people have their ideas so first piece of advice take all the time you need to get well just take your time no rush to get back wave number one made him financially secure as in in as what Rogan and Eric Weinstein calls his fu money he seems to be a guy on the thrifty side of things anyway for the most part spend time with your family get lots of rest figure out a stable sustainable diet exercise find some good doctors that you trust and just get just get physically well and of course Jordan over the years has been nothing but transparent about his own struggles with immune deficiency with you know mood disorders and the like so Jordan just Jordan is a year older than I am just just do what you can to get well and take care of your wife who it seems quite clear to me you deeply love and your children and your I think he's got one grandchild and the friends around you take time to to value these people in your life and then as you know strength permits get back into a reliable flow state mix what I mean about that if you if you do the kind of work that that has a lot of mental stuff you over the years you begin to learn kind of the mix of habits you need to do it as a pastor I've learned this too too much time in the office or too much time just talking with people or I are you know I need a mix of all the various elements to really stay healthy and productive everybody has their own mix some are more bent towards being bookworms some need the right mixture of practitioner reflector and you know I know it would be really hard for him to once again take on clients but and I don't know what would be good for him but the right atmosphere the right mixtures the right conversational partners you know a lot of Jordan's work he did you know with graduate students and maybe that's a piece of it I don't know does he need a university setting hire staff hire the staff you need I mean again he's he should be able to he should have the income stream sufficient to you know hire the staff that he needs and you know don't use family too much it's it's difficult working professionally if the people around you are your family members that have kind of been co-opted into more professional tasks so again it's just my opinion I don't I don't know finish that 12 rules for life sequel maybe call it 12 rules for death that was brought up I think it was Joey's idea or someone's idea in the the local meetup now you can't use it I guess perhaps but don't be decadent in the do thoughts in the doubt that sense of decadence use the trough use what you learned in the trough part of what made 12 rules really work I think was you know particularly the last sections of the book where he was quite open and transparent about a father dealing with the medical situation of his daughter you know the more Jordan reaches into his own life generally and his own life experience the better his anecdotes the better the storyteller you know again a lot of this stuff came through in his videos his maps of meaning videos a lot of the stuff before c16 so get the marketers off your back you know these people will use him and they will spend him to make money off him so you know get it get the right publicist who will manage that so I mean Jordan is still in his 50s a relatively young man he needs to be thinking about the next 10 to 20 years of his career and at this age that means something sustainable something something that can work over the long time not a not a quick money grab do a reasonable book tour next time that's probably really a book tour the last one was sort of a evangelist to crusade cult of personality that was marred by sort of the suck of American political stuff going on and I think the decadence of the marketers it would be it would be very difficult to do but figure out figure out how to how to balance what to say yes to what to say no to and and maybe he's the kind of guy that needs the crowd in a sustainable way so figure out how to get that in a sustainable way you know let a book tour be a book tour if you're going to do something else creative that involves touring make it sustainable and be anti-grift one of the one of the real question marks that came up in wave one was this um mba with the acton school of business and you know someone I had spoken to a couple of times had been one of the fellows and you know they were promised all of this facetime and close working with Jordan and it pretty quickly seemed like that was never really in the cards Jordan Jordan's gonna have to sit down and because of the amounts of demands on him and his age make an assessment of where his priorities should be and he's probably gonna need someone to walk you know someone he really trusts to sit down and talk that through and then I'll get to my last point when I get there but um be careful about money making enterprises that that wish to use your name or sell your attention we've all got 24 hours in a day we've all got to sleep we've all got to eat we've all got to maintain our relationships with our loved ones um one person can only go so far figure out the balance figure out the mixes you know and he's he sets a high standard tell the truth or at least don't lie um in some ways a lot of his credibility is based on him you know being anti-grift with a lot of these things hold um hard as it is hold space at a status level like his hard as it is hold space for the randos and you know lots of stories of people who'd come up to him and want to shake his hand on the street in Toronto or when he'd go on tour you know the guy got seriously famous and again all the stories that would come back to me were that he was nothing but generous and gracious with his time um to a certain degree you get it hit a level of status you got to figure out how to manage that even the pastors of small churches have to figure out how to manage these things so be anti-grift this is the book you should really be working on the sequel to maps of meaning because that is really more the seminal work of his and um i think if jordan's going to make ongoing contributions he's got to in that sense get back to the get back to the center get back to the heart of what he cares about um where his deep anxieties are and work on those things find the right platform to talk it through you know if you watch his lectures it's clear he used university classrooms and um used the university setting to to do some of his work that was the context um you know find the right school that can negotiate he's in the negotiation that can negotiate the right mix after you figure out what the mix is um i i would recommend looking at small religious colleges frankly why number one because um well first of all probably any any small religious college it'll be complicated at a religious school because most religious schools have some degree of confessional requirements on someone so maybe you'll be an adjunct prof or a visiting prof or something like that and it seemed he wanted to do something like that at cambridge and it's really a shame that in some ways that that fell through because i i don't know i wouldn't be surprised if he needs everybody needs a context in which to in which to work and i'm not sure just being a celebrity is a healthy one and so for me um you know being a pastor of a local church keeps me real and to you right was the bishop of durham bishop baron is a is a roman catholic bishop with a with a special calling um find the right context and i think one of the one of the things about religious universities is that they have a certain degree of bias towards classics by virtue if they're the right religious university by virtue of virtue of of their religious commitments and i think especially today when so many are throwing away the classics finding the right small religious college might in fact be a good place reboot the biblical series um asin talib has he's talked at google a couple of a couple of times but his talk i remember which one it was it might have been on black swan ask them you know if you want to do if you want to do a work and have that endure what should you talk about talib basically said you should talk about the oldest thing possible that's a brilliant insight that talib made and i think part of what made the biblical series so important was that dynamic the world's most published book the broadest book possible one of the oldest books possible the bible has proven for many people to be a continual source of refreshment um whether it however they regard the book itself whether they regard it with more of a religious or less of a religious perspective one human life is too small a pool to draw from draw from deeper wells you won't exhaust the bible you can't wear it out um people you can wear other people out but you can't wear the bible out and so you know all of these books behind me all biblical commentaries the most read the most critique the most analyzed book in all of human history um you're not going to wear it out find the right setting to give them you know the first round was in the in the bettor theater in university of toronto maybe that's the right center i mean george's gonna have to figure all these things out but um let the masses come to you i suppose you could do a tour of the biblical series but again you've got to think all these things through in terms of the the main thing is that it seems kind of interesting in retrospect but jordan peter not jordan peterson bill hybels wrote a very interesting book on leadership bill hybels pastor of willow creek church in schaumburg illinois wrote a very interesting book on leadership and one of the points in that book was um he said that you know the pastor should spend 75 percent of their time on uh personal or on personal leadership what does that mean um you yourself are the tool you are using if you were a master guitarist you would spend a lot of time making sure that your main instruments were in tip-top shape you are your main instrument that's what you've got to use so set your priorities get yourself in a good place and then do it i wouldn't be a pastor if i didn't tell him to go to church but do so quietly i think you know after two plus years of thinking about this and especially the last video i just made you know it's okay to keep your answer to the believe in god question i think it's um the answer invites it's it's a kind of a nice riddle and invites people into um a little bit deeper questions about who or what is god what do we mean by that word how are we using it that kind of that kind of frustration and dissonance i think can deepen conversations uh be careful not to bless any specific tradition until unless you have to or unless you want to but again part of peterson's appeal was um you know he at least had bona fides in terms of his his skepticism the problem with being part of of one particular tradition which is what i have as a ordained minister in the christian reform dutch reform tradition um bishop baron has and being a roman catholic bishop uh you'll invite hundreds and or thousands of years of ecumenical drama people often want to challenge me on some of the certain aspects of calvinism which i don't find particularly germane necessarily to the conversations i wish to pursue that's the liability of being wedded to a tradition so go to church quietly um figure out how to do that um build relationships in a real community of people who are trying to embody jesus that's what that's what going to church is actually all about now reboot the question and answers why it's a good form for his rambling roaming answers it's a good place to hold space for the randos in his following it it keeps contact with people outside the status distortion field um hierarchy status binds and blinds and you know it sounds strange but even being a gringo living in a very poor area of the Dominican Republic i think Shelly from the um discord server would know exactly what i'm talking about she lives in a poor community and uh or she was living in a poor community in a west african nation you become sort of a minor celebrity and the regular rules don't apply to you and it makes it difficult to sort of get unvarnished opinions because we whenever we interact with someone with whom there's a status differential um we can't help but have opportunities and liabilities distort the interaction so that makes it very difficult to to maintain relationships and keep an open door to randos and people who um want to talk so you know do reboot the question and answer i think i think i thought that those were those are really good i thought it was a good good use of a couple of hours a month and i know some people want me to start doing it i might we'll see i haven't quite figured out how exactly i want to do it go back to the interesting conversation segment of your channel um you've got a lot of status to so that you can reach a lot of interesting people um diversify the selection um have high and low status people whoever you know i usually whoever you find interesting um he's he's got let he's got a level of status now or the the way the interview game is played is that you keep try to reach for higher names so that you can sort of work your way up the ladder status-wise um you know whereas i have spoken with some people with you know slightly higher status on my channel and and a lot of people say paul you should talk to this person you should talk to that person i've been pretty reluctant to just grab for high status people unless i've had an opportunity to get to know their work and um usually there's a real reason for me to want to talk to them other than their status so that i'm not just climbing a ladder and well someone might say yeah but that keeps the status of your channel low yeah it's not a bad thing that's a good thing um think about the incarnation of jesus um went from the highest status you could imagine down to the low and there's something deeply christian about that whole movement um do your homework on the biggies and i think jordan almost always does that at one point i was you know really trying to facilitate him talking to nt wright and jordan had nt's books and nt wright would have to be read maps of meaning which not a small book uh jordan would have to read about 30 times more to read nt wright's work nt wright is an astoundingly prolific that conversation never happened that's lamentable um could be an interesting conversation pick a few repeaters to build long-term conversational duets i don't know that sam harris is the right guy but um you know pick a few people not not just you know rogan and rubin who have their own shows i mean you need you need that thing too but you know jordan has high enough status that pick a few long-term repeaters i mean bishop baron could be a could be an excellent choice as someone who's you know got high status come back and have conversations with because you know again baron's a baron's a seriously legitimate um individual use wise counselors there's a lot of talk about this in kind of the the heading up the wave that that you know other people were speaking into jordan's life and and checking him and all that talk kind of stopped and i i wonder if all that talk stopped because again it just became too much and the wave got too big and i mean who who who's going to be able to coach you on something like that because so few people have had an experience like his but he's going to need people around him again whose advice he really trusts who are wise and um mature who can speak into it they don't always have the right answer but if you listen to them you'll learn from them discipline pacing people you trust that have access to your life and here indispensable we all need each other and of course my last point follow jesus well jordan's relationship with christianity is ambiguous um but jordan has said a number of things you know christ by definition is the best that a man can be um his you know some people you know talked about him doing exodus esther says he should jump to the gospels that would be very interesting it's a you know esther's are very sharp cookie so um she's worth listening to um he is um you know jesus is the archdio at least this is jordan's framing of course for me is the son of god um jesus is the archetype of the ideal human being so be his student and do what he says to do and follow that land wherever he goes so that's it that's my bit of pastoral advice for jordan whether he hears it or not and maybe for those who are sort of following along with with you know the jordan story and for those for whom a tweet like this even completely regardless of the of the source of the tweet or the person of the tweet kind of kind of grabs you this video is for you
