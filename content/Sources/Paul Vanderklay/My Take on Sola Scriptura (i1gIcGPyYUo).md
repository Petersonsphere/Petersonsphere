 Last October was the Protestant world celebrated the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. They marked the beginning of the Reformation with Martin Luther nailing the 95 theses on the door of the Wittenberg Church. And so a lot of Protestant churches celebrated that by, a lot of Protestant pastors celebrated that by doing a sermon series on the five solas and I didn't do one. I'm a little bit of a contrarian and it's like well if everybody else is doing it I don't feel like doing it. But then some of the lovely members of my church came and said well we think we should hear some of this and I thought about okay. So I wanted to get through Advent which we did and so now we're into the new year so I thought I'd do a little sermon series on the five solas. Now it's really helpful to recognize that the solas don't actually come from the Reformation period. They come from the 20th century and it's 20th century theologians and historians looking back on the Reformation and asking themselves what really was this this conflict about and what really energized the split of the church, at least the church in the West because the church in the West had already split from the church in the East. And so it really energized this and along the way these these three solas became five solas and that's that's what we know of the five solas. Now I'm going to talk about sola scriptura and this this really comes from Martin Luther and there's a famous Martin had his audience before the Emperor in Worms, Germany and I like to call it a diet of worms because the little boy in me thinks that sounds fun. But Martin Luther you know was was called to account for his writings before the Emperor and charges were being laid on him and these charges would very much could very much have cost him his life. And so here all of his books are are accumulated and and Eck asks him you know can you will you recount all of this and Luther the first day kind of kind of punts and says well there's a lot of things there you want me to recount everything and I need a I need a night to sleep on it so then he comes back and and they're like well you know it's not all of the things and and they go back and forth but but what it really came down to for Luther is a question of conscience and scripture and and so this is where you get this this famous saying even if it you might not have said it well we'll find out. Luther replied since then your majesty and your lordship desires a simple reply I will answer without horns and without teeth unless I am convicted by scripture and plain reason I do not accept the authority of popes and councils for they have contradicted each other. My conscience is captive to the word of God I cannot and will not recant anything for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. God help me amen. The earliest printed version added the words here I stand I can do I can do I cannot do otherwise. The words though not recorded on the spot may nevertheless be genuine because the listeners at the moment may have been too moved to write. Wow now now this then becomes the impetus of sola scriptura now it's helpful to see right away there that unless I am convicted by scripture and plain reason well that's an interesting addition and and also you have to factor conscience into the mix and to be fair this is the previous page in the same in the same narrative this is Eck talking to to Martin. Martin how can you assure how can you assume that you are the only one to understand the sense of scripture you put your judgment above that of so many famous men and claim that you know more than that than than they all you have no right to call into question the most holy orthodox faith instituted by Christ the perfect lawgiver proclaimed throughout the world by the Apostles sealed by the red blood of the martyrs confirmed by the sacred councils defined by the church in which all our fathers believed until death and gave to us an inheritance and which now we are forbidden by the Pope and the Emperor to discuss lest there be no end of the debate now at had a point and I think that point has been recognized it's not that Protestants are are kind of living in a cloud and don't understand the objection or both sides of this argument in fact a very accomplished Protestant scholar Alistair McGrath wrote a terrific book Christianity's Dangerous Idea where he notes that yeah one person with the Bible can bring a whole lot of stuff in fact a number of the a number of the sects in America that grew up in the 19th century out of what was called the burned over region you think of the the Latter-day Saints movement you think of the Jehovah's Witnesses all of these movements grew out of one person with their plain reason reading the Bible and this is what they believe and so off they go and so Sola Scriptura sounds especially when combined with conscience because that's kind of implicit in the idea seems seems like a dangerous idea and and that's what that's what McGrath goes into now I've been working on some of this stuff because some of the other videos I've been doing I mean kind of what you had was medieval Christianity you know it's kind of rumbling rumbling rumbling along but there's a lot of tensions beneath the surface and so you have this monk who is is very devout he's got a tender conscience he's concerned for his soul and of course as a monk what he starts doing and as a very bright monk what he starts doing is studying the Bible with all the new tools that that Renaissance humanism has been has been offering so he's he's studying the New Testament in in Greek and you know he's he's in a sense dialoguing with Erasmus the great Roman Catholic scholar and and you know he hits this crisis and then he's got these complaints and so he nails them to the wall for discussion he nails them to the wall in Latin and and he's just he's wanting to have a good academic discussion like an Acum edition does but but what he does is he unleashes stuff that's that's there in the in the community in Germany and you know people begin to realize this stuff is getting talked about and the the normal way of dealing with this is kind of suppress the man but Luther also kind of had a personality where boy if you lean on him and you push him he's gonna push back and so they pushed him and he pushed back and they pushed him and he pushed back and this just keeps going and it gets to the point that that it all boils down into a moment where in a sense the church is saying bow to our authority or or else or you'll be burned at the stake and and Luther is gets to the point of saying I don't care what you do to me I believe what I believe and and for me this is existential and I will not back down and and it becomes solidified into this very binary question is is our absolute is the absolute foundation of the church the authority of the institution or does it rest somehow on the reading of the Bible and and this then kind of becomes one of the elements that explodes into the Protestant Reformation but now Luther I think had hoped that his vision of reading the scripture would prevail but but what happens is in fact not unlike what EC and the church had predicted which happened would happen which would be this this explosion of ideas and these diversities of opinions and this then leads to to these these political conflicts because religion and politics are are quite merged and so you have these these terrible wars in Europe and so you know after a hundred years of these wars people are starting to say well we can't be killing each other over this we need a new foundation for knowledge and then and then things kind of split in philosophy between rationalism which is kind of a you know and an approach from pure reason and logic it's kind of up in the cloud then you have empiricism which is below which is kind of well I I believe what I see and I'll build up from knowledge and this all continues to to tumble through the the European the European project and culminates in a sense with Nietzsche's death of God now now this this has continued obviously on until the 21st century and and so all you have to do is go to the internet and go to YouTube and you discover that you know the Bible isn't the only source of our divisions it's not just people who have given up on the on the church that have differing opinions and one of the fun examples I ran into this week was this one guy here part of the the MGTOW men going their own way movement has explained to us how marriage is a waste of time money and energy and so he's he's against marriage and here you have this woman from the the feminist side saying that marriage is an oppressive institution against women and no no honorable feminist could embrace the institution of marriage and so here you have this classic debate and and the difficulty that rationalism and empiricism had was neither they too could neither bring uniformity and bring agreement it's it's almost to the degree that to be a human being is to be disagreeable and so we disagree now Christian Smith who is a sociologist who is now teaching at Notre Dame I think wrote a very good book called the Bible Made Impossible where he wrestles with this pervasive interpretive pluralism that you know that that we've had that we've seen since the Reformation I think an important point here is is that pervasive interpretive pluralism in fact predates the Reformation you can read you know differences you can read religious battles all the way into Paul going into the synagogue and reasoning from the scriptures that that this resurrected Jesus Christ is the Son of God and of course if you read the book of Acts you find that this sparks tremendous debate in the synagogues and sometimes these debates get bloody and and Paul would get beat up or stoned or thrown out throw out of town and so so there's nothing new to religious division this isn't an invention of the Protestant Reformation I'd say this is a this is a function of human beings but but that then leads us back to the question of the Bible and the question is is the Bible a worthwhile platform for the conversation and and I think okay well well how might you answer that question now obviously if you someone who believes in the Bible you would answer that question from the Bible but if you're not someone who believes in the Bible I would suggest that you might answer the question by just looking at evidence in world history the Bible is the most the Bible is the most translated printed studied debated book in all of human history and if you look at Guinness Book of World Records I mean it's not even close you know if they're looking around perhaps for a a second book it's reported that 800 million copies of the red-covered booklet quotations from the works of of Mao Zedong you know is perhaps second to the Bible but as we might imagine you know even that book has probably fallen out of favor now just not so long after its its printing in 1966 which which makes you realize just what how potent the Bible has been now you might say well that's because of colonialism in Western Europe but you know that's that's not entirely where did this slide go okay but that's not in try see this is I'm gonna move slides around a little bit here pause see I told you this was editing so so you might you might make the argument that that well it's only because of colonialism and and all these other reasons that the Bible is draws so much our attention and there are plenty of other wonderful texts and there are lots of very popular religious texts but but again my argument is is nothing even comes close to the Bible and and you might say well that's a function of of of white imperialism in the colonial world well I don't think that stands up to to the facts either this little diagram on the one side shows how the in a sense the the center of Christian gravity unlike the other major religions has continued to move through the history of the world and and what what's so amazing about the Bible is that it gets translated and put into people's hands and people start doing new things with it in fact people start doing things with it that that others thought well you can't do with it and and now on one hand that's an issue because of pervasive interpretive pluralism where where people get all kinds of crazy ideas from the Bible and and someone who is in touch with the roots of the Bible and can study it well would say okay well but but those are really crazy ideas and those don't belong but on the second on the other hand you've also got the pushback that well even amongst those people who who know Hebrew and Greek and are are scholars of the Old and New Testament well they have plenty of beliefs and they have plenty of perspectives and and so in fact what what I would argue is that the Bible itself when it gets into the hands of people and we see we're seeing this currently in Africa and Asia and you know Wycliffe translators go out into into jungles of people who who don't even have a literate society and they you know for the first time help them record their language and bring them written language and then put the Bible in their hand and and these people begin to read this book and they connect with it and that's just a rather incredible thing and and so what I would argue is that diversity and in variation in fact hold together they need a narrative thread to hold that together and things kind of wobble on both sides but how the Bible actually functions in the history you know now especially since the since the Christian era how the Bible functions is that it kind of hold you've got tremendous versity diversity intention but it kind of holds it together and and I think that the most compelling and universal way that we can understand our existence is is by seeing meaning within story and and I think in fact that your story as can seen only by God because there's the the me I know myself to be then there's the me that people close to me see myself as being which is in some ways more accurate than the me I see myself to be and and but less accurate in terms of me from another perspective and every perspective on me adds another dimension of me which usually has some distortion and bias but but often also an element of truth and then you begin to ask well well who could possibly see me for who I truly am and I think the only reasonable answer to that would be God and and so and and I think that's in fact the same thing the same way that the Bible functions in terms of what what can actually keep the narrative story together of human history for such a huge diverse group of people and and it comes in the form of this book now part of really what the what the Protestant Reformation was really dealing with was the question of whether a human institution can finally endure and now for the Western Church based in Rome you know they they like to make the argument that here it's kind of a geographic argument that hey we hold Rome we hold the Bishop Rick of Rome and and so we now have the authority but they make that appeal obviously to what to the Bible and and they make that appeal notwithstanding an earlier feud that they had with the Eastern Patriarchs and so you know implicit within the Protestant Reformation are the seeds of this dangerous idea and and then the question is can and another one of the issues that rolls into the Protestant Reformation is that of the Church and that and and the question of can a human institution finally endure and the Protestant Reformation along with Sola Scriptura begins talking about what it calls the invisible church and what it means is that and it's in a sense we see the church from beneath this this we see this human institution which is is fallible and vulnerable and and and all of these things kind of what C.S. Lewis talks about in the screw tape letters in chapter two but but God sees the church from above and the church from above is his bride and and and here we have the question can we from below actually see the church and and the church is in a sense an amphibious organism and and that it's it's both above and below and but institutionally it it doesn't always from below mirror what God sees and what God desires from above now now the the divisions are lamentable but and and we know what God wants for it but this has the above and below dynamic but but again returning to this question of scripture some of the things that Jesus says about it are are truly alarming do not think that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets that would be you know the the old testament I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them he and his person fulfills them for truly I tell you until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will in any way will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished huh that's a dramatic claim and and in in Matthew 24 we get a an equally dramatic claim heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away so what does that mean now now in in the Christian tradition we we associate the incarnate word of God which is Christ with this this book this Bible this this scripture and and again this has this has been you might say well those are only words well okay but it's happening I'm sure there's many people that have stood up on a mountain and said you know well I'm speaking the truth and it will stand forever okay most of them we've forgotten we're still talking about this guy and and we're talking about this guy in the context of this book and it seems that wherever this book goes stuff happens and and and not all of us agree that that we like this stuff or that the stuff is good or that the stuff is even even necessarily in in alignment with the book but but it's going and and Wes Granberg Michelson who was the former general secretary of the Reformed Church in America a sister denomination to my own in his book makes this observation the idea that laid at the heart of the 16th century Reformation which brought Anglicanism and the other Protestant churches into being was that the Bible is capable of being understood by all Christian believers and that they all have the right to interpret it and insist upon their perspectives being taken seriously yet this and and I would think you know I know a lot of these I probably won't put this in the sermon but a lot of these you watching this are Jordan Peterson people well this is at the foundation of freedom of speech really if this powerful affirmation of spiritual democracy ended up unleashing forces that threaten to destabilize the church eventually leading to fissure and the formation of breakaway groups here Peter Michelson is addressing Anglicanism Anglicanism may yet follow the pattern of other Protestant groups and become a family of denominations each with its own reading and applying the Bible that gets into this practice of confessionalism and the Christian Reformed Church is a confessional church and so we take sola scriptura and then we take confessions and we lay them on the top and we use them as as laying our cards before the world and saying these are the filters through which we are reading the Bible and and we are we are more than welcome to engage in conversations with other Christians and non-Christians but these are laying our cards on the table and and this will become this just letting you know these are our positions because people hold lots of them and here Michelson echoes Alastair McGrath the dangerous new idea firmly embedded in the heart of the Protestant revolution was that all Christians have the right to interpret the Bible for themselves now this is not saying all Christians interpret the Bible correctly this is not saying all interpretations of the Bible are equally valid this is not a plea to relativism it is a recognition of the human experience coming to terms with the text but it is also a recognition of the dramatic historical evidence that there is something special about this text and this text ought to be dealt with in a privileged way and within my own traditions laying my Protestant cards on the table the framework for our conversations within what the church should be and become and what rules should govern the church are based on this book we will listen to the tradition of the church we will listen to other believers we will do our best um our best our best work with reason as Martin Luther says we will do our best work with conscience we will take all of this but this book becomes the frame becomes the narrative thread which manages the tensions of diversity and variation this in a sense holds the tension within the conversation and the narrative this becomes for those of you who believe in fandoms this becomes canon which is the word we use for what the Bible is now well how does this work well I see this in the light of this is part of how God brings together the diverse cultures not only the diverse cultures we have now in human history but the diverse cultures throughout in human throughout human history this is where I can meet Augustine this is where I can meet um the apostle John this is where I can meet Martin Luther this is where I can sit down with African Christians and in our own church on Sundays we have our extremely diverse Living Stones congregation we have a group of of Wesleyans from Tonga who use our facility who who worship in their own language and have their own traditions and we have a group of Nigerian Anglicans and and so why would we open our building to these people and I would say it is because of the word of God and part of the Bible and and part of what happened in the American frontier is exactly this and I could put in a quote from from Mark Knoll where when when when the the church moved into the American West they they kind of outpaced the European traditions and so they needed something that they could hold themselves to and this then begins this tradition in this very pluralistic dynamic diverse context of the American frontier of the Bible and this is where this entire language of this is a Bible believing church and in a sense sets out the the what is I think in some ways a sociological marketplace that we've called evangelicalism but to me this this brings in this brings in Richard Mao's observation that that what we find in Isaiah chapter 60 is is this vision of God in a sense seeding the cultures of the world with his word and and this this tradition by Abraham Kuyper another big name in my tradition that says all of these cultures are mine now now they all have elements of brokenness and and they all have sin in them they all are in in a sense marred and contaminated I believe in the doctrine of total depravity which means that everything we do is tainted everything we do is biased everything we do misses the mark completely but God in a sense in the eschatological vision of the world draws all this back to himself arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the Lord rises upon you see darkness covers the earth and thick darkness over the peoples but the Lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn lift up your eyes and look about you all assemble and come to you your sons come from afar your daughters are carried on the hip they will look and be radiant your heart will throb and swell with joy the wealth on the seas will be brought by you to you the riches of the nations will come and and I think when I when I hear this I think about the banquet of the lamb which is this eschatological banquet which celebrates the final culmination of Jesus as Lord over all human history and when I think about the banquet of the lamb I sit down I imagine sitting down at a table where they will be there where they will be Thai food and Chinese food and food from Africa and food from the hills of the Dominican Republic and Dutch chocolate and Dutch cheese because the Dutch do chocolate cheese and divert desserts better than they do some of those other things and and and the the food of the earth will be gathered together and the great banquet of the lamb will look like the smorgasbord of the cultures of the world defined renewed pers perfected but how can that narrative thread be held by one institution no what will hold it together well I think it will be in fact the the the thread of the word of God which which we find in Christ and which our witness to that is in the scriptures but again we might say yeah but but but wait a minute I mean it's it's too dangerous to leave this up to people's consciences and at this point I think we turn and the conversation goes to the Holy Spirit and and to me a story from the Bible that illustrates this best comes from Acts chapter 8 now an angel of the Lord said to Philip now Philip is part of these these new deacons and so right away we have when the the the the Aramaic speaking Galilean apostles of Jesus stay in Jerusalem at the persecution but it's this new group of Greek speaking Greek named diaspora based deacons that become the early evangelists in the book of acts and and Philip is one of them and so an angel of the Lord said to Philip go south to the road the desert road that goes down to Jerusalem from Gaza so he started out and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch an important official in charge of all the treasury of Kandake which means the queen of the Ethiopians this man had gone to Jerusalem to worship and on his way home was sitting on the chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet now what we know because he was a eunuch he couldn't get oh but so far into the temple he can't fully become a Jew because he's been sexually altered by his master the spirit told Philip go to that chariot and stay nearby then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet do you understand what you're reading Philip asked how can I he said unless someone explains it to me well right here we have the word of God so the the Bible the law and the prophets now extended into the Christian world by the New Testament we have the law and the prophets and and this becomes the narrative thread by which this Ethiopian who is excluded by the institution where where he in fact can become a part of it so we invited Philip up to come and sit with him and right away you see both the the the the work of the Holy Spirit bringing Philip there the work of the Holy Spirit moving in this situation but also the testimony of someone who knows something and this is how I pull together well we've got the church fathers and we've got scholars and we've got this diversity of of commentators who all of whom disagree but but this is where we all come together and this is where the conversation happens and the Bible becomes this narrative thread that holds us together this is the passage of scripture the eunuch was reading he was led like a sheep to the slaughter and as a lamb before the shearers is silent so he did not open his mouth in his humiliation he was deprived of justice who can speak of his descendants for this life was taken from the earth and so this eunuch who can have no descendants suddenly relates to this this suffering servant of the Lord from from the book from the book of Isaiah the eunuch asked Philip tell me please who is the prophet talking about himself or someone else then Philip began with that very passage of scripture and told him the good news about Jesus as they were traveling along the road they came some they came to some water and to the end the eunuch said look here is water what can stand in the way of my being baptized and he gave orders to stop the chariot then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him when they came up out of the water the spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away and the eunuch did not see him again but went on his way rejoicing and to me that story pulls it all together where you have the word of God as being revelation to the eunuch but but he needs help in understanding it so the Holy Spirit comes and brings Philip into the picture and and here in this picture we have in a sense the entire framework of how the Bible functions within the entire picture of us coming to the Lord that's running through my sermon and then we will do communion so thanks for listening and if you have feedback and input please put it in
