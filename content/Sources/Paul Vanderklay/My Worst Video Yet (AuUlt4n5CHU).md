 Hi, this is Paul. I'm just gonna do a little video. We'll see how little it is Actually, I was gonna do a little video just on the the teaser that James Fox Higgins published I think yesterday or the day before of his beginning of his conversation with Jonathan Peugeot actually, I had a fruitless run to Costco because I forgot my watch and Got a chance to listen to the whole video which which was really really rather good and James Fox Higgins is a young man who was in a sense brought to Christ by Jordan Peterson and he's he's working this stuff out and Jonathan Peugeot obviously is very well informed and especially in the in the Orthodox tradition Calvinism got bandied about a little bit Calvinism is Calvinism is a very broad thing and Yeah, I'll just leave it there Calvinism is a very broad thing and there are many different kinds of Calvinists and so often the conversation on Calvinism gets reduced to a conversation about the doctrine of election and it's it's important to remember that the doctrine of election is something shared by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church and the Calvinists and The Orthodox as as Jonathan said and that's true. I have my knowledge of Orthodox capital O Orthodox Christianity is is really quite deficient, but I do know enough to know that the Orthodox Navigate that conversation differently and the focus of this video was not Calvinism or not Calvinism or The doctrine of election or no, but but I thought this was a good conversation between the two of them It gets you know gets Jonathan goes into a lot of the kinds of things Jonathan goes into and I thought it was well worth listening the The piece that that I originally wanted to talk about this though was was the question That that keeps coming up should you know is is Peterson a Christian now? Should he? should he Convert should he formally start going to church and Jonathan has some good stories in this video and and I I agree with Jonathan's point in that that Right now if if Jordan Peterson, I'm not I'm not suggesting that he shouldn't Formally be baptized or convert or start going to church someplace. I would as a Christian minister they they take away my They take away my ordination if I would suggest that he he shouldn't convert but the fact that he doesn't associate or identify with any specific congregation or any specific denomination or even his answers with respect to Christianity itself are Ambiguous and in a bunch of my older videos I've I've categorized Peterson as an agnostic as I think that's formally the position he's taking Act as if this is the Peterson's church as if and I'm not gonna Yeah, I'm just gonna that's that's where Peterson's that I'm gonna leave that where it is I don't have any inside information or anything like that. So but but the question of how His association or identification with formally with Christianity or with a specific tradition would impact the Impact it's terrible editing on the EDC's having on the conversation would be important and And I think you know one of the earlier videos I did on Actually Peter this was the first this was the first video of mine that Peterson tweeted On Kind of comparing Jordan Peterson with the office and his his his staying in the middle kind of keeps the tension alive and keeps the romantic tension alive and it may be that that someday in the future he For reasons of his own decides to associate with a church or decides to more formally call himself a Christian And you know with all the delimitations that that would require for him but you know at this point he's he's keeping the conversation alive and the You know, he's bread-pilling people and you know as a Christian minister, I'm fine with that But part of you know, what's what's been going on? I know a lot of people are really excited about Peterson talking to William Craig Evans and the number of people said I should you know do a treatment on that Conversation and maybe I will but but in some ways I See his conversation with with Matt de la hunty a lot like his conversation with William Craig Evans because in many ways both de la hunty and Craig Evans are modernists and and Peterson comes at them as a phenomenological pragmatist and that deeply impacts the Basically how you approach life and I talked about this quite a bit in my last video where I talked about Scott Adams it's almost as if the modernists are Approaching truth like a movie and and truth is something that's that's truth is something that we fundamentally see It's something that's you know, a little bit distant from myself. It's something that's separate from myself Whereas for Peterson truth is is much more active and Reality is not a movie that we're watching but reality is a form for action and you know, there's there's a lot in the Bible about that Jesus for example tells a parable of two sons and And and one one son The father tells the sons go do this and one son says he would and he doesn't and the other son says he wouldn't and he Does and Jesus says okay, which one was obedient and so Christianity has built within itself this bias for action and you can find this Regularly throughout the the parables of Jesus now at the same time Christianity also has a bias for belief but part of what happens in our conversations with respect to this is You know pistis it for example the Greek in the New Testament for this word that usually gets translated Believe is also have faith and I remember early in the ministry I once did some switching and you know I did a lead a Bible study or something and I switched all of believe for have faith in and Switched to the word faith for belief in a in a copy of the Bible that I handed out and and people started getting annoyed because Because it sounded too active. It sounded too it basically sounded too active and with some of the Traditions that have come up especially in Protestantism There then was raised a question of faith versus works and this is a Conversation that regularly comes up within Protestantism Protestantism not so much in The Roman Catholic tradition again. I really have to upgrade my knowledge of the Orthodox tradition the Orthodox Church is a is a is quite a late comer to the American scene and that's really important to remember and It's gonna be very interesting to see what happens to the Orthodox Church in the next hundred years Now that it's it's here in America and it's increasingly having an impact so I'll leave that where it is, but Part of part of the you know, people are always saying why I want Jordan Peterson talk to this person I want Jordan Peterson to talk to that person as I said before neither Peterson nor Dilla huntae have Probably as much time nor should they necessarily make it a priority to study each other's work because they're both They're both moving up these hierarchies. And as I mentioned before Sorry for the pause I had to sneeze as I mentioned before Hierarchies filter as they gain access even even as someone is going up a hierarchy They still only have 24 hours in a day and even if they're adding staff to make themselves more efficient or or adding organizations or institutions to to basically amplify What they're able to do we still only have 24 hours in a day and and that's a limitation we have and As I talked about in my last video I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about consciousness as I'm thinking more about phenomenology and and so when when Peterson talks to Dilla huntae or when Peterson talks to William Craig Evans or Even when Peterson deals with a bunch of these other conversations You know that it's it's remarkably difficult to have a productive conversation and that's That's something that might not be self-evident to a lot of people but as someone who's whose Job it is to have conversations with people conversations are very hard because people are very complicated and the Difficulty goes up when we you know videotape them and have them in front of a lot of people now Now Peterson is a clinical psychologist, so he's having conversations with people all the time I'm a Christian reform minister So I'm having conversations with people all the time if you look at the conversation for example that I had with John Van Sloaton You know we're both of us are you know, very experienced Conversationalists we both knew each other. We have a high degree of commonality in terms of our knowledge our background knowledge Conversations are very very difficult. So a lot of the conflict that I see happening Let's say between someone like Dilla huntae who's who's you know, his whose gig is to you know disprove Christianity and Jordan Peterson who you know how to categorize his gig right now I mean he's he's promoting his view of the world and his view of the world is I think leading to People converting for some very real reasons and I actually rewatched a a video that Jonathan Peugeot has done on a Comment that he got from an atheist and I think there's a lot of gold in that video in terms of understanding Exactly why Jordan Peterson is having the effect he's having and this project that I've been working on my Jordan Peterson project for the last Eight months No, we're getting on to a year now Of listening to his stuff. I think I'm finally beginning to understand bit by bit Kind of the underpinnings of why he's having the effect he's having on people and why after people listen to him They are far more open to Christianity and I think it has everything to do with the Enlightenment and with modernism Now now what's interesting in the conversation with? With Forgot his name James Fox Higgins and Jonathan Peugeot is is that when we get into talking about What happened in the Protestant Church and that history there is a lot going on there in terms of culture and Philosophy and I dealt with some of that in some of my earlier videos I'm probably going to have to revisit it Somebody made a comment that you know why what you seem obsessed with modernity and okay, I probably am because I'm trying to figure it out because it appeared to me at least until the Jordan Peterson Phenomenon and again, this is why I've given it so much attention and this is why I think this is at least in my experience something of major importance Until the Jordan Peterson phenomenon it seemed that Christianity into modernity was a one-way street and and modernists had been for centuries having a corrosive effect on Christianity and and this This gets into lots and lots of areas and And so what I saw in Peterson which I had not see was the possibility of a mass change in this now now this is rather interesting because these categorizes of of modernity and post modernity and traditional And I forget the video I watched of a guy the emergent, you know, this kind of emergent thinking You know, what's after post what's post post modernity so on and so forth Postmodernity so on and so forth. These categories are not These categories are are labels that we're using to try to identify some things, but they're you know, they're they're pretty It's very very difficult for example someone had made the comment that um That that scott adams is not postmodern because post modernity says that you know, we can't know facts and and I think that's true, but There's you could talk about post modernity every time you use one of these labels in some senses You have to define them and by the time you're done defining them You've forgotten what you want to talk about because we're always living in the moment and we're conscious creatures. So In some respects Peterson is very modern and and especially when Peterson picks up this label of being a classical liberal because Classical liberalism is in a sense probably the height of modernity And and so in some senses Peterson is very modern in some other senses. He's got some post modernity in him And in some other ways with his phenomenology You know if as i'm looking at this, you know trying to educate myself more in terms of phenomenology I mean phenomenology is really a response to the failures of modernity to to To actually arrive at certainty and so what tends to happen What I think is happening is that What peterson is doing is Is in a is using the tools of modernity that had proven to be so corrosive to Christianity Those tools themselves are now Now How do you even say this what's happening those tools themselves are now undermining that case against Christianity And and so it isn't it isn't a mystery When you look at the the main lights that peterson is using Why this would be the case? I mean peterson is is focusing on nicha. He's he's focusing on Dostoevsky on kirkagard Um on soljah nitson and And darwin and and so this this is what's happening. And so, you know again i've seen peterson Why do I why am I so interested in peterson? Why am I studying him so hard? Why do I continue to be fascinated in him because I think for the first time what we're seeing from peterson is that There's a door out of modernity Post-modernity And and it's not necessarily through post-modernity, but it's not disconnected from it There's a door door out of modernity that seems to be giving new life To what looks like traditional christian belief And I hadn't really seen that before i've seen reversions from modernity i've seen an attempt at a post-modern Christianity and and as i've said earlier, I think the The element of the culture war that is at work within especially within protestantism and it's significant that The social justice movement within the christian churches is strongest within protestantism within at this point mainline Protestantism that that that is perfect perfectly reasonable If you can i'm not able to articulate all this yet if you can actually follow the thread Um through the reformation into modernity and then into post-modernity there are deep connections between post-modernity and this identitarian this identitarian phase and in a sense this this rigid identitarianism is Is kind of the low-hanging fruit if you've If you've embraced post-modernity and lost all points of orientation And and so then we're starting to default to skin color or to gender or to orientation and all and to and to nationalism and to all these elements of All these elements that are basic and obvious and easy to create groups around and so I think while there's we're seeing both in the main line and this group that's called progressive evangelicals the the attempt to construct a a post-modern Christianity my View of that has been skeptical and it's been skeptical because I see both the progressive evangelicals and the main line Devolving into all of the kinds of Eating themselves in identitarian ways That we're seeing the non-christian um the non-christian post-moderns doing in other words I think there's a self-destructive nature to that That is self-destructive for community And and you know the kind of Again, this is where This is where labels are different because when I talk about the liberal Church i'm not meaning the same as classical liberalism that there are deep connections between them but when we talk about the liberal church, we're talking about the main line church and we're talking about the the threat of skepticism and the attempts at The attempts at addressing the break apart of christianity That happened in the reformation and I don't mean that ecclesiastically. I mean that um in terms of the epistemology Be as i've as i've gone in before After you know as as europe was destroying itself over the reformation there became a a crisis of authority with respect to texts and And so the movement was to try to find certainty and therefore community because I think generally speaking The search for certainty is also a search for community and we see that deeply in science and technology but but this this search that is happening is is so, but basically what happened was the Darwin Um changes in assumptions about history uh rachel brown Made some some really good comments. I watched the conversation between jonathan. Jonathan pizot and rachel brown there are some really good elements in that conversation too where so both of both of them are medievalists and In the medieval period there was this Multi-vocal reading of the text you could have the symbolic element of the text more the literal element of the text You had all of these symbolic elements of the text and what happens in the reformation is that You know, basically the reformation takes a hammer to all of this now I'm a christian reform pastor So I got to be careful about the reformation when from a very young age when you hear reformation you learn to salute um, but and and i'm not going to say that the that I'm not going to say that the reformation was unwarranted What what luther tried to do was? Was reform the church and so the church pushed back on luther and luther was in some ways Had a personality like jordan peterson if you pushed martin luther He's going to push back and and martin luther could push back hard and there was a lot of pent-up stuff In in in the political world in the economic world in the philosophical world in the religious world That was waiting to be catalyzed And everything was right where where luther was and and who shit hit and and that's telling because if you look at the places where The protestant reformation dug in and the places where it didn't get traction or it was destroyed And so then you look at france and of course john calvin was a french refugee who fled to switzerland Who you know set up shop in geneva and started writing things and if you look at where? A lot of the reformed churches grew you can look at the switzerland and who okay? Uh jung's father was a swiss reformed pastor and you look at the netherlands where my tradition comes from again a place of a place of tolerance well And there's a long long complicated complicated history in there but So this multi-vocal Reading of the text that happened in the middle ages all through the middle ages and and very very early on You know it started in the um started in the church fathers you can find it in origin and on from there well, the reformers the reformers saw that as splitting apart the world in some ways and and they were looking for certainty and And they were looking for they were looking to to base their authority on the text Not on the institution of the church which was seen as corrupt and let's get luther as due There was a lot of corruption in the roman church and so You know on and on and on and on That's a tremendously important history. It's a tremendously involved history but That very much gets into why? peterson is Changing the conversation and it's also the reason why peterson when he sits down with matt della honte and when they haven't studied each other The conversation just isn't terribly productive That's going to be very interesting to see the conversation with sam harris and jordan peterson that both of well We know jordan peterson is studying. He's read all of sam harris's books Um, they should you know, hopefully have a more productive conversation, but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't and and again, it's I'm You know my my tradition of calvinism again calvinism is very broad Uh presuppositions are a really big deal because These these presuppositions that we have are deep within our culture and they're deep within our our makeup and they These you know, the reason we talk about foundational things is that the building above can only be supported depending on the nature of the foundation I had to say goodbye to my son and uh Got interrupted and and so again back to Yeah, uh Sometimes sometimes people ask me well, well, how do you plan your videos? and well, sometimes I plan them and sometimes they just happen and again, i'm I'm thinking all this stuff out loud and Trying to trying to learn as I go and again the it's been amazing, you know reading your comments I've learned i've learned so much from you people and i'm just I just feel I mean if all of you were one patreon, I should have to pay you So so then you know when you again when you get oh, that's right. I was talking about sam harris and jordan peterson this this foundational difference between modernity and phenomenology is Makes it hard for the two groups to talk And and have a productive conversation and and so, you know one of the real things is seeing versus acting and So just in you know, the last last few days or even weeks You know as i'm as i'm trying to get my mind around this question You know, what is existence? What is reality? What is the world? and Uh, I mean obviously peterson has affected me deeply phenomenology is starting to impact me um, but but this this combination of matter and moments and and how You know, I well I did a video yesterday now i'm wearing a different shirt, you know my the matter of my The matter of my body hasn't changed that much from yesterday today But again, if you look in my sermon, I talk about this a little bit, you know I'm i'm a very different creature than I was 20 years ago How have I changed from yesterday today? Well, i've had experiences all day and i've had conversations with people and and so that has you know created We we don't really know how that impacts the brain but we do know that you know with brain plasticity and You know the brain actually changes as we think and so there is a deep mind body connection and and so, you know, i'm going through in these moments and and i've always known this as a pastor because For example, there are things that happen in life where worlds change um Um, I don't know if I have this book right here i'm at home right now um The body keeps the score which is a book I read a couple years ago on trauma And and and you know that if you work with someone who has been let's say abused as a child or you know that trauma gets stuck and And the trauma gets stuck in our bodies. I mean not just in our brains but in our bodies and and so Well, well, what kind of being are we and what kind of reality are we and and even in in some ways? You know, I think about You know in in what ways am I differentiated from the world around me? I mean I can touch this computer. I can touch this mouse. I can touch this table There's there's a very clear distinction between the world around me and me But when it comes to like my sisters that I grew up with There's some deep ties between us and you look at that with twins, you know identical twins or you know There's deep ties between us and we don't understand any of this stuff And that's why every time peterson says, you know, we we don't really understand consciousness He's right and and because we don't understand consciousness. We don't know we don't understand reality and again, this is part of the reason why i've been enjoying watching scott adams because You know scott adams is is trying to You know take serious take seriously how much we don't know and he's trying to apply it but That in and of itself is exactly the dilemma that you know You might you might sit there and watch this movie and say We have no idea what's going on with this movie. What i'm seeing in this movie is probably only A little bit of of what's actually real and again if you go to jordan peterson's April question and answer he gets into that he's saying, you know, how much of reality do we know? Well, I know I know a tiny bit of the reality of sitting here in my living room right now That's what I know and I hear my son who is who is shaving over there and my dog is snorting over here because You never you never heard a little dog snore louder than this dog But you know on and on and on and on and and with knowledge, you know The amount of knowledge I have is is tiny tiny tiny. So So What do we know and again for me people always ask well why your calvinism? well, this is a part of my calvinism because calvinism as an aspect of Calvinism is My particular take on calvinism is that it's one of the more skeptical aspects About our capacity to know And our capacity to save ourselves and and that's part of why I stay with my version of calvinism because If my ability to rescue myself or be productive about myself Is based on my and again, it's really hard to even decide define what me is. I've been listening Oh, I forget the um I forget the guy someone mentioned a guy who's doing Who has this nice little nice little course on nice little book nice little course on, you know philosophy of the mind So i'm going through that right now And again the guy puts it really well and has given me new thoughts and ideas But you realize how much you don't know and and even you know, here's here's a crazy thing Say you're listening to me and let's say you say i'm learning a lot from paul vanderclay Well, how much really because in the moment you might see something and like wow I see it and then the next moment It's gone. So you have to go back and you have to see it again, and then it's gone. And so You know with if I really want to learn something like for example cs Cs lewis's book miracles. I need to read it over and over and over and over again And each time I read the book I see more and then I read it and I see more and then The stuff that I read before stays with me longer and and this is where reading and talking and acting Come into play because the truth is you don't really know something until you can And this is what you learn in school until you can explain it in your own words until you are can articulate it and can articulate it Regularly and repeat it and and you don't really know something until you act on it and you don't really believe anything until you act on it Again, all this stuff is jordan peterson 101. So if you watch maps of meaning if you watch these other things This is the stuff he relates and when I first started learning this stuff It rang true, but I had never seen it that way and then as I continue You know in my so far one year learning from jordan peterson's Course well, this is what i'm learning and i'm appreciating it, but i'm going to have to I'm going to have to admit that even though I feel like i'm learning all of this stuff This is just tiny tiny things now. What does that mean? That means that Let's say four or five years from now I've kind of exhausted everything that I think I can learn from jordan peterson and then You know, maybe i'm on to the next thing And then at some point this all gets interrupted by death And you might say Boy, isn't that a waste and I would say yeah, that's a real waste and then I would say What if it isn't interrupted by death and you say well, wait a minute. Um You've just finished talking about the fact that everything that you've learned has been, you know, somehow encoded in your brain And you know that brain is decaying and it might fall victim to senility or alzheimer's or you might have a terrible car accident My head gets squashed like a grape and um, then you would say all of that. That is paul vanderclay goes away And I would say as a christian I say no You'd say why not? And I'd use the the sharecropper's wife's answer, which is god knows well god knows what well god knows me What do you mean god knows you I mean God knows me. Well, okay, which me does god know does god know the six-year-old me or the 12 year old me Or the 20 year old me or the 54 year old me i'd say god knows all of them and god knows the entire process all the way Through and then you'd be you might say well, are you saying that god is pantheon that god is the sum of all things? and I would say God knows all things But god is more than just all things that and that god in fact has a will and via christianity three persons and you might say well Okay, so So god has persons. Well, how about how about just an impersonal thing like star wars force and I would probably say um, the reason I don't think Um God finally is impersonal Is because of my relationship with nature and again, this is via cs. Louis's miracle. I can colonize nature Now this little rubber thing This is just a little rubber thing I'm just trying to figure out a way it could kill me But um, you know, i've we've colonized this it's made of petroleum and we've invented zippers And you know, there's all kinds of things here I guess if I could put it in my mouth, I could gag myself with it I could kill myself with this little rubber thing and and that way perhaps nature would conquer me but we have so thoroughly colonized nature and I think that is a That is a difference between the personal and the impersonal and so when you know people Every time in star wars when someone says use the force, um, I think you're basically validating my argument because Because You don't the personal uses the impersonal now the impersonal is very powerful But the personal uses the impersonal actually just last night. Um, I watched justice league with one of my sons and Spoiler alert if you haven't seen the movie and you're going to see the movie close your ears for the next few minutes Um, so one two three here comes the spoiler Which is probably not a big deal. But um, guess what? You know, remember superman died in the last movie. He comes back to life Surprise surprise, but then he comes back to life and Okay, so there he's We'll see benny. Um He's got you know Super strength and and you know all the problems with the superman character. I mean, he's he's superman he can do anything but He comes back to life and the real question is what's going to go on with his head? Because he can have super strength and he can have super speed and he can have supervision and he can Super Vision not supervision. He can have all these things but it's his personhood that governs and and that's where the interesting story lies, so This is who we are now Scott adams and sam harris disagree on trump and and again, this is where we're watching a movie in a sense sam harris and and And scott adams are sitting and watching their movie and adam says, oh, there's two movies and and and sam says no There's really one movie. There's there's really one movie and i'm going to argue with it and they don't agree Jordan peterson dill honti can't agree on god, but they still sit on the stage together and they joke about throwing sam harris off the stage Well, why is that? Well, because we know a lot more than we know and you know last year I read guns germs and steel jared diamond um And the the elizabeth the jim elliott and elizabeth elliott story beyond the gates of splendor. That's a very famous christian story but but basically my point in this is that you know When let's say for example when the The spanish first land in the americas and the native americans see them You know, there's a there's a there's not a it's not unlikely that there's going to be bloodshed in fact, it's almost definite and so when When you meet another human being if you don't have anything commonality, it's probably going to be one dies One dies and is killed by the other but but now we have this entire thing built in and now So you've got peterson and all the stuff that's built into us via, you know our common heritage You've got stuff built into us via our common cultures and you can begin to get a sense of Of how this is so when jordan peterson and dilla hunty sit on a stage, they're dressed nice. They're behave they're behaved. There's There's you know, they can do a lot of talking. In fact, they could probably talk about a lot of other things more than they can talk about god why because If you get your mind around this and again peterson has made this points in his maps of meaning and personalities class There's a whole lot there that's enabling this that we don't see Well, why don't we see it because we've already built it into everything around us And and so the the kind of refined tuning we're doing, you know on one observer might look like yeah You got two guys on the stage arguing. Well, that's one way to say it. Um, but those of us who've been interested in the conversation You just have to stop and pause and say what an amazing world we live in what amazing creatures we are What an amazing civilization um You know, we are the most blessed we we are the most blessed creatures you could imagine But what a rambly video, um And then I saw and then I saw this I saw this someone had tweeted me this. Um, Uh questions no christians can answer and they had a whole bunch of um Atheists who are skeptics and wanting to engage in christians and you know, what's fun There are christians who want to do that too and and so part of me looked at that said boy, that'd be fun I'd love to talk to some of these guys But notice again always when you know the dilla hunty thing, you know who won Well, that's framing it one way and now again when you get into petersonian terms, well, we're not you know He and kathy newman, they should have a conversation Now there's a world behind that word choice and this is exactly why jordan peterson kvatch did the pronouns because he's saying Even with the words we pick we are sneaking in worlds and in defense of theologians and philosophers who wind up Arguing about worlds. This is something that philosophers and theologians know Every single word every single word sneaks in a world Tolkien knew that lewis knew that finding the right word is critically important and that's that's in a sense where writing has a Often has a an advantage over extemporaneous speaking which i'm doing now So, you know what what fun to sit down and and talk to atheists and and and in that sense again um Can you? Get to know each other well enough to have a productive conversation Best yet. Can you become friends? Can you like each other and and can you? Can you you know Basically if you can like each other the more commonality you can find the the the more connections you can have with the other person probably And this this gets ironic probably the better conversation you can have and probably In some ways the more heated conversation because and that's the reason that husband and wives fight There's a lot on the line And and even though they know each other probably better than any other human being in the world knows them There's always a ton on the line and That's why Being married and staying married. I've been married 30 years is hard and that's why if You know and if you ever get the idea that you want to ask me to perform your wedding You should think twice about it because my wedding sermons um People usually gasp when they hear what I say because I tell them basically you're standing here promising to love each other And a year from now I might very well go out to coffee with one of you and you'll you'll complain like crazy about the other person and Think you are nuts for marrying them. How could you how could you possibly you can't even possibly live with this other person? and Sometimes it doesn't take one year. Sometimes it takes seven. Sometimes it doesn't happen. Sometimes people are fighting even before they get married so You figure it out, but that's the world we live in and so um I I was going to mention if you if you look at alan jacob's book how to think He's got an appendix in there with with basically rules for thinking and rules for talking And and they have everything to do with you know, don't don't talk for victory talk for understanding And and if you can have a conversation with someone with which you've got significant disagreements if you can if you can Begin to understand each other You will it will even be more productive with respect to the places you don't agree And so that in some ways was part of the problem with the jordan peterson dilla hunty Conversation and part of the problem with the jordan peterson William craig evans conversation and that's why in some ways A dilla hunty william craig evans conversation would be a little bit easier because they're more on the same page and they're They're both in a sense playing the same game and they've lined everything up And this is why I think peterson with his phenomenology with his pragmatism with his psychological understanding he comes around and The modernists don't quite know what to do with him and and this again is why I think he Is significant because because of peterson And peterson doesn't even know what he's doing and and this gets onto my last slide that Here we are, you know, not only are we Not only are we these moments going in time. We are so complex We are also These cloud of witnesses and you're talking right now To use jonathan height's term you're talking right now to paul vanderklay's rider Not the elephant but the rider and the elephant they're pretty deeply attached and now let's switch focuses to more of a depth psychology perspective where You're talking right now to this this conscious paul vanderklay this conscious paul vanderklay who is You know who is having who is living in this moment who is talking to his computer Who is going to upload this to youtube who is intending to read the comments of what people say to this and And look at how many people viewed it and you know all the crazy things that I do but but within me are these watchers these little sub paul vanderklay's and And the all of these sub paul vanderklay's are You know have all grown through history with me and the books that i've read and the way that that my you know my parents parented me and the the christianity I grew up in and And the town that I grew up in and the friendships that I had and then All of the jobs that I had and getting married and having children and watching videos and watching tv and reading books and Pastoring a church and and doing hobbies and and on on on on on So again, I I can't even make the graphics for this All of these are coming in and all of this is being developed and again To think about the fact that you know, i'm 54 right now. Who knows my father died when he was 77 My grandfather died when he was 90. Um, who knows how long I'll live. Um, I don't know I mean I could drive in my car tonight have a terrible accident again my Boom my head gets squashed like a grape and you might say oh, you know all that stuff in paul vanderklay's brain. It's gone And rightfully we I would hopefully rightfully some of you would say good riddance god vanderklay's gone He won't make any annoying videos. Then why are you watching? You should go see a psychologist and figure out why you're watching videos of me if they annoy you um, but But I would say as a christian Um And let's get back to the resurrection that um, I know that my redeemer lives And what christianity says is that He will raise me and he might say Well, what I mean, he'll raise you i'm saying that He knows me And and even this this way of knowing a person someone asked, you know, have you written a book? No Uh, why not because i'm 280 hd because you know, have you seen my videos? There's a reason I haven't written a book look at my videos. I can hardly control myself here But I was I was thinking I actually did some work on a book a number of years ago and it had everything to do with Like here. Here's a term relationalism um the fact that I know paul vanderklay in a way that no one else does because You know, yeah even even This guy even this guy. I know paul vanderklay in a way that no one else does. Okay My wife knows me and and sometimes my wife is talking to me and it's like do you know me, you know, that's not me. Um Well, i've got my biases. She's got her biases She's got her limited slice of me I've even got my limited slice of myself. I was you know chatting with my sister yesterday Both of my sisters know me In ways, I don't know myself my congregation at church knows me in ways. I don't know myself My dog knows me in ways. I don't know myself My dog knows how I smell in a way that I don't know because my dog smells better than I do My children know me in ways that I don't know myself and I have five of them Which means that each of them sees me through their biases But but all of those biases probably also enable so so each of them probably know aspects of me Better than I know myself and then you'd have to ask. Well, how could god raise me? Well, god knows all of that and god knows me better than Even the sum total of my congregation and my wife and my dog and my kids Because he knows me All the way from my beginning all the way from when he knitted me together in my mother's womb He knows me that well. And so how could I be resurrected? Well in some ways I could argue that The material my material me is incidental And and we let's use a metaphor of this So one of my sons is you know has a 3d printer and he's making stuff and he bought it used for like $200 and you know, it doesn't always work So he just ran out to the library because the library has a better one He's printing that and you know, he got an engineering degree and so so he's playing around with 3d printers. Well In a sense you might consider the resurrection To be god 3d printing the world and you might say well that sounds kind of wild and I what's your what's your proof of that? Well, I proof that such a Proof proof points us in the wrong direction. Why do I believe that I believe that because jesus walked from the tomb And I believe that because now now you might say well, you know Yeah, but if i'm sitting in a grave or if i'm cremated or from i'm lost at sea or what have you How can god put me together? Well, he put me together once Why would I imagine he couldn't do it again? Why would I imagine he couldn't make a copy of me? You know now how will he and and this is where as christians we say we have no idea And if you read see i've got first corinthians 15 rolling around in my head If you saw a rough draft for sunday yesterday and i'm preaching it tomorrow I'm always working on my sermon until I preach it and then I start working on the next one But later in that chapter paul says, um will have a spiritual body and that really sent a lot of people in the wrong direction But if you understand how paul uses the word spiritual His his point is that? in our resurrected body we will This gets into some c.s. Lewis stuff too we will we will be fully So hard to talk about We will be fully Created by the spirit. We will be fully in line with the spirit. So then if you listen to jonathan peugeot's talk with I forgot his name again higgins Jfh, I think that's what it is. Um, you know Jonathan was talking about becoming this this this becoming I got to be careful with this because i'm a protestant more like god In what ways are we like god? Well, we're not going to be eternal because that ship has sailed um But we will be more like him and and we will be like him in like him Like him as he intends us to be C.s. Lewis makes the point. Um makes the point in one of his books that We might imagine Excuse me. We might imagine that as we become more like christ We will become we will start to look identical like things that my son can print on a 3d printer and c.s. Lewis says no actually When we become more like christ we actually Become more unique Become more like the paul vander clay that that That the lord predestined from all of eternity. There's a little Calvinism for you. Um will become exactly who he intends me to be And I don't know what that is and you say well that will that be more like the paul vander clay who is 20 Or will that be the 54 year old paul vander clay? What if when paul vander clay is 90 He has Alzheimer's and he forgets who he is and I would say God knows god knows all of this And i'm not worried about it. Why aren't you worried about it because I can't control it. Why worry about it? um And I trust him I I think finally So so one of the points I was making is that your modernists like uh, dilla hunty and like william craig evans um In in some ways I might make the argument that they're both protestant and this gets into again this long stream of things Because because I think modern atheism is very protestant and and that's why this Is Dilla hunty versus william craig evans is is kind of modernist protestantism working out its stuff and You know the social justice warriors are you know post-modern Protestantism working out its stuff And the stuff going on in the united states today is a christened dumb civil war well, um Where was it going with this see i'm already getting senile I trust god with the resurrection and and I think trust is exactly the issue that's involved when The more you think about how little we are in control of everything the only The only resolution for anxiety is trust To believe that and again, this is why i'm a calvinist to believe that God is this big and this powerful and this good now you might say yeah, but with double predestination Is he really good? And well, we could talk about double predestination sometime. That's a very complicated and i'm not always convinced a terribly productive argument calvin This gets into some ugly corners of calvinism that Um, I don't really have a lot of interest going into because I haven't seen them to be terribly productive but what I think the biblical doctrine of election communicates is that It's not finally up to us and now again as um, jonathan See, I gotta go all the way back. It's terrible of me to forget his name I even i'm even his facebook friend now james james james um Um The reason paul starts out the book of ephesians with these passages about being, you know predestined is I think to give the ephesians a sense of um A sense of it's both and again a sense of this is god's plan. He's working it out and It's this great adventure that we have to act in and and this is why you know dilla honte at one point I heard him say i'm a compatibilist. I said so am I i'm a compatibilist calvinist because on one hand God has ordained it on the other hand We have to do it We have to work it out and and that's why I always go misery deliverance gratitude that that all that we do is in gratitude its response to him and he saves us in spite of ourselves and he saves us despite ourselves And I think that's the best way to language it yet. There's a story that I told someone recently Um, it's probably apocryphal. It's about augustin and and the reason the orthodox and the western church You know deal with election differently is because um because of augustin because the western church started dealing with augustin or starting deal with Dealing with election and that all goes back to augustin which is why the roman catholics and the lutherans and the calvinists. They're all You know, they've basically got the same doctrine of election. It goes down to augustin And and it's probably knotted up in platonism in some ways or neo-platonism. So you know have fun with that in the comment section, but And that's the reason so the orthodox church the eastern church they they were having different conversations and so they they dealt with those passages In different ways. Does that mean I don't believe in election? No, I do um, but It's interesting when you get to let's say the materialists Who want to say, you know Philosophically their their system winds up becoming determinism and as a calvinist I look at that and say I know something about determinism We've been talking about that stuff for years and and yet Um determinism you can hardly find determinism in You can't find determinism in the bible, um, it's just more complicated than that. So tim keller is a good sermon on this. Um I I highlighted something else from tim keller. I'm rambling terribly I was going to do a short video and here i'm going on an hour So feel free not to watch it, which is a terrible thing to say at the end of the video But anyway Back to this conversation good conversation. It was I I don't know how interested all of you would be in it in some ways James is working out his stuff. Jonathan is You know dealing with a lot of his orthodox stuff and it's just fun listening to jonathan's journey um, no Oh, this is what I wanted to say. So, you know another thing Both with respect to denominations And with respect to how to talk about the reformation the beginning of c.s. Lewis's mere christianity is gold Because I think at the beginning of that book lewis nicely Gives us a vision for how we should Handle denominationalism and and lewis's lewis's take on the reformation was this The conversations that needed to happen between martin luther and the pope Should have happened and this is classic lewis should have happened in an english pub over some good beers by a warm fireplace between good friends Because there's real things that there's real things that have to be worked out Between the three major branches of the church the orthodox the roman catholic and the protestants Uh, we should work them out as brothers and sisters in christ In christ there I said it and so when I when I look at jonathan peugeot He's a brother in christ and when I look at James he's a brother in christ now. He might say what about the joeva's witnesses and the mormons Yeah, well I'll take them on a case by case basis. Okay? Um, i'll give you i'll give you that or even that could get me into some trouble But and the reason I say that is again also in the beginning of mere christianity CS lewis has a really good dialogue about how we use this word of describing someone as a christian And that is also worth reading So maybe i'll in one of my videos walk through some of that more carefully because that then gets into this conversation Is jordan peterson a christian by cs lewis's definition there? You'd have to say in some ways No, because he's not classified as that and and cs lewis uses Compares that with say the the use of the term gentleman You want to be in the uh, you want to be in the video? Huh, you want to be in the video? I've wanted to get my dog in the video for a long time so Say hello to the audience mookie My my dog has a problem with his liquor he can't he can't hold his liquor So when I put him up he gets nervous and he just starts looking so So there's my dog anyway This is probably the worst video i've ever made but cs lewis at the beginning of mere christianity Talks about you know what it means to be a christian and who is a christian and so in that first introduction These issues that james is dealing with Um, yeah, I got his name right see I learn it's all those moments. I've got to i've got to create those pathways in my In my increasingly old brain All of these issues about denominations about Identifying someone as a christian And about the protestant reformation and cs lewis's vision of maybe how it should have been dealt with They're all at the beginning of mere christianity. So so james definitely read that And here's another question that if I were talking to cs lewis, I would say yeah But why did the reformation play out the way it did? And you know as I continue to listen to jonathan and learn about um orthodoxy I could ask why did the great schism play out the way it did which was you know, obviously something far early where the the bishop of rome excommunicates all the other patriarchs and the patriarchs excommunicate the bishop of rome and you know very sad history and So I have hope And and strong hope that um at the at the consummation at the At the renewal of all things all those wounds will be healed too Now I can't help when I when I think about so if someone says well What kind of church should I go to I would probably say that depends on a lot a lot a lot of things Uh, should I be christian reformed? I'd love it if you were It might not be the best church for you. Well, how can you figure out the best church? Well, it would be the church that would um Be most productive in bringing you To become the person that christ intends you to be And you might say well that should be the church i'm happiest in and I would probably say It it may very well be the opposite because it's usually through our struggles and trials that we Um that we grow the most now then you say well then it's the church that I hate most No, that's probably not it because now you're into the peterson chaos order thing. It's going to have it's going to have to have the right mix of enough like you to be productive but enough against you to To rub you and and turn that grain of sand into a pearl. So here it is my worst video ever the most rambly The most unsolicited advice the most budding into another conversation where I wasn't Invited and you know, that's when I look at the videos i've made I think boy what a jerk This guy is these people are having a nice conversation about christianity and you're just gonna butt in Um, well, that's because i'm from new jersey and and we're rude Um, so yeah, there it is worst video i've ever made. Um, if you got to this point Leave me a nasty comment and um, yeah, tell me how much you hate it
