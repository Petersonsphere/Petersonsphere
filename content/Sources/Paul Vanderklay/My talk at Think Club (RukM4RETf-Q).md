 Hi, this is Paul. Just want to do a quick plug. Adam and I talked yesterday. Adam is over at Think Club. He's got a few other channels. You can follow his stuff. He gave me the laser eyes. Oops, I just moused over it so I lost it. But we talked for about an hour and had a great time together. I didn't really know Adam at all, but we had a great time. And watch the video. You can find it on his channel and I'll put a link to it here. Look at that. Thirty-second video. Just wanted to give a quick commercial. Yesterday I did a conversation with Adam over on Think Club. Adam has a few different channels, but Think Club is one of his bigger ones. He does a lot of clips from different things and he does this art on his videos with the laser eyes. And so he gave me some laser eyes. And I'm eternally grateful. How cool to see laser eyes. But anyway, thanks Adam for the talk. I'll put a link to it here. Watch the conversation. We had a great time.
