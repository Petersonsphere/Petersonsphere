 Hi, this is Paul and I'm back with Nathan Jacobs. I had a conversation with him initially and we went through quite a bit of his life story. He's a filmmaker, he's a philosopher, he's a theologian, he teaches college, he does all kinds of things and he himself has a very interesting story and so I've been, he's been gracious enough to allow me to continue to pick his brain on a number of these topics. So thank you, thank you so much Nathan for being willing to talk. My pleasure, thanks for having me back Paul. Well I first, you first came across my radar screen with those videos from ancient faith and I was, I was particularly interested in some of the, some of the, what you've realized with respect to the relationship between nuns and duns, the personhood of God and their ideas about karma, about justice and so I'd like to go into that a little bit more. Could you summarize, I don't know, you know it's a little unfair because this is right off the cuff, could you summarize maybe some of what you began to notice to people and maybe even exploring in yourself because I've been watching the same thing happen and so when I heard you talk about it it's like wow I'm not alone in seeing this. That's right, yeah so I would say that the way I always point this out when I'm doing a talk like the one you came across which was a Midwest clergy convocation right, it was all these Orthodox priests who wanted to hear from me about nuns and nuns even though most of my research is on the nuns and I had to tell them that candidly. I think, I think duns are a different sort of story and need to be dealt with slightly differently in terms of how you do your research and I gave thoughts on how to do that but nonetheless with the nuns one of the things that always stood out to me was what seemed on just an initial glance like a contradiction so you would, you would see when you asked them so what were the sorts of things that were questions that were really troubling to you that you know pushed you away from Christianity and you get answers pretty commonly like problem of evil, problem of pain and they would they would talk about you know like Emily in Becoming Truly Human, my film, says you know tells this horrible story about her uncle falling asleep and you know burning up because he had a cigarette in his mouth and all this and she talks to her mom and her mom says well God has his reasons things happen for a reason we just need to trust him and she's like well why why do we have to do that and she just was dissatisfied with this you know blanket trust of God and the idea that somehow this horrific thing could have meaning but then when you fast forward and we start talking about positive beliefs and where are you now that very same Emily will say well I definitely believe in karma and fate things happen for a reason and when you put these next to each other it looks like just an overt contradiction I couldn't embrace Christianity because my mom said things happen for a reason where am I now I definitely think things happen for a reason so you think well what is that right so the uncharitable read is just say oh she's not thinking clearly contradictions in your worldview this happens all this time but I think I think the important nuance there which is the one that you're referring to is that when you talk about God and God has a reason for this happening you're talking about an anthropomorphic person right you're talking about someone who is watching who could have stepped in and stopped it and didn't and in this sense is in some way complicit with the evil itself and that's a pill that's too difficult to swallow whereas if you say karma or fate you've created something wildly impersonal it's more like the laws of physics so you get what you want in terms of a belief that the world is just right this seems to be part of part of the karma fake narrative where things are just what goes around comes around if you do bad things eventually that'll catch up with you do good things you'll eventually be rewarded and it's all sort of self correcting and works its way out but there's no person orchestrating that it's just sort of a an impassioned a dispassionate non capricious which I think is also critical to that impersonal force that's that's moving things along in this way and I think that's the key difference I think that's how you avoid an overt contradiction there is that this one is I can't accept that things happen for a reason if that reason is guided and orchestrated by somebody who could have you know you know made things work out differently and could have stepped in and didn't and supposedly is good but is complicit in the evil and so on whereas this one if it's just sort of like it's just a blind force and it's self correcting and things like that that's an easier pill for me to swallow and I think that's how they balance it and I think that's a really important nuance in their thinking because at the end of the day it's not an embrace of chaos and nihilism right but you know with with this sort of shift you still have a belief that the world is meaningful things do happen for a reason there's justice there's good there's evil there's rewards there's punishments all this sort of stuff all of that is retained in the worldview but you get rid of the anthropomorphic component of it that makes it too difficult to embrace but that's personally orchestrated and I think also one of the other things that you get rid of is I think there is a worry that God the Christian God the Judeo-Christian God might be capricious maybe he's not really trustworthy maybe he's not really good and when you make it just an abstract force you also get rid of that worry that it's arbitrarily functioning you can say well its only function is to reward and to punish and and it's more like physics and it's it's not a it's not a biased individual it doesn't have political parties it doesn't you know all that sort of stuff and so I think that's that's a big part of what's going on there so yeah well and and then you went on in your talk to talk about this movie which after I watched your talk then I watched your movie then I watched life itself because I write that when I find something interesting I want to do my homework and and so this movie life itself which which I found to be a fascinating movie especially after having listened to your lecture and you pointing this out and it was it was just sort of manifest there now probably most of the life itself wasn't the blockbuster I had never heard about it before I want to give a little summary maybe without too many spoilers sure yeah so I mean the light I think the best way and you you pointed this out when you talked about it in your podcast which I watched this is how you and I first connected and you introduced yourself to me let me know and I took a look at that and and as you rightly pointed out in there life itself is pulled from the thesis statement of the film right so you have this one character who is I think she's doing her doctorate maybe or a master's thesis one of those two in English literature I think it is and she comes up with her thesis statements and she's focusing on the unreliable narrator and she basically goes into this long you know sort of monologue about how the unreliable narrator is a gimmick and it's not a very good gimmick and there's a few you know few instances in works which it works but you know you know you really need to go with the reliable narrator but and this is where she points out every narrator is perspectival and has their own biases and therefore every narrator is inherently unreliable so the only truly reliable narrator would be life itself where you you know you are somehow able to step back and see things in some sort of objective way but as she points out life itself is always misdirecting us and causing us to think that certain people are good guys when they're in fact bad guys and vice versa and all this sort of stuff so she suggests that life itself is the truest you know most you know the truest unreliable narrator right and and this sets up the entire point of the film which is you really don't know in the film there are certain people who seem to be good guys who are maybe not as good as they seem and certain people who seem to be bad guys who are maybe not as bad as they seem certain events that are horrific but the way they play out seem to have this end result that you just can't get yourself to want to abandon because they're so beautiful and you know essential to the story and so on and so really when she's setting up the thesis statement about life itself being an unreliable narrator she's really offering an entire picture of what the film itself is doing which is this web of characters who are not always what they seem and the way they intersect in the way they converge and where their stories which appear disconnected end up converging in a connected way end up having this beautiful result even though you start very early on with some horrifically ugly things happening to these characters so I'd say that's that's a that's a big part of it and and I think that's I think that was one of the best pictures I've ever seen in cinema of the sort of worldview that I see at work underneath the majority of the nuns that I've spoken with it was it was very interesting I did a conversation so on my channel I have a lot of conversations with people like yourself often people who come to me and just want to talk I I spoke with a he's a doctor who he's a cardiologist in Idaho and he mentioned a movie with Will Ferrell that was out a number of years ago where he's stranger than fiction yes yes and it was very interesting how you know very similar themes worked out in there because again in that film there's there's that there's an author who is who always writes stories where there's a dramatic death and this individual begins to he's a he's a tax collector begins to realize that oh my goodness there's a narration going on and and so then they weave that they weave yeah those issues what what captured me about so many levels was that pastorally the what you noticed here about karma you know I can't believe in God because I can't believe God would have a reason to allow these seemingly arbitrary cruel and perhaps capricious things to happen to people that this God professes he loves but then again in an impersonal space well I can imagine how this tragic instance here could in the future produce something good and so the critical that the critical turn there is personhood that a a omniscient omnipotent person could not allow this here but a mechanistic a mechanism could allow this here and so where this got interesting for me is that over the last year and a half through Jordan Peterson Jonathan Peugeot the work of John Verbeke cognitive science this so much of contemporary philosophy right now and and conversations of metaphysics seem to be narrowing down into these questions of what is a person what is a subject how does the subject fit into the overall picture and as I began to look at this it's like well isn't it interesting that we have a that we have a generation of individuals naively tripping on the very same subject that all kinds of nerdy philosophers are wrangling with and then part of what again drew me to you was I saw what you were dealing with and of course the problem of evil comes up but in my pastoral experience I began to have a suspicion that it wasn't necessarily so much the presence of evil but it was far more the dynamics of trust that were at play in individuals as they were working through these issues of can I believe in a God and and and then I also noticed in your conversation with Hank Hanagraph which I thought those two conversations were were very helpful you also begin to dive into this question of person because obviously I actually just had a conversation with a guy who he was raised in a the sounds weird but they're out there a conservative Unitarian congregation and that does sound weird that's right they didn't believe in the Trinity but in almost all other aspects they were sort of like Southern Baptists so his is his morality was was very much in alignment with conservative evangelicals and so he was just kind of going through life because his church was very small kind of going through life passing as a conservative evangelical until someone it would somehow come up that maybe he joined a church and then he'd look at the church's statement which was this boilerplate evangelical and they have this thing about the Trinity and he says oh by the way that that Trinity thing I don't buy that and suddenly all the clergy are like you know if he was pro-abortion well you know and and if he you know wanted to sleep with his girlfriend before marriage I mean the evangelical church sort of has their routine to deal with that right as I I'm totally down with everything the church is about except the Trinity right he and of course the pastors are just kind of sucker punch suddenly they're going to have to try and I had a conversation with him I don't probably have some more because he basically says he says look how does the doctrine of the Trinity make any difference for life as we pass for a conservative evangelical today why would that matter and so at the same time I'm having doing all of this work about personhood about agency about metaphysics and saying well isn't it interesting that that the the largest question of the it's not just it's not just evangelicals it's Roman Catholics of many people raised religion they're defecting from the church over this issue of personhood so what so let me ask you this question and and this is also right now technologically a very interesting thing because of you know the touring test where at what point is a person is a computer so sophisticated that they are indistinguishable from a human being to a human being mm-hmm and so we have so a lot of the conversations I've been having with Jonathan Peugeot who grew up evangelical and then went over to orthodoxy a lot of the conversations on I've been having with him actually get into this question of principalities powers persons and then you get into very interesting questions of ontology with respect to spiritual beings and you know the the reality of God so let me ask you this question what is a person okay well before I answer the question I just want to offer a note on stranger than fiction I think stranger than fiction is a fascinating juxtaposition with life itself because in life itself life itself is this abstract and personal karma fate whereas stranger than fiction actually is the dilemma of a person and I'm actually okay with giving some spoilers fast-forward I guess if you don't want to hear spoilers but stranger than fiction has been out long enough that I think expiration date has expired on if you want it so of course one of the things that's fascinating is as as will ferrell's character realizes that his life is being narrated and and it seems that he's bound by fate by whatever this narrator is doing he eventually figures out who the author is who doesn't know that she's actually controlling the life of will ferrell and he ends up tracking her down and having this conversation and basically he asked her to not kill him because he's figured out that this is where this story is going and she goes into this massive crisis how many people have I killed you know can I kill this person and and so on and what I think is fascinating about this is there's a third character here which is this literature professor who will ferrell is consulting with which is part of how he figured out who the author was and and that person right that that you know literature professor ends up reading the manuscript right she she gives him the manuscript before she's sort of really you know written the final chapter where he would die and and the literature professor takes a look at it and he's read it and reread it and he basically says bad news you have to die like this is the most ingenious thing of her illustrious career and you know it's important that you die right and and we're all gonna die someday so why not in this way you know because it's it's just too important from a literary perspective to abandon it so it's this fascinating thing that he's really suggesting there is almost this best possible world's outcome here where death has to be the thing that happens and yet and this would be the spoiler part okay just pause there so they can you know so the the author ends up changing the ending so that he doesn't die and then the literature professor looks at it and says well it's not as good right like it's not I mean it's it's alright you know it's not as good but he didn't die and her rationale is you know well he's he seems like a good man and that's not the sort of man you would want to kill okay but what's fascinating there is the irony is a big part of this other component I think you rightly pointed out the component of trust right but that's one of the issues that's in there I think the other issue which is another ancient philosophy problem is the question of the passions right so the passions we tend to not really know what the proper roots of those terms are but the passions in ancient literature were basically your animal impulses and their pre volitional animal impulses right so like in stoic philosophy you have an animal impulse to react defensively say when there's a physical threat and we might call that you know let's say it that prompts what we call anger you know the stoics would suggest you're not actually angry until your will engages once your will engages with that animal reaction that physiological response to an external threat now you're angry right because anger is a volitional activity not a pre volitional physiological reaction and and I think that's a fascinating point because really when the stoics talk about cultivating apathy apathia they don't mean what I see in many of my students which is that I don't care about this class and why am I here what what they see instead what they mean instead is that you have cultivated a gap between impulse and reaction you've created the room necessary so that your will can assess whether a physiological response is in keeping with the good or if it's appropriate to be angry here because this is a genuine injustice or something like that then that volitional engagement would be appropriate and good but sometimes we have physiological reactions where you know you are inclined to be angry with your kids and they really don't deserve that right it was it was they didn't mean to drop that 25 pound weight on your toe it was an accident right and so so you know there's there's an appropriate gap and that's the whole point is that the stoics presume that the pre volitional you know impulse of the passion sometimes aligns with the good sometimes doesn't and apathia is the cultivation of this gap where the will is capable of saying yes or no to the passions that's apathy or apathy and the reason that's important is because when it comes to the question of God impassibility is the doctrine that was taught by Christians but also was held by you know most of ancient philosophy that God not having an animal body not being an organism doesn't have passions so the question of good and evil is not you know is not a question for God of impulse or you know desire in the sort of animal sense or anything like that and they saw this as critical to again trust in God right that God is God is impassable now what I think is fascinating is that the nun seems to the nuns who are inclined toward karma and faith seem to into intuitively get that the justice and trusting karma and fate it's critical that that force is dispassionate right because they recognize that passions can lead to miscalculation injustice so on the irony is stranger than fiction the so the irony is there you do have a human author and the human author can't follow through with what is apparently the good right we could talk about whether or not that's viable right that certain evils like killing a man is good but but the point is what we do have in the film is we have a setup where the literature professor has said this is the best endings this is what must happen right and the author just can't bring herself to do with the good because of the sway of the passions and so that's interesting I find that a fascinating juxtaposition with with life itself so I think you've set up well the question of of the person of God if you would you know it's so funny when you say that because I also find in contemporary culture you've also set up in a sense the the old controversy of Athens versus Jerusalem in that the God that we find in the Hebrew scriptures is he's he's moved again and again you have Oseya you know you know Ephraim you know who I love how I and you have and the Psalmist is wrestling with God and in the desert wanderings you have Moses and God and sometimes they seem to trade places God's like all right I'm done I'm gonna smite him and most like no no no no no and of course this is this is not the unmoved mover you find from Aristotle sure and yeah but but I would I would guess that when I look at when I look at say people who are happily and passionately evangelical in a personal relationship and especially Pentecostal you know they love God's passion and in fact they couldn't cultivate this personal relationship with God if they would imagine God to be an unmoved mover yeah well and I do think that comes through not just in Pentecostals I think it came through in well I used to be a process philosopher right and the process philosophers once they I mean initially with Alfred North Whitehead and people like Charles Hartshorn they were not so interested in the Bible you know you know Christian process philosophy but it became more and more interesting to biblical scholars for example so Robert News is one of the process philosophers in Old Testament studies Terence Frettheim Lutheran process philosopher as well who wrote this book the suffering of God and these were books that I always loved in in that time in my life but a lot of a lot of it was that they recognized that the sort of language that you're talking about in the Old Testament is you know dealt with and what they felt was a sort of run rough shot over we can't we just sort of deny that those things are in there and get rid of them they didn't feel there was a genuine dealing with these aspects of the Judeo-Christian God and but what you could also tell was coming through was they weren't just trying to take the that imagery more seriously and say that it's real and it's really saying what it thinks it looks like it's saying God really does change his mind and God really does way you know love and is you know swayed by his passions right or something like that right this passable God that they seem to introduce it seemed that for them that was critical to being able to embrace and love God right so you almost have this juxtaposition where on the one hand you have the folks who their main hang-up is trusting God and they need to get over that hurdle and the best way to do it is to have God dispassionate and even impersonal and then you have the other folks who really just want to know that God loves them and the only way they can feel that is to because they associate love with swells of emotion and feelings they can't imagine a God who loves without those swells of emotions and feelings so they embrace to the contrary a very personal and very passionate God who may well be swayed by you know feelings right similar to stranger than fiction and so I think that's a such a fascinating contrast because I think you have in some ways they're all dealing with as you pointed out ancient philosophical questions right there's nothing new on the Sun in terms of these types of questions if you're familiar with ancient literature and the philosophers and by the philosophers I'd include the Christian but but at the same time you have this pendulum swing happening where it seems that the need for the passionate personal God was something that was sort of a fad I don't know how many years ago but I'd say you know at time and those that was kind of a 90s trend that I think started to level off and then you had the nuns come in and that was a very different that was the opposite side of that pendulum so I think the topics they're dealing with our our old topics and the dichotomy that they're swinging between are both you know what what the ancients would have considered two ditches on either side of the right road but nonetheless there it is okay so in terms of personhood divine personhood okay so I mean as usual I'll speak from an Eastern patristic Eastern Orthodox perspective on these things you know I think one of the things that's fascinating is that the question of personhood is something that really wasn't dealt with as much by the ancient philosophers prior to Christianity and it was things like Trinitarian theology and Christology that prompted all these Eastern fathers to realize boy we really need this other thing called a person right a subject of who posses and I'll talk about their solution in a second but what I think is fascinating is in the West where a lot of the sort of solutions that were you know fleshed out in the East you know essence energies distinctions the who posses who see a distinction in the West it seems like there's a lack of clarity on some of those critical distinctions that were crucial to how Eastern theology understood itself and developed whereas in the West you have certain people like Augustine who in his day Trinitazze he says about person right he says well we don't really know what person means right so he's taking and here he's taking the Latin translation of who posses into persona and saying well we don't really know what that is and a lot of the treatise is just him trying to come up with an acceptable definition of what a persona is that seems to be nice seen but Augustine admits early on in the treatise he says well I'm sure this is one of my favorite parts of this entire treatise massive day Trinitazze is asking treatise he says at the beginning he says well I'm sure you can find the answers to any questions you might have about the Trinity in the Eastern and the Greek fathers but most of us over here don't read Greek well enough to know what they're saying so I'm just gonna have to rely on God and it's such a shocking admission right like you think is it a radical it's gonna reinvent the wheel huh okay all right so that's what I find so fascinating about that treatises because it has that level of admission that I'm kind of I've got some basic terminology from you know from a council but I really I really don't understand the nuances of what the Greek guys are doing and so Augustine fleshes that out and one of the things he arrives at is a person's as relations and I could talk about why that is that has to do with a heavy influence from neo-platinism on Augustine and his belief that you know I would say his extreme realism as opposed to moderate realism I won't get too bogged down in those terms but I do think it's an important difference between East and West which is that in sort of Aristotelian moderate realism versus Platonic extreme realism those that distinction is really between is really about this both Plato and Aristotle presumed that the categories we use of the mind right when we say that this object is read and that object is read and that object is read right the question about realism versus nominalism is the question of well is that category of thing right that general noun that we've just used that universal which it becomes the medievalist you know sort of way of talking about it where I've said red red red red is that just a fabrication of the mind my mind can't oh they're in reality there are only particulars right that red is not that red is not that red and they share nothing in common they're all individual discrete you know instances very everything's a unique snowflake so to speak and the mind looks at those and because it needs to group things I create a name and a false fabricated mental group and I say red but that's not real it's just mental I project redness onto this thing that I have associated with red that's right and it's just a way of sort of mentally grouping things but the groups aren't real right that's nominalism and it's called nominalism from no man write name write the Latin for name nomenclature right and we and and it's a name we've assigned but it's not real outside of the mind realism says no no no no these categories of genera and species and you know other properties these are real outside of the mind and the reason your mind says that's the same thing as that is because that's the same thing as that that's why it's called realist right so the mind is perceiving something external from itself and and actually the even the groupings are coming from the things out there they're not simply being projected onto them that's right so you and I are human and the reason the mind looks at you and says oh that's a human looks at me says is because we actually are both participating in this thing the singular thing called humanity right that's a real thing we both have or participate in or something right so now the differences in real so that's the basic divide between nominalism are these categories and groups real or not nominalism says no they're not real they're mental realism says yes the real and your mind does that because they're real now then within realism you get into this divide which I won't get sidetracked with I'll just say I think it's a little artificial of a divide I think they're under defined terms but your listeners probably don't need to know the nuances of this but the basic divide that's often presented is realism versus or extreme realism versus modern realism so you familiar with the the painting of a Raphael school of Athens painting where you have in the middle Plato and Aristotle yep and if you're familiar with it yep there it is right so that's that's exactly what it is right Plato is going and Aristotle is going and and the reason they're doing that is because that's Raphael is very simple but very precise way of saying the question is when you talk about these groups right these genera and species what would also be called forms right the question is where are they and Plato says the forms and Aristotle says the forms right and this this is the basic difference between realism or extreme realism and moderate realism so extreme realism says here I'll use I happen to have here three of the same type of things these are all just one shot so so Plato would say why do you look at this one and say it's a razor you look at this one and say it's a razor and you look at this one and say it's a razor and Plato would say somewhere somewhere you've got this perfect ideal archetypal form of razorness right and then when you encounter material copies so these are material so this one is immaterial it's an ideal substance it's perfect you know in every way it's an ideal substance right it is an ideal substance okay and then what we have is the demiurg the demiurgus right the demiurg the the crafter which is Plato's God crafts the world and it's a material copy of a bunch of archetypal ideal substances right the forms and so somewhere there's the ideal you know razor and then the demiurge crafts material copies and we look at this and we go oh that's a razor because it looks like this that's a razor because it looks like this right in other words whenever you see something you go through a catalog of forms you've seen and you approximate which one it looks the most like and that's why and I think this is a fascinating thing to note in Plato's favor is that when you encounter something that is decayed and rotten your first question is what is it and it's not because you don't have enough light to see it with your eyes it's because your mind actually sees things your eyes see it just fine there's like shatter texture whatever it is but your mind is saying it doesn't fit any of the forms what is it right and this is why Plato talks about that the good of a thing is the closer it gets to its archetype right the more it looks like it that's its good and then when it diverges that's its evil right and that's what we call generation right conforming to your archetype corruption moving away from it decaying rotting and so on anyway Aristotle says well that that entire view is problematic because and his critique I think the simplest critique to offer he offers like five in his in his writings but you know there's the I think the simplest one to offer is just the third man problem so Aristotle says okay so these are these material razors are razors because they look like this why is that a razor and he's and he says well if what makes this thing a razor is that it looks like this thing do we need another razor and another razor and that we keep on referring back to so Aristotle thinks that's a that's a problematic understanding of realism so Aristotle's conclusion is that abstract definitions right and you know when we say what is a circle it's not that there's an actual shape of a circle an ideal you know form of circle somewhere and then we look at it clearly we do do this comparative thing that Plato is talking about where we say that's a good circle and that's a bad circle and we are comparing it in some way to how well it conforms to something but Aristotle's presumption is that the the ideal is really the basic definition right these are abstract definitions circle is a two-dimensional geometric shape with flowing circumference all points are an equal distance from a common century and so on but that doesn't have any concrete existence until it manifests in matter and basically let's see I always this is I think the best way for me I can need to grab a piece of fabric hold on give me one second no problem all right ready to perform my magic all right so Aristotle's relationship is Aristotle introduces a distinction between matter and form obviously Plato distinguished matter from form but Plato's matter seems kind of like amorphous clay right it sort of has substances whereas Aristotle's insight which I think is an intriguing insight is that he said the problem is even if we take an amorphous blob of something let's say it's like clay so the problem is clay has properties already and these are already forms or universals or repeatable properties like density and shape and mass and things like that and so he says the problem is you've already got form and you've already got form inside of it if even if it's amorphous right and so Aristotle's conclusion is what matter is what matter truly is once you get past like basic elements and things like that is just the potential to be something matter is pure potential it is nothing in itself it is just potentially something and the way this ends up playing out in terms of realism is that Aristotle's presumption is that any concrete object any object whatsoever there doesn't matter how basic or amorphous or anything it is is a combination of matter and form it's a hylomorphic right which is hula from which is the the Greek for matter morphe which is the Greek for form right so it's a hylomorphic something and the question is what are the forms that it has and so the idea is you know we can imagine that this is Aristotelian matter right it's potentially spherical it's potentially you know cubicle it's potentially takes on a human shape and basically how that potential is realized is you know you take a shape right something like that and you actually like put it inside of it and voila right that form is now concretely manifest in the matter and Aristotle would point out the form doesn't actually belong to the matter it's manifest in the matter but the matter is not actually the shape it's just taken on the shape the shape belongs to the thing that's communicating in that and so Aristotle would say that the forms right the abstract natures that we identify that the mind abstracts from matter that's what the word abstraction means the mind perceives something there takes it out of it and now it's you know in the mind you suggest well that's that's what's going on there right that's community that that form has taken up residence inside of matter and that's why matter now concretely manifests that property but that's also and that's what generation is right so generation whenever you're talking about a plant growing or a fetus growing or whatever it is it's the process it's the draping process right it's matter has had a form put into it and it's starting to conform to that and manifest it concretely abnormalities corruptions are things like that are things where the matter hasn't properly manifest the form and corruption in the sense of you know generation moving into being corruption is the process of removing the form from the matter and it going back to potentially something so that's Aristotelian moderate realism in a nutshell and so that's that's kind of the basic difference all right so two forms of realism there moderate realism extreme realism and one of the problems you ran into now that all of this was a backdrop to say that one of the things that the western medieval's eventually started to realize specifically John Van Scotus was a critical one in this was they started to realize you know what reality in the way we talk is a hundred percent about forms it's about universals so what is an individual and they realize that their entire philosophy whether it was extreme realist or as moderate realist the only things that were real were universals repeatable properties but the individual seemed to be something unique and non-repeatable it seems kind of weird and counterintuitive to suggest that there can be a second Nathan right or dr. Jacobs right whatever Nathan Jacobs or that there can be a second Paul now we can imagine there being a replica of you that looks exactly like you in every way and we're confused just like in every you know sci-fi movie where we don't know which one's the clone and which one's real right you know but but at the end of day it's still intuitive that there's not two of you right one of them is not you which one is the real Paul right like that's always the dilemma that starts to emerge here right how do we figure out that and and so the problem was you know SCOTUS in particular thought it's really problematic you know if we're going to say for example well what makes it what makes it the individual is that it's this particular lump of matter and SCOTUS like matter isn't really a thing and then we've already introduced something that's not universal because we've just we're sort of begging the question right this particular lump of matter if we say it's the exact combination of properties like it's just this unique combination of properties we open the door to this oddity that you could replicate the individual you know and so and and then the alternative was suggesting like well maybe we go into this this maybe the alternative is that it's this unique set of properties which includes everything that's ever happened historically and spatially right so we're a super essentialist right where every property is essential to you but that gets you into this weird counterintuitive thing like really I I couldn't have been born at a different time right like I couldn't have done because now you're getting into determinism question so if I didn't do that I wouldn't be me and all of these things seem to be intuitively problematic and so SCOTUS ends up coming up with what he calls hexayitas right which is basically the thisness of the thing and he introduces what's the one non-repeatable property right and so what is hexayitas hexayitas is the property of being this and not that and interestingly SCOTUS does this partially because he says I don't know if we could even have a Trinity without having that as a feature of reality and the reason SCOTUS recognizes this is because when individuals are products of let's say in extreme realism how do you get multiple individuals of the same type well you need matter right because there's only one of the ideal now we get multiple of that individual by making material copies okay well how do you get you know multiple okay so let's say we get rid of that and we go with moderate realism well you still need matter in order to do that because matter you stick them in there right that's how you get multiple of the same kind and SCOTUS recognized well in this in Trinitarian theology of God who's above matter and so if you say God's a form right a pure form like he's the form of the good for example then you've got the problem that you can't have more than one of him and so you have the Trinitarian problem which incidentally this is sort of the basis of why Augustine's like I don't know what a person is because he's an extreme realist and God is the form of the good and so how he can't he can't there can't be multiple individuals because there's no matter up there right once you get up to the forms your past matter all this so that's part of Augustine's problem Boethius recognized the same problem Boethius incidentally in terms of western treatise treatises on the Trinity Boethius is my favorite because he goes through all the same problems that Augustine goes through then explains why he can't get to a trinity and then basically says yeah so basically none of my solutions work so I hope you found this treatise helpful okay appreciate your honesty there anyway but but and so SCOTUS is recognizing matter is not an option multiple forms are not an option and so the only solution SCOTUS can come up with is that there is a form or a nature essence God and there are three discrete individuals that have a three three discrete instances of hexaeotos right that have that nature and since hexaeotos does not matter nor is it a conglomeration of forms all of which would be problematic from you know theological perspectives because God is simple right he's not a conglomeration of anything and and he's not material right all those things are off the table SCOTUS says hexaeotos is the only real solution to this trinitarian dilemma now the reason I go through all that because SCOTUS is sort of late medieval scholastic right um he's not an early writer you know in western theology is because I think SCOTUS is the one who gets you closest to to what you've already got going on in all those eastern writers earlier so um to jump back this has been a very long aside I love it I love it I'm part of my channel is gonna eat this okay well great because of course there's the Jordan Peterson stuff that kind of launched me but a lot of people are following the work of John Verbeke and he has this he's doing this 50 part YouTube series on cognitive science and all this stuff so okay keep going great okay so jumping back then to the eastern writers the basic formulation that you have in the trinitarian discussions when the Nicene Constantinople discussions is is this this term huppasis and the question being what does that term mean okay so by way of context here what you have is in the initial discussion between Athanasius of Alexandria and Eris of Alexandria at Nicaea the first question is just we've got we've got these two different individuals right we've got God and then we've got this son of God that's shown up and pretty much by this point everybody's nobody's really going you know I think the real solution is Sibelianism and they're not different like everybody's sort of been past that we're like no you know that's not right they're definitely different um but then the question is are are do are they the same type of thing right or do they have the same nature and this is the homo ucia right we see it being one one of the many terms for a nature essence or universal right repeatable properties sort of thing universal like human so is are they homo ucia right or are they homo ucia and basically Athanasius is saying they're homo ucia they are the same type of thing just like paul and nathan are the same type thing they're both human and areas is saying they're homo ucia which is basically to say they're kind of alike you know the son of God's really God-like you know very powerful but he's a creature right and this is areas is basic distinction uh here and basically Nicaea is all about saying areas is wrong no they are the same type of thing the son of God is divine right he is God um now just as an aside there one of the reasons I say divine is because I think a big part of the confusion in contemporary western discussions about the trinity is most people use the word God to mean an individual which is very New Testament um when you talk about God right you're talking about God the father you're talking about this individual with the Greek writers they had an advantage where they could drop the definite article and to indicate what they mean right so um so definite articles indefinite articles which you didn't have right you just didn't have the definite article um you could say ha theos and we now know we're talking about God the father an individual concrete you know person which we haven't defined uh or we drop it as just theos and now it's the divine nature it's an abstract nature and we can use it as a predicate so when we say that the son is God really I think the problem is by using just God in both instances is English it's misleading because we don't have that way of dropping the definite article so I think it's actually closer to say things like um they're saying you know Jesus is divine just like God is and by God there you mean the father um anyway uh but that's a big that's a big deal it is big it is a big deal right um because I think it's a big part of the confusion I think a lot of people in trinitarian discussions are thinking somehow you've got three guys who you're collapsing into one guy and I'm trying to figure out how this fourth guy is three guys there's no fourth guy uh and that's a big part of the the confusion uh so anyway um but then at Constantinople one of the issues you're running into is um you're running into the question of well okay so like what does that mean to say that you've got two and they're both uh God and this is where I find these first opening discussions right these first two councils to be fascinating in terms of what they tell you about how the eastern church fathers and ancients generally think about language um they one of the things that I think is very different about the way the ancients think and the way a lot of contemporary people think is that the ancients very clearly don't indigenize words and ideas and what I mean by that is we have such a tendency uh in our sort of anthropology you know but having been influenced by anthropology and sociology to tend to indigenize ideas that's a greek idea and that's a jewish idea and that's a chinese idea I don't know you know pick whatever it is but you indigenize ideas and um and I think one of the things that's fascinating is that in the ancient world they don't do that right uh first of all in terms of language itself they tend to see language as signposts right so you know if I had a marker I'd write the word uh you know God on my hand right and you could you know point it to that right and they'd be like nope that's a misapplied sign post right that's no God at all right and so you'd have that but the whole point is at the end of the day they don't really care what's written on the signposts they're not talking about the signposts they're concerned about this thing right um and and you see this for example in in the very homo-o-sia discussion right if ever there was going to be an insistence that the signposts is what really matters it would be in the homo-o-sia versus homo-o-sia but people like Basil of Caesarea you know talking after Nicaea actually says I don't have a problem with homo-o-sia as a word uh and what he means is he says oh sometimes you'll say that two things are like and you mean they're exactly the same and he says so he says so at the end of the day there's nothing wrong with the word the problem is what Arius meant by it right and so here he's saying like the word is not the problem like this sign post could be used to point to either same type of thing or not same type of thing and the problem is Arius was using it to point to not the same type of thing so we'll go ahead and just like from now on we only use that as a bad word that only points to the not same type of thing but I mean you could point it to that and it'd be fine but we'll do that and the same thing happens in the Constantinople discussion so uh the terms huppasus and hucea right so anybody who's familiar with trinitarian theology of three something and one something uh typically translated like three persons and one you know nature or substance or essence depending on who's doing the translating and those are all based on the latin equivalents of these terms but the greek terms that are being used in this discussion are huppasus and hucea and one of the things that's interesting is huppasus and hucea are synonyms prior to Constantinople in just greek language generally so um hucea what is the pre-Constantinople definition of hucea well it could in report refer to an individual nathan a species human or a genus animal right what's the pre-Constantinople definition of huppasus could point to an individual nathan to a species human or to a genus animal and what happens is basil actually says basil of caesarea says in one of his letters he says oh I know everybody's totally confused nobody knows what anybody's talking about because some people are talking about three huppasus and three you know one you know some people are talking about three huppasus some are talking about three oceJI some people are talking about one oce�� some people are talking about three huppasik nobody knows nobody knows what anybody's saying and even what's fascinating here is a historical n fica actually anath Destanages anybody who says that there are three more than one usra or more than one hypotheses. Now they're anathematizing that because they're recognizing these are equivalent terms for the nature essence and they've just said that Arius is wrong and the son and the father have the same nature. There's only one nature that they share so you can't say that that's not true. Well then what happens in Constantinople they end up saying, right, what would be anathematized under Constantinople, which is that there's three hypotheses but that's because they've So Basil actually says from now on, forget it, we will never again use the word usia in any other way than to mean the nature, right, the species or the genus. Species or the genus and huppasus from now on only means the individual and that way everybody's clear and you see this definitive change in language which is fascinating. I think this is fascinating to see the fluidity of the language there and that they don't sort of see that they recognize the difference between the words you're using and what they're pointing to, right, and I think that's something that's getting lost. We're so attuned to branding marketing. Well I think it's, I don't know, I don't think I would say it's nominal because at the end of the day what the concern is is that there's something real, right. I would say they're concerned with the fact that underneath the words there's something real and I think this is the big, incidentally I'd say in a lot of the contemporary discussions, what's intuitively at play is a divide in political discussions, social discussions, there's a divide between people who really are nominalists, right. They really do think that when they say that certain things like, you know, pick your soup du jour of contemporary disputes, right, when they say this is a social construct or that is a social construct, what they mean is society or mind or language or whatever has drawn a fence around something but the fence isn't real, right, and they're nominalists and other people are going, I'm pretty sure it's real, and I think that's really what you see. What you see in the contemporary society is an absolute rift between realists and nominalists and incidentally I'll just say one of the reasons, I mean, whenever I'm talking to people about religious epistemology and why do you believe this or that, for me realism is actually one of the basic starting points so it's not as if I start with Bible and then I go there. One of the, you know, uncompromising features in my worldview is realism and the reason is because I think nominalism is unlivable because all you have to do is wait for a nominalism. I can't even find a way to articulate nominalism without contradicting myself, right, so there are only individuals not universals. Well, I've just made individual into a universal category, right. There are only, there's just material objects not, okay, well I've just said matter is this thing that they all participate in. There's no way of really articulating it and even reason itself, logic itself, sorry for this aside, but logic itself is based on realism from what I can tell so when I say, you know, yeah, all A's are B's and all B's are C's, therefore all A's are C's, what I'm doing is I'm dealing in groups, right, and the problem is you can't make logical argument without those sorts of groupings so at the end of the day if you're going to argue for nominalism the only way to do it is by employing realism because you're going to do it in a logical fashion so I think, I think nominalism is just incoherent and utterly breaks down and collapses under any level of scrutiny. Anyway, putting that aside, back to the Trinitarian discussion. So what you get in the Trinitarian discussion is an insistence that, you know, what the Trinity is when you're saying that the son and the father are homo seia, what you're really saying is that you have three discrete individuals, right, and those three individuals have a common nature and so, so, you know, as much as everybody's always perplexed by Trinitarian theology and it sounds coherent and unconsensical, give me any example of something that, you know, does that, okay, here's the Trinity, right, this is an individual, this is an individual, that's an individual, and they're all the same type of thing and I could do that or I could grab three of my books, if I had a third person here we could point to us and in fact they do do that, Basil says, read on one of his letters, does that, you know, you know, we've got Peter, Paul, and James, yep, that's, and even Gregory of Nyssa does that in his famous letter to Oblabius who, Oblabius asks him, he goes, like, it sounds like three gods because if I understand what a hypostasis is, Peter, you know, Peter, Paul, and James, I forget that those are probably not the names he used, but going offhand, he says Peter, Paul, and James, these are, these are, these are three individuals and they're common nature human and so that would be, I call these three humans so we do we believe in three gods, right, and Gregory has a response to that but I think what's fascinating is the very fact that Oblabius asked that means that's exactly what they mean by that because Gregory doesn't come back and say no, no, no, that's not what those terms mean, he goes on and levels of defense why it's not tritheism, which indicates, yeah, that's, that's what those terms mean and so, yeah, pick three apples, pick three roses, go grab three dogs, right, whatever, there's your, your trinity. Now of course everybody gets hot and bothered by this because they go that's, that's tritheism and all this sort of stuff, basic answer to that in these guys is that they say no polytheism believes in, and so this is where the Trinitarians end up differentiating themselves from monotheists of a certain kind, they say we're not Jews, right, like if you want, if you want to talk about Jewish monotheism that's not our view, we're not that kind of monotheist, we're monotheists but not that kind, and then they'd say and we're not polytheists, so they recognize that their Trinitarianism is unique relative to the other theisms and the difference they'd say is that polytheists believe that God, the word God is a genus and there are multiple species and then multiple individuals within those species, they say that's what polytheism is because theos or divinity is multiple, right, there are various types of natures that are worthy of the name God, right, some of these are aquatics, some of these are celestial, so they have different powers, activities, all this, they'd say well those are all different species of things and they would say we don't believe that, we think there's only one nature that's worthy of the name God, right, you're describing things that sound an awful lot like angels or you know principalities of powers something like that but that's not God, and so they'd say you're creature worshippers, you're not like, and hence polytheists because you believe in all these different natures, we don't believe that, so we side with the monotheists in the sense that there's only one nature worthy of the name God and we even agree with the Jews about what that nature is like and all that sort of stuff but at the end of the day where we and the Jews differ is that the Jews believe only one individual has that nature, right, and that's the guy who we refer to as God and he has a name but I won't say it and you're not supposed to say it right and then and but we think God has a son and you know he generates the son, he gets the son and he inspires the spirit and all that sort of stuff so so that's where they'd say so that's where we're unique because we think there's three individuals who have this nature, okay, and then in terms of you know the big question mark becomes well how do you differentiate these individuals and that's where we go into all the differences between God and creatures in this whole thing, you know creatures are materially separated bodies, they're distinguished by things like color and size and location and spatial situation and things like that and they would say well none of that applies to God and they would say so the thing is you have individuals who are distinct, absolutely distinct, but not separate because separate is a category of spatial bodies, right, material bodies and you don't have that with God so you have distinction not separation which in terms of logic, math, all that sorts of things that makes complete sense, right, there's distinction without separation all the time in terms of various real categories assuming you think that mathematics are real which I tend to think they are so anyway that's where you get into that sort of that's sort of way of doing okay so that's the backdrop for Trinitarian theology which then when you get into Christology also is critical because they're starting to talk about well the Son of God then takes on flesh and becomes human so now you've got it fully God and you've got fully man and how does this work and when you look through all the controversies a lot of what is going on there is there's an attempt to compromise some part of the human nature in order to sort of stick them together right so Polynarianism well let's get rid of the human mind and then like maybe we stick the divine in there and now we've got our human person right or or okay that didn't work that was condemned as heretical so let's let's we get rid of the human will and so it's we stick the divine in there and they're always trying to replace something but the thing where they always came back to was that the nature of a thing and the person having at the individual subject are distinct and that's where the unity of Christ is it's not that you need to get rid of some part right of one of the nature so that you can lock them together like a puzzle piece it's that he has those two natures and I think Cyril of Alexandria offered perhaps the most helpful analogy for doing this Contra Nestorius the heretic Nestorius which was that which was that he said you or me human persons we already are individuals who have two very different natures I can sit here and I can talk about the distinct nature of your soul versus the nature of your body you know one is immaterial and subtle and doesn't have mass and you know is hairless and is you know whatever doesn't have color right whatever and then I can set up contrary properties contradictory properties with your body and Cyril says but that's no problem because you know they're not the same sub right there's they're distinct they're distinct natures with contrary properties but they're held together by in the same individual and he says and you know what it's like to have two contrary natures that you harmoniously use without ever thinking about the difference and they hold together just fine it's no problem he says that's basically what you're talking about in the person of Christ it's the person having the two natures that uses them both simultaneously and harmoniously without a problem just as you do and it's so that's why that's why both natures can be perfectly preserved without you know sort of mutilating either one to make room for the other or something like that because it's the person having them that creates the room for that so anyway all of that is a backdrop to the question of person very very long prelude terrific one I think a lot of people will very much appreciate what you just ran through well thanks I hope so I think one of the things that you start to find is that there is a critical difference basically what they're they're recognizing is that they're you're saying there's really three components whenever you're talking about an individual any individual doesn't have to be a human individual right and I think this is part of part of the problem in the West person is always the operative term and because once you introduce personhood we start to associate it with rationality thinking decision-making free will and that's partially due to the modernist turn and Descartes and you know basically it's defined as a thinking substance right you start to have a separate category of person versus individual whereas for the Eastern Christians who really did far more work than any of the ancient philosophy for them and in fleshing out the concept of a hypothesis and what is an individual you don't really have much philosophical work going on on that because it's not as important in the pagan philosophies whereas with the Eastern fathers basically they don't have a differentiation between this who posses and this who posses this is an individual and this is an individual we don't have a separate category for this individual now the question becomes well so is there no difference between you and a razor pretty obviously some significant differences between being a razor but that's where they would say those differences come down to the nature that I have and so this is why they what they see what they see going on is that whenever you're dealing with an individual you have the discrete individual business right Nathan you have the material that belongs to that individual now this is with creatures it would not assign material to the divine who posses but you have the any creature including angels they would say have the material right that potential to be something that material is what underwrites the possibility of change in us right so we change size we change color right we can become virtuous we can become vicious right well all these sorts of you know we can become stronger weaker grow in health decline in sickness all those things are underwritten by matter and the fact that it can receive and grow in certain properties and diminish and release certain properties so the individual doesn't change but the matter that the individual has is what underwrites the possibility of that individual becoming other than what he or she or it currently is and then the third thing it has is properties and then here you have sort of subsets right you have the essential properties the things that make it species that it is right to you and I have the essential properties of human which is bipedal ten-fingered to I to ear you know all this sort of stuff rationality all those things free will all of these properties but then we also have accidental properties right these properties that come and go and have nothing to do with the species we are so we're different colors that doesn't matter right that's irrelevant it's accidental just as two circles that are you know ones orange ones blue it doesn't matter right they're both circles because color is accidental to them so in the same way the color difference between you and me is irrelevant and you know the size difference between us the location difference between us all those sorts of things all of that you know and even relational differences social situations and whatever it is all that it's it's accidental but the real right the real properties there's no doubt about the fact that you know I have you know my size or my mass is a real property it's just irrelevant to whether I'm human and so that's where yeah so that's what you end up having the the discrete individual which endures underneath all of it the material which underwrites the potential change to be other than it is and then the properties that you know that basically are in the thing and those include essential properties which are there and can't be gotten rid of and the accidental properties which come and go because they're irrelevant to what in fact we are and so you know so I would say that would be the basic structure if you were talking about a very basic structure from Eastern propersis the Eastern orthodox perspective on what you know and I'll skip the word person because I think it's too loaded I think it is too much baggage that's what you would say it is right the individual and that's why we can say this is an individual and this is an individual but when you say well does that mean that this has all the same like you know level of dignity that I have or something like that or value that I have or whatever term you want to throw out there I don't like throwing out rights because I think that's a dicey term that's under defined but you know but but okay is is there no difference well surely there is but it's not located in the first point whether we're individuals nor in the second point that we're material and potentially other you know in certain ways than what we are it's located in the third one the essential properties that we have I'm human and it's not right and that's the underlying and that's the that's the real essential difference between us and that's where you start to get hierarchy differences the great chain of beings or just stuff which we could go into if we wanted but I mean basically they presume that you know animals have certain properties that are superior to the properties of plants and plants have properties that are superior to rocks and humans have unique properties that set them apart from rest of the animals and they presume that this almost is right when you know he says that we're created a little lower than angels so the angels have properties that are superior to us and so on so they have this sort of hierarchy of ontology which again has nothing to do with the first category of hypothesis being individual second category of matter we all have that it all has to do with the third category of what are the properties essential properties we have what is our nature and that's what underlies you know underwrites all that so when we come down back to our touring test and when we come back to this question of nuns who are trying to they are trying to locate themselves in the great scheme of things and they are trying to look they are positing an unreliable narrator they are positing an author I mean because what again what fascinates me about the nuns to bring this all the way back to where we started is that the so one of the things I was thinking about this morning when I was thinking about this conversation and this topic we're gonna have it's interesting that the nuns on one hand would say in let's say in the movie life itself I can I can tolerate and understand and even an even affirm a an impersonal script writer that would in a sense justify a horrendous tragedy that seems at the moment to be wasteful pointless and arbitrary or a good that is achieved later even though quite frankly we the categories get very strange when they imagine that because there's authorship going on there when I looked at the movie I thought well that's a lovely thing for human beings who possess agency imagine ourselves as authors to say wow an impersonal thing just came up with this thing right there's I mean there's a lot going in here and so and a function of this seemed to me to be also a question of of time and because I think part of what has happened for human beings is that or in our culture is that consciousness has changed in that in terms of our our value system so to posit a divine agent who witnesses this horrendous arbitrary thing that any of us would say a house burning down a car accident something that could be avoidable right for some for some future good that somehow within the evaluator because there's always someone who's doing the evaluating I mean it's it's exactly this exchange where all of this stuff comes in is what kind of a person could God be that would let my uncle die in this fire when we would imagine send it an angel to just you know take the cigarette out of his mouth and put it in an ashtray right right yeah and well and I think one of the underdefined areas there is what is meant by the term good and I think it's inherently a utilitarian understanding of good right so classical utilitarian ism it measures goodness by pleasure and pain right so happiness they're like well let's get rid of this abstract term happiness which had actually a pretty well-defined you know meaning in a lot of ancient philosophy and medieval philosophy and and let's just go with straight quantifiable pleasure pain and and so utilitarian ism tends to say well you wedge you you weigh the good or bad of decisions and things like that based on the outcomes of how much it increases pleasure and decreases pain and then you get into the question of whether the utility I should be primarily concerned just about my pleasure pain my happiness or the broader you know society so it's sort of this you know communal utilitarian ism because looking at life itself there's very clearly some characters for which it does not pan out so but it's kind of like well those diminished you know painful bad things right they're okay because what they flower into over here is so good you can embrace it whereas if you look at the term good and evil I think from a realist perspective good as a very specific meaning good and evil the presumption is that what a thing is right it's formal cause to use there go back to Aristotle right Aristotle talks about four different types of causes formal cause what a thing is material cause of what it's made and efficient cause how it comes about or into existence and for final cause a wire for what in it exists and the easiest things are things like ears you know a properly formed ear formal cause has as its end to here right a properly formed eye has this is and see and this is part of how you can tell that it's moving you know you know moving in the right direction in terms of formal causality you know becoming what it's supposed to be and and looking at that that applies even to humans right so it's a pretty common thing you know when you're labeled a philosopher you go to a party what do you do I'm a philosopher what's the meaning of life and everybody laughs but why is that not a worthwhile question is there a better question why is that a joke is it shouldn't be a joke and one of the big questions that you know the philosophers are really answering I think this is one of the things that's often missed not by philosophers themselves who study ancient philosophy but one thing people don't realize about the philosophers the philosophers were not just like sitting there contemplating weird questions for no reason they wanted to know how do I live and the only way to answer how do I live is to answer questions like where do we come from what are we why are we here what am I right and you know if what am I does that tell me why I am and for what purpose I am and so in other words like everything was ultimately practical these seemingly impractical questions had practical ends in terms of what it means to live a good life and and this is you know and so anyway the way that plans out in terms of talking about good and evil for an individual is to say that there's a presumption in the realist that you actually do have proper ends for which you exist and you know and live and your choices can either move you toward that or away from it that's what is sort of weird about humans I don't know how often people actually reflect on how strange it is that we have the ability to you know rationally intellectually assess things and then make decisions about whether we want them or not right presumably bees don't sit there and go what am I for what end does a bee exist do I want to conform to that end or not it just does right like it just does what it is right whereas humans have this extremely bizarre capacity to reflect on the proper end of a thing identify the course of action that would bring it toward their proper den and then choose whether it wants to do that or not that's so weird there's nothing else in the cosmos that does that that's absolutely bizarre and yet this is exactly why the philosophers think philosophy is so important because at the end of the day how you define good or evil has to do with identifying what the thing is what end it exists for which it exists and then moving toward that accordingly and they thought that was just as true for me as a human as a whole as it is for an eye or for a nose or for an ear right the difference is those being involuntary organisms and sort of considered in themselves just develop into that right and then start doing what they do and so the point of all that is to say that for the Eastern fathers the way they flesh this out which as I said this will be the perspective from which I'm always dealing with these questions is is that the big problem with something like life itself is that there are multiple characters who never achieve their proper end so the problem with this sort of way of talking about good and talking about all these different converging things that somehow result in this flowering of good really what you're saying is you see a pleasant pleasing circumstance for a certain group of people but from the they would see is the real problem is that may be fine we could first would have to assess whether just because it's pleasant and you know flourishing and fits the sort of life you might like whether that in fact means it's good there are a lot a lot of lifestyles or life situations we might want that might not actually be for our good but the other problem is you look back and there's very clearly characters who of course if we stop the narrative at death which is a big part of the question let's presume their narrative ends with their death good just because the nuns don't know what happens at death most of them admit that's the one thing they really don't have a stance on well the problem is that character clearly did not that individual never reached their final end so the good was never realized for them they were divergent from the good of whatever human supposed to be and and then they died divergent from that proper end now of course the sleight of hand here is that I haven't defined what the proper end of humanity is right but I think it's pretty obvious that nearly losing your mind and being ultimately you know wildly depressed and not wanting to live is probably not the end for which you may let's say we're gonna leave this big question of what is the end for which humanity exists over here just like unanswered for a moment but we could probably get a pretty quick tip to the hat from everybody to say it's probably not that right like we shouldn't strive to be wildly depressed and not want to live okay okay so in that case I can think of at least one character in that film that does not achieve their proper end and so at the end of the day when you start to talk about this the big problem is that is that you have this this good over here that we're talking about this that this all flowers into does not address the fact that this individual never achieved the good now I do you think of course the critique that opens up here is that people can say well that's too individualistic right you're thinking in two individualistic terms and you have to think in more cosmic or global or whatever terms right about humanity the planet and the cosmos I would say the Eastern Fathers have that concept too right they they have a very much a concept of redemption and salvation and proper end for the entire cosmos their view of the Christian religion and of salvation and the you know all of this does culminate in something that's not primarily just for man and then you blow up the cosmos right it really does include the salvation of the entire cosmos you know plants animals all this sort of stuff and that's a complicated topic that we could talk about but at least just just recognizing that they have that but they don't think that ever justifies the sort of sacrifice of individuals right you know the cosmos is composed of individuals and so it's not just sort of saying well we'll sacrifice a bunch of individuals who never confirm form to the good as long as we get this one like sort of outcome up here right that would be that would be Thanos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to snap his fingers and we've got two we've got who did this guy's math we're gonna kill half the pandas cuz we got sorry he is my favorite character I think he's wildly wrong but I appreciate his rationalism no I mean you're right it is it is this Thanos logic right that says look at the end of the day we're just gonna have to kill off a bunch of people you know but at least the future generations that survive it will be grateful and I'm the only one who's willing to do what needs to be done here right really he went to war with everyone because he's the only one willing I guess him and his head spin you know you're right well I very much I very much appreciate you laying that out because you know part of what's happening part of what's happening I mean some of what I've stumbled into is a a Renaissance if you will let me back this up I have so many thoughts that just came in it apart so you're you're a movie maker and it's it's interesting because when you think about a movie like life itself which is a which is a beautiful film just as just as you said movie watching always has implicit within it I'm sure movie makers have worked on this the the subject we watch the movie and we watch the movie through the camera and that that obviously guides not only some you know the perspective that we have of the events within the movie but also the evaluations and so just like you said this this one person who in in in almost anyone's estimation did not achieve her end her sacrifice achieves a particular end and also with most American films the the value system reflects well what is of the highest value well you know romance romances of the highest value right right to soulmates can find each other and you know we'll cut the film imagine they live happily ever after I mean absolutely the movie the movie creates a world much of which we may or may not be conscious of and are not necessarily invited to evaluate and part of what has happened in our culture part of the reason why people might joke oh you're philosopher what's the meaning of life that we're we're too busy watching movie after movie as John Verbeke would say following I think it's Frank for bullshitting ourselves with all of this stimulation and entertainment so as to not pause and say maybe there is a an end for which I was created what what might the decisions of my what how might my daily decisions pursue such an end what kinds of disciplines might I need in life and and then in that process actually beginning to construct a life that has meaning and purpose and ends mm-hmm yeah yeah and I here's where I'd say like there's three sort of components to this that again offer some these aren't obviously we'd be here for a very long time if I fleshed out a full like here's Eastern Patristic worldview and all of this stuff but I think there's three things that are somewhat informative that that are at least initial seeds of a different perspective on this than what you might get from say life itself and you know one of those is the how critical realism actually is to the answering of those questions so it's presumed that it's recognized that for example your eye right your eye is composed it's not a simple right there's talk of God being simple and then creatures are not simple and that probably sounds weird and people like what does that mean and basically all it means is something that's complex is composed of multiple parts right or more importantly a complex nature is composed of multiple subnatures so your eye we can talk truthfully about the nature of an eye that holds to that that is a real thing right eyes that's an eye that's an eye that's that's a real thing that's a real nature but it's a complex nature in the sense that it holds together within it a series of subnatures so your eyes have you know retina which is one type of you know one type of thing subnature you've got you know veins you've got you know animal cells and they're right you've got all these sorts of things that are also themselves or natures unto themselves and that are shared right with other types of things animal cells are not unique just to your eye right we can find them throughout your entire body so it's not unique to an eye so it's a complex nature because it is something that holds together a series of sub lower natures and and and incidentally one of the reasons that people like Basil of Caesarea presume that there's a sort of ontological depth to the reality is that they recognize that it's not it they don't know how far that reality goes down and that's why they presume there's a wall in terms of our epistemology how much do we really know about what a thing is because they recognize we know certain basic things about what it is but that keeps them they presume that just keeps on going down and there's a depth of ontology would be one way of putting it to what things are but what they did recognize is that when you identify that when you ask the question what is the final end or call it final cause the telos right the the the end for which I think exists like an eye one of the key questions is what sets it apart as unique right so when Aristotle would define things his process for providing a definition was that you identified as genus and then you identified specific difference and by genus we don't use genus and species have been using these terms but in philosophy and Aristotelian logic that's that's just sort of large group small group it's not you know kingdom high on class order to able to genus species sort of stuff that's used in science that's totally different sort of cataloging system so for Aristotle right you would say the reason he identifies man as a rational animal is because he says animal is the genus right that's the largest that's the larger group not the largest largest might be you know being right or creature right or something like that but it's large group is animal that's the genus and then it's specific difference what sets it apart from the it's rational now of course Eastern fathers like Basil would say there's far more to the definition of man that's a nice starting point to differentiate it but there's a whole bunch more to what makes you human to human but the reason Aristotle is concerned with genus and specific differences specific difference tells you the proper end of the thing because animal cells in your eye are shared with a whole bunch of other things so the animal cells don't really tell you much about what its proper end is but once you get to the capacity to see now you've reached something that sets it apart from an ear or from a nose or some other organ in your body and this of course becomes the foundation of natural law ethics right because you're getting into these issues of saying what is the proper use of a thing and and the good of the thing is tied with its you know nature and its proper use anyway this is this is one of I but I think that's a critical concept putting aside whether you would buy wholesale everything that's in natural law ethics I think the insight of natural law ethics is critical and and here I should do a little aside natural ethics sometimes is treated like it's consequentialism like don't have sex kids because you get STDs like that is not natural law ethics at all actually natural law ethics have to do with things like don't scrape your eyeballs kids because that'll pinder their ability to see that would be natural law ethics or even interesting things like don't eat that weird food that has been engineered in such a way that it has no caloric impact because essentially what you're doing is you're trying to harness the pleasure of eating which is a byproduct while undercutting nutrition which is the primary end for which you have a digestive system so anyway it gets more into things like that right though that's natural law ethics it's much more philosophically astute than just consequentialism which is sort of a John Locke nominalist form of natural law ethics which isn't really natural law it's consequentialism but anyway so I think one of the things one of the components in there is that the realism which I mentioned as I think is critical to the entire worldview of the Eastern Christian writers and which I think is just a critical distinction in general and a lot of the conversations going on is also critical to how you begin to address these questions of what is the end for which you know I exist it's and that's why Aristotle was so concerned with specific difference because it includes reason being primary has to have something to do with the fact that we're humans our proper end because that's what sets humans apart from other things and that's why Aristotle would probably be inclined to say sex is probably much less important because there's lots of animals that have sex now of course the characters say therefore sex has no part in human exists and that's not again it's not natural law ethics right nor is it realist ethics it's just saying that whatever the hierarchy of goods and however we begin to work that out that question needs to recognize the primacy of reason as the unique feature of humanity primacy of reason free choice those sorts of abstract thinking those sorts of things so I think that's one component that is is helpful and begins to push against the sort of utilitarian just whatever life circumstances you know happiest we have they fall in love right and they have kids and that's great right and we're all pleased with it now and we can go home and and I I think I think a realist pursuit of the question of the good right the good specifically for human beings but also for the Cosmo has to be realist in orientation I think it offers a much more substantive assessment of those things I think the other thing is that's critical is the question of where you cut off the narrative and this is why I think the death problem is a real big problem the fact that certain characters in their die without ever achieving happiness is a big big problem right and I would say that one of the things that I find fascinating about the Eastern Fathers is that their narrative of the pursuit or God's pursuit of the good right like so let's let's take this as you know the life itself versus you know the Eastern patristic God the life it's life itself ends up it stops pursuing the narrative stop pursuing the good of an individual the second they die right like it's over and now we continue on with the continuing living things right whereas an Eastern patristic thought the pursuit of the individual is good never stops right it is an in perpetuity pursuit and you could see this in a couple of interesting I think counterintuitive or shouldn't say counterintuitive mmm things that would be alien to Western sort of Christian narratives many Western Christian traditions one of the things that's I give two examples here the one example of this is is when Maximus the confessor one of these church fathers he he talks about Christ descent into Hades right so this is in second Peter where it talks about Peter's letter where he talks about Christ preaching to those who rebelled in the time of Noah and in the early church this was understood as Christ dies right gives up his soul and his soul goes where well to the realm of the dead I mean Hades right and Hades just meant the realm of the dead so he went wherever dead people go right should be relatively uncontroversial but he died he goes it's almost tautological right you can't he went wherever dead people go and so and part of that is Holy Saturday is the celebration of this this narrative of Christ going into Hades and preaching to all the other dead and declaring who he is and the gospel of Christianity and all this sort of stuff anyway Peter this is how Peter was understood when it talks about this and in second Peter right that he preached to those who rebelled in the time of Noah that those people are long dead and he goes and he preaches to them and they're sort of a snapshot of all the people who have died before that and are in Hades and then rebelled and all that but one of the things that's interesting in Maximus's treatment of this as he points out the the one of the passages I think it's like second Peter 4 6 or something like that he talks about Peter also talks about they were judged in the flesh according to men in order that they may live in spirit according to God or something like that it's some sort of formulation like that and the way Maximus interprets that is he says unlike sort of the let's say the average sort of evangelical presumption that you know all these really bad people who were doing really bad things in the time of Noah God drowned him because they're really bad and now they're in hell right like and that's and they'll be punished forever for all the things they did. Maximus interprets this as they were already punished for being horrible people. How? They were drowned. That's not good enough for you. Like people get upset about waterboarding. How about just drowning like and so and but the but this is where the idea of the unmaking of humanity is a critical step in the redemption of man in Eastern petristic thought. So the presumption is that man has in some way been corrupted this is you know there's something that's gone awry in our nature. It's not the original sin doctrine of Augustine but it's still something that's corrupt that makes us basically inclined to do things we shouldn't do right and that manifests in all sorts of different ways. Some people are sexual perverts that's how it manifests. Some people are you know hot-headed and inclined toward anger that's how it turns some people are inclined toward gluttony. All of these are just distortions of our nature where we have impulses or passions that incline us in directions we shouldn't be inclined and we tend to submit to those and the presumption is that a big part of remaking us right this the hope of the resurrection from the dead is that you first have to unmake us and undo that corruption and so the death of the body is the sending back to the body to its basic elements in order to unmake it right and the only thing that's left is the one thing that's not soluble with the soul. Now of course the soul needs to be converted it needs to be turned back to God it needs to be corrected and and part ways with its various the corruptions that it's been accustomed to and that it's desired and that it's committed to and recognize the true good which is God and order things accordingly otherwise you're just going to be corrupted all over again. Now the reason that's important is because they presume part of the thing that Maximus talks about here is that basically the people who were in rebellion were unmade. All right, Louis talks about this in the space trilogy when one of the angels are talking to the the scientists who are corrupt and evil right who have landed on their planet and one of the angels says well if you were my man I would unmake you in order to remake you right and that's what he says right he says something along those lines. Louis being very influenced by the Eastern Fathers is attuned to these sorts of nuances in their thinking. Anyway what's fascinating is that how Maximus interprets the they were judged in the flesh as men or that they may live according to God is the idea that they converted that they were unmade in the rebellion and could no longer act on any of their corruption or passions or any of these things like this and they sat in darkness until the Son of God appeared to them and preached to them and they now had the ability to repents and be redeemed so that in the resurrection they could actually be remade as they were created to be. And I think one of the reasons that's a fascinating nuance is because if you think for example of like Moses and Pharaoh right Moses is this warning about destruction and being hard-hearted toward God and all this sort of stuff but for them the death of Pharaoh may well be the only way to actually fix someone like Pharaoh because it may be that the only way someone like Pharaoh who believes himself to be a God can ever find his his pride can truly be broken such that he recognizes he is no God at all would be for him to be unmade and be completely unable to act on any of his desires wants passions any of those sorts of things. So that's one element to it where I think one of the things that's fascinating is how the Eastern Fathers interpret all these ultus and passages and things like that about wrath as they see it a redemptive intent similar to life itself in the sense that it's always driving toward the good but the difference is it's driving toward the good meaning of that individual every individual every creature becoming what it's supposed to be relentlessly even if it means like in the case of Pharaoh or in the case of those who drowned in rebellion in the time of Noah that that unmaking the creature is you know an inevitability in terms of the only you know way forward in terms of redeeming them so that's one component where I think it's fascinating that the extending of the narrative out of their story out is is critical to how they see meaning in those things and I think the other thing is in terms of another example of this is one of the things you begin to see in their understanding of eschatology and future judgment heaven hell those sorts of things for the Eastern Fathers very much they tend to see heaven and hell not so much as places locations they see them as states or conditions of the soul right so Chris system for example says he has no need of a place called heaven when he can become heaven right this is where they see the critical statement of Christ being the kingdom of God is within you right they see this this is that's where paradise is Chris isn't them again and his homily on the thing it's called the cross in the graveyard something like that he's talking about the thief on the cross who Christ says today you'll be with me in paradise but then Chris some says but he's right when he's resurrected he says he he hasn't ascended to see his father right wherever that is he's he says so where has he been he's been in the realm of the dead so how was he in paradise and Chris's answer is he was with Christ and you know wherever Christ is his paradise this is why being even in Hades with the Son of God is paradise right this sort of thing and similarly in terms of hell then you have the inverse right where you take a you take a creature that is miserable you know you see this I always found this fascinating I don't know if you remember the A&E show intervention right but you have these addicts right and they'd be they'd be interviewing them before the intervention they'd say oh I'm miserable I'd be better off dead you know all this sort of stuff and then people would intervene they'd say how dare you and that was always the weird thing and then they'd also think about like I'm not sure I want to be clean which was also very bizarre right because you're like you were just saying you're miserable you'd be better off dead and so on but I'm so attached to this I don't know if I want life without it which is weird thing and basically the their whole point is if you take someone like that who is in a living hell stick them in the city with streaks of gold they're still in hell right like it doesn't matter where they are and similarly you know with Saints you take them and you put them out in the desert and the desert becomes paradise for them because it doesn't matter where they are the where the location is matter of indifference so one of the reasons I think that's important is because even in the Eastern Church you see differences amongst many of the Eastern Fathers on the question of whether or not eventually all will be redeemed universal salvation thing which was sort of a big controversy and it's a big controversy in the East partially because it's one of those things that's well I'll take the risk of saying it's never really fully settled in the Eastern Church right it's oftentimes thought of as condemned and over and settled because of the condemnation of the originists at Constantinople 2 but anyway there's there's there's reason to think that that is not a full-blown condemnation of universal salvation in all its forms originistic apokarastasis it's you was basically Hindu right the souls transcend matter and disappear back into God right it was a very specific form of universal salvation that was considered problematic and Justinian submitted anathemas for consideration before the council one of which actually condemned universal salvation in all its forms and the council's actual anathemas did not adopt that anathema in its form which some have taken people like Callistus where have taken to indicate that this is because the council did not see all forms of universal salvation it's problematic hence you have people like st. Gregory of Nyssa who is a canonized saint but it believes in universal salvation right that's for the thing anyway this is one of those things where universal salvation gets into this weird gray area where it seems to be it's not dogma it's most certainly not dogma in the Eastern Orthodox Church it's a minority position for sure right in the Eastern Orthodox Church but it seems to be an open question in the Eastern Orthodox Church they don't know right and even when you look at like the ransacking of Hades the Eastern fathers on that right Christ preaching to those in Hades you have some who seem to talk as if Christ you know liberated the dead and for that reason nobody's left right and all you know were ultimately redeemed some seem to think that nope anybody who was down there and rebelled wanted to rebelled and they continued to rebel even though the only person keeping them there was them right and then some seem to hold the middle ground where it's like well anybody who wanted out could get out right at that point and and there's sort of this gradation anyway it's not really a subtle question but one of the things that's fascinating about it is if you put aside the people who are sympathetic toward universal salvation and you just look at the Eastern patristic writers who are who definitively think universal salvation is false right one of the things that you find is you find that first of all they think anybody who is damned right the state of damnation in that state of misery is damned by choice right this is the hell is locked from the inside sort of doctrine so someone like Christ Stem who is clearly opposed to universal salvation in his treatment of the unpardonable sin passage in the New Testament where Christ talks about the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit which is this unpardonable sin Christ Stem points out that Christ never says that it is per se unpardonable meaning of such a kind that it could not in principle be pardoned Christ says it won't be pardoned and Chris systems interpretation of this is that it is in principle pardonable there's nothing about it that's worse than any of these other sins that are pardoned it's just that those who commit it you know which is basically the sin is identifying the good as in some way demonic or evil which is what you know the Pharisees were doing in those passages has in some ways willfully you know rejected the good and can't see it anymore and don't want it anymore and that's and and there's no way to turn back to God when that's the condition you're in because God is the good and so Chris systems conclusion even though he opposed universal salvation pretty clearly thinks hell is locked from the inside right those people are in a damnable state because they can no longer see the good and they perpetually reject it and this is one of the reasons why one of the things that comes out in certain fathers is sort of subtle but you start to look at enough passages in the Eastern and British writers is that they seem to think what is the case is that all are raised you know God gives himself to all the veil of the divine glory is sort of lifted and Christ shines into the world but it is the subjective condition of the individual that determines their experience of it for those who are in a condition who love God right it's it's it's pleasant and it's desirable and for those who do not it's unpleasant right and so the idea being that there is a subjective experience that's different an objective condition that's that's different all have been redeemed right Christ has redeemed all raised all and all this stuff but it's the condition of the individual that determines whether that's desirable or undesirable now the reason I think that's that's interesting is because when you begin to look at this question of redemption and the pursuit of individuals really what you begin to see when you bring those two things together is even for the folks who well even for the folks who reject universal salvation hell right the eternity of hell is really an equilibrium between God's refusal to abandon a creature to its own devices it continues to uphold its existence continues to beckon it to the good continues to give himself to it and call it back to the good refuses to destroy it because that would be to abandon and hope of it ever changing its proper end and the creature refusing to ever embrace its good and so even in the reality of hell you have with certain of these fathers that they see a redemptive intent there right the this equilibrium emerging out of the perpetual pursuit of the creature and the creatures perpetual retreat so what I find fascinating they're taking these two examples together is what you begin to find when you look at these Eastern fathers is you see they extend the narrative not only beyond death right they they they see it extended out in perpetuity because ultimately they see the characters each individual's your story my story not just being about this life but even death itself can be part of the redemptive story of the creature and then even in the eschaton for those who still under the presumption you either have people who think ultimately this has to pan out where all do achieve their good right and you have a universal salvation folks like greater missus or you have people who don't think it pans out that way but they still believe as part of the picture of the eschaton is this perpetual pursuit of the creature and it's only because of the creatures refusal to embrace its redemption but you know how it becomes reality so I I would say I know that's a very long and complex sort of picture I I think it's an important difference between the life itself picture which has a very thin this worldly finite temporary picture of happiness right people get married like what happens to a couple okay so they they got married they're happy they have kids they're thrilled and then what you know they don't grow old they don't get Alzheimer's right like they don't you know cancer doesn't set in at any point that mental illness and mom didn't get into the daughter right like it's a you look at that and go okay so you basically what you have is you sliver of goodness for a certain snapshot right and your hope is that that sliver that snapshot is enough to make up for all this other craziness that we've just seen down here that was required in order to get us there but there is no sort of lasting the good whereas the contrast of course are to simplify it is the Easter Patristic view is that the good of each individual and of every component of the cosmos is is critical to the narrative but the difference is that though the achievement of that good is not limited to this world nor does death even mark the end of the narrative for the individual the true narrative extends really really far down the road and I think this is probably clearest as just a in this long monologue I've been doing with this is that there's this doctrine you know the eighth day doctrine that you see in a lot of the Eastern fathers and it's because one of the things they recognize that is that in the Genesis narrative there's the setting out to make man and unlike a lot of the other components of the narrative it doesn't seem that making man has ever completed and this comes through and things like God saying let us make man in our own image and according to our likeness money makes man in his own image and likeness is not repeated and it's presumed the likeness is something more something that has to be actively entered into right this is the good right so the image provides the grounding ontology what we are that allows us to move toward our good but the likeness is the actual active entrance into it and because man is never fully made there and one of the things also in the narrative is the seventh day isn't closed right so in all the narrative you have this beginning and end all these days and then the seventh day never closes it comes out that they think we're in the seventh day though in other words Genesis sets up this narrative that what we are still in is the making of man which also in their theology is critical to the making of the rest of the cosmos too which that's the part I for what because it's more complicated and you know probably would be a totally different conversation sometime but what what that that allows you to see is to look at the whole of our own stories and the cosmic story and history as part of one long creation narrative that is still in process and still has not culminated and that's where that's that's I think sort of the thing that really begins to capture the Eastern patristic worldview is that we are all part of this making of man that takes place the incarnation is part of the making a man resurrection is part of the making a man our own individual stories are part of the making a man our death and our unmaking is part of the making of man and none of it culminates until we really get to the resurrection from the dead and the redemption of not just all of humanity but also of the cosmos right and all that so anyway it's a much it's a much more robust narrative than these people got together and were happy for this sliver in time and so all this other horrific stuff is is okay unfortunately the boy there's you we're running up into a time deadline that I didn't think we'd even get close to happy about that I'll say okay good good and because this has been very helpful for me there's so much more I'd love to because I mean the whole I mean I because you've given me a really nice introduction into and I'm sure it's just a sliver into the Eastern patristics and this is very helpful for me and I think a lot of people will find it very interesting but there are many you know when it comes to so so I am NOT I try to keep reminding people I am NOT a philosopher I am NOT a theologian I'm a and what that means is I live in this intersection between all these folks going to life itself and saying I just found myself in that film that's right and me saying how much of you is there really for yourself can't you can't you just with just a little bit of I mean even the deconstruction that's being offered to you by almost everybody on a street corner today deconstruct a little bit of this vision that was presented to you and suggest perhaps there is something more to you and you should want more than than than just this you know and and I think in some ways the the you know the this moment right now with respect to the nuns I know any s clear on that he's gonna leave thinking about those women and habits I've gotten that one numerous times yeah but you know there's there's so much here to dig through and I know you have a time commitment so yeah I wouldn't imagine we'd go for almost almost two and a half hours and things unsaid but yeah I I feel that way because this question about the nuns is very much and in even the question about persons because this question this this representation they have in their mind about what Christianity asserts the God is yeah yeah yeah yeah well maybe we'll have to have a second conversation yeah or a third I guess technically this this would be our second conversation the reason I wanted to have that first conversation was I want at least for those who are willing to sit through hours of video which people on my channel clearly are I wanted them to know that for you this you're not just some egghead that is nerdy about books but what brought you here to read Basil and Chrysostom and all of these Eastern Patristics is in fact the question at a party that says so what's the meaning of life how should I live my life right yeah and and you're right that is that is the case right and anybody who listens the other podcasts you watch coming to a human will know that for me this was not this was not an academic exercise in order to ask these questions and read all this in fact it's one of the reasons why if you look at my academic career my publishing record my degrees all that sort of stuff it's a very it's a very poor cobbled together way of building a career if you want to build a career right like it's very clear like you you kill it on the you know the ACTs and you go off to Harvard and you know you get the right degrees and then you pick a very narrow focus that nobody cares about and you write about that very narrow thing for the rest of your life and slowly climb your way up the tenure track and so and one of the reasons my resume and academic career looks so mishmash is because it really wasn't driven by building a career it was built it was driven entirely by the questions right the questions of you know does God exist do we have free will why are we here how ought I to live all those sorts of questions and and the roads I wandered through you know as we talked about were not very conventional right and they were driven by this is where I'm very sympathetic to a lot of the questions that you find with the nuns because I was a nun not the kind with a habit but I was one of those nuns and my hang-ups on the problem of evil divine hiddenness right can you trust God is God capricious all those sorts of things those sorts of issues I recognized as as pivotal issues and I never went to the full-blown you know karma fate impersonal God but I certainly once we are a form of pantheism and you know process philosophy is a form pantheism panentheism you know so yeah so you're right for me this was not it's not like I just went to college and I took a class and we read some Eastern Church fathers and I thought hmm I want to be a classicist when I grow up and it started reading certain guys in Greek it was a it was a much more existential journey for me that was very twisty and turning until it actually settled right it's settled in Eastern Orthodoxy and and that's one of the reasons I always speak from that perspective because it's where I landed and what I found to be most satisfying in terms of the various I use data points when we talked right this idea that what science does is it takes a series of data points and then the hypothesis is the way of coming up with the coherent way of dealing with those you know in many ways that was the sort of methodology I was doing with worldview issues and eventually that led me down the road to Eastern Orthodoxy so yeah it's definitely not an academic exercise you're correct I'm not an egghead with a love of books clearly and but it's it's also it's wedded to your life right and the questions have been driving you and I'm I'm blessed that you've been driven this way even if it's kind of a messy way to make a career and I hope that but I hope that you can take this stuff because I mean part of my point here is that life itself is life itself is what people the movie life itself is what people are imbibing and that is forming and shaping and that that has implications ramifications and consequences all around us yeah and it's helpful to have I think a better informed a better informed better informed people also shaping film I mean of course this is I graduate of Calvin College this is what Calvin College is supposed to be about right all right you have to go I do have to go you're right you're right Paul but I am I'm happy to continue this conversation again some time should you want to pick up and and and see what loose ends we can tie up oh there's there's people how will you spend eternity well I don't know what eternity feels like but I see a lot of good things to do so great but thank you for your time my pleasure Paul and we'll swap emails and figure something out sounds good all right thanks bye bye bye
