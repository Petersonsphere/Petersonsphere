 Hi, this is Paul, and this is part of my Rough Draft for Sunday series, where I walk through, as a practice run, the sermon that I'm going to preach this Sunday. And this Sunday is Palm Sunday, and I'm going to begin by playing this little selective attention test that those of you who are watching this channel, because you've watched Jordan Peterson videos, you're already well aware of, and you're aware that the point is that we don't see a lot, and in fact we miss a lot of things. And this is very true, especially of a holiday like Palm Sunday. Palm Sunday for preachers poses a special challenge, because the story is really fairly simple and clear. Not always as clear as we imagine. One of the things that I like to do often, if I want to get an idea of the zeitgeist, which is kind of the spirit of the age, is I go to Google and I'll do an image search on something. And so these are the things that come up for Palm Sunday, where you have palms and you've got some Sunday school pictures of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey, or something from a movie, and so what we know about Palm Sunday and what people identify with Palm Sunday are waving these palms. And so this is the story, and this year we're telling it out of Mark. As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples saying to them, Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, what are you doing, say, the Lord needs it, and he will send it back here shortly. Then they found a colt outside in the street tied to a doorway. As they tied it, some people standing there asked, what are you doing untying that colt? They answered that, they answered as Jesus had told them, and the people let them go. When they brought the colt to Jesus and they threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road while others spread branches they had cut in the fields. Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, Hosanna, blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David, Hosanna in the highest. Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the 12th. Now this is one of four tellings of this Sunday that you'll find in the Gospels. And this is Mark's telling. Now, Mark has a special, one of the things that we do as preachers, especially with Matthew, Mark, and Luke, we compare the wording of them. And one of the things that you can see is if you line them side by side, you'll see, oh, this is interesting. They kind of follow the same story. There are some interesting details at the end in terms of what's happening, which day, how it goes, but you'll also find word selection differences. One of the things you might notice that in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, there's no mention of palms. They get mentioned in John. So what we tend to do is we tend to take all the different elements of it and put it together in kind of a mental composite picture. And that's what gets acted out on Palm Sunday. Now what people who have studied the Bible have known for a long time is that there's an interesting relationship between Matthew, Mark, and Luke. Here Mark is in the center. Matthew is over on this side and Luke is on this side. And everything with this particular kind of reddish color comes from Mark. And you can see that the gray here, at least in this chart, is found nowhere else. So gray stuff here is unique to Matthew. Gray stuff here is unique to Luke. And then there's stuff that's common in Matthew and Luke and that isn't in Mark. And this has led to what is, this has led to the supposition by many people that Luke, for example, when he starts his Gospel says that he gathered together sources, that Mark was one of the sources, and that what's often called Q or source is the other source, the source that Matthew and Luke had in common. And then we assume Luke perhaps had sources other than those two sources that he accumulated into his book. And even though the Gospel of Matthew doesn't say so, the assumption is that the author of the Gospel of Matthew did similar things. Now Christian tradition has held that the Gospel of Mark, that the Mark who wrote the Gospel of Mark was a disciple of Peter. And so Mark wrote this Gospel based on the stories and the preaching that Peter would do. And so he wrote it down and then it gets, it's shared and used by the other two. Now in our sermon series we've been talking about covenant. And covenant tries to bridge this communication gulf that we have between ourselves and God. If you consider the kind of being that would be responsible for the creation of the rich, deep and enormously complex universe that we live in, how could that being in fact communicate with us and how could that being communicate with us in a substantive way and in a meaningful way and ways that impact how we live our lives and what we do and what we do with ourselves. And part of what we have to face in this is that even through a text we begin to recognize that we just read through this text and then we saw the story and we have the cult and the asking and he rides on it and then they come in and they wave branches. What we begin to see is that in fact even the telling of the story we have this composite telling of the story that is filtered through and that there's selection bias, there's awareness issues, there's all of these kinds of things. Never, never mind the fact that the text was written thousands of years ago and that there's been almost nonstop conversation in the world about these texts ever since they were known and on and on and here we go and we think well how on earth can God get through all this clutter and then you have the church reality where churches are celebrating this Sunday and we do so kind of to reenact the palm branches and some churches that are large and have lots of money, they might even have a bring in a donkey into the sanctuary and this somehow is supposed to pull all the pieces together about how we and God can relate. Now one of the, what often happens when you preach a sermon is you have your own attention issues that I can't talk about all of the text or we would be here all day in fact in any given text like this we could go a very long time talking about it. There is no other book in all of human history that has been as studied as the Bible, that has been as talked about as the Bible, has been as dissected as the Bible and many of you who don't sit in a study and open up books about a passage are not aware of all that we could go into with respect to this passage but in the context of this creator God trying to connect with the rebellious world one of the details I'd like to focus on this morning is the unwritten cult and in fact this is kind of an interesting tiny little tidbit which is actually a really big deal in terms of the conversation that we're having because the question is how can this creator God connect with this rebellious world and so one of the elements that we have to deal with in this conversation is wildness or chaos and in fact what's fascinating about this so as with all these modern tools contemporary tools that we have to study the Bible this is a little screen capture from my Bible study software you find this little footnote after the English translation which no one has ever written and if you mouse over it it gives three references one to Numbers 19, one to Deuteronomy 21 and one to 1 Samuel 6, 7 now in the interest of time I won't go into all three passages but they're all very interesting passages the Deuteronomy 21 passage is a passage that details how a town can make atonement for an unsolved murder and those are what the editors put in on top of the English Bible to help us understand it if someone is slain lying in a field in the land the Lord your God is giving you now right there that selection of the language God is contextualizing his entire land that he's laying claim to and now someone has been murdered and nobody knows well it's probably not true that nobody knows who did it someone knows who did it God knows who did it but it's an unsolved murder and you can't figure it out and so the idea is that some something here has happened the way the world should be has been violated if you go back over the number of the sermons the covenant that happened at the end of Noah is God said all of the bloodshed that has happened in this world I'd like it to stop God rescues Noah but then establishes a covenant says look I'll maintain the firmament if you stop killing each other well we haven't stopped killing each other in fact killing each other continues and here's a case where someone has been murdered and nobody wants to fess up and so what should a town do and in a sense what God is saying is that this town is responsible for the individual this town is responsible for for this murder and how will this town be able to stand before God and give an account for themselves if in fact someone has been murdered and nobody is fessing up and and they can't solve the crime well your elders and your judges shall go out the measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns find the closest town the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and never worn a yoke and lead it down into a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is no where there is a flowing stream there in the valley they are to break the heifer's neck now now this gets into this entire picture that we've kind of been looking at the relationship between the people's lives and the animals lives and again and again we see that when people don't do what's right the animals suffer and so here this heifer takes the blow for the town it's a substitution and and now it's really interesting is that this heifer needs to be it's not wild he's domesticated but he's a borderline animal and and where he's never been broken well what does that mean now most of us are city dwellers and we're not you know we're not accustomed to this but if you've ever had a cat or a dog that you have to train you recognize that there's a certain degree of wildness even in this domesticated animal that you must you must take out of him and and so it's interesting that you take this heifer that's never been yoked and you take it to a field that isn't plowed where there's a stream running through it in a sense you're you're passing from civilization out into chaos out into nature and here the execution must happen that's really fascinating why what's the deal with the wildness in the world and god's claim over it and our pain and our paying and and our paying attention to this wildness what's the relationship it brings to mind cs lewis's chronicles of narnia and the talk about aslan and and and the children wondering is he safe and and no he's not safe he's well is he wild well he's he's kind of wild he's when if you think of wild as being not in control of itself aslan is fully in control of himself but he's not tame he's not subjugated by us and so this heifer that has not been subjugated goes by us goes into a land which is which is in a sense not subjugated by us and that heifer takes the blow similar thing happens or an interesting thing happens in first samuel 6 where the the philistines have to get the the ark of the covenant back to israel because it's it's bringing disease and chaos and destruction and so they thought they could take it as a as a trophy of their victory over israel now they just want to get rid of it and so here they're given instructions now then get a new cart with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked so so here again the calves are kind of in this this liminal space between between chaos or wilderness and between civilization and hitch the cows to the cart but take their calves away and pen them up now the the natural thing to happen would be that you could heart you could barely get these cows yoked in order to pull a cart they've not been trained to pull a cart they don't there's no expectation that there's every expectation that these two cows even with a rider would likely be unable to take a cart at least without a great deal of effort because they've never been broken and then they've got this desire to go back to their calves because they've just given birth but then of course it's these two calves or these two cows that then take the ark of the lord and put it on the cart and the chest beside it put the golden objects these are the offerings that they're giving them and let it go and they took the two cows and hitch them to the cart and then the cows go lowing happily to the israelite town and so the philistines very instinctively understand that this is the this this is god's doing this is god's doing this is wild this is someone who has power over the wilderness now now what's interesting is that jesus again is going into jerusalem and and this has great symbolic meaning jerusalem just isn't any other city this is the city that hosts the temple that that is in a sense the the embassy the sub temple to the great temple above the sky where the ruler of the world resides and israel isn't just another people it's it's his chosen people and the donkey isn't just another conveyance this is the these are the um the mounts of the kings of israel david rides rides the rides the donkeys and solomon rides the donkeys and so jesus is sitting in their in their place and so this this palm sunday passage is just simply rich with meaning um symbolic meaning that connects it to how many different old testament passages which gives us preachers uh something different to talk about every year as we have to go through the passage we talk about the psalms association with the hosanna we talk about the zechariah association we talk about all of this but but notice again how luke how luke frames it and only luke he has peace in heaven and glory in the highest and this that is a contrast to the birth story where the shepherds are out in the field and the angels are singing peace on earth and goodwill towards men so the shepherds hear from the angels peace on earth which is a way of blessing a way of expressing well a way of expressing blessing it's a it's a you know it's a greeting as it were and now earth in palm sunday in the reception of jesus to jerusalem responds to heaven and it's it's the embodiment of of heaven and earth being set right and the kingdom of god coming where the blessings that heaven gives earth are now reciprocated by us and given back towards heaven but but what's interesting is that although this passage is rich with the symbolic it's also rich with this this idea of of of god and jesus as the ruler of creation and a little bit later and at least luke's account um the the the the the pharisees rebuke jesus say teacher rebuke your disciples um and jesus says if they cry out if they keep quiet the stones will cry out now stones don't cry out stones don't talk stones are there but the the the jesus is saying that what is happening now is of such significance that nature herself would respond if the people the people who are per the genesis story the the stewards the viceroys of earth we are the ones who have language we are the ones who are supposed to verbally respond to heaven we are the ones who are supposed to act on behalf of god to the earth and we are the ones that are supposed to speak on behalf of the earth to heaven and so jesus says if if the children and if the if my followers didn't cry out the stones would cry well well what stones are these well these are actually the stones of the temple that that the the entire cosmos from the the inanimate stuff would find voice and and the logos who is christ as we see from the beginning of john the the logos would would be received by logos would be received by speech and then actually after this jesus makes the comment and he weeps over jerusalem that not one stone will be left on another and this is this is a prophecy about the destruction of the temple now now what's amazing about this is that this picture that we have from now where is the temptation see this is why i practice because what i realized when i was going through this is that i wanted to make a point about the gospel of mark and the wild animals and i i was waiting for that slide to come up and i didn't see it come up because i failed to put it in well it's interesting in the gospel of mark that for example when you look at the temptations a story which which you can find in matthew and mark and luke the shortest version is in mark but one of the things that mark decides to include is that and he was in the wilderness 40 days again the symbolic meaning of 40 days being tempted by satan and he was with the wild animals luke doesn't see fit to include this matthew doesn't see fit to include this but mark mark the gospel that has jesus fighting satan and jesus you know encountering the the forces of chaos and evil and jesus mastery over creation when jesus is in the wilderness he's there with the wild animals and and this is a picture of well pre-lapsarian creation this is a picture of jesus with the wild animals and for you jordan peterson people if you look at jonathan peugeot he'll jonathan will work this um work this imagery jesus and the wild animals and and this is where you have the sense of the lion and the lamb both both bow before him and jesus here in this space just like we saw in the old testament with these stories jesus here in this space so when he rides the colt the the one that has never been ridden now any of you out there who work with horses and and break animals for for human service know that animals need to be broken animals need to be trained well jesus doesn't train this animal it's not his animal and in the entire story you know there's lots of layers to that story where you know it's almost kind of like a jedi mind trick this is not the the master has need of this colt um jesus is master in this and jesus is is being received as he truly is now recognized by the great city of jerusalem and and so this is in many ways well this is a triumphal entry and and again many of us in our in our culture don't understand this but anyone in the roman empire would have understood what a triumph is it is when the great general comes back to the capital after defeating the enemies after a victory now we jump ahead i think the person that that probably articulated this best was c.s lewis in his book and miracles where he talks about miracles of the new creation and he talks about walking on water for example in the walking on water we see the relations of spirit and nature so altered that nature can be made to do whatever spirit pleases and this this lewis intimates and i think the bible intimates is that you know this is what happens in the fall that we rebel against god and nature's nature does likewise against us and and so here with with with creation restored nature is once again the servant of the steward who is in perfect obedience to the master and and so when jesus has received jesus nature receives jesus as her master and so jesus miracles are not violations of nature but actually the subjugation of nature but the the willing subjugation of nature where nature recognizes its author recognizes its master and humbly and happily serves its master and so the walking on water we see the relationship of spirit and nature so altered that nature can be made to do whatever spirit pleases this new obedience of nature is of course not to be separated even in thought from the spirit's own obedience to the father of spirits apart from that proviso such obedience by nature if it were possible would result in chaos now now in terms of my jordan peterson conversations this is this is the material vision the evil dream of magic arises from finite spirits long to get that power without paying the price the evil reality of lawless applied science which is magic sun and air now go back and look at alchemy and newton and you know newton anyway that's that this won't be in the it's probably won't be in the sermon not what i mean i mean alchemy and newton and all the jordan peterson talk although you can probably see that it's there's stuff behind here in this i do not know how radically nature herself evil reality of lawless applied science which is magic sun and air is actually reducing large tracts of nature due to disorder and sterility at this very moment i do not know how radically nature herself would need to be altered to make her thus obedient to spirits when spirits have become wholly obedient to their source one thing at least we must observe if we are in fact spirits not nature's offspring then then there must be some point probably the brain at which created at which created spirit even now can produce effects on matter not by manipulation or techniques but simply by the wish to do so if that was what was meant by magic then magic is a reality manifested every day every time you move your hand or think of thought and nature as we have seen is not destroyed but rather perfected by her servitude and so so louis's thought here and that what we see on palm sunday is that jesus comes riding into jerusalem as as master of innocence momentarily within that little place renewed perfect relationship renewed perfected creation the people rejoice the cult obeys the skeptics say shut the crowd up and jesus says if they were shut up the stones would give praise the temple itself would speak what must be spoken so the king of creation comes his miracles declare him the king of creation and everyone knew it we want creation however and we don't want its king and this is the story of the garden of eden we want to be kings of creation and and in fact though part of the part of the calamity of our stewardship of creation is in fact our own division because we are not together under the great king we are divided and so it's it's the clash of all of these visions that creates the turmoil and the suffering and and the chaos that we unleash so just like in genesis god doesn't destroy jesus doesn't in that moment destroy anyone who stands against him he in fact tolerates them and in fact what will come because those of you who understand palm sunday good friday easter what will come is that some in this crowd who are at least watching and perhaps cheering come the end of the week will at least watch and perhaps cry out crucify him and this is our story this is how we are this time he will face a political execution he will be killed by empire and and i don't have time to go into that but that right there is how the bible tells the story all the tensions between our rebellion against god and and god's tolerance of our rebellion yet god's slow patient work as we talked about in the sermon last week to to bring our wills to to bring us to this place where this jeremiah vision of of all of us knowing the lord and of of creation being set right and again you can go back and read jeremiah 31 and see this vision of life as it's supposed to be and that vision of course in jeremiah 31 told within the perspective of the cultural setting at which the the prophecy is given but what drives us to rebellion what drives us to refuse to worship we are tiny little pretentious beings demanding that we be the center of the universe and the main character of the story and the truth is we are not we cannot be we are simply what we are and we were made to be part of a far larger story and something deep inside of us knows that to be true so then jesus in this symbolic moment reveals himself fully publicly now now this is very interesting because in the story of the temptations the satan tempts him to to to throw himself down from the pinnacle of the temple and all of the people will see him but what's interesting is that in some ways this story is the reverse of that where jesus in fact reveals himself and he reveals himself with riding the untamed cult and he and he is revealed and he is worshiped by the crowd that is celebrating in the words of the psalmist that they use the which has i didn't go into that in this telling which has tremendous significance in terms of the coming of david and the restoration of god's kingdom and all of that comes into being so in a sense that this is jesus revealing himself but the revelation of him elicits the kind of response we would expect from a sinful world and and what's interesting here is that that rebellion is led and spoken by the religious leaders and this is something that that preachers and pastors and Christians should take deeply seriously that that it was not the case that when jesus arrived all the Pharisees and the observant of his community you know would stand with him against the Romans and the pagans those of course were the culture war lines that that that everyone understood and saw in that day but jesus in in a strange way transcends this culture war and every side hates him and just this group of people including the donkey comes to obey and to worship but that will be a decided minority that at the end of the week will be driven into hiding while the political while the political and religious powers that be take hold and crucify him which again will yield more revelation so he must receive his proper place otherwise the stones of the temple will cry out the rebellion is on full display to and and and this is this is always what happens with revelation that when the curtain is pulled back and we see god our truest nature inside of us rebels and we say no I must be king of the world I must be king of creation if I have to subject it with blows I must be in charge and that then is the story of the world all of us fighting for control we expect angel armies to put down the rebellion in a mini apocalypse now remember revelation is Greek for revelation is is apocalypse or English for Greek apocalypse is kind of like revelation or revealing the imperial the imperial Roman armies will put down Jesus hoaxed rebellion sorry I got a phone call we expect angel armies to put down the rebellion we expect that but but what happens is in fact that imperial Roman armies will put Jesus to death and and so we say well well who's really who's really on top and if you followed my Ezekiel conversations you know that this this is in a sense a redux of of what's happening in Ezekiel where the script has changed and and and those who who should be his subjects show their begrudging loyalty to Rome but also reveal their true loyalty which is really only to themselves and and and not mark but but Matthew and John will move this move this point much further when when the crowds will say we have no king but Caesar and and in reality what they're saying is we have no king but ourselves I have no king but me I do not want to obey this God I do not want to obey this man I will rebel against him and nature comes up and rebels against us and says oh oh you little center of the universe who who has this story in your head that that imagines that the entirety of of creation revolves around you your body will break down in the age of decay you will be subject to cold and to rain and to influenza and to and to how many viruses and things and you will die you are not center of the universe and we have no moral high ground over them because we are just like they are so what will we do with this will you bring your proper worship to creations king that now we imagine and you say well we bring proper worship and what what does that mean in terms of church should I should I go to church well how do you expect to worship him well I can worship him from home good you should worship him at home you should worship him with personal devotions you can you should worship him by prayer you should worship him with songs but but part of the reason that we we come together for worship is we worship him as a people in a sense as the crowd that gathered on that Palm Sunday that that rightly worshiped and and I sometimes think if we don't worship him the stones will cry out and and we and what happens when we worship is that we begin to we begin to replay this this Palm Sunday so we began looking at well we're very selective watchers we miss things we don't see things and in fact the truth is I've seen that video a number of times so I can't not see the the gorilla who comes and beats his chest and and I miss counting the basketball because I'm looking for the gorilla well what should be we be looking for on Palm Sunday and and if we believe this is true what does that mean in terms of our action should we worship this God should we come together with others and give him our gifts and give him our praise and if we don't what does this reveal about our hearts and then we have to ask ourselves the bigger question will we in fact be obedient because worship is in a sense something we formally do and let's say we go to church and we gather with the saints and we give our praises and we pray our prayers and we give our offerings and we listen to what the great king has to address us with but but worship should be 24 7 we should worship him as we work we should worship him as we speak in fact all of our words all of our actions everything we do should be in alignment with him which is exactly the picture of this of recreation where the donkey obeys gladly willingly receives his master and if the people themselves wouldn't shout the stones in the temple would cry out so how should we respond what should we do
