 Jordan Peterson did a New Year's question and answer video and two of the questions touched on church and I thought those two questions touched on church in such an important and dramatic way I wanted to make a video about them. So basically Jordan Peterson suggests church might be helpful but can't stand in himself because of the lying pastors and he said that's probably more about him than about anything else and I want to respect those comments but as a pastor I wanted to touch on them. So he made the video and Victoria Circus did a lovely job outlining the questions and I really appreciated that. That was that was a completely helpful comment. Now Peterson on church, basically my initial observations were that he absorbed the Cold War assumptions about church functions and if you listen to Peterson's Maps of Meaning course you know that his journey in many ways grew out of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation. Peterson's about my age and and he and so he was trying to figure out why these two civilizations are putting the world in peril over these ideas and so he I mean his Maps of Meaning course is basically his work to sort that out and what he what he does along the way in here especially with respect to the lying pastors comment is he articulates one of the central struggles of mythos versus material and and this is really in many ways seeded by Jesus in the Gospels and and the early church fight over over whether the Gentiles can be included and whether they must in fact be circumcised and if they must obey the dietary laws and and when Jesus says it's not what you put into your mouth that makes you clean or unclean but what comes out of your heart and and this really blew up in the in the Protestant Reformation in the fights over over sacraments and the priesthood and investment so so let's dive in let's let's take a look at the the first let's take a look at the questions and answers can we take the biblical Andrew Wells asks can we take the biblical story seriously enough with us without also keeping biblical traditions what's the psychological impact of group gathering church going before now these are two separate questions and they're they're really quite separate so the first question is can we take the Bible seriously and that gets into kind of the central the central struggle around Peterson and and when he says biblical tradition biblical traditions boy we could have a long conversation about that and then the second is the psychological value of groups I think we could take the biblical stories seriously enough but I don't think that it's particularly easy the traditions bind the community together now I'm saying that and I don't go to church you know and the reason I don't go to church is because well it drives me crazy to speak frankly I haven't been able to sit in a situation like that ever since I was well ever really that's really the truth of it ever I'm not convinced that that's a good thing because I do believe I've had good conversations about this with Jonathan Pagio I do believe that communal return to the source of the community's ethics is actually a necessary thing and maybe I'm atoning for my past sins by doing these biblical lectures at the moment which is something that's communal so and then because there's also something about going where a bunch of other people are to reaffirm your commitment to to the good that you're also all aiming at that's that's got some power in it and and I don't think that that's something that we should forego I think it's dangerous I mean look even if you're cynical about church and I guess I would put myself in that category it's it's certainly the case that communal church going in the 1950s say provided the average person with at least an hour a week where they were contemplating no matter how poorly the purpose of ethics in life and and the idea of a higher purpose and a higher meaning in life and you got to think that spending an hour a week thinking about that is better than never doing it at all so I don't know how to that tradition can be revivified in a meaningful way but I think it's I really do think it's a catastrophe that we've lost it because we don't have a center an ethical center that holds our community together and the consequence of that is that we're fragmenting quite badly so and and I think that's a that that's a classic Peterson answer it's it's self-critical it's it's it's very honest and transparent and again this these are these are some of the qualities that I think have really brought a lot of people to appreciate and love now now let's let's listen to the lying answer you said you don't go to church because the pastors are lying most of the time what do you mean by lying in this instance I don't my experience has been that they don't believe what they're saying that's what it sounds like to me that's what I mean by lying they say these things and they tell people to believe them but they don't believe them themselves and so and they're actually not listening to them they're not listening to what they're saying that's the thing that I've always had this experience in church and there's lots of other reasons I don't go to church and a lot of them have to do with me not with the insufficiency of church but you know a lot of the scriptural writings really have really hit me and I do understand some of them I think to some degree and it's it's kind of painful to hear them utilized by people who are doing it formulaically or without conviction or even worse knowing full well that they don't believe what they're saying and so that's what I mean by lying now it's important to remember that as Peterson and himself has talked about he his background is in the United Church of Canada which is a large I don't know how large it is which is a which is a mainline Protestant denomination and this is going to get us into this this entire history of the church in the Cold War and after the Cold War and then the culture war and the split and identity politics on the left and the and conservatives on the right all of this is bound into this answer that that Peterson is giving is giving right here now I'm not going to go through the answer but basically I think what Peterson offers here is a quick low-resolution history of post-war post Cold War Protestantism now now he begins with the classic articulation of the mainline of the Cold War mainline church and the function of the Cold War mainline church now don't forget that well you might not know this but church attendance as a function of population reached its height in American history during the Cold War now that often surprises people because people often imagine that the the history of the church in in in the United States and North America has been a long steady decline but that's not actually true it actually rises and falls and its height was was actually during the Cold War and that that stands to reason given that the entire nation was mobilized in an existential crisis to fight godless communism and and the implied purpose of the church therefore was ethical reinforcement within the Cold War West the church the church was there to buttress a communal whole of the civilization in the 50s that had mobilized itself against godless communism just as the generation before it had mobilized itself to fight the Germans and the Japanese during World War two now now the psychological value of church therefore within that framework was to reinforce was to reinforce ethics and I think subconsciously the reason you did that in church and you know there's for example in Washington DC a national cathedral you would never have that built after you know you would never have that built today and in fact if you go into the National Cathedral you will see the emblems of civil religion one of the things that we could talk about is is that term civil religion and and Robert Bell as essay which is worth going back and googling and reading Robert Bell as essay on civil religion and and my thesis essentially is that this we were the civil war or the culture war is a is a Christendom Civil War and what I'm going to outline here hopefully not with not too much length is why this split up after the culture war so Peterson implies articulates the implied purpose of the church as ethical reinforcement within the Cold War West but now there's a psychological value in ref in reinforcing this communally and and one of the big things that Peterson has been helpful to me as a pastor is getting is coming to terms with the roots of that the roots of that psychological dynamic that church gets into and before I saw Peterson I was doing a lot of reading of of Jonathan Haidt on that and he has come to value the Bible in this but the church doesn't live up to its alarmingly high claims and and you can hear this is in some ways echoes of Jesus was one who taught with authority and they didn't trust the teachers of the law you read that in the Gospels and there's there's a lot of Jung in Peterson I'm reading I'm reading Jung's autobiography right now and sometimes I'll find quotes in Jung's autobiography that I think boy I've heard I've heard that out of Peterson I don't know how many times now one of the things to that it's important to remember now Peterson specifically mentions the 1950s here and again this is an off-the-cuff answer so I think in a sense what you're getting from Peterson again what I appreciate about him is his transparency and his honesty and so you're getting an unarticulated kind of you're getting an architectural and archetypal stream from Peterson here and when he mentioned the 50s it's very interesting because of course the Peterson was born in the early 60s and so he doesn't even remember the 50s but the the 50s archetypally have come to represent something and so I took this picture out of a out of a book produced by the Christian Reformed Church used in its Christian schools during the during the 50s and 60s and this picture in a sense archetypally represents the ethos of early Cold War American Christianity and in fact American culture and American moral alignment if you watch Leave It to Beaver if you watch Father Knows Best this was in the American consciousness how America saw itself represented itself to itself in television in movies this was before the 60s who we imagined we were and who we imagined should be and the critical thing to know there is that in the in the early part of the Cold War there was complete alignment Christendom alignment between the church and the civilization because we lined up behind God it was during the Eisenhower administration that in God we trust gets put on the coin that one nation under God gets inserted into the gets inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance and and now and so the assumption was that the church's alignment and the culture's alignment or the church's morality and the culture's morale morality were completely aligned and so you send your children to church and people go to church in order to get ethically readjusted kind of like the chiropractor and and and set in line so the church and state and culture are all in a line now one of the one of a really good book to read about this is George Marsden's The Twilight of the American Enlightenment and George Marsden was a teacher at Calvin College before he moved on he moved on to someplace else Notre Dame or Yale that seems to where all the the Calvin College profs who hit it big-time go and and I was actually fortunate enough to have George Marsden I was a history major in in college and I was fortunate enough to have George Marsden as one of my professors but but in this book he writes about the you know in the late spring of 1960 this is just at the turning almost the turning of the tide really the 50s go from 1945 to 1965 and the 60s go from 1965 to 1975 and they more align with the the the end of the civil rights movement and the beginning of the Vietnam War movement but in the late spring of 1960 life America's immensely popular pictorial news magazine again it's pictorial that's important here claiming a readership of 25 million published a crucial US debate in five-part series on the national purpose the authors a distinguished group including not only professorial observers of the national scene headed by the legendary Walter Littman but also the men of practical affairs sociologists at this point were kind of the the gurus of the culture and so you had all of these you had all of these luminaries including you know Adley Stevenson the the egghead who ran for president and and and got defeated but also Billy Graham were among the most famous representatives of the major areas of American life it was unremarkable at the time that all the contributors were white males it was just as unremarkable that the forum included clergymen even though the clergymen the clergyman was an ardent evangelical and then and then he goes on to describe who Henry Lucy's who most of us don't know today but at that point in time was probably the most the foremost shaper of the culture now I think again Peterson knows more than he articulates here because I took his maps of meaning course and the key thing is that we we act things out and this is in fact what he's getting out at that answer is church is so crucial if you want to believe the mythology of the Bible because what what you're doing in churches you're living into the fandom you're not just you're you're you're dressing up to go to see your Star Wars movie you're you're deciding which which group in Harry Potter's universe which which part of war of Hogwarts you're gonna be are you gonna be in Hufflepuff or you're gonna be in Slytherin you know which ones are you going to embody and and and and and Jonathan Haight then Haight and I read his books you know before I discovered Jordan Peterson talks about you know the circling motion and and and Haight talks about this again and again in his books and in his videos and in his conversation with Jordan Peterson how this establishes kind of a psychological framework of sanctity and and so it was vital for for for the American government fighting its war against communism to employ the church because here we are standing against godless communism and we're aligning all of our institutions together if you if you watch for example I just watched a Wonderful Life I usually watch it every Christmas again you know look at the way that that that church functions in as the civil religion WASPY white Anglo-Saxon Protestants are in many ways the the civil religion of the country and and when they built this National Cathedral in Washington DC they fill it with emblems of the of the American civil religion during the Cold War period lined up to fight the Russians and so Christendom Cold War consensus consensus consensus but then fractures into the current culture war now now critical in this the transition is really the civil rights movement because the civil rights movement becomes the the gold standard of of ethical behavior in America and this is where we begin to see the right and the left coming apart and this is where we begin to see not one civil religion like we had in the Cold War but I would assert now two civil religions progressive liberation ism is the new ascendant civil religion of the United States and to the to to a degree Canada and Western Europe that are in some ways further down that path now now the civil rights movement what it did was was critique and and really you know question that mythic picture of the WASPY American family and all the institutions around it by shining a spotlight on how African Americans had for a hundred hundred years since the end of the Civil War been excluded from the American dream and and what is often not noted is that the church was vital in that movement it's the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. many of the civil rights leaders were pastors it's the Reverend Jesse Jackson but but but what happens is again first you act it out and so what we see is that we go from a transition of church home and school in alignment with the country's ethics and and and the government agenda now to a much more fractured society but now there's a new there's a new acting out of what ethics looks like ethics used to be going to church and sitting nicely even if you're Jordan Peterson and can't sit still in church at that you know the transition goes from going to church and sitting nicely and listening to the nice minister talk about ethics now into acting out ethics in the street now again Marsden touches on this prior to this transition Christianity properly understood and natural science properly understood and the analytics typically argued were not at odds see it is exactly there was this consensus and then in the culture war it split open now part of what Jordan Peterson is doing is trying to put them back together this is crucial Peterson is trying to remake what was split in the culture war so the 1950s Christianity science politics within the civil religion all meaningfully aligned rather truths of faith and truths of science were complementary and that they dealt with two different realms of human experience in such a basis Protestant theologians of whom Reinhold Niebuhr you've got neo-orthodoxy here you have Reinhold Niebuhr who is practice is one of the most prominent churchmen of the mid 20th century era notice how often Barack Obama would quote from Reinhold Niebuhr that's not an accident so on this basis Protestant theologians of whom Reinhold Niebuhr was the best known could be prominent voices within the liberal mainstream in Niebuhr's cases chastening words regarding the American condition could be welcomed but his generalized Christianity offered little to challenge most of the secularizing trends that he himself identified when the consensus culture collapsed in the 60s and 70s taking with it all but the vestiges of the old Protestant establishment that collapse initiated among other things a religious crisis and this will set up then the fracturing in in the West or in the United States the rise of the moral majority the decline of the church the fissure between science and religion as expressed all of this gets ripped open then formal recognition of Christianity as in public school prayers and observances declined in the same period now you have now two competing ethical and moral paradigms that are now going to be at play and get fully blown in the culture war now again first you act it out why did I don't know which Jenner this is but I guess I have no I have no Jenner cred here I don't know which Jenner this is but but this Jenner does this this commercial for Pepsi in which they you know their corporation there they're walking some lines here that they try that what they do is they embody the sacred of progressive liberationism they embody the sacred of the ascendant morality of the left and they do it in a protest but the protest is an empty protest and of course all the signs are saying you know nebulous things about love and peace and justice and and all of this and you get all of the people of the right skin tones together and of course they're all young because we've got it we you know we want to capture this market in their youth so we'll hook them on Pepsi and have them drink all their life but then of course this moment that was picked up by Twitter which was my favorite tweet of the year hold my wig Keisha I got some liberating to do um it's Jennifer and and that that tax-free hands whoever you are she just nails that moment and Pepsi gets exposed for dealing with what is sacred to the left and Pepsi has to quickly pull this off TV and of course then you know reports of Jenner being you know being crying and and feeling disabused and and you know it's just playing out in our culture if I drive from Sacramento to the Bay Area often and along the way I noticed that there's this statue what over a pedestrian bridge over route 80 and I noticed that there are statues among it and it's it's a terrible place to try to stop and one of these days I'm gonna have to stop and get my own pictures of this so I looked it up and it's um it's Berkeley's big people statue and and see again this is the left first we act it out and then we create a representation and what I noticed now these this is all about protests but notice the placards are empty in other words you can put whatever you can put whatever protest you want to but the critical thing to notice is the protest this is the updating of now if you look at the church for example in the main line on the the left the politically left Protestantism protest for many of them is now is now the height of their ethical behavior first you act it out that's what it looks like now one of the things now let's now we've dealt with the first question that that Peterson dealt with let's look at the one about the lying pastors because this gets into something deep within both the Christian Gospels and then the Protestant A couple of summers ago I went to the cliff dwellers in in southwestern in southwestern Colorado and and the docent was explaining to us how the the shaman or the holy man that you put on the mask and you put on the garments and was explaining to to us very secular people that that when they would put on the mask and the sacred garments that the person would become the god and and now right here in our cultural moment we have all of these issues that Peterson is illuminating and and the issues from which he is drawing his audience all of these issues get illuminated because we have secular say well how does putting on a mask make you a normal human being a god well it does in their cultural imaginary but but we really struggle with that and we laugh at that and we despise it because well because we know that you take off the mask and he's just a man a man who a man who has to eat a man who has to relieve himself a man who is ethically problematic and right now we get into the question of incarnation and the Christian story now if you look at the pre-reformation the two dominant Christian pre-reformation traditions they're heavily involved in materiality in the Roman Catholic Church obviously in transubstantiation and the bread and the wine become the body of Christ and again we can't we can't hear those words anymore in a pre materialist way and Peterson you know is trying to get at those kinds of ideas but it's important that these two traditions wear vestments and when these when these men who were born of women who are you know have their own moral defects and their own moral struggles but are elevated by their communities as emblematic of what their communities are trying to represent represent when they are placed then with the symbols of their office and when they are robed they become the representation of the God and in fact the split between the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic was partially clearly over language they had in famous quote they had a tizzy over a diphthong and you can Google that if you want to but but also the the question was who represents God in the Eastern Church said the patriarchs and in a sense the community does the body of Christ the Western Church said it's the heir of Peter who has the kings of the kingdom and sits on the throne of Rome and that gets into this entire question of the history of the Roman Catholic Church Constantine and that whole history but what I want to point to his now once they are vested with the clothing and the office they become the representative of the God and that then explains the the goal the cathedrals and all of this representation that happens in historic Christianity but now if you look at the Protestants you have to know something happened but yet not as much happened as we imagine now if one of the things that I like to do if you want to get into the cultural is do an image search in Google and see what Google who probably knows our culture better than we do because they're crowd sourcing it pulls up so if I just Google image search mega church pastor who do I get Joel Osteen a health and wealth a health and wealth preacher who embodies you look at Joel and Victoria they're young they're beautiful maybe I should be jealous of Joel's hair he's probably older than me but looks far younger than me has far more money than me he embodies the ideal of his congregation but now you look at some of the at the young evangelical mega church pastors do they wear vestments no mark Driscoll is there in a in a shirt and in some skinny jeans and he's teaching from the Bible without a pulpit and Stephen Furtick another mega church pastor and down here we see the the conversations about his house Creflo Dollar I grew up in if you know anything about the African-American church you would wonder why all these poor people are really struggling hard to put together money for the Cadillac of their pastor because the entire church exalts in the affluence of the pastor even if all the people are poor now generally waspy white Protestants look at that and they say oh that's that's injustice and that shouldn't be right but you're not understanding what clergy is how clergy is supposed to embody the clergy is supposed to embody the archetype now but the Protestant Reformation comes along and says oh no Luther says the priesthood of all believers but but you can see these struggles continue to be played out within Protestantism but then what America the pedophile priest scandal and this just in a sense this is that this is this is sealing the deal on the Cold War religious consensus in America because right there these priests who wear the vestments of the Lord who are supposed to embody the ideal are in if are on the side abusing children which archetypally here you are the highest ideal the priest wears vestments and embodies the ideal and then the other which is just as archetypal where this they are they are doing the the greatest almost all sexual sins have have been recategorized as free expression except for this one they are abusing children so you couldn't imagine a more archetypal issue which then becomes an archetypal movie where you have the press which now we're in classic liberalism in the West the function of the press here to to speak truth to power where the press brings down the Roman Catholic Church and to sum it all up this movie of course gets the Oscar because they absolutely nail the archetypal moment of the post-Cold War deconstruction of the church so here we have Jordan Peterson and he brings in the assumptions that are formed in the Western Cold War about the church that the church is about ethics and alignment and we understand the church because of its psychological power but but his lying pastors complaint echoes the entire sweep of modernity and in Protestant Reformation as as deconstructing as the deconstructed the passage of the traditional embodiment vestments transubstantiation to the secular age of authenticity and if you read Charles Taylor secular age you retailer talking about the reform how how now instead of having a sacramental church where you know you could well you could be shrewd in business and even unethical in business and you could have a wife and a mistress and you could violate the law all the time but as long as you go to church as long as you fulfill the ritual you sufficiently secure yourself away to heaven but there are always tensions within the Roman Catholic Church and that's where Luther comes in and kind of blows that up and in that destruction you there therefore have very clearly the iconoclasm movement where we get rid of all this material at materiality because we've acted it out and now we embody and represent it mentally this is the same transition of the physical blood sacrifice then to in the Roman Catholic Mass in a sense the sacrifice of Christ on the altar to say the low church Protestant tradition of which I come out of where we don't have an altar in church at all why because the sacrifice of Christ has been completely turned into a mental exercise that has to be displayed then in the ethical practice of my life all of the roots of this are in the Bible and and when I get into my temple talk on Genesis 1 when I finally get around to that one I will I'm gonna start fleshing some of this stuff out so there's hopefully not too long an answer to Jordan Peterson's response to Jordan Peterson's comments about church I'd love to hear what you have to think so leave me a comment and let me know
