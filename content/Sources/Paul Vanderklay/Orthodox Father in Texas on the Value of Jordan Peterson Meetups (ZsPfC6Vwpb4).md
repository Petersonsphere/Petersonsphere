 Hi this is Paul and I have the privilege today to introduce David Lewis to you and I first came across David Lewis's name when someone from my meetup in Sacramento relocated to Dallas and he said oh there's a meetup in a church right here in Dallas too and so and I thought well that's kind of interesting so David wanted to introduce yourself a little bit. Hi I'm Father David Lewis I'm at Saints Constantine and Helen Orthodox Church here in Carrollton Texas it's a suburb of Dallas it's all it's all one big mess and and I've you know I was I was first I was first introduced to Jordan Peterson through a friend over email he suggested I check him out and and I blew him off but then then Jordan Peterson sent somebody to my church like is this guy shows up in my church and and says yeah I decided that I want to raise my daughter's Christians and I said well let's talk so we met for coffee and and he he told me he told me he'd been watching some videos and and he was he was convinced that the only hope for our country was if was was a revival of of Christianity and he wanted wanted to raise his daughter's Christians and and so I thought alright if this Jordan Peterson guy is sending people to my church I'd I need to I need to check him out so you know I I I dove into the to all his videos and and it went through the biblical series all his classes that he's got I've watched all the classes and I've gotten a lot out of him I'm I'm I'm a fan of him as a as a teacher as a as a clinician I think he's a great he's a synthesizer and a popularizer he he makes things accessible to the people he's made things accessible to me that I wouldn't have encountered had it not had it not been for him and he's he's been been you know just a joy to watch and and then there's this phenomenon that started happening and and I don't remember I don't remember when it was that that I I saw I think I saw one of your first videos about about the meetup and I thought to myself well obviously I'd why wouldn't I do that so so I did exactly what you did I posted a meetup and they came and they and they've and they've been coming since February since last February almost almost 11 months now we were we were once a month for for about the first six months and then they said can can we do this more often and I said okay so we meet we meet twice a week on Saturday nights after Vespers and I don't think we've I don't think we've had fewer than ten people once yeah yeah yeah it's really amazing twice a week or twice a month I'm sorry twice a month okay yeah twice a month Saturday nights Wow Wow so you do Saturday nights yeah that's interesting I've looked at the Saturday night space and and the group was kind of yeah we'd come but it wasn't their preferred night so yeah that's interesting well it's interesting the other way I hadn't I hadn't really considered another night because it works well for my schedule because I'm I'm here at church on Saturday nights anyway we're done by six so it's you know it's a it works it works well but now we started out talking before I started recording about about the conversation I had with John Van Donk you want to share a little bit what you shared with me about that yeah absolutely I enjoyed his I enjoyed his classification his classification of the general the general fandom of the Jordan Peterson phenomenon but I I've noticed that that in my meetups there there there have been considerably fewer of the buckos then then I had maybe expected I would I would find and my guess is that has something to do with self selecting nature of meetup.com you know if you if you only advertise it this way you're only going to find people that are looking to go to a meeting about something and but we've definitely had a lot of a fair number of I'd say I'd say that mix has probably been about 50-50 Christians versus atheists and and and Christians of all stripes and atheists of all stripes yeah according to the the classification set up but but definitely definitely a lot of you know lay people who are interested in philosophy and and you know not I might take I might take issue a little bit with it's not just it's not just armchair philosophers who are who are satisfied who are tickled by by JBP's anti-postmodern rants there there's also there's also this group who sort of sees him as a defender of the Christian West and and you know sort of it's a it's like it's like a part of the culture war you know the the the intramural civil civil war and Christianity that you've talked about yeah yeah I think it's a good way to put it we get a lot of we get a lot of those people too now you're you're in Texas so you're in the Bible Belt which probably makes some of the sampling of people you're getting a bit different than say Sacramento California over here on the left coast yeah we've we probably have a higher percentage of skeptics but so so what have you done in your meetups do you have a program that you do or do you just know no the first several months the first several months oh all I did was suggest that we introduce ourselves and and and maybe and maybe say how you got interested in Jordan Peterson and that generally took two hours it was my experience too we and I've talked I've talked to other priests in my in my diocese about this and you know told them told them what I'm doing and I've tried I've tried to tell them look you don't you don't have to do anything all you have to do is provide a space give people an opportunity like this conversation is happening that's right like people are talking about Christianity and philosophy and culture in this really interesting way this in and in a sustained way like the conversation keeps happening that's right and it's happening whether we're involved in it or not that's right and but we but we could be involved that's right why would we this is why it's a no-brainer this is what blows me away when I try to talk to other CRC pastors about it I'm like just open your door you don't even have to be an expert but just let them talk then have the conversation and be available that's all you need to do and you know on my this is this is my defense against the incessant meddler charge on on my on my meetup post you know I promised that there would be that there would be no sell there would there be no pressure and I've kept to that you can you can ask Dustin if he'll back me up but you know invariably at some point during during a meeting somebody's gonna say well what about this and you know turn you know ask me a question about Christianity and you know so yeah but but it's just part of the conversation and really I've gotten more out of I'm pretty sure I've gotten more out of this than anybody else has I've it's really been a joy to to meet all of these people it's been fun having these conversations like it reminded me of my grad school days when when when you know conversations like this were were you falling off the wall at you and it's because because you were you were surrounded by that sort of person and you know it's been a while and you know I'm a dad with four kids and you know don't I don't have I don't have time for that sort of thing anymore but all of a sudden I get to talk about this really cool stuff that's right and and then I'm learning a lot of stuff that I'd never encountered before not just from not just from Peterson and the other IDW guys although you know I've really enjoyed Jonathan Haidt and the blogging heads guys and you know podcasting and and YouTube has really has really changed the way I the way I encounter information in the last couple years and it really started with Peterson but it's it's spread past that but but aside from them I learned a lot from the people who come to the meetups it's just been a really great time but I always tell the people at the meetups I I'll say you know I I talk a lot on my videos if you want to hear what I have to think you just listen to my videos but when it comes to the meetup I want to hear from them and I learn I learn so much every time and so I usually do we usually have kind of our regular two-hour meeting and then at the end of the two hours I announce time and say okay well we've been here two hours anybody who loves to leave they can always leave whenever they wanted to anyway that kind of gives permission people permission a time to leave but like last night we started at four I was a little late in closing the meeting closed the meeting official meeting at 630 and I had to kick them all out at 1015 and that is wow I didn't I didn't learn that at first and so the first time I did it it was it was 1 30 in the morning and I'm we're still at church talking and the phone rings and I thought I know exactly who that is that's my wife it's like where are you I mean first of all she's a little nervous who are these who are these people you're meeting with and are they dangerous and right well they're dangerous but not in the normal kind of way you might think right like it could possibly be dangerous to my career so so have you gotten any kind of input from the other priests or do they just kind of stare at you and kind of like you know they they they're always polite they're always interested and you know there there have been there have been enough there have been enough little of Peterson saying something positive about the Orthodox Church that you know somebody somebody will will chime in and say oh yeah I heard I heard he said something good about us and you know so like there's no negative reaction I don't I don't get any I've never gotten any flak from it and it just varies from blank stares to oh that's interesting and and a few people say oh that's that's a really great idea and like the there's a department of missions and evangelism in in our in our archdiocese and you know they found out about what I was doing and they did it they did a little video I don't think it got a lot of response I just I can't I can't figure out why more people are not doing it I don't I don't get it like no negative response but but I don't I don't see it spreading either no no I've had exactly the same response in the CRC and we haven't had you know we've got me but Jonathan Peugeot has obviously been a big piece of this movement yeah and and many P especially in terms of the Orthodox and one of the guys who came last night mentioned you know he'd just been to a second Orthodox service and and so it's some of the people some of the people who come my way have been visiting Orthodox churches and but it's it's you know unlike a lot of evangelical churches becoming a member of an Orthodox Church is not a an instant I mean some evangelical churches you show up you raise your hand boom you hit the water you're in baby right so with the Orthodox that's where I come from so I know I know about that but no it's gonna take at least a year okay so it's so you you grew up evangelical yes tell me about that well so we we went to Baptist churches when I when I was a kid or Bible churches but they were really the same there wasn't there wasn't the distinction being made in in our minds about about you know Baptist or Bible Church or that sort of thing but really the the the main the main influence on my family was actually Youth for Christ which is one of these parent church organizations that popped up in the 40s a lot like Young Life or Campus Crusade so so I had I had family that were that were involved in that you know professionally for for a couple of generations and and so yeah so I was still I'm still going to Baptist churches and and you know I think I think I got saved about 12 times and baptized twice by but by the time I graduated high school I don't I don't mean to make light of my people I I'm very thankful for the upbringing that I have they they taught me they taught me the faith they taught me to believe they gave me faith they taught me the scriptures you know sometimes when I'm preaching I I still I still end up quoting a passage from scripture that I memorized when I was 10 yeah you know so thank God yeah but you know when I had I had my questioning phases in in high school and college and and when I was in when I was in college I started started getting a little disenchanted with the the cult of personality that you know if you have a good preacher then next thing you need is a building program and you know blows up and and and I met a guy in the philosophy department who suggested I go to his his PCA church and they fed college students after after church so it sounded like a good deal and and so I went found out they sprinkled babies and that was a little scandalous especially because because I could tell like they they had all the other markings of real Christians you know I could I could see these these were sincere believers but what were they doing baptizing infants so I asked and their answer was surprisingly scriptural and and and sound theology and and it also it also it showed me it showed me a vision of the church as a community of believers that exists through time that I had been unfamiliar with that I had never encountered before and so that that was really the start and and I think I think studying studying philosophy had had something to do with it too because you know I I learned I learned that the things that we believe we we believe in communities and that yeah I learned I learned to distrust the idea of an individual approaching a text in a vacuum because that doesn't happen you know we we learn how to interpret the scriptures from other people we learn how to pray from other people and and so so the the question the question of which people do I want to learn these things from yeah it got real important and I spent some time I spent some time with the CRC yeah in in South Bend with Len Mandrazi oh really oh Len and I are gonna have a conversation one of these days because I know I don't I don't know I mean he would certainly not remember me I was I was just I was just a person in the in the crowd but but I really I really enjoyed listening to him and I met I met a lot of I met a lot of Catholics when I was when I was there who it was a similar experience you know they they they didn't and said things that that I really couldn't handle but that I could tell that they were that they were real Christians and so I had had to find out what was going on and their answers were once again surprisingly biblical and sound theologically and so that was a challenge but you know eventually I I I got convinced that that worship really really ought to be focused on Christ as he presents himself to us in the Eucharist and and that bishops are bishops are good that that there's that there that the authority of the church is important and and and the the authority of the church to teach me and to form me matters and and then I eventually met a crazy Orthodox guy who who taught me taught me a couple of things about prayer and I decided to church and a year later I was in Wow how did you how did you then take on holy holy I don't know I don't know what's called in the Orthodox tradition is it orders or officer yeah holy orders orders okay yeah sure you can say that well you know a while later I I was I remember watching watching my priest do a service and thinking oh that's what I want that's what I want to do with my life and and so I I told him that that thought occurred to me and he laughed out loud he lol me before that was the thing and it said so wait a few years he said he said talk to me in three years so three years went by and I said hey you remember what I said I'm still thinking that he said okay let's talk to the bishop so we talked to the bishop and and the and the bishop said that's a good idea but you should wait a year and I said okay and you know I just got married we had a new baby and and he said wait wait a year and he came back to visit the next year and and he said yeah it's time and so off we went to seminary in New York and the rest is history Wow wonderful wonderful so how did you how did you get to Dallas then well they out of seminary I was assigned as the assistant in Austin okay or for five years and then and then about about five years ago I was assigned here okay okay you know it strikes me as interesting that both you and Jonathan Peugeot had pre histories in the evangelical church and both you and Jonathan are also how to say it willing to engage constructively and openly with Peterson I wonder if there's something to that yeah I don't know I don't know I mean I will I will take issue with with with one thing that that that you and Van Dont said only one well well you were you know he was saying he was saying there's this crowd that's that you know pulling for Peterson to end up on their team right and I've I've never thought that was especially likely I'm I think I think I agree with you completely about about about that you know I mean he's he's hard to peg he's trying to figure out what he's doing on the fly it seems to me and you know a minute like did you see the did you see the interview with Patrick Coffin yes where he said he said it seems to me that you are you're either a last Catholic a closet Catholic or a future Catholic which is it and and so Peterson's answer was well why not Orthodox and and so so you know a lot of people is that hey see well I say that I've never I've never actually met people I've never actually met people who who really think that he's that he's gonna gonna come to my team but you know it doesn't matter he's he's he has already done a tremendous service for churches of every stripe as far as I'm concerned yeah yeah so so what's your take on so you're in the camp actually I was watching a Adam friend did and and such PSA such did a did a live stream yesterday that I was actually chopping up this morning and thinking maybe about doing a video on and you know part of the early on in my videos I did a video comparing Peterson to Jim and Pam on the office and then on these sitcoms there's always this tension will Jim and Pam get together will Jim and Pam get together and that's part of the Peterson fascination it's the Truman show and like how will it end what will happen to Peterson and some people think you know so Owen Benjamin says oh he's just stringing us along he's teasing us he's duplicitous that might take it all other people like oh he's in process other people know he's so so what's so what's your take is he in process is he just himself well I think that he's largely himself I did I did see I did see one time on a I think it was a it was a reddit ask me anything somebody asked him so why will you only endorse it why won't you endorse Christianity explicitly and his answer was because it's more effective to endorse it implicitly and you know that that could have that could have been that could have been just an answer but I mean he's he's he's pretty self-conscious he he's thinking about he's thinking about what he's doing and the effect that it's having but but I really I really think that I really think that what you see is what you get yeah I think he's I think he's working through stuff I wish you'd get back to the biblical lectures you and a whole lot of other people that would be great there's a certain amount of we in our meetup last night there's a certain amount of angst that so he'll he'll be doing these his book tour so-called book tour until May and then he'll pause and do reading he says he's gonna do the biblical lectures in November and then his new books gonna come out in January and then I imagine the book to the book tour on 12 more rules starts all over again perhaps if if in fact you know it's so hard to know if the level of excitement and enthusiasm stays where it is now that kind of thing hard to maintain and hard to predict sure so so I don't know that is I mean from my perspective there's a lot more interesting stuff that that he could be doing I agree a hundred percent we we looked at so he so Jordan went through his at least the the present draft of his 12 new rules on the question and answer that he did that he did yesterday you know when he releases things on Sunday morning it's like come on Jordan you know right all days of the week you got to do you got to do it on a Sunday morning I mean I don't got a lot of time on Sunday that's right give a little love over here to us lying manipulative opportunists right Shapiro's got an excuse Sundays is Monday that's right and and Peterson it was so funny because you know the last few things Peterson's been in the strange place I'm looking at this place and thinking what what is this place well it's his son's basement so that right oh you're living in your son's basement which means you're down to the underworld to rescue his father this is very archetypal so so where do you think so so right now so this was our one-year anniversary meetup that we had last night and I didn't have a lot of time to post it because so much of so much of this is dependent on my schedule which is which is kind of too bad I I'm always trying to think of okay what should I do next how should I do like this how should I adjust this but it's it's hard to know because it's you know this is so much of the moment that you're exactly right you put up something on meetup.com and 10 to 12 people show up and you know as a as a local church pastor it's like when does that happen I mean churches are never able to come out yeah yeah no one of the one of the things that really struck me about this in fact just before I started the meetup I did I ran some numbers and presented it to my parish council on you know I looked through through the the four years that I've been here of all the of new people that that we take it that we had brought into our church and you know I classified them according to different backgrounds so that so some were were Orthodox but they you know but they just moved to town so they're so they're already Orthodox Christians but but they were looking for a church because they you know they because they left they left their their home church when they moved and then you know there there are some you know a few that were Orthodox that had been here but were unaffiliated there were there were a fair number of Christians from other churches who got interested in the Orthodox Church for one reason or another I mean they're there there are people there are people that move from church to church in in in Dallas all the time but the the one area the one area that was that I that I really wasn't seeing I wasn't seeing completely unchurched people like how do you reach people how do you how do you meet them and and then this guy shows up who was completely unchurched and Peterson sent him to me and you know I thought about it and I realized okay so there's this there are millions of people watching this Canadian psychologist talk about the Bible and they're listening to him tell them that that there is meaning in life but you're gonna have to struggle you're gonna have to pick up your damn cross and struggle uphill if there is ever a warm market for the Orthodox Church like if I'm being cynical like he has identified the warm market like here it here it is what are you gonna do so you know at least at least this way I get to meet some I'm completely on the same page and that was that was what struck me when so I'm watching this I'm fascinated and just like you I'm learning a ton from him and I'm thinking I'm thinking some new thoughts and it's sending me on on errands and then I start getting you know then I've just watched look at reddit and I look at the comments in his things and I I look at email groups I'm thinking just a whole lot of people out there they can't talk to Peterson because he's way up on the status rocket so who are they gonna talk to and and then people go to these things and they're like I want to talk to someone who can I talk to and and virtual conversations are are nice but they're not the same as conversations in real time with real people that's right that's right and and I agree with all the things that you say about institutions too and we we need them we need we need connection with people and it's it's a it's really it's really lacking in our in our in our culture and the times that we live in are really very isolated times and and I think I think that's part of the reason for the the phenomenon that we're seeing too much as anything else yeah yeah so so what's so what's the next thing where does where does this go do we do we keep doing meetups do we because I'm always thinking about you know what do I need to do next well I'd like to try to I'd like to try to steer the conversation a little bit I'd like to see if I see if I can't get you know Peugeot and one of the Weinstein brothers to to you know get on a stage together you know I'm tinkering with that idea you know it would be it would be a neat event to see live but then it would be one more one more little little piece on on the the YouTube trail and maybe you know maybe we can nudge nudge the conversation towards and towards some of the things that I think are most interesting yeah I really like the Weinstein brothers I think they're great yeah yeah yeah they're they're they're really smart and they now they're they're really fun well that would be one of the interesting things is of course been you know Pang burn went in there and organized the Peterson Harris conversations which I thought were helpful but now paying burns kind of you know self-destructed it sounds like faster patreon which was another institution that was really facilitating a lot of this now that's all coming apart and again people don't recognize that these other things that are alongside are are really foundational to the development of a movement and and so you know patreon is now you know they're they've run aground you know rebel wisdom is as I think David Fuller in in the UK is still pumping out materials and and throwing up interviews which is really good but I I think you're right in that it would be just about any way that we can figure out how to host more conversations and and I I sort of liked it that you know that it was an atheist you know hang burn doing it because then there's no you know there's no suggestion that ah you know this again another Christian opportunist I remember when I first put my video up there are a number of comments like yeah there's a some pastor gonna ride Jordan Peterson's coattails and and especially in the Protestant world we are we tend to be known as opportunists more definitely more than the Orthodox perhaps more than Catholics but that's you know maybe it's just because we're small we we don't we don't get the we don't get the attention I had a I had a friend who he was traveling through West Texas and saw it saw a sign for Rapture insurance a flyer in a in a cafe and I said what's Rapture insurance well in case the Rapture they'll take care of your pets well the obvious the obvious question is who exactly is going to be taking care of my pets but but they but they had thought of that and and you were you were assured that all of their all their very qualified caretakers were either Catholic Episcopalians Jews Muslims or atheists and and I said I said you know why we didn't make that list and he said yeah because they've never heard of us exactly well you know part of you know the Orthodox are so new in some ways in on the American scene before the Jordan Peterson thing I read Molly Molly Worthen's she had written a really nice piece not piece but a really nice book on evangelicalism I can't remember the title right now the Orthodox very much get mentioned in there I mean the Orthodox have been you know you they they pop up now and then one of the one of the things that that I read talked about the fact like you know someone would send me links to ancient faith radio and you know some of that kind of stuff sometimes and and of course reading Rod Drears blog I think that's done a lot to put give more the Orthodox more visibility sure one of the one of the things one of the interesting conversations I heard was was reflection on how whereas let's say in in Russia or Greece or any of the any of the eastern countries where you've been the established church right now coming to the United States in this crazy religious marketplace very healthy yeah how this then changes the Orthodox in terms of in a sense you are the fresh face on the block right and yet we've been around from the beginning at least the church has I'm I'm kind of I'm kind of new myself but no it's it's interesting and you know I think I think they're they're growing pains with as there are with with any immigrant church you know the like the the Antiochian church like my my parish for instances is was started by by people a few families of Lebanese Syrian and Palestinian descent and you know so a lot of a lot of them came over around the turn of the 20th century and then then you know there was there were a couple there were a couple more waves so you know some of these people are just Texans and Oklahomans now but then but then we've also got we've got people or who are just arriving too no I think I think that it I mean it it definitely it definitely changes us it has it has to change us and and that that should that should be expected every time the church has moved to a new place it's encountered a new culture and you know incorporated and baptized some parts of that culture and you know at least at least in some places a new language and and that's that's always been the way it works you know you've got you've got the tradition and you have to stay true to the past but that tradition has to be re-articulated in a new time in a new place it has to be it has to be represented here and now and I mean back to back to Peterson I think I think one of the one of the most impressive things about him is that he does such a he does such a good job of engaging our culture as it as it is as it lives and thinks and talks right now and and you know doing it doing a much better job of it than then then most Christians are and you know I think we can we can learn a lot from him I I think my I think my my preaching has changed since I since I got acquainted with him I've for one thing I've I learned from him a way to to engage political discussion without without being overtly political you know like you can you can talk about you can talk about things like ideology and and and and maybe even ideological possession and and the the need the need to to engage people that you disagree with without without thinking that they're your enemy without thinking that they're evil and you know I really I really appreciated Jonathan Haidt's work on on on that and you know yesterday I even I even joined a group called Better Angels that I that I saw I saw an interview with with with one of the representatives on the The Glenn Show and and and they're they're a group that's that's an engaged in in this effort trying to get red and blue types together and and and just just actually confront each other meet each other because that happens less and less these days we tend to be very segregated on ideological lines and and that's that's a scary thing yeah yeah rambling but but so it's been really good talking to you well it is it is a scary thing and when I look at the I mean the current government shutdown that that's emblematic of the two sides getting to a point where they're not able to work productively together I I studied American history that was my undergraduate work at Calvin College and I don't remember which historian was it but said you know the genius of the American system is political system is compromise and that's something that is is currently lost and it's you know right now there seems to be no it seems to be very little possible gain from this shutdown other than political points right and that's that's a that's a misplaced focus and then that polarization is you know the the numbers of people that would be upset because their child married someone of the other political party you know those numbers continue to rise and that's a that's a real problem you know Republicans used to go to church with Democrats yeah and vice versa and and I don't think that happens very much anymore you know we're we're much more likely to we're much more likely to choose a church where everyone agrees with us yeah politically more than more than even doctrinally exactly exactly and and that's not good no and that's one of the things that I've been pleased at Living Stones we've continued to be we're in Sacramento so there are some so there's some members of the congregation that that work in the Capitol building as staffers for one party or another and there are other members of the congregation that are died in the wool members of the other side and that's and so we can't not talk about politics at all but it has politics has to be relativized and politics does become the center does become the central filter of your worldview you basically become a very short-time person because the political scene continues to change right right well we've been talking for a little while do you have any and I've dominated the I pushed this conversation along do you have any questions for me um no I just I really appreciate what you're doing I'd I I'm I'm always impressed with uh with the volume that you put out and uh and I I hope you uh I hope you keep doing it I I don't see the volume it was so funny because when I posted a five minute video a couple of weeks ago I got all these comments like people are a little miffed that you know how dare you put out five minutes and to me the volume is it is more it's just a function of you know because you know as well as I do it's a whole lot more work to preach a short sermon one yeah sure and so it's it's all just first drafts and no cuts and no editing but no it's good stuff it's really good and man I spend a lot of time in the car so uh you know keep it coming all right well well thank you so much David and I really appreciate the the opportunity to talk and likewise God's blessing on your group I mean again with my group I I I don't know where any of this thing goes but I I just think this is this is exactly the thing I need to be doing now and I'm having so much fun and I wish more people would do it may be blessed may be blessed well thank you David thank you so much for talking bye bye bye
