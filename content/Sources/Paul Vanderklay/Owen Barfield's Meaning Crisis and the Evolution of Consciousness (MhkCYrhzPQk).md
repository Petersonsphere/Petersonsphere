 Hi, this is Paul. I'm gonna do a pretty major video here on Owen Barfield as explored by Malcolm Malcolm gate or gait he's an Anglican priest in England You'll find a number of videos on YouTube with him speaking about CS Lewis Owen Barfield some of the other inklings this exploration of Barfield's thought I thought was very pertinent and Very clear Barfield's not terribly easy to understand you might look back over my videos and see a video I did with Mark Vernon so Mark Vernon's been working a lot on Owen Barfield also Owen Barfield's grandson is Been working on his grandfather's work, so some of this some of this will stuff will come in You'll find the links to these videos down in the notes, but let's get started Meaning crisis has been around a while and this of course is the centerpiece of John Verveckis work and we'll hear a little bit from him today But it's beneath a lot of Jordan Peterson's work. And so we'll look at a couple clips from him today But let's go ahead and dive in No, that's not it. I I'll probably be doing a video on this video in the in the future. Obviously I copy the wrong link hang on I Think as we come to a crisis in our own culture About the relationship between ourselves as subjects and subjective Consciousness is looking out on an apparently dad increasingly Objectified world where we're also objectifying people in appalling ways and losing the sense of what person who it is It's what barfield has to say about the nature of knowledge that I think is most pertinent For for the concerns of our own age. So I want to lift him having acknowledged that context that literary Context with the inklings. I want for the course of this lecture to lift him out of that and Try and give a bit of an overview of his wider Concerns and particularly to think about how he might have something to say about the development of modern science As well as the development of literature So I want to take him out of literary and of course the other circles in which he might be known and celebrated might be Broadly called esoteric circles and they have their proper interest But I want to lift him out of both of those circles and place him firmly in the public square As somebody with whom everybody who is concerned about what is the case? To borrow Wittgenstein's phrase Everybody who's concerned about what is the case? What can we know and how can we know it? I think barfield is a vital person who's been ignored So so that's the context of what I'm trying to say So why should we consider barfield more widely? Particularly why should those concerned with the interface between science and religion or science and spirituality as well as Spirituality and poetry pay him serious attention. Well consider the following statement from barfield These are the opening sentences These are the opening sentences of barfield's seminal essay the rediscovery of meaning Barfield writes Amid all the this is written in the in the 70s Amid all the menacing signs that surround us in the middle of this 20th century Perhaps the one that fills thoughtful people with the greatest foreboding is The general sense of meaninglessness It is this which underlies most of the other threats How is it that the more able man becomes to manipulate the world to his advantage? the less He can perceive any meaning in it The more able he's able to manipulate the less he perceives meaning now does that strike a chord? So Almost everyone I think will recognize that the crisis to which barfield pointed in fact that was published in the 70s He wrote the essay in the early 60s has deepened since then Barfield offers a very acute historical analysis in that essay the rediscovery of meaning of how it was that the increasingly detailed knowledge arising from the scientific revolution seemed simultaneously to evacuate the world of meaning he observes that Here I'm quoting that essay again quote the vaunted progress of knowledge Which has been going on since the 17th century Has been progress in alienation The alienation of nature from humanity which the exclusive pursuit of objectivity in science entails was the first stage and It was followed with the acceptance of man himself as a part of this nature so alienated and therefore by the alienation of man from himself this final and fatal step in reductionism occurred in two stages first his body and then his mind Newton's approach to nature was already by contrast with the older scientific traditions a Form of behaviorism And what has since followed has been its extension from astronomy and physics into physiology and ultimately psychology It's really worth considering that hum if my eyes from my script for the moment if you think about earlier writers say for example, sir John Davies writing at the End of the 16th century in his beautiful court poem orchestra Which is about the making of the cosmos in which he sees the cosmos entirely as a love-led dance He sees it as tingling with consciousness. He sees the movement or motion of the heavenly bodies as Participatory and conscious of something larger than itself Now Newton replaces that with an entirely Materialized and objective version of things working on a law of gravity So that the law of gravity wasn't there to begin with but it's seeing it as the exclusive account of all things That's what's meant by reductive Thinking what one of the interesting things about Newton and this and this perspective is that? Every time we have a conceptualization, let's say of the beginnings of the world Every Time we speak a narrative of those beginnings What we consciously do in that narrative in our contemporary mode is Exclude ourselves now one of the things I thought of when I heard Malcolm Gait or gate Say this was a project by biologos now biologos There are some Calvin College professors That's currently run by a former professor of Calvin College, he was married to a Physicist at Calvin College and some of you might recognize Reverend Len van der Zee. He's been on my channel a couple of times he's a minister in the Christian Reformed Church and a friend of mine and and One of the things that they biologos tried the other day was again to marry the Scientific view of the origins of the universe with a story and and this is this is Some of what they put out From the time we're little children we all love a story And we never seem to outgrow it. In fact, we not only love stories. We make sense of life through stories More and more Bible scholars are recognizing that the Bible is the true story of the whole world It's the epic sweeping and continuing story of God That's now it's interesting Bible Bible scholars are recognizing and you might you might say Recognizing from what period of lack of recognition? Well, that would be a period not too long ago where there was a great deal of interest in in Understanding theology as science and understanding Bible study as science and so now suddenly Oh, wait a minute It's a story which is really rather funny because any anyone in literature could could point that out that it is very much in Narrative form stretches from creation to new creation It tells the grand adventure of redemption in Jesus Christ But we cannot simply repeat the biblical story as if today's science of origins were irrelevant. So What if we told that grand biblical narrative? with the scientific knowledge of the origins of the universe that the ancients did not have and what if we were to tell it in the poetic and imaginative style of Genesis 1 or Job 38 or Psalm 104 or Proverbs 8 because there are multiple creation stories in the Bible. Not just the one at the front end What would it be like? And now notice that all of those actually if you look at a modern if you look at a modern typeset version of Genesis 1 or Job 38 or Psalm Psalm 104 They're all set out as poetry for or Proverbs 8 What would it be like? Let's call it the big story For eternity there exists one God who but but I'm not gonna play this I'll have a link to it in there, but but just notice the project and Let me not go let me not go back or notice the project and then go back to What he was saying is the thing so the law of gravity wasn't there to begin with but it's seeing it as the exclusive Account of all things that's what's meant by reductive and what's interesting again is that? What we do when we we cannot help but talk about let's say Let's say you're a complete atheist Let's take let's take a completely. Well, you have the anomaly We'll just call it an anomaly because that's impersonal and we completely try to strip any Persons out of it. All right You still cannot articulate the event From one person to another with speech and have it be intelligible without creating a story and by Creating a story you actually insert a person into it You insert an observer and part of what we do when we look at that story is we represent it with Representations now Now one of the things that I appoint a thing I made way back when I did a Jordan Peterson commentary video On the Genesis series was note that if you do a Google search while I can I can do one right now with the We'll just go to Google. Let's do image Image at Google comm and if I search solar system What we have here are various representations of The solar system and you'll notice that each representation is is is created To accentuate certain relationships between this this shows to a degree some of the relationships of size You still have order this shows sequence but not size this shows much more size and a Perception of order now you would look at all of these things and say well, these are scientific representations But but point out that let's say if you had the Had the perspective of an astronaut What would the representation look like it would be waking up in the morning and getting dressed and getting in your car and driving to the the space center and to begin go through the process of putting on the space suit and whatever whatever one and then going into the capsule and sitting in this capsule this tiny little window and A whole deal of shaking that's the phenomenological Story of going to the moon, but when we talk about these things we tend to look at these representations like this in other words What what we fail to see again and again is the role that representation plays in Everything that we do and in the way what we think and in the way that we communicate and so one of the things that we're going to see through this video is that Well The world is divided and in fact you saw that very very easily in The way that this whole thing is set up when when Len is talking about how well we have this scientific Thing and then we have this story but but what we don't see is that the scientific thing is also a Story in a way it is a representation And so what you know the preacher and this is Len is a preacher and I'm a preacher what preachers often try to do is take things and Represent them and say them and communicate them in a way that multiple people within a context in a culture can Understand apprehend and then actually begin to apply that is The preacher's job now what? Malcolm Geith notes with Owen Barfield is this meaning crisis that that in a sense well, I I'll go to the next slide because so for Vicky has been talking about the meaning crisis and this is very much interested me So every Friday puts out a new video, but there's another channel that For a while they they grew fast and then I looked at some of their more recent videos and hardly anybody is watching them They have these think big animations and they're taking an older version of her Vickie's current series Buddhism and cognitive science which you can also find on YouTube But the sound wasn't very good and and the recording quality wasn't very good and that's part of the reason for the new version that has that has better better sound and and is more set up to be for video, but What think big animation is doing is taking some of this and and doing it in cartoon form and I really like the job That they've been doing so let me play a little bit of one of their videos Because they nicely articulate and this they nicely articulate exactly what Lynn Vandersee and Malcolm Guy and Owen Barfield and John ver Vicky have been saying that in a sense what's happened to us is we've become well Let's play it because they explain it in many ways better than I do old Aristotelian model we all fit in and belong with the universe But we have just been given proof that the structure of our experience has nothing to do with the structure of reality Gala the structure of our experience has nothing to do with the structure of reality Even the way that you even the person who wrote this script there The structure of reality is Already down into our words and and what that sentence does is communicate the the the alienation As barfield via guy or guy via barfield was saying this is the alienation and again I think this video nicely captures it Leo expands on this Copernican idea And he tells us that mathematics is the language of the universe and that is how the mind can reconnect itself to the world So math is the way that the mind can reconnect itself to the world math is the language and one of the things I took a lot of math in high school and college and then when I watched my kids in high school learning calculus it was like That is a language that is a language now. Here's there's always the big question Do we create math or do we discover math? Well in a sense we've created the language But math is out there and so there's a big word for barfield is this idea of participation This is where the two ends come together. We're gonna see this a little bit from verveky Galileo integrates this new math into what we now know as the scientific method And he begins to use experiments using this new experiment now if you if you go back to my older videos and I'm gonna go back to some of these ideas because I'm reading this book fatal Discord about Erasmus and Luther and these issues fascinate me and they're all over the place and I'm gonna want to take some Of that stuff when I I set up an appointment John verveky and are gonna talk in a few weeks, but but these issues of Alienation of separation In the Reformation you had the you had the great belief in text that comes from Renaissance humanism and Erasmus was kind of the Giant of that I did a conversation with with Ron Dar on Erasmus and I'm gonna do another one with Ron Dar on Erasmus after I finish Reading through fatal discord, but I'm reading and watching videos and doing all this stuff. So it's all in competition So it takes a little while for one thing to come through But I like doing it all together because then all kind of comes together and synthesizes But so so what happens is that after the Reformation and after the Reformation in a sense blows apart Belief in text and they're looking for a new foundation of certainty in the West and that's where you begin to get you you begin to have Rene Descartes and and Where well now and Rene Descartes and then in his wake eventually Isaac Newton where we're no longer going to agree that Aristotle is the source of information the texts from Aristotle that have been discovered and then integrated through Thomas Aquinas into the West but but now we are going to look to the Empiricism we're going to look to the world itself and we're going to do experiments in the world So Galileo develops a telescope so he can see the stars He can see things going around he can see things going the moons going around Jupiter and and he's going to do Experiments with weights and we're not going to believe what Aristotle said in a text because actually Erasmus and some of what Erasmus does this this love of the text begins actually to undermine the power of the Vulgate text for the rest of the world and Luther comes on to this and establishes a whole new way of seeing Christianity in the Bible and understanding our relationship with God and the church in a sense blows apart in certain parts of Europe and that Brings war and I mean it's a it's a huge mess So now for certainty let's turn away from texts and let's look at the let's look at this world Because now we're gonna get into the monarchical vision because anybody who holds this cell phone stand We think we're gonna get into this well. It's the same stand right? It's hard. It's here It's it's it's if I walk away from it and come back I went home and I slept last night and I dreamed and I don't remember any of my dreams from last night But I lived all these kind of lives and I came back to my office this morning and here was the stand Right here. This is solid. This is anybody who walks in my office can pick up this stand. They might say well What is this? I'll say that's a cell phone stand. Oh, okay. I get it so on and so forth So well back to the video mental method Galileo discovers inertial motion in this old worldview Things were acting on purpose because of this internal drive to better themselves Okay, now let's pay attention to that because that's gonna become important later on because when we when we learn about Aristotle I think again for vacu in some of his earlier videos does a terrific job in terms of explaining Aristotle things fall to the ground Because that's that's what's happening on purpose now Even when we say that what we're beginning to conjure with those words is in a sense this little stand having consciousness and Wanting to it wants to make union with the earth but I keep interrupting it with with my hand and then my lap and then the floor and it and it want this this thing wants Something and when we say that we said what we conjure up in our minds the little story that's that's it's kind of a kernel It's implicit is that this this is conscious and it wants okay, and and so that's what happens and Thing is when we read that from Aristotle's modern people were like well, how dumb is that? Why would why would my little cell phone stand? want What we don't see When we say oh, that's so dumb is what we don't see is ourself looking at the assumptions about what the cell phone stand is We don't see ourselves. That's the thing about human beings our eyes look out. I can see my hands But in a sense, I'm here in my head and I hear I see my hands But to say that the cell phone stand wants That's just a remnant of archaic speech. And so then when we look at these ideas from Aristotle, we think Yeah, Aristotle, I mean huge Man what the man was able to write and do and think it's incredible but But he thinks that he thinks that objects like my cell phone stand want that's just crazy Everything was acting on purpose Galileo discovers inertial motion in this old worldview things were acting on purpose Because of this internal drive to better themselves Now if you look at my conversation with a quality existence But She's looking at Percy and the Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance and they're getting into this idea of I learned You know a lot from that conversation terms of quality that everything is seeking quality. Well, everything is seeking again. We have Personalization there's there's consciousness in everything and it's seeking Everything was acting intentionally and everything was in it intention everything's act again consciousness It's drive to better themselves. Everything was acting intentionally and everything was in its proper place Galileo proper place one of the things I first started noticing toward Peter kept saying proper proper this proper that proper I'm not saying that's the right word. I'm saying that's the right word I'm not saying that's the right word. I'm saying that's the right word But everything is in its proper place. Well, there isn't a proper place for anything unless there is intentionality Unless there is Purpose unless there is a plan unless there is an observer Because I would say this cell phone stand is in its proper place when it's right here by my computer is in its proper place when it's right here by my computer, so I can put my cell phone on it, so I can watch the time, so I can keep track of my appointments and things as I go. That's its proper place. And now I have to put the clock there, because I left the cell phone stand in the charger. So now the clock is in its proper place. But proper is, in many ways, an expression of my will and desire to be able to see the time so I don't talk too long, which I probably will, because I'm already talking way more than I thought. But that's all a function of me, the subject. Discover that things don't act on purpose to make things more actual. Discover that things don't act on purpose, really? How did we discover that? How do we know that? I talk to my little cell phone stand and say, do you have a mind? Do you have purpose? Do you have consciousness? And again, another part of me says, what are you crazy talking to your cell phone stand? If you go back and you look at the Jordan Peterson, Matt De La Honte conversation, and you notice the bit where Jordan Peterson asked Matt De La Honte about talking to the lawnmower, do I talk to my clock? Do I talk to a voice on the other end of the telephone that very well may be a computer doing a robo call? Things are getting weird. And more beautiful. Things act. And more beautiful. Does my cell phone holder see beauty? But yet, we talk about beauty as if it's a quality that things in themselves have. Because they smash into each other mind. Act. Place. Galileo discovers that things don't act on purpose to make things more actual and more beautiful. Things act because they smash into each other mindlessly. Mindlessly. There's the key. Pay attention. Each of us still feels that we are autonomous beings. We have our will and we act on purpose. But nothing else does. Instead of acting in collaboration with the universe, we are now an isolated will that doesn't belong. And what is our will compared to all this dead matter? The narrative unfolding of a universe trying to come to completion is now dead because nothing acts on purpose and there is no story to things. A universe trying to overcome its inner conflict is gone. And the sense of a mutual fitting and belonging to the world around us has been shattered. What is left? Math and an isolated will trying to impose order on whatever it can. And even that is exactly what Geith and Barfield are talking about. And that isn't real because your experience is faulty and cannot be trusted. Math is the language of the universe. What about love and beauty? What about everything that belongs to our subjective experience? Galileo has an answer to this. He divides the world into primary and secondary property. We have a hierarchy. What is primary is things we can do math on like shape and weight. What's secondary are non-mathematical properties like love, beauty and meaning. All the stuff we care about is an afterthought. The world does not possess these things. That is what the mind willfully imposes on reality. I present to you the meaning crisis. When you feel connected to things for their beauty, love or meaning, that is all a mistake. The meaning that was captured in these old worldviews are being withdrawn and we are now trapped in a mind that cannot connect to the world. So think big. They've got some really good stuff out there. So that's the meaning crisis. And Barfield's writing about it in the early 20th century. And this is the same conversation that we're having. Now, I'm gonna pick up from another, there's a few videos of Malcolm out there doing this, but listen to what he has to say here, picking up. It's the same lecture, it's just a little bit different add-ons. You follow that? He's saying, we decided to stop thinking about the cosmos and nature itself as living, moving, breathing, meaning. And we decided to think of it as a mechanism and then to analyze it in mechanistic terms. And then we said, hey, the body's part of that as well, so let's do that with the body. And then they said, well, you know, the mind is, you know, probably just produced by something mechanical in the brain, let's do that with the brain. And in the end, we don't know, as we kind of cut the knife to dissect ourselves into these little atomistic bits, we don't even know anymore what it is that's holding the knife. Did you hear that? The sound isn't as good on this other one, so I'm playing from the first one. But we looked out and we said, oh, the stuff out there, it's all dead stuff and, you know, do what we want with it. And then we learned, well, we're made up of this stuff and our thoughts and we're just that too. And if you noticed in the first clip from Malcolm Geist, this license to treat other things as objects, because everything's dead. You know, I can go into the ground and I can dig up the ore and we can refine it, we can mold it and we can shape it. We can do all of this, because, you know, if we treated people that way, but we do treat people that way. Now, in all fairness, in the ancient world, they treated people awfully horribly. Well, this is all part of the conversation about what a human being is. But if everything's an object and I'm a subject and I'm an actor and I have will, and this gets into my long conversation with part of the difficulty of pantheism is that everything then is impersonalized, including ourselves. Well, we hold ourselves, we give ourselves ethical license to colonize that which is impersonal and in our way. And one of my, whoops, one of my favorite examples, well, this gets into very much the third chapter of C.S. Lewis's The Abolition Man. Who's, we're dissecting ourselves, who's holding the knife, we're shaping ourselves, who is doing the shaping? My favorite example of this is a clip I've played a number of times. I'm gonna play it again, because it's worth playing, because every time I hear it, it's like, okay, he seems completely oblivious to this separation. Who's doing the programming? Well, G.I. uses this. If you discovered that you were a robot and that you were sent to, I don't know, assassinate some person who was innocent, if you discovered that that was the explanation for you, you would reject your program, right? Again, if you discovered you were a robot, you would reject your program. Who's the you? And you, again, you would reject your program. It. You, as the robot that had been given decency in order to get by everybody so you could commit your assassination, would say, actually, I prioritize the values and I reject the mission that I've been sent on. That's who we are. Who's holding the knife? We are that robot. We are on a genetic mission that is absolutely unacceptable. How would you just succinctly define that genetic mission? That genetic mission is. Just propagation at all cost? Propagation of your particular genetic spellings. And here's the key, it's a little subtle, but if you and I have different spellings for a particular, let's say, a respiratory enzyme, and let's say that respiratory enzyme functions better in you than in me, it's 10% more efficient. My respiratory enzyme still wants your respiratory enzyme to go extinct because it doesn't care about the function. It cares that that spelling is advanced and your spelling is in conflict with my spelling. Notice how he's taking all of this science and turning it into a story. That's the only way we can perceive it. Notice that this story is embedded with an entire ethical, all kinds of ethical assumptions and pre-sumptions. As long as yours is around, there will be fewer copies of mine. So our genomes are actually interested, I mean, if I can just be clear about it, the mind fuck of the whole thing is that the entire evolutionary story is the cosmic spelling bee and it ends in genocide, right? Entire story is a cosmic spelling bee and it ends in genocide. And what we have to do is simply stop, just simply not listen to our programming. Well, is it programming? Again, C.S. Lewis in... C.S. Lewis notes in Miracles that this entire conceptualization, well, okay, so that's what we are and that's how we are. And it's the big show that governs everything, but we don't talk that way. We can't live that way. There's no living that way at all. And on one hand, we feel the alienation, but as it increasingly gets applied to us, well, then we just reject it. It's like, well, that's funny. Well, let me just be... Let me just stop my heart. Let me just be a 16th century person. Let me just be a spaceman. This is what we're doing. We've always done this as children. Maybe we should pay attention to what we're doing and say, maybe there's more to that than we think there is. Now, if you go back to Paul Maxwell's, I'm not going to play it again. He has this great video on history of philosophy in about 23 minutes. And he talks about ontology, epistemology, and axiology. And ontology was the preoccupation with ancient philosophy. So why does this thing fall? Well, it wants. And what is this made of? It's... Ontology is the question of what is. Epistemology is a question of what do we know? How do we know? How can we justify knowing it? That's modern philosophy, post-Décartes. Axiology is post-modern philosophy, which is ethics. How should we behave? And what happens is that in this history of philosophy, skepticism creeps up and in a sense devours it. There's Gillian. Is it Gillian Barr? I don't remember. There's a disease basically that you become paralyzed and it starts in your toes at your feet and it works all the way up your body. And then what they very, if they find that you have it, they get you on a respirator because it's actually temporary. And in a sense, the skepticism moves from ontology to epistemology, to axiology, till we get to post-moderns. And we say, oh, we're just moments who are acting in time, but there's no acting. And because all there is is acting. There are no stories. There's nothing concrete. And so, but these things are built on each other. And so one of the things, if you look at the conversation again that I had with, I can't remember her name, a quality existence, we both were talking about how ontology matters. She was mentioning that that Pirsig basically is working on the metaphysics of quality and working on this moment that was in the video that I just played where everything seems to be pursuing quality or good. And that's a very interesting idea. So I haven't done any reading in that book, but I'll have to learn a bit more about that. But there's modern skepticism about ontology. And so, shoot, one of the video recently that she did that caught my attention was when she was talking about Peugeot and Verbecky and working through that. And one of the things that I said was I wish that John would do some more conversations on ontology and he did one, which was really cool. And so now listen to this, because again, the meaning crisis is baked in and I really like how the, again, not a lot of views on this video, but I really like how the guy who was interviewing John really sets it up well. There's this notion of goal, right? There's this notion of becoming a more actualized, better fit. So there again, you have this idea of progress, which this metaphysics of quality has within its idea. I mean, progressivism is deep within our culture, but also within this thing is telos. And I'm not gonna play the whole video, but actually later in this conversation, they get into telos. That's a really important part of this. Telos meaning goal or achievement, that things seem to be going in a certain direction. And even let's say from, I have to embody it in a story, even from a, let's say an atheistic, an attempt at an objectivistic story of the universe. You start from the big bang and things go out. They, you know, things go towards greater complexity, multiplicity. This is ideas behind biological evolution, but they're always in a fight with entropy. So that what? So that more transformation can continue. And it's a kind of loving transformation, right? Because it's an affirmation of self and the world in some important sense in a way that transforms it. And there's also an admission there that we are connected in fundamental ways that together we come into these co-defining, co-interpretive transformations and become something more connected, more real in some sense. Well, how- Real. Oh, there's a word. How fundamental is this process of transformation to what we must endorse metaphysically in the world itself? We might be something to say how fundamental is sentience, how fundamental is consciousness. I find it difficult to understand how this process can kick in with the meaning associated, the goal formation associated, even if it's implicit. This, it gives coherence. The goals give coherence, this relationship to, it's kind of a unity of goals, a unity of becoming, of harmonizing evermore in this holistic way, right? It seems to me like I can't understand how this is not fundamental to being itself, at least as far as we can conceive it psychologically. And that I think was a really important phrase. I'm waiting to get the second piece of the Australia talk here over so that I can publish it. But one of the things that I see is important with Peterson is that, so in a sense, what happened, what happened in the history of the West is that we together began to imagine, well, we can explain stuff and the existence of stuff via physics and Darwin and life. But when I think when Peterson and Sam Harris are talking in those Vancouver talks, I think the heart of what Peterson is saying, yeah, but you're not gonna get psychology without some of this stuff. You need this God number one actually for psychology because you need this filter. Now, Christians might not call that a God that they recognize, but. And then the line that comes between psychology and metaphysics becomes blurred. So I'm interested in the role you think something like this subjective coherence making transformation plays in your metaphysics. Is consciousness fundamental? Is something like sentience fundamental? Or is it an emergent property of something that is? Right there, is consciousness fundamental or is it an emergent property? There's the question. And materialism, and we'll let John decide, physicalism, is it dependent on assuming that consciousness is, consciousness is an emergent property. And then we're back into that video I just played from Think Big Animation where we're all alone, where here I am in the room and you know, my, this is unconscious or panpsychism, which says, well, this is conscious and it falls to the ground. Aristotle was right. Well, how can we know and how can we tell? Now we're gonna be getting into metaphysics. Non-sentience plays in your metaphysics. Is consciousness fundamental? Is something like sentience fundamental? Or is it an emergent property of something that is non-sentience? Okay, so there's a lot of things there. That was a very complex question. Yes. The first thing is, and I don't know how much you're committed to some of your predicates, but I would argue that meaning is not subjective, it's transjective. And part of the ontology that I'm trying to advocate is an ontology of real relations, right? That relations aren't just sort of mental glue that we use to put things together. Okay, an ontology of real relations, not just mental glue. Again, he's starting to, well, I'm not saying he's starting to back off, but this is a backing away from, this is a backing away from this modernist approach to the world where I can say with great certainty that the relation between me and this thing is a projection of my mind. No, there's a real relation. Already we're bringing in something about the relationship between me and my cell phone holder. And I think that that is actually something that comports well with our scientific ontology because things like evolution are dynamical systems themselves. They're self-organizing processes. And I take it that there's a general consensus that evolution is the best explanation of how we actually got here. And therefore there has to be a reality to it as a causal factor in our emergence. And therefore these dynamical systems and the sets of constraints and the real relations that they embody. You know, that's an important point that I don't often hear from materialists where that, well, evolution, well, you say, well, I believe in evolution. Okay, is evolution a thing like my cell phone holder? No, it's a process. Or if you're in Canada, it's a process. Oh, well, what's a process? Well, that's this linkage of cause and effect. Well, now back in C.S. Lewis's miracles in terms of the whole show, but it's a process. Oh, well, what exactly is a process? And this is where, you know, Verveki is saying, well, we're basically saying the old system can't hold, meaning the modernist system. Are real and causally efficacious in an important way. So I take that to be a fundamental thing. And then once you give me that in my ontology, then I would talk about, I talk about- See, he has to say it that way because I think people like Daniel Dennett are not gonna give him that. And a lot of people aren't gonna give him that. The real relations that they embody are real and causally efficacious in an important way. Causally efficacious. So I take that to be a fundamental thing. And then once you give me that in my ontology, then I would talk about, I talk about two things first. I talk about it in terms of a deep continuity hypothesis, the idea that my friend and colleague, Evan Thompson, has developed out of the work of Francisco Varela and others. And this is the idea, and this actually comes out in the relevance realization theory. This is the idea that the system of constraints, right, that structural functional organization, and this is very much the Aristotelian model that makes me possible as a biological agent. That, right, those sets of constraints, they get exacted. They're not identical. They get exacted the way my tongue has been exacted for speech. They get exacted up into cognition and they get exacted up into other level. Now pay attention to up because this is so built into us. It's so built, Verveki will always talk about the grammar. So built into any kind of communication, any kind of intelligibility we have. So these things, these mechanisms that we had for very simple things get exacted, that's a word I can never remember, get exacted up. And so Peterson will talk about this and all this mechanism that we have in our brain that we use for visual pattern recognition and everything. Now when I close my eyes, I can have vivid, I can imagine things. And in fact, I can even close my eyes and I can reach out and okay, there's my little track ball and oh my goodness, look what I found. And I recognize it with my hands. And we're taking the same mechanism and it's all going up, which means in a sense it's heading towards a teleology, it's heading towards a goal, which was the question that was asked of him in the beginning here. Of our notion of self and that there's a deep continuity between the kind of self-organizational processes we find in the depths of our biology and that we find in the heights of our reflective rationality. And many people are arguing for this deep continuity. Now you may say, well, that gets me sort of in, I can sort of see that, right? Okay, now we've got living things with all kinds of mechanisms and things that can be, I keep forgetting that word, I should write it down. Things that can be harnessed in other words to get up, but how did all of this stuff come to begin with? And in fact, if you look at this hard long story from the Big Bang all the way out to here, I mean, one of the real questions that there's huge questions about is, how do you go from inorganic to organic? Just YouTube that and look for a guy like James Ture, who was an incredible scientist and says, yeah, we have no idea. Well, what do you mean we have no idea? I just bought this story. Why did you buy the story? Did you buy the story? You mean you bought the story on insufficient evidence? You bought the story on faith? But that's only taking me sort of into one layer of the ontology. Well, no, because I think there's also a deep continuity between being a biological thing, which is an autopoetic thing, a self-organ, see, autopoetic things are self-organizing systems that are self-organized to seek out the conditions of their own existence. And that's how they differ from merely self-organizing things like tornadoes that do not self-organize in a way. Yeah, yeah, so autopoetic is self-making exactly. Whereas the tornado is only self-organizing. But there's of course, again, continuity between what we see in the self-making seeking behavior of even a paramecium and the self-organization capacity that we see in the fire that is spreading. So right there, even the paramecium, there's something in the paramecium that differentiates it from fire. There's a self-making, there's a consciousness. Does a paramecium have consciousness? Well, we're much more willing to grant paramecium consciousness than myself on hold or even a tornado or even fire. But we sense that there's a line, but to say where that line is, and why do we say, why do we have that line at all? I'm not advocating anything by asking that question. I'm just asking the question because, just like in the Think Big animation, and Galileo discovered, did he discover or did he assert? So we can, instead of just reading upwards, right? You also should use your ontology and read downwards. You should see how the upper level thing gives you an affordance of intelligibility down into the depths of your ontology. And then that leads me to my second point. Now, this is not something I have as well developed. And so I asked for some charity on the part of your listeners. Just give them some charity. I really wanna know. I listened to it already, but this is good. But I've become increasingly critical of these two big things that we have time to do with our ontology. We tend to have a completely emergentist ontology in which everything emerges up, or if you go back far enough in the neoplatonic framework, we have the exact opposite. We have a completely emanation ontology. And I think both of these ontologies, and perhaps I think it could make a case that this is a point that Whitehead was making. So you might find resonance with this. Both of these ontologic, I assume it's Alfred North Whitehead. So now I have somebody else to study. Critical grammars, a completely emergentist and a completely emanationist account. I think they each have just, they have obverse sets of irresolvable problems that they can't do. And that sort of points to me that either one of these exclusive ways of thinking of our ontology is in some fundamental way flawed. Now, and trying to get beyond both emergence and emanation, I think is one of the central tasks facing us as people are trying to understand our ontology. And that's why I like what I advocated earlier about the deep cognitive hypothesis says, don't only look upwards, like when you're trying to understand like the emergence of consciousness, take the properties and make that inform how you look downward, make that a grammar of intelligibility how you look downward. Now, you shouldn't simplistically then say, oh, well, that means that consciousness is down at the fundamental level, because that is to miss exactly, right? What the power of the emergentist has said, but you also should, you shouldn't think, right? That, right? That there's some sort of dualistic heaven that the emanationist wants. The land, the world of pure form. And so, as I said, that second point, I think is something that we're, I'm really wrestling with. And in my mind, it intersects with this deeper attempt. I have to try to get and break through a lot of these dichotomies that sort of have us locked in an ineffective grammar of cognition and of our existential lives. So I don't know, I do know that that is in no way a complete, a responsible answer, but I'm trying to show you what my thinking is about this. Which I really appreciate. And so, we're working on this. And I find this change really helpful. Now, I would very much be, and, you know, a top-down guy being a classical theist, but it's very interesting to me watching the movement in this conversation. Let's go back to, let's go back to Barfield, because now we're gonna look at, you know, one of the things when Vervecki described himself in that one interview as a physicalist, I know, well, what's the difference between a physicalist and a materialist? Well, a physicalist has matter and information. And again, when I listened to Daniel Dennett on an unbelievable show, well, Dennett talked about, we have matter and then information. I remember hearing Dennett say information, I said, oh, information? What, tell me of this information. And now Barfield had been working on this and Geith sets it up quite nicely. Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? It's interesting, isn't it? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? Where is the wisdom we've lost in knowledge? Long before the information age, before the whole massive technology of processing information in sort of bits and bytes, Eliot recognizes this hierarchy, that you can, the more information you have, the more you require knowledge to organize the information. Information is simply information, it's neutral. What do you do with information? How does it fit together? What does it suggest? What is the whole that's suggested by the many parts? Knowledge is required for that. And they say we should be moving now from an information economy, which we're in towards a knowledge economy. But once you've got the knowledge, what do you do with it? That's where you need wisdom. Where is the knowledge we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? Where is the wisdom we've lost in knowledge? What Eliot is suggesting there is that the more information we have, the more we require knowledge to organize it. But it also follows that the more knowledge we have, the more deeply require wisdom to know what the knowledge is about and what to do with it. So in that passage that I quoted from Barfield, the accelerating increase in that pigeonhole knowledge by individuals of more and more about less and less, Barfield here exposes problems arising from positivist materialism, which will be felt most acutely by those concerned with the interplay between science, psychology and religion. Our experience of meaning, both in our own individual consciousness and our intuitions of collectively held meanings, simply as experiences in themselves tend to resist this reductive atomizing into purely material interaction to which our current scientific paradigms might be pointing. Barfield is able to observe our progress in alienation, partly because it's part of a deeper process that he investigated all his life, the process by which our mode of consciousness and therefore both the objects and the kinds of our knowledge have changed. Our mode of consciousness has changed, or as Barfield contends, evolved over time. As we shall see, Barfield contends that our current detached and therefore alienated mode of knowing is only one phase in the development of our consciousness. And this approach of Barfield's, not fixing what we know and how we know it in terms of the way we do it now, but being aware of a deeper reach of how it was done and able at least to imagine a possibility of how it might be done, that sets us free from the way we do it now and allows us to consider alternatives. This approach gives us the possibility of at least imagining another way of knowing, a way which does not necessarily exclude our present hard-won objectivity, but rather integrates it with a participative and meaningful way of knowing. Okay, now participation is a really important word for Barfield because he talks about the, and we're gonna have some more clips on this, the ancient way of knowing, let's say. And you think again about, think about Aristotle and his ideas about things having purpose. You know, I didn't really, again, I'd heard that, I'd heard that of Aristotle for many times, but until I kind of saw it through Barfield, I didn't really stop and ask myself, why did Aristotle conceptualize the universe in that way? Now the heart of what Barfield is saying here is that, should be something fairly obvious to us, that because we know people from different cultures conceptualize things in different way, well, cultures don't just stack up horizontally in terms of all the cultures now, cultures also go down vertically in terms of the people who had the Dutch Jews of 200 years ago saw the world in slightly different ways. Jews of 3000 years ago probably saw the world in dramatically different ways. So Aristotle, his conceptualization of the world was a function of his consciousness and of not only his individual experience, but the shared experience of his culture. There's a book out there, one of the many books that I never finished reading, which was taught, which looked at certain places in time, places that, you know, a certain group of geniuses that we might say came out of. When you think about the fact that Socrates was the student of Plato and Plato was a, in a sense, a follower of Socrates, what are the odds in the whole span of human history that these three individuals would have a chain of relationships together? Well, what were they surrounded by? They're surrounded by a culture, they're surrounded by a language, and this culture and language proved so exceptional that it was able to colonize many other cultures and languages to the degree that we're still talking about them today. What is with that? So Aristotle in coming up with his ideas of, well, things act with purpose, this cell phone thing is acting with purpose, well, that's a function of the consciousness and the culture. And Barfield pauses and says, pay attention to that. That's not incidental to the story of all of this. Later in that same essay, The Rediscovery of Meaning, Barfield uses a metaphor drawn from the experience of language and reading to describe how we might move without loss beyond our present alienation. So. And when he says without loss, because again, if you look at Thomas Nagel and some of the points that I've been making, I mean, Thomas Nagel is a world renowned philosopher who has come to the point of saying the old paradigm has come to the end. How can we move beyond it without losing? Because we don't want to lose the knowledge that we have gained that has allowed us to create this cell phone holder in a very cheap and efficient way. We don't wanna lose that, but it's clear that we've come to the end of this. How can we get beyond it? Here's a bit of speculation about the future from Barfield. He writes, "'It remains to be considered whether the future development of scientific man must inevitably continue in the same direction so that he becomes more and more a mere onlooker, measuring with greater and greater precision and manipulating more and more cleverly an earth to which he grows spiritually more and more a stranger.'" Now, spiritually there's, again, if you've listened to my other videos, you know I'm hung up on this word. What do you mean by spiritually more and more a stranger? Who holds the knife at our dissecting ourselves? Who reprograms the assassin robot? Who does these things? Well, who? That's the question. We don't even know what we are. His detachment has enabled him to describe, weigh, and measure the processes of nature and to a large extent control them. But the price he has paid. Now, it's important when you hear nature in that sentence too to think, well, what do you mean by nature? And what we have come to mean by nature is often that which proceeds on its own apart from intentionality. And again, remember the picture from Think Big Animation. We're all by ourselves out here in the totally dead world. And so nature is that totally dead world, but it's moving. And so then we study the relationships and the systems within it. And we say, well, those are the systems and the mechanisms and the processes, but they are mindless and directionless and purposeless. And when you listen to talk from Darwin of Darwinian process where that's random. Random is just another synonym for a sequence we can't understand or predict. That's what we mean by random, but we've given it another internal seed of a story that says, well, that's this impersonal process that happens and it must be consciousness. Has been the loss of his grasp of any right and to a large extent control them. More and more a stranger. His detachment has enabled him to describe, weigh and measure the processes of nature and to a large extent control them. But the price he has paid has been the loss of his grasp of any meaning in either nature or himself. Penetration to the meaning of a thing or process as distinct from the ability to describe it exactly involves a participation by the knower in the known. The meaning of what I am writing is not the physical pressure of thumb and forefinger or the size of the inclines with which I form the letters. It is the concepts expressed in the words I'm writing. But the only way of penetrating to these is to participate in them, to bring them to life in your mind by thinking them. In other words, there's something that happens and it happens in the letters of a book where the participation only happens when, so Alvin Plante again, Nick Waltersdorf wrote this book, when I, Paul VanderKlay, read them, when I participate in them, that makes the letters, suddenly the book is transformed. I am bringing something to this dance. Now suddenly, well, what if we are just floating in the air and swimming out there in space in the middle of a dead universe or what in fact, if there is a knower, one who knows all and he's conscious and he sees all, well again, suddenly you see the necessity of God for psychology, the necessity of God for meaning. In the same way, if we want to know the meaning of nature, we must learn to read as well as to observe and describe. Now, if you've read Narnia, that just sentence he made, that's Narnia all over the place. Is there any possibility of scientific mans ever recovering the old power to read whilst still retaining his hard-won treasure of exact observations and manipulative control? For no one would advocate a mere relapse into the past. Signs are not altogether wanting that there is such a possibility. Well, that's exciting. Tell us more. Oops, one ahead. And I didn't make the slide. Oh no. I hate it when I forget to paste the link into the slide, but let's just keep going in it. Now, he wrote that in 1926. And in a sense, everything he has written since is a development of that insight, that our current mode of consciousness is not the same as it was when the words we are now using were first used, nor will it remain the same. We can learn from a previously participative, meaning-drenched way of understanding and perhaps learn to recover a participative way of knowing. The period in which we happen to be living, in which we experience knowledge as detached and alienated, is only one fragment of time. But, Barfield contends, we carry all of us within us, embedded in the language we use, the memory of another way of seeing the world. That is one of Barfield's core ideas. This idea that by finding out what words used to mean, you can get a different view of consciousness itself, is one he explains very clearly in a short passage in a later book, called Speaker's Meaning. Here, Barfield makes a distinction between inner and outer. A thing can have an outer meaning, but also an inner meaning, which we now think of, we now, in our way of thinking, think of as a metaphorical meaning, but he's interested in why we have to choose, put a flag in that, as Sam Harris says, because we're going to have to come back to that metaphorical meaning. So, you're talking metaphorical truth, this idea that came up with Jordan Peterson and Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris in the Vancouver talks. We'll come back to that. We have to choose in our mode for a meaning, which we now think of, we now, in our way of thinking, think of as a metaphorical meaning, but he's interested in why we have to choose in our mode, between outer and inner. Why we have to choose between the literal and the metaphorical, and why we can't have both at once to the enrichment of both. This is what Barfield writes in Speaker's Meaning. Words which for us today have an outer meaning only, formerly had an inner meaning as well. Moreover, the process by which they have lost their inner meanings is clearly the obverse or correlative of the very process by which many other words have lost their outer meanings. Both processes may well be illustrated by the history of such terms as breath, or air, or wind, and spirit. For here, they happen to be sharply pointed by a well-known record from a period when they were not as yet divided. In the English version of St John's Gospel, this is all Barfield, in the English version of St John's Gospel, Chapter 3, we find the following three verses in which both terms, air, wind, breath, spirit, are employed alternately. John 3.6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whenst it cometh, or whither it goeth. So is everyone that is born of the spirit. Probably, this is still Barfield, probably most people read the first part of the verse, verse 8, as a metaphor comparing the spirit with the wind. But if we turn to the Greek, we find it is not so. The same word, nouma, is employed throughout, though it has been rightly translated first as spirit, and then later as wind, and then again as spirit. In Hellenistic Greek, nouma still conveyed the concomitant meanings both, but the English translate. And again, think about that, and what blows my mind is that, when I go to seminary, they teach me to read Greek, and so you read the New Testament in Greek, and you mentally translate, well, nouma, spirit, nouma, spirit, wind. And in English, when you do the translation, we just fill in the words. Well, what if we use wind each time? Well, it doesn't seem right. Well, why doesn't it seem right? Well, what's going on? It has had to split it into two words, one of which, spirit, has since lost its outer meaning. So spirit has a kind of abstract metaphysical meaning, but you can't put your hand on it. Wind, this is me explaining, but wind is, you can put an anemometer up and get a reading, but you don't think it's a spiritual thing. Huh? Now, what's so interesting here is that, again, there's a divorce. There's a divorce that happens in nouma between wind and spirit. And one of the things with my God number one and God number two, there's divorce that happens in the meaning of the word God between number one and number two. And I'm going to have to think about the relationship between the divorce in the word spirit and the divorce in the word God, because it's this split world that the meaning crisis is showing us that that's what all of this comes down to. When we see that in earlier life and culture, didn't need two words for those two things, but insisted on one word for both, we recognize that they were apprehending a unity which we've lost. Does that make sense? So, spirit has lost its outer meaning and wind has lost its inner meaning. And that outer and inner meaning is a really interesting... So wind has lost its inner meaning. Wind, we can put up the wind gauge and watch it spin, but it's purposeless. It's dead. We, poetically, I mean, how many movies do you sit there and at a certain moment the wind blows and Jonathan Pigeot watches the movie and says, ah, symbolism. Yeah, symbolism. Symbolism is connecting the outer and the inner meanings. We say, oh, the wind is blowing, which the other day I was standing, I walked out of a building somewhere, I stood, and a wind came up in blue and I just had this sense of change, and it changes in the air. Well, the weather changes and in Sacramento, when you get a windy day, it usually means that there's another front moving in, and well, that's its outer meaning, but it, so wind lost its outer meaning and spirit lost its inner meaning. Or, wait a minute, wind lost its inner meaning and spirit lost its outer meaning. Because now, again, words that fudge. Every time I hear someone say spirit or spiritual, and this is the amazing thing because everybody's using this word. I mean, to speak about all of the kind of things we care about talking about and no longer use this word, hardcore atheists can't seem to do it. Just like hardcore atheists can't seem to divorce themselves from the idea that they are not fixed into the whole show. And that's the point that Lewis makes in that passage I didn't read from Miracles, which I thought I might read by the way. I'm not going to read it. Here we are. It's the same thing, but yet we operate, we function, we walk around, we use language, we do all this stuff, and we don't know what we're doing. I've been thinking a lot about kind of the high resolution and the low resolution. We learn to operate these things in a good enough way. We used to employ the word spirit or spiritual in a good enough way that other people sort of get. But when we sit down and we really focus on it, we really try to say, now, what exactly do you mean? And you see that in a lot of the conversations I do. Someone will throw that word out. I'll say, what do you mean by spirit? What do you mean by spiritual? What's lost its outer meaning? We're still using it because actually with our language, we're navigating the inner and outer all the time as we go, but we're not paying much attention to it. And this is part of the thing that I do as a pastor is I do pay attention to the line between the outer and the inner, and I keep watching people go across it and then say, well, I'm an atheist. I'm thinking, you don't sound like an atheist. Yeah, but then they'll be offended like Matt Dillahunty and Sam Harris. Or you say, well, I'm a Christian. Well, you don't act like a Christian. That's what pastors say all the time. I'm a Christian. You don't act like a Christian. We don't know what we're doing. They've been split up. For us, the wind, and that's the end of Barfield's comment. Now I'm commenting on this. For us, the wind only means the thing that blows. It doesn't mean anything spiritual at all. We split these two things up that were once apprehended together as a unity. However, what Barfield noticed is that when we read poetry, particularly poetry from these earlier periods, we can suddenly experience a change of consciousness. And for a moment at least, we can have a real knowledge of the world as seen from a different mode of consciousness. Now this is important because it's not just poetry. It's music. It's a movie. It's a film. It's art. And this is where we get into this question of that which is real because, and I got into a little bit of this with the Frank Schaefer thing because the Frank Schaefer says when each of us bends down and sees the toddler and the toddler runs into our arms just in that moment, now pay attention even when we're talking about this, just in that moment it's a transitor thing and a little bit later, I don't remember if I have this in or if I'll play it, but it's the wire passing over the magnet. I mean it's that, it's the spark and that's the language that we use. It's the spark just in that moment when the embrace between the lover and the beloved in that moment of insight, in that moment of seeing, what is that moment? You don't, it's not like this. We use language and with language we can sometimes provoke it with poetry or with art we can provoke it or with illustrations we can provoke it, but it's not. This. So what is it and where does it live? Because in truth we live for it because if you look at, now we're going to have the great competition between Netflix and Amazon Prime streaming and Disney's going to start their own streaming and what are they selling? They're selling that moment. They're selling that passing, that thing that Frank Schaeffer says makes the whole world worthwhile and if something were to happen to that child, the universe would collapse. Okay, so what is real? Well, people pay a great deal of money to go on vacation to stand up and see Yosemite National Park and have that moment. So what is real? What is governing? What is colonizing? What is determining? What is molding and shaping? And so cars are made and airplane tickets are bought and hotels are built and railroads are constructed and rails are laid and all of this materiality lines up and serves that moment. That moment of what I would say is glory. Again, my answer, I sometimes go into classrooms and say, why is the world made? You can't answer that question in a materialistic frame. Why is the world made? I say the world is made for glory. What do you mean by glory? It's that moment when the baker comes out with the best cake they've ever made. It's the moment when the baker is watching the guest take the fork and put the piece in their mouth and say, it's the best cake that I've ever eaten. It's that moment. But we live in time. We have time. We have the moment. We have materiality. We have all of this stuff. We have story. What is happening? Indeed, in Barfield's key work, Poetic Diction, he goes so far as to define poetry as a felt change of consciousness. He was actually in the draft originally just saying a change of consciousness and he was reading it out to C.S. Lewis and Lewis said, no, you must say a felt change of consciousness. And that's the baker watching the guest eat the cake. And this again is there must be an observer. The baker, the woman eating the cake by herself, there's less glory in that than the baker seeing it. You write a thank you letter for someone who said something or done something. I get lots of thank you messages for my videos. Why do you send a thank you? Because it must be watched. It must be appreciated. It must be observed. Well, what about when no one is there to hear the tree falling in the woods? There's an observer. And this is what not just Christianity but this is what the world has. There's got to be an observer. And again, pay attention to the story of the beginning of the world. Someone's at my door. Hang on. Plumbing work in an old building. It's the experience of that. I can suddenly see something I didn't see before. I suddenly conscious. He was reading it out to C.S. Lewis and Lewis said, no, you must say a felt change of consciousness. It's the experience of that. I can suddenly see something I didn't see before. I suddenly feel the inner has at last been restored to me of what was once before I read this poem, only the empty outer. That's what I felt. That change. So Barfield writes, I find myself obliged to define poetry as a felt change of consciousness where consciousness embraces all my awareness of my surroundings at any given moment. And surroundings includes my feelings. By felt, I need to signify that the change itself is noticed or attended to. He elaborates on this definition a little later in poetic diction using a very interesting analogy drawn from science. The phrase must be taken with some exactness. It's talking about the moment of appreciation, the moment you suddenly see the thing in a new way. Appreciation takes place at the actual moment of change. It's not simply that the poet enabled me to see with eyes and say to apprehend a larger and fuller world, but the actual moment of the pleasure of appreciation depends upon something rarer and more transitory. It depends upon the change itself. If I pass a coil of wire between the two poles of a magnet, I generate in it an electric current. But I only do so while the coil is positively moving across the lines of force. Current only flows when I'm bringing the coil in or taking it away. So it is with the poetic mood, which like the passage from one plane of consciousness to another, it lives during the moment of transition and then dies. It lives and then dies. And if it is to be repeated, some means must be found of renewing the transition itself. It's a really remarkable passage. You could spend a long time dwelling on it. One thing I'd particularly like to draw to your attention is that what he says happens in those moment where we're reading a piece of poetry suddenly restores a kind of wholeness to your view of things. In other words, the inner and the outer have now come back together. He's not saying it's a grim, dull, meaningless, pointless set of, you know, what Coleridge called from Locke's point of view, an immense heap of little things out there. And that's pretty grim. But at least we've got some poetry to kind of compensate for it privately in our own little islanded inner consciousness. That's the materialist perspective. And when you every year, they didn't put one up this year. Usually around Easter time, the Sacramento Freedom from Religion Association puts up a billboard. And I've used that in previous videos. So here's this dude and here's his face. And he believes that the universe is meaningless, but he experiences wonder. And that's good enough. I don't think it's good enough. It isn't satisfying most people. He's not saying that at all. He's actually saying the experience of reading great poetry, particularly ancient poetry and ancient text, is that for a moment you see the world as other people saw it once. And that world is still there. You're, as it were, having put into your hands a new scientific instrument like a better telescope. It's very interesting. One of the poets who I think has most absorbed some of this understanding, though not directly from Barfield, but as it were indirectly from Coleridge, is the modern Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis. And she's got a superb sequence of poems called Zero Gravity, which is, amongst other things, about the repair of the Hubble Space Telescope. So it happened that her cousin was one of the astronauts that went up to, you know, they spent all this money on this great mirror up in space. And it just was slightly out of adjustment. So they weren't getting, and they had to go out and have somebody physically kind of recalibrate it and adjust it. And as a result, we had those astonishing and beautiful pictures. And she has a constant analogy between the subtle readjustment of this this thing and what poetry itself is doing as a possibility for the way we perceive ourselves and our spirits. And that's a very, both a Coleridgean and Barfieldian way of seeing things. So if we're making, this is me explaining Barfield, if we're making a transition, if we're moving from one plane of consciousness to another as we read a piece of great poetry, we might reasonably ask, which is the plane we have lost and which is the plane we're gaining? Barfield believed that at least one mode of this change of consciousness enabled us to see the world in an older and more participative way, which he believed healed our alienation. And that is part of where both the pleasure and the power of poetry was to be felt. For Barfield, the access to forgotten truths, which such a change of consciousness enables, is vital as a counterbalance and corrective to the one-eyed view of reductive science. So just as poetry and poetic metaphor gave us an access to this change of consciousness, so too he also believed going behind the poetry, the earliest poetry, the whole realm of myths and mythology, so-called primitive myths, which are the subject, of course, of early poetry, also have something vital to teach us. Indeed, Barfield appeals to myth, particularly to the story of Odin, later in poetic diction, to make this very point. Now you may remember, if you've read one version or another of the legends of Asgard, that in order to acquire knowledge, Odin made a sacrifice, first hanging himself on the world tree, Yggdrasil, the steed of Odin, the great ash tree that connected the nine worlds of Norse mythology, first hanging himself on the world tree, and then, you remember, descending to its roots and offering to pluck out one of his own eyes in return for the knowledge of how to interpret the runic letters, which the tree was writing with its roots. So, Barfield says this about modern science, extraordinary application of the myth, but very pertinent. Our sophistication, like Odin's, has cost us an eye, and now it is the language of poets, in so far as they create true metaphors, which must restore this lost unity conceptually after it has been lost from perception. We see things that perhaps others couldn't have seen in other ages, but only by plucking out one of our eyes and looking at the others. So, for Barfield, the great deposits of human poetic utterance in many languages over several millennia, to which we still have access in the foundational texts of the great religions and the mythologies, oral mythologies of all the ancient peoples, in everything from our own Hebrew and Christian scriptures through to the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita and through to the stories of the First Nations in the Americas, the great inheritance of those things. For Barfield, that great deposit of human poetic utterance in many languages, to which we still have access, is not simply some disposable cultural capital. It's not a series of records of purely subjective experience, nor, as Dawkins would have it, a series of incorrect versions of modern science. It is, instead, for Barfield, part of the hard evidence we have of the changing interaction between consciousness and cosmos. More than that, it is still, for all of us, a mode of knowing which we would be foolish to ignore, as he says in the amazing concluding paragraph of Poetic Diction. Without the continued existence of poetry, without a steady influx of new meaning into language, even the knowledge and wisdom which poetry has self-given in the past must wither away into a species of mechanical calculation. Great poetry is the progressive incarnation of life into consciousness. That's an astonishing thing to say, there's a whole other time this evening to get into all of what that means. But it's a stunning thing when you read this, because it's such a rejection of the fundamental division, the kind of, as I've called it in another place, the epistemological apartheid that we're living with at the moment, the separate development, where we've got hard-edged, reductive, factual, quantitative scientific knowledge over there, which is the real stuff that's actually the case. And then we've got this kind of quaint little bantu stand over here of nice heritage touchy-feely subjective stuff that we're allowed to have, providing it doesn't impinge on anything like economics. Over here. And Barfield is saying, no, we are casting aside and allowing to rust the very instruments which the past has given for understanding what is the case. So, how might the insights from these two literary and philological books, History in English Words and Poetic Dictionary, I'm going to jump ahead to the next thing about Spirit and Wind, where he rants a little bit. Barfield's next major work, really major work after Poetic Dictionary, a long gap, great deal of thinking in between, was Saving the Appearances in 1957. Saving the Appearances is subtitled A Study in Idolatry. It's really a work concerned with the way we know, with the relationship between thinking and imagination, language and perception, and with how all these relate to our awareness, both of the divine and of what it is to be human. Now, at its core, it's an account of the evolution of consciousness. The evolution of consciousness was an idea he'd first posited in History in English Words. He'd been able to look at the evidence and say, look, the way we configure the world, the way we see things, has fundamentally changed. It's really clear from the fact that Numa, and for that matter Ruach, which is the Hebrew equivalent of Numa, or Spiritus, which is the Latin equivalent of it, it's clear from the way those words are used in the ancient texts that the ancients simply did not have the experience that we now have of a meteorological activity devoid of meaning, which is predicted by weather men and which you just get on with, that they could never feel a breeze blow or draw in or exhale a breath without that being entirely filled with spirit, without that being an exchange of consciousnesses and a participation and exchange of being. Wind could not be anything other than spirit. The language makes that clear. It is equally clear that the spiritual could not be anything other than the exchanged and particular and physical. It is not the case that they had private, intellectual, abstract spiritual experiences and some part went, oh, it's a bit like the breeze really, I think I'll make that link. It's only when the thing has been separated out, and we've falsely created the idea of a wind that isn't spiritual, that some poor poet has had to come in and do the reparation work and say, oh, well, look, I better make it a metaphor for the spirit because actually that's what it is. Do you see? So he'd seen that there was, we did used to know in a different way and had direct access to a different level and kind of reality than we've given ourselves access to now, that we've narrowed the focus of our vision that we've plucked out the eye. So of course it could have been, he could have ended up saying, well, gee, it was great then, I wish I'd been alive then, it's such a drag now, it's all going to the dogs, you know, end of story, which, you know, might have been a temptation. But on the contrary, he began to see that the process wasn't over and to see that actually the plucked out eye, the scientific knowledge might be quite important, but we need to find a way of recovering the other. And he began to think of a much bigger arc of this evolution and to see that we're in a story that's not over yet, so that the later writing becomes filled with extraordinary hope. Okay. What's interesting is this gets into very much the conversation that Peterson and Harris and Weinstein had in Vancouver. And there's a moment here when Weinstein finally has, it's sort of like the book of Job and he's ready to stop listening and he has something to say. I think I can get us somewhere. Alright, I'm going to start with you, Sam. Let's swap out the idea of metaphorical truth for something a little harder headed. Heuristics, right? We have heuristics, we use them to perceive the world, they're often highly reliable. What's interesting about this move is that when he sets it up this way, he says, sometimes we use heuristics, sometimes we don't. The problem isn't on the heuristic side, it's when he's saying we're not using heuristics. That's the side that has the problem. In fact, almost everything that you believe that lets you operate has to be a heuristic of some kind. If you decided to learn to drive and you got into the car and they said, okay, well it's all quarks out there, right? You need to understand how quarks interact with each other. Not useful. Right, not useful, right? What you need are some heuristics in which you can stipulate that there's something called a vehicle out there and you don't have to be overly precise about what it is and you learn to avoid it. The heuristics vary a lot in quality. Some of them are really good. The periodic table is really good. Now, the periodic table is really good. Okay, what do we mean by that? See, one of the things that I've been doing a lot of thinking about is, in fact, is the, what's the meaning of this? What is the use of this? Well, let's hold myself up. How does physicality function in our world? And I think it's basically communication. It's a really durable form of communication. Now, the psalmist says that, Psalm 8, Heavens declare the glory of God. Day after day they pour forth speech. Night after night they pour forth wisdom. The heavens declare the glory of God. Day after day they pour forth speech. What if materiality, in fact, is here to communicate? See, now, in our split world, it doesn't, because we assume we're alive and it's dumb. Well, what is this telling me? The idea of gravitational potential energy is kind of crappy, right? If I have a phone on a table here, I can tell you how much potential energy it has by measuring its mass and its distance from the ground, but if I've got a hole at one depth on one side of the table and another depth on the other side of the table, I can't calculate it because it's a crappy heuristic. What exactly is crappy? And right away we're back in a sense to Aristotle. And, well, what about that? Why is our heuristic so crappy? And one of the things that you see very much in all of this is, and Verveki then gets into this, is the functionality of will within the choices that we've made about how to set up the world. Because what we're really looking for is to govern. But again, who's holding the knife on the ongoing first-person dissection? Who's doing the reprogramming of the assassin robot? It works well enough in regular stuff, right? Now here's the question. What if these religious texts are heuristics through which most people simplify calculations that they are in no position to do based on the limited amount that they are capable of perceiving, the amount that they understand about the things that are in play? Such a condescending way of, oh, those old ancient people who didn't know much. Yeah, right? So they're deploying these heuristics maybe to reduce things that degrade well-being. If it were true that religious... It's so funny because again, well-being is simply assumed instead of, we don't know what's well-being. Give somebody endless amounts of money and five years and say maximize well-being. Will they do it? Good luck. You cannot demote truth as merely metaphorical unless you do not know what truth you are pointing to, but also the truth in which that truth operates. In fact, there's an entire structure that has to be brought in. And I love this little illustration that Geit uses here. And again, what it shows me is that this other video that I played at other times from Dallas Willard where he talks about worldviews in that our worldviews are not really... They're not really set forward straightforwardly to us. Oh, yeah, sure. We push religion and we push ideas and we push values and we enforce things. And here's an important book and an important author that gets into this. And he deals with the world after Freud, which is uses of faith after Freud. Very interesting stuff. But Dallas Willard makes the point that, you know, it's all in the tiny little status things that we use. In fact, if you're walking on campus and say something that is out of step with the current regime on campus, that could be something about political correctness or identity or it could be saying something like, well, I think God made the world. Boom, status hit. We're highly... We pay a tremendous amount of attention to status within our social realm. Okay? I had another conversation with Nick that I'll be dribbling out at some point where Nick and I talk about that. Whoops. Don't want to go ahead. But Gait nails this in this little illustration that he has. And Barfield points to a couple of really major things that are really major shifts in the way we as human beings have configured and imagined the world around us and the way that imagination has then actually affected the things we see, as it were, and affected our observations. So he talks about the shift from an Aristotelian mode of thinking, which had the... Oh, I missed it. I've got to find it now. This is one of the key points that Peterson keeps trying to make to Sam Harris in the Vancouver lectures again and again and again. He keeps trying to point to this. Sam Harris says, well, I'm just living in this space of objects. I'm just acting in the world. And Peterson says, that's completely naive and completely wrong scientifically. You are bringing stuff to the experience. When I walk into my office, I see a very different room than when somebody else walks into my room. Somebody else walks into my room, they see all of the mess in my office and they say, gosh, this pastor's got to get a grip. His office is a disaster. When I walk into my office, I'm just waiting to sit down and do what I need to do in it. Is it the same room? Yes and no. Including the instruments which science uses for that very penetration. It insists on dealing with data, but there shall be no data given save the bare percept. The next is imagination. Only by imagination, therefore, can the world be known. What is needed is not only that larger and larger telescopes and more and more sensitive calipers should be constructed, but that the human mind should become increasingly aware of its own creative activity. That's a very far-reaching thing to say. He points out something which actually lots of people admit, but they just don't join up the knowledge. I've admitted it since Kant, actually, that what we perceive of the world, including all the stuff we study scientifically and look at through telescopes and microscopes, physicists will tell you this straight away. Any physicist will tell you that this desk is actually mainly space and that the appearance of its solidity and all of that is something that we experience as a result of a combination of the shape of our minds and the nature of our senses. In fact, we do a great deal creatively of joining up, as it were, the dots of experience. We all know that, you know, there are lots of drawings where you can have the half thing drawn and you make the rest of the face. There's a huge amount of us shaping the world that we perceive. But Western scientific knowledge is trying to ignore that completely. I often use the example from my own experience of doing science in school as a child. I came into the English school system late and had never done proper science as the children were doing it there, physics, chemistry and biology. So my first experience of it was a sort of third-form chemistry lesson when the boys had already been taught how to write up the experiments. I was just amazed and astonished by it all. We were doing a really simple thing with litmus paper, putting it into the acid and alkaline and changed color. We had to write the experiments up. I think, you know, one of my best early prose poems about this experience and how I took the litmus paper and I put it in and on. I included all the facts that we'd done, you know, but I expressed my wonder at it. It was my first chemistry homework. Of course, I was called up to the class when the homework came back and given a right dressing gown. Every time I'd use the word I, I had a red pen through it. I was instructed by torturing the English language and using the passive voice that, you know, the litmus paper was immersed into the titration and it was observed that such and such. As though there'd been nobody to do it, nobody to observe it, nobody actually there, just the dry objective facts. And I was expected to swallow this fiction that the thing had happened with nobody there to be there. But actually, if there'd been nobody there, it wouldn't have happened. And my perception of the beauty of what it was was part of the event. Now, you know, obviously my chemistry teacher hadn't done any quantum physics and didn't understand the importance of the observer. But you see that, that, that, right. And they didn't see it too well. But it's a beautiful point and it's exactly the same point that Dallas Willard makes with, you know, the students who are getting, the woman at the beginning of The Divine Conspiracy, he tells a story of Robert Coles where there's a graduate student in the Harvard Business School complaining that she's dropping out of the course because basically all of the guys who are getting great grades in her class, she's cleaning rooms to try to make her way through school. And these guys don't act very ethically towards her, even though they're getting a graduate degree in business ethics. And she's just trying to do a little business. This is how we are. And so what happens, I love that, I love that chemistry experiment, take out the eye and he's like, it didn't, it didn't dip in by itself. You're not a part of the picture. Oh, really? I'm not? This is one of my favorite Peterson clips. So, so, so Roger mentioned that the transcendent is what we bump up against when we realize our ignorance. And so it's that which transcends our ignorance. And that in itself makes it an implacable fact, unless you believe that you have no ignorance, in which case there's no point in furthering a discussion with you. So the transcendent is the fact in so far as it's that which transcends our ignorance. But you can also think about it technically. So, and I think we know enough about how the brain works now, so that not that we know much, so that useful things can be said about that. You tend to represent the world in the simplest manner that you possibly can that works for what you're doing. And so you don't actually see the world. You see sufficiently useful low-resolution representations of the world. And if they work, then that's fine. There's no need to adjust them, and they're relatively easy to remember and to manipulate. But now and then you have a misapprehension about someone, let's say, and you have a conversation with them, and the conversation goes sideways. And what that means is that the thing that you thought you were conversing with is not the thing that you're conversing with. And that manifests itself in error. So error is the place where the transcendent reveals itself. Now that earlier part where... Error. And the misapprehension. And if they work, then low-resolution, you see the world. You see sufficiently useful low-resolution representations of the world. Sufficiently useful low-resolution representations of the world. If you pay attention to your own perception in new situations carefully enough, you will find this to be true. I rented a car in Massachusetts when I went there for my daughter's graduation. It was a beautiful Jeep, Cherokee. It was a lot better than the car I thought I was renting. But it was a beautiful car, and I drove the car for four or five days. Each successive day I learned more about the car. Well, did the car change or did I did? Well, see, in a way you say, well, the car didn't change. The car always had that capacity. But this is why we talk about grammar and this is hard stuff to understand. When we see the world, we see these low representation, these low-resolution representations. That's what we see. And we see that when we're doing science. We see that when we're doing our children. We see that when we're doing our spouses. And they get encapsulated in these moments of consciousness. And there we are. But we see them in communities, too. It's not just us by ourselves. And Barfield points to a couple of really major shifts in the way we, as human beings, have configured and imagined the world around us. And the way that imagination has then actually affected the things we see, as it were, and affected our observations. So he talks about the shift from an Aristotelian mode of thinking, which Aristotle, you remember, had the idea of the unmoved mover. But Aristotle believed that everything else that moved consciously moved in a relation to something else, that everything, as it were, was moved by love in the end, and that the spheres turned because they yearned to be with the sphere above them. And that's why the words motion and emotion are actually related. Motion and emotion, because they're moved by love. That was the consciousness. This is what Barfield is helping us to see that Aristotle didn't just have some crazy idea. That was the world that he lived in. That was the world of the community he lived in. Our language and why we speak about being moved in more than one way or the other, that we still have an inner and outer for move, but Barfield says we'll soon lose the inner, and moving will no longer be moving. It'll just be setting things in mechanical motion. One of the last places where we get them both beautifully is in Coleridge's lovely line in the Ancient Mariner, where he says the moving moon went up the sky and nowhere did abide. And the moving moon is moving in the sense that it's moving through space, but it's moving the mariner, it's moving the sea. It is itself something which moves the whole meaning of the poem. So there was a big shift from the Aristotelian participative, engaged, conscious way of seeing the world to a mechanistic way in which you have a law of gravity rather than a law of motion as meaningful motion. Then there's another major shift, which is the famous one between the heliocentric and the heliocentric view. So if you thought the Earth was the center of things, then you configured everything in one way, and then you realize, no, actually you can make a better account of the observations, the appearances, if you think of it the other way. But what Kuhn pointed out in his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, is when an old theory, an old consensus, an old fixed way of seeing things, which was a human construct but has been around for so long that nobody thinks it's a human construct anyway, they think it's just an iron scientific law, when one of those is getting ready to break, what happens is you get a series of new observations which don't fit the old mold, and the scientific establishment of the old mold, whatever it is, completely ignore them and don't publish any of the papers about it. And then when eventually the observations are too many to deny, they come up with increasingly elaborate theories to account for the new observations under the old system. And it was wonderful when the brilliant and ingenious attempts to account for novas and to account for the observation of the movement of heavenly bodies while still seeing the Earth as the center and the sun going round, it was absolutely brilliant until eventually you couldn't do it anymore. And somebody, you know, kind of Copernicus had to come along and say, just imagine it this way, suppose it was this, and then suddenly the new model makes complete sense of all the observations. But for a while about five people understand it, and everybody else is going on with the old view, and in fact we're still going on, we still talk about sunrise and sunset, don't we? We don't say Earth turn, which is what it actually is. So he observes that when there's a big shift coming, there's a few people get it, there's a lot of real observations that are underprivileged and not noticed, and then eventually there's a leap and a new sense is made of things. And now what's interesting about that, and as I continue to get into Barfield, I'm going to be paying attention to, because I'm very interested in how these things move in the zeitgeist, how massive numbers of people change to the point that when I go into a classroom I'll say, how many of you believe that the Earth is round? Everybody raises their hand. I say, can you demonstrate that to me? Well, I saw a picture from the moon. That's not a demonstration. I think it's Dallas Willard, what he's saying. It's the status things that we believe in groups, and then these beliefs then focus and shape our world. It's the most obvious thing, but we quickly forget it all the time. The leap and the new sense are always preceded by an increasing sense of crisis and desperation. And he believes, writing in the 70s, that we are about to undergo just such a change, that the previous consensus that there is no mind out there and that mind in here is only an accident that's kind of rolling around meaninglessly in the concavity of our skulls and will soon be extinguished, which is very peculiar, and it's a view that's only been going on in the West for about 300 years. And he thinks it's had its day. It just doesn't account, we cannot account for consciousness. Simply mechanistically. But we've got such a huge investment in a purely reductive and mechanistic way of seeing things that every time we get any kind of observational phenomenon that doesn't fit. We've got this huge, we've got, economists will say, we have huge sunk costs in the present situation. And again, as I've said in past videos, when Christianity was in a sense getting moved out of the public sphere, we had huge sunk costs in it that philosophers and philosophers, you find again and again philosophers that would be like, well, we can't believe this stuff anymore, but here's a new adaptation of Christianity that's going to work for us now. Here's a new reduction of Christianity that's going to work for us now. Here's a new way, and you find that in Christian theologians all throughout the 20th century, basically, evangelicals would call them modernists, all these new adaptations because the sunk costs are just too large that we can't give it up. Well, now folks are giving it up. But we've got the same thing with modernity. The sunk costs are just too large that we can't give it up, so we have to adapt it. And so this is where Sam Harris, people say, well, why do you like Sam Harris? Well, Sam Harris is one of the few atheists that talks about spirituality. Okay, he's trying to figure out when we have the earth at the center how to have the sun, how to account for space. Copernicus is going to come along and nobody's going to remember Sam Harris. Take with it, we just ignore it. But there comes a point where there's too many to ignore. And he gives a brilliant account, which is what perhaps I'll close with, of the way those changes come and the way he feels they're coming now. Which again seems to me to put its finger on just where we are. So this is why he calls the current way we see things the Cartesian paradigm. The Cartesian paradigm because Descartes defined man as a thinking substance, said I think man. And you remember Descartes, the most significant division in knowledge that Descartes made, which we're still working with, is the Cartesian paradigm. The Cartesian paradigm is between two kinds of being. There's intellectual, I can't remember, there's thinking stuff, which is only in us. He thought probably in the pineal gland. And then there's extensive stuff, stuff out in space, but that doesn't think. And that's the big division. And he thinks that's coming to an end. This is what he says. The frozen mass on which he depicts us as camping on the surface of an ice cap that is about to melt. A frozen mass on which the psychological and physical structure of our technological civilization is erected. And into which are embedded deep down foundations determining even the minor details of the edifice they support. That mass consists of a collective conviction, mainly subliminal and by now amounting to a certainty, that nature is an objective system which man can only affect by manipulation from without. And that each individual man is separate, as a separate part of that kind of nature. That is the mass. And its surface at first sight looks firm enough. Yet for those with eyes to see, there are a good many indications that it is not nearly as firm as it looks. And further, that the likelihood of the mass as a whole continuing solid is being seriously threatened, both from above and below. Cracks are appearing in the surface where the foundation first became visible to the naked eye as the result of impacts from above. While from the opposite direction the frozen mass itself appears to be growing thinner, becoming more like the crust than a mass, as it is thawed by a gradual increasing warmth, uprising from the depths below. The impacts from above represent the instinctive human reactions against the results of our critical, uncritical objectivity that has dominated intellectual life for the last two or three centuries. The warmth from below represents the beginning of the criticism. And he thinks the whole thing that we've seen as this solid way of dividing the world up is changing in the face of a change of consciousness. And he thinks we're the generation that are living through that. And that one of the ways in which we'll work our way through it and recover knowledge is actually by remembering and participating in the knowledge of poetry. Thank you, Will, I'll stop. Okay. And I'm out of time. But what was I going to say? In a sense, there it is. Now, he wrote that in the 70s. You might say, wow, the 70s, that was a long time ago. A bunch of you people living here weren't living in the 70s. Don't forget these things take a long time to change. As I've said many times, the modernist worldview died in the ashes of the First World War. But the body takes a long time to cool. Okay. And here we are. Anyway, I'm out of time. So let me know what you think about this.
