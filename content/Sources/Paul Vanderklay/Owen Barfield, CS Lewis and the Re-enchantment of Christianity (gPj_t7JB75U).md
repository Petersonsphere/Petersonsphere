 How have you been Mark? I'm well yeah so the books been out about a month or so yeah and like you know I'm getting I haven't had any unexpected reviews I was hoping to get a few reviews like in the Christian press in this country I think they might be coming so I'm still waiting on that a bit but getting a nice little crop of emails some people have read it and said you know this really got something for me I want to take it further so that's all sense that it might get momentum as it were and not just you know be oh that was an interesting read and then move on because that's kind of what you want for a book if possible. Well what would you like what would you like the book to do? I think give people a fresh sense of Christianity and particularly the person of Jesus and focus people on this transformation of consciousness which I think is at the heart of Christianity you know what would traditionally be called the mystical side I'd know relocating the kind of spiritual wellspring of our culture I feel that we need it as a culture even as a civilization and Barfield I think can help point us at that but but and also move Christianity I think from I don't know how you say it but for me it's it feels in this country it's got a predominantly kind of moral sensibility which is no bad thing but move it from that to a sensibility which is much more about the mystical core of life itself which actually I think is much much more needed in in Western culture I think we've got very uncoupled from that. It's it's interesting I I've never been to the UK but I've obviously spoken with some people from it and I know some people who live there the the it's always so hard to talk about these things with any with any clarity because we're all individuals and we we sense the culture from our own perspective and from our own little locus of consciousness but the the sense that I often get from the UK is that there's a there's a obviously there's this this state church the Anglican Church there's some of these fringe Christian movements that are a little bit evangelical ish let's say some brought over from America and some that have always sort of been native to the UK and and and but yet a vast realm of people who are sort of living in the shadow of old churches but for whom any kind of conscious connection with the Christian tradition is is is fairly detached. Is that fair? Yeah and I think it is I mean it's the the percentage of the go-to church is very low now I think Anglican Christianity is still fairly significant in the culture you know still quite a lot of people will get married in a church and they'll think about something like baptism funerals that kind of thing and of course you know when that when the eumolica gets crowned or something like that then the church swings right into action you know but I think in terms of it really being a resource that people might turn to to flourish it's almost gone except unless you're really already initiated into church life because of your past or because you're one of the rare people that maybe has had some sort of conversion experience and maybe goes to a more evangelical church or you know you've got some faint echo of choral even song you know which I don't want to be sniffy about because they're they're amazing experiences but nonetheless this that it can really shape your life that that discourse is you know fading very fast now now you work you work as a therapist as how do you see yeah I'm not obviously not asking you to talk about individual clients but how do you see this disconnect in terms of the the types of people that you spend a lot of time with and and spend a lot of time listening to are are many of your your patients and clients just people from the general population or I mean what are you read I mean because I would assume I mean when you write a book like this and your perspectives are surely shaped by a lot of listening to how people are processing their lives and what they're struggling with and their their lack of flourishing yeah I mean I've written about very much trying to capture the inner dynamic that you know things like reading engage seeing the world in a different way a different you know adopting a different worldview this evolution of consciousness idea what that's like from the inside and that comes very much from the psychotherapy practice I mean people come with different expectations if you like different hopes some that very explicitly with Christian pasts religious pasts or they've read it they've listened to a lot of I mean I have you know people that have listened to a lot of YouTube's and sense then they know this thing called awakening or enlightenment kind of out there you know and they're they're wrestling with that so sometimes it's quite explicit sometimes it's the normal kind of troubles that people face anxiety depression these kind of things I've worked on the in the NHS as well which is the very explicitly clinical environment but either for me I think the most the primary thing is it's important for me to get get a developing sense of where I think I'm coming from and where I'm rooted you know otherwise I think burnout is very common among psychotherapists if you don't have a kind of sense of that where your wellspring is located and and writing the book was really important for me in that way but also it's it's kind of it means that in my mind if if an engagement with someone feels like it's going in a more spiritual direction you know then I've got I can I can kind of go there with them I've got some resources to go there with them you know I'm very very convinced that these things only really make a different when it's you can it yourself so you're always trying to stay with the person and feel where they are and see what next step might be possible to take but also I think that it's it's really important that kind of as a culture we're trying to create the possibility for a connection to a life that's not just a life in our own heads and although psychotherapy with Freud had a very skeptical approach to the spiritual my sense is that in the hundred years or more since Freud and things have developed very substantially on from there and many psychotherapists are very open to how as Barfield put it you know consciousness is not just something tapped onto the rest of the world but is the inside of the whole world and I think psychotherapy arose because there was a need to regain the kind of wisdom within a life that used to be in the medieval Christian period held by the religious houses that kind of disappeared in this country almost overnight within about ten years of the Reformation the dissolution of the monarchs and left a kind of a vacuum and it's it's the kind of wisdom that's got to be lived to really be passed on and it's not like Newton the second law of motion you know which you can kind of read in a book it's something that does come from within you now I watched your your your presence on unbelievable with with Malcolm Geith and I thought that was a I thought that was a really wonderful conversation and you also I mean you spoke and I you and I spoke a little bit about it about your story and you know as what you said about therapists is also true of pastors I mean people people imagine that pastors should somehow be these we're we're seen by the roles that we play and understanding that there's an inside to the roles that we play and if if the pastor doesn't have a living faith and doesn't have a continual likely wrestling with many of the same things that the people that they are ministering to and with also wrestle with there's a disconnect and the pastor is is not terribly helpful or useful for those around so so I'm curious you know it was interesting because because Justin Bradley mentioned that you had spoken with him before and I haven't dug up that episode but between that episode and the and the subsequent conversation obviously via this book via barfield after after Plato you had a wonderful conversation with Michael from who had I had spoken with before I thought that was a I thought that was just a tremendous conversation I thought you two went to a whole bunch of really helpful places and give me a better understanding of how this book arose for you how and obviously I think part of your project for this book comes out of your experience of renewal with faith can you can you talk about how how Jesus Christianity how consciousness has changed for you in this journey I think you've got to have a sort of direct sense of things and I think I can see now as a kind of cradle Christian you know my family was Anglican we went to church and it was quite a natural thing for me to be ordained for example and it wasn't difficult and I was always interested in theology you know so doing the study was always straightforward but I never really cracked the kind of direct experience strangely enough you know it was always mediated by the church and you know I knew and loved as it were church rituals church liturgies I was always you know quite monastic in my inclination so things like daily office and so on and were part of where I was at but I can see now that if I was always a bit of one-step removed I never felt which I know is a common experience but as it were I had a sort of divine friend in Jesus I never had that sense and I also never really had the sense of of God as a kind of person to relate to either and so that that kind of what I think in a way looking back that's what ran aground for me that I kind of ran out of connection with the source of the spirit you might say and then it wasn't until after I left being a curate being an Anglican clergy person and had a kind of breakdown really and through a combination both of therapy and also I discovered mindfulness I went on a quite extensive actually a three-year mindfulness training which took you kind of step-by-step for a whole load of things but realized that there was a felt presence of the divine that I could connect with and that was very real to me and so in a way that was the beginning of being able to speak from a sense of actual participation to use Barfield's term in these things and then when I you know got onto Barfield it began to give a kind of backstory to the sense that I was having now both in terms of Christianity but also in terms of my own sort of experience of a kind of alienation and disconnect and so on and and how that was actually part and parcel of what he thought of the evolution of consciousness of our times so that gave me it sort of put three dimensions into this nascent kind of sense of divine awareness you might say it's it's interesting when I listen to you even though I would think some aspects of your of your faith are quite distinct from let's say certain forms of American evangelicalism that especially in the in the 70s you know were categorized and articulated as a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and what you just described is using some different words but I think in some ways sort of maps and tracks with that movement I've often referred to Chuck Colson who in his book Born Again you know goes to his wife and says you know I'm I've become a Christian and his wife looks at him and says but we're Episcopalians what do you mean we've got a church all the time and and of course you know Jimmy Carter goes on the cover of Time magazine as Born Again and so this this whole thing moves through the United States at that point and it's it's interesting listening to you you know in in similar terms you know obviously different but also there's a there's a sort of a there's a sort of a mapping that's going together with that yeah I mean I think that's interesting no I think that's absolutely right I mean I was I was drawn to the more Anglo-Catholic side of things and also that was part of the monastic side but so for example I had a phase of doing quite a lot of silent prayer and trying to get into that but just not it just didn't really seem to work it sort of exhausted me and I it wasn't until I got to go with the Buddhist that could sort of show you silence a bit like how to ride a bike you know the practicalities of it and and then some developed sense too of what goes on inside when you're trying to engage with these exercises and it and really I just think that in certainly in the Christian circles I knew that that inner kind of awareness the wisdom has just kind of fallen away everyone knew there were the people that knew is important but the practical know-how as to how to do it just wasn't there so quite heroically kind of people struggled at it but it's not sustainable yeah it's very interesting just just looking over the landscape of these different Christian movements because of course also in in the United States sort of spearheaded by Dallas Willard there was the you know the Christian formation practice in the 70s as well there was a a renewed emphasis and focus of many like Richard Foster on on meditation the the spirit of the disciplines it's it's very interesting how how these you know these in some ways distinct distinct traditions distinct practices but but perhaps all sort of in the service of a of a revitalization and it's so so you so you like you know many other so you you learn some learn some things from the Buddhists but where does that also in your interview with an unbelievable it sounds like you're still sort of homeless in a sense too with respect to how to locate these things institutionally yeah I do feel that a bit I certainly do I mean I do a combo of both going to church and going to a place called the Buddhist Society where they just have sitting practice so it's like a communal sitting and this is nothing there's no ritual attached but it is nice to do that in a group and I mean my kind of my tussle with the church being the Church of England I know is that is that it very much defines itself in terms of its social engagement with with English culture say and it you know very very does that really really well there's a lot of civic engagement you know so we're not that far off Christmas now and so the Cathedral where I will go they will have dozens and dozens of carol services where people from all sorts of different companies and organizations will come in and and do that and they do that really well you know that does really give people something at this time of year and then also the social justice side which is very developed you know things like soup kitchens food banks and so on that's quite a big part of of what goes on in the UK now I mean the NHS is amazing I you know I've worked in the NHS and there's over a million people if you like are doing good Samaritan type stuff every day in the NHS out of a population of 65 million or something so it's very very well developed but there's always a need for kind of the net that people inevitably fall through when you get bureaucracy so that that's all very good but it's very this worldly it's very it feels very kind of secular actually some I read that some some people have written about the self secularization of Christianity which is when it flourishes in this kind of area but forgets the more vertical dimensions and you know in a way because the Church of England certainly is going through an identity crisis there's a huge risk that it devotes more and more energy to the things which do seem to be going well like the social engagement side of things and but at the same time almost unaware it's losing touch more and more and more with what I think of as its wellspring and in fact what could be its real USP because there's lots of people that do good social engagement and you know not least of which is the NHS but what it feels to me like our culture really has lost a capacity to engage skillfully with is this spiritual dimension and I that's what Jesus meant by the kingdom and that's why he kept going around saying have they got eyes to see how they got ears to hear and all that side of things you know we human beings need more than this world even though we're in this world and man shall not live by brotherhood and etc etc you know you can away but unless I mean as much like you say unless a pastor is kind of engaged with that element themselves in their own lives even if they kind of know somewhere in the back of their mind it's important it won't come through and so the priests in the Church of England unless they're engaged with that kind of personal development the spiritual discernment of things themselves inevitably it just doesn't have the vitality and so you know when you're looking to be fed and develop yourself in that in that way you have to search quite hard for a place where you can actually find that as the main priority it's you know it's it's interesting to listen to you talk about this because obviously in in America the I often hear the opposite complaint which is that this large let's say evangelical church is so often so heavenly minded in the opinion of some there's no there no earthly good although if you if you actually look at who who in North America does put a great deal of time and money into helping drug addicts and serving the poor you know evangelical churches are very well are very well represented in those spheres as well and and it seems that a good bit of the a good bit of the of the division happened with modernity in the skepticism with respect to let's say the world to come or the age to come and so then this great emphasis on well we must we must we must bring about whatever goods can be had in life and obviously goods understood as creature comforts less anxiety you know fairly secular goods whatever goods can be had must be had within the secular frame and it's it's very interesting you know I'm trying to get a sense of when you say spiritual especially in a highly secularized culture and now let's say with with sort of a Buddhist a Buddhist sensitivity can you flesh that out in contrast to let's say the Church of England as you've described or American evangelical ism that are you know whatever only what's good for the next world is important so because I want to get into some of that from your book because some of the most interesting things that I was I was wrestling with in your book had a lot to do with Jesus and the kingdom and and in a sense how these pieces fit together yeah I mean maybe picking up on one part of what you said there then and then seeing where I can go with it the whole kind of pie in the sky when you die approach I think that has it was probably a quite a good critique at a certain time but it also has has led to a sort of okay so we must do something about this world you know we must that's where we must engage with things but I think the both ends of those poles what they miss is actually what I think Jesus was on about the kingdom which is as I think it has been said you know there is another world and it is here but the question is how can we realign our sense of ourselves and our sense of being alive with the other world that's already here you know again I think that one of the really powerful things that Jesus said that people at the time didn't get in the early church and kind of really wrestled with was you know not the kingdom will come it'll be here it'll be there but no the kingdom of God is within you and so that's what I really mean by the spiritual that you know we have our kind of if you like material reality which we can we can touch and we have our emotional psychological reality which we know very powerfully because it shapes our experience all day every day but as it were within that or behind that or underneath that is another possible experience which is captured in biblical expressions like for me phrases like underneath of the everlasting arms there's a kind of it's a still sense of presence that is if you like life itself and it's when you can live life from that sense of eternity if in terms of you know a sort of so you're not just caught up in the rush of every day but there's a sort of a capacity almost to step back and to see life from a much less rushed place it's possible when you have kind of emotional ups and downs which of course we all do and not to be completely identified with them but to know that there's another side to you which actually isn't really affected by those emotional ups and downs it's right there with them but it can keep you can I mean the practical side of it in a way you can keep your mind about what's going on so you don't get pushed and pulled in every direction it's that sense and I think it's also a sense that our present times can be experienced from within you know what traditionally would be called salvation history if you like but is the sense of of God's unfolding in it that is part of this world but I think that when you experience that then this world increasingly comes to be experienced as almost like the doorway to a much bigger reality and you know I have a growing sense really to be sort of completely personal and this is kind of right at the cutting edge for me but I do have a growing sense that our task in this life is to develop an awareness of these things at all levels and to live as much as we can with the capacity to move between these different levels from the material the emotional psychological spiritual in a kind of a flow and that somehow I feel will set us up well for what happens when we die that we'll be able to as we go into the next life with our eyes more open than we might have done otherwise and I think this is this is in that this is for me this is what's in the stories and these accounts of the resurrection in the gospel you know the trouble that the disciples have with seeing the resurrection Jesus I think is sort of directly correlated to how much their eyes have opened how much there is can hear and in a way that's the challenge for us it's how much of resurrected life do you see now and the more you see now I think the more I don't know quite what happened after we die of course but somehow I feel that that's a big part of what we're called to do in this life is to prepare for our passage into the next but it's not that this life doesn't matter because the way we prepare for the passage into the next is precisely how we live this life you see what I mean it's a both and rather than either or I was part of the let me see if I can when I read it just a few minutes ago I said I got to put a bookmark in this because it was it was when you're talking about Christ's miracles and I've been I've been preaching through the the gospel of Mark right now in a section of a good number of miracles and I've you know I've really I've really come to believe that part of the puzzle of figuring out the the mind the mind matter duality and and a number of a number of these things that are connected with it do have a lot to do with coming to terms with Jesus miracles and I think not in the sense of the modernist fundamentalist feud of the late 19th early 20th century did they happen didn't they happen not that I don't think that you know I'm personally not skeptical at all about the about the the nature of you know that Jesus multiplied loaves and fish that Jesus still disdained it's those I'm not skeptical at all about those things but the but this question that I that we're struggling to articulate about you know and again I think barfield is so helpful in this this initial participation this withdrawal from participation and then the final participation I think some of what CS Lewis understands the miracles to be in his book miracles which has been an important book for me when he talks about the miracles of the old creation and the miracles of the new creation really very much maps on to some of barfield's final participation and and so what we see in the miracles are these are these expressions of final participation in the present age that Jesus manifests before before you know thousands of people in some cases and so again I've been preaching through these in the Gospel of Mark and what what amazes me so often is that we come out of the modernist fundamentalist frame with this idea that oh if I would only see a miracle then then I would believe and then we imagine that somehow resolves everything but when in fact you see the disciples Jesus stills a storm in in in Mark chapter 4 and you know they're shocked and awed who is this man and then he sends him across the lake and they're rowing against and then Jesus walks on the water and you know it's like you still don't get it it doesn't matter and and in fact right in the Gospel of Mark it says you know they they didn't understand the loaves because of you know their hearts were hardened which nobody in the New Testament wants that to be said of them in pharoah terms but this this this way this this way that Jesus manifests this final participation in that the the winds and the waves obey him the you know the the challenge of a of a hungry crowd and not enough money and Jesus tells his disciples you give them something to eat and they're they're well you know what do you mean give them something to eat and you know he said well go find what you got you know five loaves and two fish and bring them to me he looks up to heaven he breaks the bread and you know there are 12 baskets left over and and so I these these perennial challenges that we have to try to to try to not just understand articulate but live within the live within the world as it is and then of course with the resurrection I think CS Lewis is absolutely right and I think the book of Colossians hits this that the resurrection isn't just oh one additional miracle in line of the other but the resurrection is actually the door into what the new what the next dispensation will be you know the the life of the age to come so for me these miracles of Jesus that we have this side distraction over here did they or didn't they happen completely misses the insight that the miracles should afford as to what what happens when all of the layers are put back together so I couldn't find the quote in your book but I I was curious as to as to how that you know what how those miracles play to your view of barfield and your book yeah I mean I remember you made this comment about CS Lewis but miracles and barfills fun position before and and that I think I thought oh yes yes yes I mean more I think what happened to me is that miracles have just become less of an issue you know back in the days when I was doing my physics degree you know they were and and you know you you could read these apologists that try to talk about suspension of the laws of nature or something like that you know and it wasn't very satisfactory but I think once I started getting into mental health particularly you start to realize that well a couple of things really one is that you're waiting on something often in mental health you know this is no secret in psychiatry you know a drug may help it may not but it's not really tremendously successful and you only have to work on a mental health ward for a short while to start hearing psychiatrists say things like well we could try this I sometimes get good results with that you realize that you're just trying to provide a container for something else to happen and then and to sort of discern it and work with it but that started putting me directly in touch with a side of life that the purely physicalist approach doesn't really can't really accommodate at all and then also you know what Jung famously called synchronicities and so on they start to occur so things become meaningful you know people have dreams and coincidences occur whatever it might be and you start to realize that you're engaging with a dimension of life where this isn't it's not that happen all day every day but it's it's also not that as a word reality has somehow been snapped in order that these can be fitted in it's much more that you're engaging with a different level of reality and you start to become more conscious of them when I was another thing that happened was when I was trying to get to grips with Owen Barfield's original participation I read quite a lot about encounters with indigenous people because I had the idea that you know maybe they or they still live in a kind of original participation and it seems to me that they do and it's very common for say Christian missionaries to go to fairly isolated tribes and to witness the tribes seeing spirits you know collectively en masse and you can dismiss it as superstition of course but it seems to me that these people are very savvy about their environments that's how they survive you know they're not stupid they see things quite literally I think which you and I just wouldn't see and so these kind of two things they don't get me to Jesus walking on the water and still in the storm but they got me just a step further to realising that I find it completely understandable that a figure like Jesus would be living with direct contact with levels of reality that enabled these things to kind of happen around him you know exceptional things do happen but people have paranormal experiences and so on all the time they're random they're chaotic they can be disturbing they don't want to make of them and but someone who was living with a full sense of contact with those many layers of reality and I think that those things would not only happen but they'd also be able to make something of them and to be as you were aligned with them yeah so that it's not so much that I've had to reconcile miracles and reality it's as if you like my sense of reality has gradually got bigger yeah well and I very much appreciate what you say because as a pastor too you when you're when you're just dealing with people people being themselves you know I found part of what part of what secularism has done is a mass shaming of people and a silencing of people to speak naturally about the experiences that they have and so as a pastor you very quickly realize that people in polite company will not tell stories that are sometimes their most meaningful because they will be they will be shamed they will lose status because they'll they'll tell a story that that can't easily be explained in a sort of scientistic framework and and and so you know it's it strikes me also that for for most of the history of the new testament the miracles were seen in missionary efforts as validations for the authority of Jesus and the gospels themselves and of course with the with the advent of modernity that situation gets reversed amongst at least people who have been sufficiently impressed by the fruits of modernity and sufficiently inculturated by the habits of modern speech yet that's a fairly limited bubble within human history one that as is true of most bubbles we tend to impress ourselves with so but but again these when when i'm talking to when i'm talking to people about barfield and i'm trying to get my and i'm trying to articulate where barfield is going with this i i think the language in the way it's heard right now let's say of an evolution of consciousness because of the particular communities and the language habits of those communities that phrase gets framed in a certain way which tends to be a bit gnostic-y that that okay so we've got the we've got the the the mind matter duality and what we'd really like to see is is people derive more enjoyment and a sense of satisfaction from life from the mind the story sphere the mind aspect and then the do the the materiality aspect is is therefore diminished and demoted whereas what we find in jesus is this is this radical integration of this radical this radical integration of the world which which i which is what i sense in barfield and and how barfield then is able to address the meaning crisis because i i just had a conversation which i'll i don't know who i'm whose conversation i'm going to post tomorrow yours or or the one i just had with with an individual with whom and he and i are entering into a certain degree of debate where on one hand he he expressed his skepticism as to whether or not christianity offers resources to to challenge to to offer offer resources to address the challenges that we face in our contemporary society but the longer we talk the more i hear a nihilism that basically sees the world as dead and mined as a you know sometimes inconvenient byproduct of this great capacity that we've developed in a darwinian frame for survival and and and and which leads into this full-blown nihilism which i think barfield in some of his essays clearly saw coming and so the initial bar initial participation is not a gnostic retreat from from apples and and freshly baked bread and the glory that the book of isaiah says god has has based you know has shot the world through with and and i think that's part of why i see barfield as so helpful for affording these glimpses of glory and promises that we won't we won't just be observers of glory but participate in the in the production of glory which is in fact what we were made for yeah yeah yeah yes i mean i think that i mean that we've got we've got our sort of modern day prophets and and barfield would particularly point us to the romantic poets but also the metaphysical poets i think figures like william blake thomas trahearne have been very important to me and it seems to me that what they indicate is that the direction of travel is to see more and more and more of material reality as as alive as having living qualities and in some ways i think modern christianity has itself got very gnostic because in a way what it's done is it's kind of stripped out the spiritual ecology which was part and part of parts and parcels of medieval christianity you know it knows that the human matters it knows that god the trinity matters but there's almost nothing in between now in a lot of christianity and so although it probably wouldn't say the cosmos is a is a dead machine turning over like scientific materialism would it sort of defaults to that nonetheless and i think that part of the task now is is to revive our perception our participation in the rich kind of spiritual ecology that you know many christian writers wrote about and and it's precisely in the world you know it's not it you know as as andrew marvel puts it one of the metaphysical person is in his nice poem the garden the curious peach you know is participating in the divine vision too and it's by contemplating the apples and the curious peach as you put it that the divine vision comes to you yeah and yes with this nice extra twist there which you give it there about that there's a meaning i think to with the withdrawal which is that our participation can be our co- becoming co-workers can be enhanced yeah so and that's also what i like about barford is it's not a council of despair in that sense either it's not nihilistic either in that way there's actually a meaning to our sense of disengagement in order that our sense of who we are as individuals can sort of gain from that crisis really in order that that we can reparticipate in a new way a fuller way right right have you read lewis's the discarded image yes yeah yeah and because when i i read that just recently and you know after having read some barfield and talking to you about barfield you know it struck me how much barfield i heard in that book as well and so lewis of course laments the loss at the end of the discarded image he laments the loss of this of this unified worldview medieval worldview based in in the classic worldview that that afforded that just afforded meaning in in in so many helpful ways to to sufferers people who suffered you know the common indignities of of humanity throughout the middle ages and that that image then gets discarded and this you know in conversations that i have sometimes with roman catholic and and especially orthodox christians who in some ways you know very much long for a i think orthodoxy in sort of its renaissance it's seeing in the united states now is is really an attempt at getting back to original participation and and you know the the protestant reformation was this you know grand tragedy that followed the tragedy of the division of the church between greek and latin yet yet yet none of us none of us are retreating back to a hovel in the woods or at least few of us and not bringing cell phones and batteries and um and knowledge of germs and sanitation but but yet so so i i very much agree that barfield's helpful in even in the withdrawal from participation that that that you can see so so the missionaries find the tribe and and for you know for a long time we've recognized that the secular rising influence that the missionaries that the western colonial missionaries had on these peoples and the you know some of what was lost by that secularization and and the deep secularization that the the church now has which gets split into either at least in the united states the mainline church which oh we're we're trying to perfect this world and the evangelical church which sometimes is well we're just all you know trying to get people on the boat into the next world and again i think barfield has the potential for offering a a hope an image of resolution for this and and giving us images and and pointers to how we might read the bible in a way that helps us not lose the benefits of this middle passage of a withdrawal from participation but yet um bring it together in resolution in a sense of final participation and there are so many this week i'm this week i'm preaching on jesus um talking it's such a fascinating passage after these passages of the miracles the the pharisees and the teachers of the law come to jesus and complain that his disciples are not properly washing the ceremonial washing and so they're taking in defilement and jesus makes this move where he says the vile defilement doesn't come from the outside in defilement comes from the inside out and now reading that after knowing some barfield it's like oh my you know this this movement that jesus is making and this this and and i know luther doesn't always get too kind to treatment and some of that is rightfully deserved but some of what happens in the reformation is also this this movement that that luther makes the psychologizing which in some ways accentuates the problem of withdrawal from participation but also you know is is right there sort of in a line if luther is reading jesus talking to the scribes and pharisees it's not a big jump that luther has to make in terms of luther addressing some of the practices of medieval catholicism in in the ways that they sort of practiced a sort of initial participation in the sacramental system that they that they worked with yeah no i mean i think that um that my sense of it you probably know this a lot more about this than me but luther certainly maybe calvin too is that um they re-problematized the individual struggle with the external authorities um and you know and it it's it's a messy business i mean it's not it's it's a it's a it's a real struggle it's not just a you know a bit of dotting eyes and crossing tees it is a kind of crisis and a collapse which is why the reformation i think was was bloody um but um the legacy for us now is um as it were if it's not quite in the bible um it's not quite in the world it's not you know we've got to kind of put these things all together and bring ourselves fully uh into engagement with these things and then um uh as you say when jesus making these apparently and you know slightly odd but apparently you knock his comments about it's not what comes from with that but what comes from within the the files suddenly you realize that in that very moment he is seeing um the switch of consciousness he's seeing the evolution of consciousness um they're they're massively significant moments yeah good luck with that one well there were the the pharisees and the scribes very much saw them as massively significant and it's yeah that's true yeah it's exactly these kinds of things that jesus said which would bring about his death because they they understood that he was dismantling this system that he was dismantling he was demand dismantling their religion which and so you know he's dismantling okay well it's not that you know it's it's not this defilement and it's like well okay so so jesus and on one hand we can give him some cover because they're they're clearly referring to the tradition of the elders which hedges the torah but in jesus making this comment he is engaging the entire mosaic system and the authors of the gospel of mark know this because they put a parenthetical comment that basically says well you see this is why eating anything is okay and it's like whoa you know you have just set up the tremendous conflict that will play out in the very early church between people who are saying we are the true inheritors of moses versus those who are saying hey wait a minute you ought not to eat these kinds of meat and you ought to practice and so you you very much have these two systems set up to conflict each other and jesus comes on top of them and says no i you interpret moses through me now and you can very much understand why a good number of people are going to say oh really and where of course the disciples will need a great deal of evidence to okay they're impressed with jesus and they want to follow him but then he's killed and if that in fact is the end of the story well why have this massive civil war within the jewish you know the the diaspora jewish nation if if jesus was just making stuff up and he was actually killed by the romans and he didn't finally appear to his disciples in such a convincing way that they began to die at either the hands of the romans or at the hands of their their fellow jewish people so i mean there's there's a ton in this that i think barfield with his with these this nice three simple movement i think illuminates and then when you when you see the movements of this participation and you go back to the bible you say oh my this is really lighting up some passages that we we had sort of you know as protestants you'd read that and say oh okay so well this is why reformed christians would eat sausage on friday to annoy their their catholics and so then we set up these facile arguments we and we protestants are on jesus' side and you catholics with your transubstantiation are over there transubstantiation are over there oh no it's it's nowhere near that simple and what we see actually is this continual return to these transactional moments and and i think yeah again i evolution of consciousness yeah but what on earth do we mean by that because this move that jesus makes in this passage this is i think barfield nicely frames and says there is something really important about the trajectory of human history with respect to mind and matter and how these two things are understood and this telos that he gives us that says they need to be integrated and what we see in jesus christ i think in his miracles and resurrection are is revelation in terms of that integration we however are struggling to not you know we we you know jesus did it we're just trying to understand it in some ways and then lean and live into it yeah i mean this when you're talking there makes me it's making me think of an area that was quite discover discovery for me when i was reading the book which is the research that's been done on the intertestamental period because when i did my theology back in the late 1980s i don't really remember thinking much about hellenistic judaism we kind of let from you know very rich old testament scholarship into rich new testament scholarship but very basic things we never asked like how come the new testament sort of synagogues when there's not a single synagogue in the old testament and and then there was also that that that nice naive question about you know why did jesus come in roughly zero ad when the time was fully well how was it fully what we had this 400 years of sort of silence especially if you're a protestant in between yeah so what so what now having read um much more about this intertestamental period and and the work which i think is quite relatively new really trying to flesh that out looking at a lot of apocryphal material just looking at the history um uh this kind of thing is that i think that um hellenistic judaism you know the world was becoming a very troubled place um it's a time of just endless trouble within judaism judaism and the greeks and then judaism the romans um uh but it's also you do get a sense thinking more spiritually about it that the world was becoming a much thinner place and that um the the sense that people had of the the distance between you know this world and the next or the world now and the world to come with particularly apocalyptic expectations um you know i think that there was a sense of of proximity there and maybe that's a bit like the dualisms of now you know where minds and matter feel so you know in one world view that you can occupy feel so far apart um you can sort of segue into another world view which for me has been around mental health where minds matter actually feel much much more intertwined it's much harder to say what's one and what's the other um and it's when you kind of enter that uh that kind of zone um that as a way the kairos moment can start to happen um and a new perception of things can start to form um so i see some analogy somehow between you know the intertestamental period and now um you know it it's not for nothing as i think we said with justin bradley it's not for nothing that consciousness is like the grit in the material shell that won't kind of just won't give up um you know that that's where these worlds start to come close to one another again and and what you thought had been separate maybe isn't quite so separate after all i listened to your lovely conversation um well your commentary on roger penrose's uh conversation with william um william lane william ben craig it isn't it and um i i've interviewed roger penrose a few times myself because i do writing in science and religion and at one time he said to me do you know sometimes when i turn a light on i realize that the room's been filled with eternity and i said what do you mean what do you mean and he says well i filled the room with with photons and they travel at the speed of light which means they don't experience time you know so the room is sort of filled with eternity and and i think that i always remember because for him for me that was like him coming close to you know his three worlds actually that's just like a holding model um but really what what i think he i wonder whether he gets glimpses of is something that transcends that all together actually yeah and that's really the direction of travel it's not to try and record it's not really to decide is the mental bigger than the mathematical is bigger than the material whatever you know and i know it's to hold the tension and then see what uh as it were explodes all together uh and transcends it all together oh interesting what a what a what a great what a great line what a great line well and and and what's so amazing to me you know again i've been you know as the the i i so love my job because they pay me to they pay me to study the bible what a what a what a what a wonderful life i have but you know when you begin to realize you know not only does jesus does jesus manifest this initial participation in the miracles but his whole life then and death is this renegotiating of what it means to be anointed which is mesiah and christ and the gospels are really this this struggle between between world saving between world saving projects of the romans have their their their roman way um obviously the pharisees and the teachers of the law and even the disciples are working their own projects and and jesus you know okay well everybody knows everybody understands the project that almost all of them are working you gather a big army you get them weapons you you mobilize them you try to win battles you take cities you one way or another you by virtue of the sword you conquer the world and and jesus jesus comes at it in a remarkably different way by saying well i will conquer the world by you killing me and of course when we hear that we think no that's getting killed is the definition of losing and and jesus of course loses on the cross which is what everyone sees it gets inverted in the new testament and says no this is actually resolving the grand story of humanity and and then he rises and shows his disciples but doesn't stop by pontius pilate or harry to say you know how do you like me now doesn't do that which one would think well that would but no that's quite clearly moving back into the script of the world and then of course you know a couple you know 300 years later a roman emperor will you know place a cross on his on his standard and conquer in that name which of course has its own twists involved but but again you talk about an evolution of consciousness there are there are real reasons why jesus just completely overturns history by doing something which seems so utterly common and catastrophic being one of the thousands of people that the romans crucified during their reigns and you know i we we don't have a sufficient we don't have a sufficient respect for what how this has all changed the world and so again i think i think barfield's work nicely illuminates some of the mysteries that are going on there that we are insufficiently respectful of yeah i mean and i mean it takes me to what i sort of feel is the real gift of christianity to the world in a way which is making kind of crystal clear if you like first of all in the person of jesus and the notion of incarnation but then i think this is something which can become everyone's experience at least in principle is that as it were my i am um rests in the divine i am in some way um and um that when as it were the physical body is does die does pass away is you know killed um uh that's not the end of uh of of what jesus originally um and that's not the end of us either um and it becomes both um death becomes both the moment at the end of life of course um but i think also um that you know the reason why paul can start talking about uh crucifying every day and taking up his cross every day and so on is that he realizes that um the the small deaths of the of the small i am every day um open up more or more onto the divine i am so he can eventually start saying things like you know the mind of christ is within me it's not no longer either live but christ live within me and so on i mean that's what you you see that quite nicely actually see this evolution of consciousness in paul's letters even um where he i think he gradually it's partly because he's speaking to different audiences and responding to different quests you know they're not systematic but um i think you can sort of track um the growing or sometimes called the mystical paul as he himself too realizes that what had happened climatically um at the end of jesus's life but also i think have been happening through um can can be the same pattern for his own life um and it doesn't just mean he might be martyred um you know given that he actually was um but that uh there's something about the dying every day the inner sacrifice the inner offering um that becomes so absolutely crucial um he realizes that as well and i kind of feel right now that part of the divine wisdom of having the cross at the center of christianity is that um it means that at the end of the day you can't ignore that that is the crucial dynamic um it's it's you know because sometimes one of the one of the christians is just made and maybe this is what you mean by being a bit gnostic-y um is that as if this reading of christianity is just kind of sailing off into heavenly bliss um you know it's like all resurrection and no and no crucifixion but i think it you know christianity really doesn't nail that it's the both and um and uh it's only when that you know that path is fully followed so i try to put in a book you know it's because jesus really is fully human to the point of death that he can fully mirror and be be transparent to the divine um it's like the more human you are the more that happens not the less human you are the less the more that happens i think that that's and i think this then gets picked up um in in different religions actually and i think this is this is a bit of an ongoing project for me um you know i my understanding is that that what we now think of as judaism uh rabbinic judaism particularly um uh responded to the moment in a different way um that the law became what has been called i think uh everyday mysticism so that um the law makes you attend to every moment and as a word feel the divine in every moment um so i think this is a this is a different response to the times um which i quite like seeing how they can complement each other now um because in a way you know if christianity has got the tendency to think about pie in the sky when you die and judaism now will say no no it's kind of like what's the next festival that's what really matters and and how does that shape the seasons and so on and this idea that that's uh the other world that's here um you know that's one way of understanding that i once i once asked a friend of mine who's a very strict jude i said you know why don't you use a lift on the sabbath it seems a bit extreme you know i can press the button but you can't what's the point of that um and uh and he said look you know if it was all rational then it wouldn't these rules wouldn't take me anywhere else they would just keep me in the rational world with everyone else you know and the whole point is that it's constantly edging you towards a different perception of things um and yeah so some sort of in a way i feel that that you know judaism might be reminding us of some of that as christians now yeah well maybe it was true at the time that that you know that man was made for this sabbath was made for man not man for the sabbath but there's something about maybe the sabbath that we need to take on board again now you might say well and i think i think that's right i think the i think the the participation of the mosaic law was intended to to create a a rich contextual a rich contextual environment for god's people where god was you know where where god's created order which you see obviously manifest in genesis one where god's created order is just lights up everything in their world and and we you know we tend to look back on it as this as this burden burden but um talk to anyone who is who's religious about going to the gym well yeah it's a burden but it's also it's also liberation and and so i think that was built into the law which then you know makes jesus pivot then all the more interesting because i i think the pivot and i'm sure sort of showing my third use of the law calvinism here i think jesus pivot then is to is to continue to recalibrate this this balance that it has that's right this the moses spoke of me because the the restrictions were supposed to shine with my order but that order can too quickly become a tyranny and you have to understand that the law was an icon not an idol and and so then jesus i think makes that move there that an idol is the thing which now the manifestation of the law becomes at the top of their hierarchy and the thing that they worship instead of an icon which should have been the thing that they see god through and but that seeing god through then reorients their hierarchy so they understand that you're you ought not to you know segregate your goods so you can impoverish your parents imagining that god is now giving permission to this when you ought to understand that the parents are in fact higher than the goods that you are withholding from them in terms of god's list of priorities so yeah i mean you know when you say that i this is one of my bug beds about the way the parables in christianity are read now is and maybe there's a parallel here you know they have been read as this worldly moral tales um you know so the good samaritan is about being a good samaritan um and uh in a way they they've ceased to function in the way that barfield develops and others too but i certainly got it from him um that no no no these are um uh kind of stories that are supposed to twist and turn inside you in order that a completely different perception a different energy almost of life can be channeled to you you know so the good the significance of the good samaritan isn't that he did the good work um to the to the chap in the ditch although that was you know good that he did it um but that he was free to do it um and you know that was the difference between him and the other two um that and if you can attend to that quality in the parables then i think the divine light can start to shine back through them again and it's why i think a lot you know a lot of the parables just aren't moral at all if you know they're either immoral or amoral um and but if you if you try and attend to them you know barfield's very clear about this that the way to perceive this new life is to to focus on the felt side of it to focus on the energy um you know so that's why he was into poetry um you destroy a poem if you try and sort of nail its meaning um but a poem lives when the feeling of it keeps channeling and speaking to you and i think that parables are very much like that um you know i don't know we had in church the other week um the parable of the unjust steward you know who goes around and and says i'll cut your debts when he thinks he's going to lose his job um and uh you know so what's that about and then he gets praised for it um but there's something about um he's living on the edge living in the moment um and uh when you start to sort of almost admire him the kind of quality of of of of edginess um then i sort of had a felt sense of there's an energy there that maybe speaks of the kingdom um you know he's he's literally on an edge that's part of the value of the story i guess um he's sort of being kind of doing um he feels that his life's at stake you know nothing less than his life's at stake um and then um you know the kind of the slight mania of the parable almost um i think jesus is really trying to say look um there's something even though this story seems completely immoral and there's something about the quality of the narrative there and that if you can just allow that to to to fall on you um then um that can be common energy that you can use as well but that takes you into different appreciation of life something like that anyway that's one of my favorite parables and i don't know do you know who kenneth bailey is no i don't know kenneth bailey is a he's a new testament scholar who for years taught in lebanon and there's a number of books of his treatment of the parables and i i particularly like his treatment of that parable i i've used it sometimes and people hate it i won't go into it right now but i very much agree that the the parables and the miracles i think speak in the same way in that you're very right that the parables are not mere moral stories because you know both luke 15 luke 15 has the parable of the lost coin and the lost sheep and and then the lost son and and anyone who you know not particularly with the coin because coins don't wander off but but any any good shepherd who would read the parable of the lost sheep would stop and say now that's that's completely irresponsible to risk the 99 to go look for the one and any moralist who would look at the behavior of the younger son just as the older brother does he's he he presents the moral voice in the story and and jesus ends the parable leaving us wondering not whether the not whether the disobedient son who as the story ends is wonderfully ensconced in the party which for jesus if you read the gospel of luke the party is the kingdom of heaven and the outer darkness the land far off is is hell you know we leave the parable wondering if the elder brother will make it to the party because the elder brother doesn't want to go and that then goes into the parable of the of the of the crooked steward which is one of my favorite parables because people read that parable and and i watch interpreters twist themselves all kinds of different ways to derive a moral out of it and you just can't and i think that is a part of the purpose of the parable but i think i mean jesus miracles i believe are actually parables in action that is that is the role that they play in that he illuminates the kingdom of god well how is turning you know how many i forgot i've calculated it before you know the amount of water that jesus turns to wine at at the wedding at cana it's an astounding amount of wine and and this is for people who have already had a good amount to drink and you say well why would he do such a thing and well it's it's a parable well is it a moral lesson no goodness it's not a moral lesson it's it's a lesson that is intended and and he keeps it a complete secret the lovely thing of the miracle of cana is apparently only the servants who have listened to jesus know what happened so the slaves understand and the partyers and the masters have no idea and yeah and i mean and and what's so amazing about the gospels is that they're full of these of these ambiguities and these these things that just completely misalign our sense of how things ought to be so yeah i mean and i love the first miracle in john um again barfield helped me understand the detail in that story which always troubled me which is when jesus says to his mother woman what have you got to do with me um you know and and uh people say oh you know that's just the way you address the woman or something like this you know they make all these kind of excuses but then barfield got me thinking about deuteronomy where deuteronomy is really strong that um you need to break those old um relationships to family you know if your brother tells you what to do stone your brother um it says in deuteronomy and i and i think this is a kind of this is another sort of um a kind of like imaginative wrestle that goes on um to to propel you into a different dispensation and so i think when john's when when jesus says to to mary's mother when would i got to do with me um he's sort of saying look this is part of the new just what's about to happen is part of the new dispensation as well and that um to it's sort of alert you as it were that um uh not just being part of the tribe being part of the family part of original participation to use barfield's phrase and that that that that comment would have alerted them to that that something new is about to happen because it echoes the deuteronomic way of thinking about the family um you know that's in jeremiah as well i think the lovely expression about um you know the parents will taste uh bitter herbs but the children's teeth won't be on edge or whatever i can't remember the you know the the analogy there but anyway yeah that again a lot of these details which um as you say some people can try and sort of smooth out or pretend aren't really there when you see it in terms of this um quantum leap um that almost in every if it sometimes feels like almost in every phrase is trying to sort of like nudge you towards yeah i mean it's really helpful yeah well i've i've enjoyed this mark i don't know if you have anything else you'd like to we've gone on for a little over an hour so um yeah no it's great to i mean i'm i'm i'm really pleased that we've talked about um uh you know both that i know my matter problems um the miracles um you know what jesus was really driving at uh you know where we're at now i'm it haunts me that you know you that you you too as a feel that this is about trying to shift consciousness to see another world that's that's already here um because i do feel very very powerfully you know my mission with barfield i feel this is what he's told me and i want to try and carry it on is to um to say i think this is really where it's at with christianity now and i hope it's exciting for people um uh yeah i hope you know there's a tremendous promise there and i feel like it does it chimes a lot with um uh you know the people certainly i come across who are interested in awakening new consciousness enlightenment you know i think that christianity can can really uh address that head on and embrace that movement which i think is in the air certainly as i see it you know is the sort of it the zeitgeist it is where the spirit's at i think it is where god's mission is at now you might say and so to try and align with that um with the richness of of of what christianity has to bring um feels to me to be you know the way to go well i i think you know again i i appreciate you know i appreciate what you're what you're doing to to uh bring barfield back into the conversation and i very much agree that his you know perhaps his time has come in some ways more than in his life but i i you know jesus jesus says that that we will do greater things than than some of what he has done and that's that's a that's always a very interesting that's always an interesting thing to discern um exactly what aspects and frame we might imagine that in but but i see i i see real i i see real hope and and and realization in bar fields in in bar fields pointing us to final participation that can that can motivate us and give us hope and a vision for for for what christ in us can do in our lives and and in in the life of the age to come which i think again in an appalling perspective is is always now and not yet i mean the new testament always places us at the in the end times and you're like well two thousand years seems like kind of a long end time but um but that that we're you know the the present evil age with the resurrection of christ has been diminishing and the life of the age to begin in the resurrection and so we're in this we're in this middle phase and so so we are continuing to wrestle with this withdrawal from participation hopefully fruitfully but also being pointed to a final participation where where the the parables and the miracles of jesus not only illuminate the the common things of our life but begin to transform um but begin to well continue to transform us and and i hope christ's church in both a cruciform and a resurrected way so you know as a as a minister that's my that's my vocation to to live this to point to this to encourage this and to help people to help people believe that you know that might sound pentecostal of me but but my perhaps where i differ from the pentecostals is not that i believe miracles still happen but that miracles always happen in the way that jesus miracles are for how jesus used them as are the parables and and i think again i think barfield is a is a tremendous a tremendous addition to this conversation because he helps us grapple with the challenges of this modern withdraw from participation that at some point will be moved beyond so yeah i completely agree yep so thank you mark and thank you really appreciated it yeah i've enjoyed this and i'm sure we'll talk again so keep keep doing your work and keep doing interviews again i i you're i i had to make a decision whether or not to oppose to post third party content but that conversation you did with michael i'm going to put a link to it because i thought you two covered a ton of really helpful and and really shed some light on your journey and i thought it was just a wonderful conversation i'd love more people to see it so yeah well thank you for all that you do as well because you know i i discovered you when i was googling around barfield and you would already you were already on to him and um so it's a it you know it's a it's a very nice thing for me to feel to be part of something that is bubbling up and in engagement as well so thank you all right well have a good evening you too cheers bye bye
