 Hi, this is Paul. So I monetized the channel. How's it going out there? I've earned $30 and I think I've instilled way more than $30 worth of punishment on I don't know how big of a group of you. So I made the video last week that again just to review why I did this YouTube announced a change in policy. It was going to begin monetizing some is going to begin monetizing some videos from unmonetized channels. Now I never monetized my channel partly because I hate ads, partly because I was just sort of doing what Jordan Peterson had done and so I had never monetized it because I've there's plenty of videos you can click on. How much money do you make on YouTube monetization and and by many accounts not much. Now my sister has a smaller channel than I have. You can find her Ann Clay, A-N-N-E-C-L-A-Y and she does home decor and when I was back in Massachusetts last year helping her set the thing up and her channel got started and and I looked at the demographics of her channel. Her channel was mostly women in there, women who were over 55 and apparently Ruth's my well her real name is Ruth her she goes by Ann Ruth Ann. Her channel has a whole lot of women many of whom aren't even logged into YouTube and I think they're buying stuff from home decor that my sister and my cousin Mel are talking about and so my sister who again is as her husband is about to be laid off my sister isn't employed and so YouTube's gonna be a big piece of their income so she told me she got a thousand dollars last month from monetization. I thought wow that's you know that's that's not nothing and but you know I gosh I hate ads and so well we'll talk about that. A little bit about how YouTube revenue works to the best that I can understand. They will show an ad if you click on the ad there'll be some additional compensation if you buy through it I think there'll be more but most of my experience with ads has usually been just an ad at the front end of the video and after five seconds you can click skip and then you go. I didn't know they put ads in the middle of the videos and one person said there was there was 18 ads in the nuance video and I'm thinking that's that's a catastrophe and you know again part of why I never monetized the channel is I don't want to hassle you all and basically for no reason but the problem is if if YouTube starts monetizing my videos and I haven't monetized my channel then basically you get the annoyance of the videos without then YouTube keeps all the money plus if you're like me I never watch ads on YouTube because I have YouTube premium I've had YouTube premium for years because it used to be Google music and I like the locker feature of Google music and now they're phasing that out they're pushing everything and everything down into YouTube music now so I've I've always had the family plan of YouTube premium so that my kids also didn't have to see ads etc etc and that's why I really didn't know whether ads would even show up in my videos but apparently there are things in my videos that can be monetized like buying gold or you know and then when I did my video well then I started you know so I monetized the channel and then that you go through the whole thing and then it says okay monetize the channel I just clicked yes and so bang it's all there and then when I did my rough draft for Sunday video it was like do I monetize this video or not do I decide if I'm gonna monetize some and not monetize others and what's gonna be my criteria for monetizing some and not monetizing others or I mean I'm I'm this whole channel has been just a playing with things and so here I'm learning a lot of stuff from you so keep the comments coming it's it's helpful input so but this is you know this is the way this is the way this is gonna go we've seen this with the dot-com thing where they they start out basically gathering the audience and so you're giving away free stuff but the longer this thing goes on the more return they want to get on investment so the dot-com strategy is basically give a free ride at first grab an audience and then slow Lee get the money out of them and YouTube has a near virtual monopoly and so they're going to act like a monopoly and and actually as I continue thinking through this and again keep keep the comments rolling on this because I'm very interested in terms of what's what I should be doing with this channel and and if I should broaden out on other platforms etc etc you know part of me you know if YouTube's gonna spam up my content with video with ads well I don't know do we just make it egregious that doesn't sound good for some of you so the variability of YouTube ads is important so then I go I go into a browser that where I'm not logged in so then it's just you know I'm a non logged in viewer just looking at YouTube plane and so then I thought well what kinds of ads I'm gonna see in my video how many ads are they gonna be out there but I didn't spend a lot of time doing it not anywhere near as much time as as you all will be if you're just letting my content run so yeah I talked about this already it's usually not a lot of money if you just dismiss the ad quickly nothing comes of it if you let the ad roll I think there's something I don't know the number and type of ads vary greatly apparently so I again this is all the algorithm based on your profile what you watch whether you fit the advertisers I mean there's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes in terms of whether you'll see ads at all or whether you're just going to get shellacked with ads and then my clickbaity title like you know something hotter than your neighbor's life yeah I know how I know how we work those tend to get me in trouble too because because the the algorithm reads you know and tries to associate these these terms and so I'm gonna keep experimenting with this thing now I'll just summarize some of the comments that I've read and of course you can read them yourself on that stream some of you said all your channels worth it go ahead if you can get a little support for this that's fine number of you like me already use YouTube premium and I hadn't never thought of this before but all of you who do use YouTube premium YouTube just kept all the money and at least if I monetize the channel I don't know exactly the how that works but I guess I some of some of your YouTube premium money would go to me which is which is fine some of you say I already use an ad blocker so you don't see ads and that's and that's fine I've often used ad blockers in certain browsers brave browser and and other browsers have it built-in opera Microsoft edge a bunch of browsers have it built in if you're using Chrome I mean Google is an advertising agency that's their business and so if you use Chrome you're not really gonna they're not really gonna block many ads and you Google's gonna make sure they get all the data they can out of you so I use I only use Chrome usually for what I'm actually using Google products because often Chrome works a little bit better for some of the Google products I've had it with uploading videos that that if I'm uploading it in opera or Firefox or edge that the upload doesn't work as well as if I'm uploading in Chrome so I personally I use four five six seven different browsers and of course there's different there's there's different engines underneath these browsers so Microsoft Edge is using the same chromium as as Google Chrome does and and there's certain browsers that share that Firefox sort of has their own platform and then there's other subsidiary browsers like water Fox and so there's a lot of different browsers around there and so I actually tell people to use different browsers and log into like I use Facebook in one browser I'll do Google in another browser and so I'll I'll differentiate the browsers because Facebook is pulling and Google is pulling in all of this and Microsoft is pulling they're all trying to harvest you in one way or another and of course there's duck duck go and there's lots of ways to deal with with the the tracking threat so some of you are already using ad blockers and apparently that helps filter out some of the YouTube YouTube ads so you know hey if that's what you go I'm not offended at all and some of you said uh there's too many ads already and they're disruptive and offensive and inappropriate so I'm gonna have to check out some of the settings on monetization and figure out how this works and again part of me is almost well let's punish Google for the ads and start using ad blockers and and like I'm about to say you can get my content on other platforms you don't have to get it through YouTube now there's real issues with that that that we'll talk about so here's some of the options for avoiding ads on YouTube well YouTube is big and convenient and if you've got an Android phone or an Apple iPhone they've got the apps for it and all of that and YouTube premium again which is a service I use I'm I'm all googled up and so I watch content on my phone I like it in the car I don't want to see ads YouTube premium just fixes all that are you giving the man money yes you are that's you know if you're if you're using any Google products you're in it and then I'm in it pretty deep so on YouTube use ad blockers use YouTube premium it's just a very convenient platform now the audio only version of my podcast it's currently it's hosted on pod bean and it's you can get it through iTunes and you can get it on Pocket Cast and some of the other some of the other podcast platforms there are no ads on my audio version at least unless somebody's sneaking them in now Joe Rogan moved to Spotify and part of the reason he moved to Spotify is Spotify sort of wants to do to podcasts what YouTube has done to online video we're gonna see how this goes and so some have said well you should get your podcast on Spotify I might the only thing with Spotify I can have pod bean export it to Spotify like they already do to iTunes except that I have a bunch of my older videos where I didn't re recompress them into mp3 and so I would either have to delete some old episodes or go back and and reformat some of those old episodes and I just haven't sat down to to do that to take that time to do it so it could be that when Joe Rogan finally makes the leap to Spotify I'll go through the old collection of of episodes they're mostly the conversations that are not at mp3 there and I'll probably maybe delete those from the archive and go to the other so but the audio only version has no ads and so I I always have to remember that a lot of people even though I've got it in my bottom part in my notes every time here are the links to the audio version a lot of people don't read the notes and so there is an audio version on the audio only version you can get it in iTunes you can get it from pod being you can play it in your other podcast platforms and there are no ads in that which is sort of the reverse of Joe Rogan because I listen to Joe Rogan both on podcast and on YouTube and there's a lot fewer ads in the that the ads are right up front in the podcast version so maybe Rogan just monetizes his YouTube stream but all that's going away of course now there's some alternate networks out there and one alternative network that I've been on for a long time is library and I got onto this because there's a New Zealand developer who came onto my channel early and we talked and and he's got some relationship with us and this is like many of these blockchain blockchain networks that is supposed to have like a cryptocurrency incentivization in it and so all of my videos are up are all of my videos up on are up on library and you can find my videos there and you can play them there and I'm almost positive there's no ads on them I don't know if the performance will be the same I don't know that there are apps for your mobile devices I don't know how easy it is to get it on your smart TVs that's the thing about Google I just bought a new TV because my wife is basically you know she wants to banish the wires and I got lots of wires around the house because I'm always playing with this stuff so I got a new TV and it's a smart TV and you know Android TV is integrated into it and so I can pull up YouTube and if you've got a YouTube premium account so there are no ads on YouTube on my smart TV if you don't have YouTube premium you're probably not going to run an ad blocker you're gonna get shellacked with ads so and I don't know that you can necessarily one library or bit shoot or think spot or any of these alternative networks but I'm already on library Jordan Peterson's on library you'll find a few other familiar faces on library you can find my videos there but again that's mostly if you're watching it from a PC I'll continue to think about some of these other places somebody recommended mines which I didn't know anything about they seem to be sort of a Facebook alternative think spot of course I've never gotten on to think spot I never got on to it because I wanted to first see if I actually used it and I watched the Peugeot Sargon of a cod video first on think spot and then Jonathan posted on YouTube what Jonathan Pazur said about YouTube has been my experience to the majority of the audience is there YouTube's capacity to discover new things is there they've just got a huge advantage over these other platforms now that doesn't mean we shouldn't be playing with these other platforms because it might be that these other platforms are the future and many of these blockchain platforms you don't know what blockchain is you can look that up there they're a lot more resistant to to takedowns so but sometimes some of these other alternative platforms are a little bit sketchy too and I know some especially Christians are a little bit more sensitive to you know pornography violence some of these things that very well might be on these alternative networks so I haven't really jumped full into them I know Jonathan Peugeot when he did his website talked about that he found a developer so that when Jonathan makes a video they get populated to his bit shoot and all of these things but I tend to watch Peugeot on YouTube again because I've YouTube premium and I don't want to mean to make this video into into a commercial for YouTube premium but that's that's how I've managed the the ad problem and it is a problem so again I've got a bunch of questions about this blockchain so I just pulled up library.com and tried to play one of my videos it took a little while now I would imagine with the blockchain technology you're not going to get the kind of instant performance you're going to get from a hosting service like YouTube that has vast vast resources and very fast server farms and and and I mean that's that's part of Google's advantage is they're they're wealthy and they're massive and they're going to perform better but blockchain is less easy to disrupt you know we've somebody made a comment that all of his all of his most interesting channels were already taken down by YouTube that's a that's an issue and then you're not and they're gonna be on these other networks and so and I worry about the signal signal to noise because the same dot-com effect with respect to these channels are probably going to be the same and that sort of leads me to should I you know I could do sort of a free version on YouTube and you have to suffer through the ads and then maybe you know I've never I haven't done a freemium or a paywall thing but I could do just videos hosted on a website where with no ads and I've thought about some of these things so it's it's just one of the things for me too is I don't want to complexify my process of making videos because I'm not fundamentally a content creator at least I don't think of myself that way I'm up I think of myself as a pastor and I want to build community and so I don't want to just be about content creation and if you haven't seen that about my channel oh perfect example I've just been running through slides and been running this thing full I've been running through slides this whole time you know here's the no ads here's the no ads video there's the no ad slide the viability YouTube ads the comments I made all these little pretty pictures I didn't even show them to you maybe the pretty pictures don't matter I don't know my daughter recommended that I post the PowerPoint and or the PDFs of these on on my patreon platform just in case people wanted to get them there's more things and I don't know if I'd put them you have to be a member of patreon or not a member I don't know I'm always playing with these ideas and I'm trying to figure out the best way so yeah this is what I'm thinking about there's the evolution of wine skins and actually I want to make three videos today I was gonna make two I want to talk about Carl Lentz and Jordan Peterson just dropped his video about his new book and I really liked the summary of his new book I really got me excited Jordan didn't look very good but he sounded good and the content sounded solid so I'm I'm terrifically well I'm a lot more optimistic about Jordan's future now so I'm really I'm really excited about this but there's an always an evolution of wine skins you know what is a local church and this this conversation is really important because there's always a ton of change and we never quite know what the change is and even people who are working really hard to resist change the world still changes around you and and we're always interacting with that world and so yeah and I think about you know I was just getting into the church this morning and thinking about you know okay we had another death in the church and with COVID I don't know where this goes I don't want to pastor another church and have a church just say no you know we just want you to be our local pastor we don't want you to work with this online community no I want to develop this online community and see where it goes but I don't want to be divorced from a local church so I'm trying to figure out what my career looks like going forward so far Living Stones is still open and thanks to the generosity of many of you who are contributing to the church you know the church runs pretty cheap for the most part I'm I'm probably a majority we've got the building to heat and we can't really have renters right now because of COVID but you know we're trying to keep the church open but it's a small church and but at the same time I've got a large online thing and this online thing I see is really credible ministry and I see this as sort of a an experimentation space in terms of what ministry and church and everything looks like going forward and so you know when when Eric Weinstein and I went back to when some of his earlier editions of the portal and he's talking about you know this needs to be sort of a financial enterprise and you know a couple of you have leaned on me heavily for that and I kind of dismissed you and some of you got annoyed with me and you know had a little drama about some of that but you know I still listen to you and I'm trying to figure this out that's basically it I'm trying to figure this out so local Protestant pastor is one model and this channel has been a grand experiment and it continues to be and I have to keep it efficient and you know I have to eat and you know Eric Weinstein talking getting closer to getting closer to retirement it's like yeah me too I have a denominational pension which won't be a lot and I have Social Security which hope it keeps in and I'll have Medicare which at some point will take the heavy lifting of my medical things in the future but my wife and I are working on house stuff and you know we have five kids and four of the five still live in Sacramento and you know two are living at home right now two daughters and one son is away at college and another son lives apart and quite frankly what we'd really love to do is live on sort of a compound I don't want my kids dependent on us but I don't want them far away from us and so that means you know I'm probably not gonna take a church in another part of the country my wife has a career here and in Sacramento and so there's just a lot of COVID has sort of taken a whole bunch of things and sort of thrown them up into the air and in real time we're trying to adjust to all these things and so how do these new tools and spaces create shape deform reform you know I started my career as a missionary and then as a local church pastor and what is it that I am now and you know still figuring that out you know the Bible talks about don't muzzle the ox so and I have anxiety I've got issues about money I mean I grew up being poor for Jesus and I don't think that's a bad thing but some of you have pushed back on me and said well you know this is there's some issues to that theological perspective as well not that I'm going prosperity gospel health and wealth guy I don't think I'll ever do that but you know I've I do have to think about what retirement means and I do have to take into consideration some of the sacrifices that my wife has made over the years because of my decisions to always prioritize ministry and not really worry too much about money so you know I don't really I don't really yeah all those things are in me and I'm just being transparent about who I am so there's the evolution of wineskin so keep the comments coming I do read as many of them as I can and and even if I don't heart it doesn't mean I haven't read it and when I first started this channel like which which comments do I do I heart every comment that I read or do I heart just the ones that I like or what kind of message does a like or a heart or a love or any of these kind of things that I don't really know so don't read too much into it but I do I do read them and I try to I try to figure out I'm just trying I'm just trying to figure this whole thing out because it's really big and new and confusing so yeah keep the comments coming I really appreciate them and I'll be watching for the continued evolution of this platform you know and I library all I had to do with library was basically put in some things and whoosh every time I upload a video to YouTube it sends it right over to library and initially there was a glitch because they had a limit of two hours it's like what two hours sometimes we're just getting started so but they fixed that now and so all my videos upload to library so you can find them all there you can find them all there advertising free now if you if you're just deep into Google because they're on your phone and they're on your smart TV and and you know and probably ad blockers aren't gonna work then I'd say pay your either ten dollars for a solo but fifteen dollars a month for five accounts find a bunch of buddies and that's that's three bucks that's three bucks a month for no ads on Google that's not a bad deal so if you can't get away from Google and you're on things other than PCs and you can't add block on your smart TV or your smartphone that's so is it really dumb my real concerns are what happens when sort of this general-purpose PC goes away and then we see that going on in the Apple space so you know find four other people and get together and do a YouTube do a YouTube premium account because you know on one hand we might complain about this or that about Google and YouTube but on the other hand they're they're incurring massive costs for server space and app development and all of that and you know in many ways if I have the money I'd rather pay than have them necessarily being a parasite off my information so so that's the deal and that's basically what I have to say I think I'm just gonna upload this now some of these smaller videos sort of interspersing behind the main ones like I said maybe I'll get two other videos done today and then I'll probably keep with my usual pattern of releasing them in the morning so thanks for listening and again let me know what you think and let me know what your experience is
