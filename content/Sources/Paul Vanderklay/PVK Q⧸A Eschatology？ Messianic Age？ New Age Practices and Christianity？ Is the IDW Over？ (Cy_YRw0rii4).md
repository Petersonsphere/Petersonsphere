 So we've been talking about, I've been doing this question and answer once a week at this time and people have been asking me for a question and answer similar to what Jonathan Peugeot and Jordan Peterson did and John Vervecky is doing, but I didn't really like that format and then when the Discord server came along, I liked the possibility of this better because just getting a written question and responding to it doesn't allow for much back and forth, but we haven't necessarily had a lot of back and forth with this method either, so for me it's trying to well we're trying to do multiple things at once, I want there to be more of a dialogue rather than just a monologue, I can do monologues on YouTube but we're facing the, once you're past 8 or 10 people it gets that much harder, and so even with 30 people having a productive conversation isn't easy, so we're going to be playing around with different ideas and routines and Topher, why don't you introduce the idea that you had and what you're thinking about and then we can talk about some of Cassidy's ideas of implementing it Sure, so I got the sense from kind of post a few of your Q&As that you were kind of reaching out for feedback, and so I sensed that maybe there was a bit of self-consciousness on your part, that maybe, you know, like you were kind of saying that you had a sense that maybe it was too monologue and not enough of dialogue and that kind of harkening back to the early days of your channel you know, there's kind of two modes that you would go into, one was conversational and one was the monologue, and I mean your monologues were great I always really enjoyed the way you were able to kind of knit together different conversations and turn it into kind of a coherent thought process but there was the other side of it, which was your interviews with various your hour-long interviews with various people like Tim or Nick or Luke, etc. and I thought that that was one of the things that, to the extent that you've managed to get on your own status rock that was part of the jet fuel, was your ability to kind of lead and have compelling and interesting conversations with normal folks, and so if you were kind of grasping for a format that would be kind of maybe a bit of a return back to that style, that this could work and so this is something like each week or however many weeks we come up with a topic or so maybe we all kind of throw topics and then they get sorted through some sort of mechanism potentially getting upvoted or something like that, maybe the more conversation around them or the more reaction to them, we can kind of get a sense for what the community is energized about and then once you have a topic, and a key to that I think Paul is that you would need to be interested in it that your presence in at least some of these or most of these is going to mean that ideally it's something that you have some particular interest in so that it's not just kind of you going along with what we're interested in and then not really kind of having something to add to the topic yourself and so you and we come together, pick a topic, and then before each conversation we ask for volunteers who say who this week would like to talk about this and people raise their hand and then we come up with some way of randomizing maybe we use a virtual dice or a list randomizer or something like that and we pick three people and then we have a little round table where you and three people can have a long form discussion on the topic and kind of go back and forth and I believe currently the thing after that would be people suggested that maybe we open it up after that so to the extent that we have a larger group listening to that small conversation then after some amount of time we pause that and kind of turn to the audience and say you know what about that did you like, what about that do you want us to kind of zoom in on closer and then I think that's it. The last thing that maybe we should add to that is that maybe there's some sort of mechanism where if you were in last week's talk there's like a cool down that maybe there's some sort of mechanism that encourages the next week to be a new crew of participants so that it's not just the same voices every week, that's something that we can iron out but how's that for kind of a vague overview? No that's good, it's helpful for me to understand some more of your thinking and I very much track with that because you know right away I mean I've just been bumbling into this whole thing and when I was having conversations with people who were first contacting me because I was first putting up videos I thought well why don't I share some of these conversations and that sets up a whole series of dynamics but part of the value that I have is I want randos to have voices and obviously the reason, you know there are hierarchies, these things exist and so very quickly once you get past a dozen people, really past two people hierarchies in various areas begin to manifest themselves and so part of, you know I'm not saying it's a bad thing but at the same time what that means is that part of what many people experienced with the Jordan Peterson phenomenon was oh wow this guy is really helping me, I'd love to ask him a question but there's a bottleneck when he has a million YouTube subscribers I don't have anywhere near that many but still we get these bottlenecks and part of the bottleneck is me and my attention and my time and my ability to you know that Dunbar number where I can what maintain something like 120 relationships at a time and so I have an issue with the way that these hierarchies lay out because and I think actually Christianity addresses this because the Holy Spirit when Jesus leaves he says it's good that I go and the Holy Spirit is going to come in a sense that way everyone gets to be Jesus friend and everyone gets to have a relationship with Jesus whereas sort of in this time in this meat space area Jesus is limited to one place at a time I'm not saying I'm Jesus but that's a limitation that we all face so to the degree that we can create some structures where we have some more openness I'm really in favor of that because part of the reason and I know because of the Vervecki paper I was writing and then this week has been post-Vervecki paper catching up with things I've had a lot of church work and I'm continuing to get requests for private conversations and I'm trying to balance all of these things and I don't want to say no completely to private conversations I don't want to say no completely to rando conversations so I'm trying to smooth this out so my hope for this technology is that now maybe with this randomized rando format we can get more voices into the mix because that helps me because once because there are many of you out there and all of your minds are working and the goal of what Vervecki calls distributed cognition is that together we can think better than I can think with a dozen friends or 120 friends so that's the hope of this thing so that's so I don't know if we'll be able to pull it off by next week Cassidy isn't able to be here this morning but she's sort of organizing it and she's going to release a paper that has some of the structure and so it's an attempt to try to implement Topher's idea and we'll try it now a number of people have contacted me and said I really like the open question and answer because we do you know we take a question that's been submitted on the text chat in the discord and then we take another question from somebody who's just listening right there right then I think that's a good format because again it sort of randomizes it and so again my thinking is that through a variety of formats we can hopefully be learning some things and also learning together so that's the reason behind all of this any any questions about this from anybody in the room now I muted Indy Defense because Indy Defense Mike wasn't muted and I was getting a little bit of visual feedback so I'll unmute you so you might want to mute yourself if Indy Defense is listening or if he's playing a game and oh there he goes okay good any any questions about Topher's idea and Cassidy attempting to implement it okay well let's see who was someone was I thought someone was planning on MCing this morning I don't know who that was I don't see who I thought was going to do it this morning he's not in the room do we have a volunteer for someone who would like to queue up the questions and MC for this morning come on people don't be shy I'd be happy to but unfortunately I'm at work right now so I kind of can't commit okay no I understand and part of part of what's interesting to me about this whole format is some of you can listen at work okay Andrew Andrew says he'll do it good so Andrew's gonna have just give me a second yep and again the reason I like having an MC is that I'm trying to record here and take notes and you've seen I'm trying to render something hopefully usable that I post on my YouTube channel so it's just helpful if someone else is sort of managing the questions and queuing the questions so okay so do you want me to like insert questions when one seems to be answered or yeah you can use my role so you can start with the questions for PVK thing there are some that are backed up on that a little bit and then intersperse those with opportunities for follow-up from the room or if the person asking the question is in the room you know maybe I didn't hit their question exactly and so they could redirect so that's that's kind of the role okay so I just got to make sure everyone's questions get answered yeah well you know we've done this quite a bit so we don't have a big backlog of questions which okay great so I'm guessing the last time was like July 3rd so I should start from there yeah yeah that would be that would make sense yeah let's see what's the first question well somebody says Trinity they couldn't resist let's see Jacob seems to say oh that's right he was asking for something else like a sermon or a prayer prayer here we go go ahead all right so random asked a few days ago he said he would love to know if eschatology is something that you ever think about as a believer or theologically I think I think we're I think about it a lot and I think we're always thinking about it this whole end of history meme that I touched on in today's video about the mooks and the knights game B you know it's it's interesting to me where eschatology comes into play the Good Place TV show is very much eschatology the woke religion stuff with a vision of pervasive equity is eschatology that's a really interesting one because Jesus images of the life of the age to come don't look like equity they look like they look like merit in for this so this week I'm working on my sermon do not lay up do not heap up treasures on earth but heap up treasures in heaven and so Jesus doesn't sound terribly equitable when it comes to the life of the age to come and he connects it to what we do in this world and Brett Weinstein and his game B what he tries to what he and his channel have tried to do and Eric his brother to to a degree is say well here's you know we have humanity must be preserved I mean CS Lewis picked that up in the mid 20th century so eschatology is last things or a final state or or a telos now I know that that verveky and company are trying to sort of back away from telos and I understand why that is in terms of the history of it but eschatology is almost always a part of what we play right now when it comes to Christian theology up unlike the doctrine of the Trinity Sam notwithstanding eschatology remains sort of an unfinished theological framework whereas at least there was broad consensus with respect to Christology and Trinity there is not broad consensus with respect to eschatology the historical position seems to be a mill as it's called where the millennium that Jesus talks about or the millennium that the book of Revelation talks about seems to be mythological or symbolic the post mills at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century imagined that we're just improving our way towards the life of the age to come that position is quite sympathetic to some materialist frameworks and I think the new woke religion is very post mill the pre mill dispensationalists are believe in a and again this is part and parcel of dispensationalism and the modernist fundamentalist feud that there's a literal 1000 year rain coming interrupted by you know various depending on how they lay out their pre mill dispensational terms so that's quite popular in books like Left Behind and other resources but in many ways the dispensationalist perspective arises out of the fundamentalist modernist debates which rises out of you know all of the stuff that we're noting in the meaning crisis the enlightenment the rise of materialism and all of that so in many ways the ah mill position which generally speaking is held by to the best of my knowledge orthodox I don't know them as well Roman Catholics Lutherans Magisterial Reformed we all all of these groups tend to look at the millennium in the book of Revelation as a symbolic existence rather than a literalistic one so post mills post millennials will say in a sense we're already in the millennium and bit by bit we are improving and so your participation in woke religion brings us that much closer to the utopia of equity that we are hoping to achieve so I think its roots are also in the modernist fundamentalist split they're just on the modernist side so there's a little there's a little shakedown of eschatology and what eschatology is how it impacts even thinkers who are not self consciously theological like the Weinstein brothers and so yeah I don't know if random is in the room if he wants to follow up on that he isn't so if anybody wants to follow up on that or I don't know if that question was the difficulty with the difficulty with me talking for five or ten minutes to try to answer a question is I don't know if I am scratching where anyone is itching and it's and we get that kind of feedback when we have face to face conversations because you can tell you're losing eye contact they're not engaged they're checking their watch they're they're you know squirming in their chair so you know as best I can I'm trying to figure out how to recapture some of this and I do get some of that feedback when I'm actually on a zoom call with someone so I have a follow up that kind of goes with what you were talking about with the revelation part and the end of the the Rapture if you will now there's an argument when is just going to come before in the middle after whatever but what's the kind of glorification of the mark of the beast and then having to live as a martyr like you know you mentioned the Left Behind series I my mom watched old Christian movies from the 70s or 80s where people Christians were living out in the woods and they had to sneak into the town to get food and it was as if it was a glorification of that if you if that makes sense to you yeah it and it's just kind of like how it how does how do you think it plays in our in our mind because one thing I've learned speaking that's not speaking but listen to your things is the Bible is a lot more than we think it is so there's there's a when Jesus elevated the weak he set up the the glorification of martyrs now that isn't exclusively a Christian thing anyone who dies for their cause the other people who are part of the community of that cause will likely celebrate the ultimate sacrifice paid for the cause we do that nationalism does that with people who die in war I am almost any group that has a cause if someone suffers for that cause especially post Jesus they will be elevated and you know if again if you if you follow Jonathan Peugeot his observations about what Jesus does with the hierarchy is exactly are exactly right Jesus runs all up and down the hierarchy and once you have eyes to see the dynamics between hierarchy and equality you will see that Jesus is dealing with this all the time now the martyrdom the martyrdom the martyrdom the martyrdom glorification is as tricky as the meaning as the meaning gyroscope you know I've often said that meaning is Jordan Peterson sacrament and and meaning the feeling of meaning is for Jordan Peterson sort of an internal gyroscope for what you should follow do what is meaningful and not what is expedient once you have set up in your mind a matrix of the good and the bad and especially in a world that has been deeply impacted by Christianity the situation is just right for martyrdom glorification and that's not a bad thing it's completely throughout the book of Revelation you have the spirits under the altar crying out for God to avenge their unjust deaths so it's a natural byproduct of any group that has a cause and suffering that goes along with it now when it comes to Jesus I don't think I don't think what Jesus says such as they will hate you like they hated me is can be is is an exhaustion of that martyrdom dynamic I think in fact there is more to it with Jesus because Jesus is always calling us beyond our position in the hierarchy and that's beyond our position into perhaps what you know Eric Weinstein calls a super position so I was listening to Karen and Michael on the meeting code they had another conversation they had another conversation last week and they those two have some of Karen's really doing amazing things with her channel I really she had a conversation with Chloe Valderie she had a conversation with Chris Arnade recently so so Karen is really doing some awesome things with that but she has these conversations with Michael that are very much on point with with Barfield and Vervecky and Peterson and so the dialogues those two are doing on these issues are just tremendous and Karen had pointed out that the disciples get frustrated with Jesus and everyone around Jesus gets frustrated with him because they everyone wants to know Jesus do you say you are the Messiah and Jesus seems to keep being coy with that well why would Jesus be coy with that well Jesus would be coy with that because the minute he claims that word Jesus no longer gets to redefine what Messiah means which is why Jesus keeps using this term son of man so instead of using the term that everyone else is using around them Jesus resists that it's not unlike what Jordan Peterson kept doing with do you believe in God and Jordan kept saying I don't necessarily agree with what you think believe means and I don't necessarily agree with what you think God means so I'm not going to answer that question that's a really crafty rhetorical trick and Jesus used that all the time well why why did he keep wanting to frustrate his disciples and and and and and disturb them and disrupt them because Jesus understood that if you want to if you want to teach someone something that they don't necessarily have a good category for you have to disrupt their categories and so that's what Jesus did and Jesus does that Jesus does that with Jesus does that with martyrdom and so when Jesus says they will hate you like they hate me part of what Jesus is pulling his disciples into is is the belief that if you follow Jesus you are going to resist them I'm working off the article that I did the video on this morning you are going to resist this whole dynamic of nights and mooks you Jesus does not want mooks and what are mooks mooks are followers mooks are blindless little pawns that go into Twitter battle over over conflicts that by design will never be resolved Jesus continually annoys and offends the the players in his culture war why because he will not be reduced to either a Roman collaborator or a sympathizer or a nationalist and and everybody wants to so when Nicodemus comes to Jesus at night he is looking for a way to to to to Nicodemus' cause and Jesus Jesus basically says to Nicodemus you cannot recruit me to your cause you cannot wield me I wield you now as C.S. Lewis points out anybody who talks this way each of us should pause and say I don't know about you know I don't know about you know I don't know about this man but if Jesus is who he says he is well then suddenly we should be his doulos his slave his servant because he's the only safe master and he will continue if we grow in him we will continue to frustrate the boxes the boxes that we have to live with and deal with and to one degree or another we have to remain in I my intent is to remain for the rest of my life in the little Christian Reformed box who knows if that will happen I don't know but that's my that's my intent but none of these boxes no box can contain the son of man and so when Jesus says they will hate you like they hated me part of what he is saying is the better follower you are the more difficult you're going to be boxed now now that then becomes a box in itself and so then people play the nice little coy game of you can't define me it's like well no not really there's only one that can't be finally defined but you will if you are a knight you will if you are a knight and if you were a follower of Jesus you cannot blindly follow your mook crowd and go where they go because the one that you are supposed to follow is the son of man and so you will you will make people upset by what you do and it doesn't mean just because people get upset at you it doesn't mean you're right that's another dynamic here they may be upset with you because you're a jerk or because you actually have it wrong or what have you but you are to follow Jesus and so yeah the martyrdom complex is completely human completely real and unsurprising in the context of Jesus okay Andrew I don't know if we have a next question unless I've been dropped out it's just you touched on a lot of things there of what I was thinking of but a lot of times I think of Jordan Peterson when he's like everybody thinks they're going to be the special one that stands out and is going to how did you word it like we're going to be the one that when we see somebody being beat up we're going to be the one to stop it here when in the concentration camp the concentration camps will be the one to stand up and stop it but he's like you're you think you are but you're not that hero yeah and every time people are like yeah I'm gonna defy all this I'm like you're that's a big load you're bearing like I don't think that's gonna happen and people don't like hearing that no no and you don't have to say it all the time either though I mean yeah we're all Mary Sue's to one degree or another none of us are smart enough none of us have are well read enough and I'll tell you the bigger and bigger stage you're on if you're if you're watching yourself at all it's it's painful and embarrassing to realize you know I'm not that smart I'm not that well read my ideas are not that insightful you know it's it's not that well read so don't believe your own propaganda and it's really hard not to so that's no that's that's really a good point okay well we seem to have lost Andrew so I'll go ahead Dennis had a question oh is that a question all all for switching up the format but my thing with something like a panel discussion is most likely it will be the same group of randos who have already established themselves as PBK's channel and that's exactly the problem with the hierarchy so hopefully we'll be able to address that Gomer day yes I share the same concern and I hope Pastor Paul or Revs in charge can sort that out okay Andrew continue to look for questions Paul there's one from Mira below that's a question okay okay I see it now yep let me get the time here okay 33 okay Mira asks any thoughts on the value of rest in Christianity taking a break kicking back with a nice beer it's easy it's easily viewed as a waste of time but it seems to be an essential activity good question part of the difficulty we're having right now is that as with many of the ideas we're thinking about our we've we've got about 50 to 70 percent of the meaning and and part of that is is the fact that as as as Barfield notes words words slash and move over time and as they get translated by language so on and so forth so this concept of rest is is vitally important in the book of Genesis and I I like I like some of John Walton's books now again just any anytime you wade into biblical interpretation there are a thousand ideas and voices around there okay so all all interpretations are interpretations but Jonathan or John John Walton has written I think some nicely accessible books that are broadly evangelical on a lot of the stuff going on in the book of Genesis and part so what happens in Genesis one in the beginning of chapter two is that God rests from his labors as I believe the King James Version says what does that mean when we hear that we tend to think at the end of a long hard work day we collapse in an easy chair with a nice beer maybe kick you know put put a footstool under our feet and you know maybe listen to some music or watch some Netflix or listen to a YouTube video that's not what the Hebrew is talking about the Hebrew is talking about in a sense the setup is completed and the joyful inauguration of the meaningful and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the glorious and the they didn't go to church on the Sabbath in the Hebrews didn't do that the Sabbath day was a day that they didn't go and collect manna that they didn't go out and work the field that they didn't they didn't do all of these things that they normally had to do to keep body and soul together as the saying goes so. So on one hand that idea of rest isn't simply the opposite of exhaustion. Or the remedy for exhaustion but on the other hand it is a ceasing of human activity that is designed to result in. A food on the table or a car in the garage. Now. This is it so so right there so so clearly the English word rest isn't fully capable of. Of really fulfilling this image and this picture and so. I think about but but those pictures are helpful things to to recognize now when you get to Jesus in the Gospels this question of Sabbath rest becomes a big thing because as I said before Jesus keeps poking the bear. Jesus goes into a synagogue now he was quite likely there the day before he'll quite likely be there the day after he goes into the synagogue. And he heals someone on the Sabbath now one might ask well why are you going to synagogue on the Sabbath anyway and you can already tell that in the process of the destruction of the first temple the the exile and the The Jews that this whole new format that was already beginning to replace the sacrificial system which was the devotion to Torah. Had already been developing and that had been developing in the synagogues all around the world where Jews had gone and. Now there's Jacob might be able to chime in on some of this stuff you know there's there's a lot of interesting discussion as to whether or not when the Jews went out. You know do you start a temple if you're living in Ephesus no you don't start a temple well why well read the book of judges read the book of Samuel that. It's over the process of the life of of the of the development of of the Hebrew of Hebrew worship. It became a very high value to centralize the the sacrificial system in Jerusalem and that we're no longer going to have high places and people aren't going to be freelancing their little altars around there and so then when the when the temple is destroyed. And then when the temple is destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then destroyed and then And Jesus walks into that system. And he starts poking at it. And because he's right there in the synagogue and a man comes in with a withered hand and Jesus heals him right there and the And Jesus is saying no, this is fulfillment of rest because the rest that God enacted in the seventh day in Genesis is the restoration of the world. Okay, so that's critical. So rest is not only a rest, it's the rest of the world that we're going to be ceasing from the from the. The Genesis three. Sweat filled laboring that the curse of the ground puts us into and you can see that in no And it's not only the fulfillment of the And it's not only the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the fulfillment of the Church. The Sunday becomes the day of cultic observance where they begin to borrow and and appropriate some of the synagogue practice but now this comes into Christian practice. And so the Sunday worship becomes a celebration of the And so that then becomes the celebration of the restoration of Jesus which is the celebratory aspect of Christian liturgy and Christian worship. So your question any thoughts on that? So your question any thoughts on the value of rest okay rest in Christianity well is there rest for oh I've been working all day I'm exhausted it's time to put my feet up enjoy a beer when you are enjoying that beer you are in a sense having a tiny little participation in Jesus healing of that withered hand. You are having a tiny little participation in the the not collecting manna on the Sabbath you are having a tiny little participation in the banquet of the lamb so yes but now as with an almost with almost all good things that participation can become a problem and part of why in. In Isaiah in the parable of the vineyard in the book of Isaiah that's just such a perfect parable because wine is like that that an amazing symbolic picture of this whole dynamic of glory whereas grapes to wine is glorious and the physiological effects that wine. Gives us our glorious a lightning of the mood a gladdening of the heart a in in this world a bit of a foretaste of the the fully restored life that comes in the age to come but wine can also be a prisoner and a jailer and a. And so all of these come together so that that beer is that rest that you enjoy with the beer is in that moment a small S sacramental participation in the life to come. And so it has its place and part of that so in my tradition in the Christian Reformed Church it was a fairly strong sabbatarian tradition unfortunately in some ways that was deconstructed in the eighties and nineties. And I don't think we exactly knew what we were doing with it but part of what I think the Jewish community continues to participate in and realizes is just how hard it is to. Embrace not only the enjoyment of the beer but the discipline of having a day a week where in a sense we turn that day over to our Lord not legalistically if your cow falls in a pit bring it out. But symbolically and ritualistically and with some teeth so that hey right now especially now that you have the Internet in your pocket and that pocket device makes you available available to your bosses or your clients who are your bosses on the other end and on and on and on and on. And so. Have a day of week where you are not driven by the taskmaster of the flesh that says if you don't answer this call if you don't respond to this email if you don't respond to your clients you're going to lose some money. And the point of pausing from. The point of pausing from. From picking up manna on the Sabbath is trust the Lord that he gave you enough on Friday and the point of ceasing from your labors by going to church turning off the cell phone. And so I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make. I think that's a good point to make making Because Jesus seems to have been involved in very active Second Temple debates between Jewish sects. The Pharisees were quite insistent on allowing healing on the Sabbath, whereas other sects were not, nor against it. And the cells participating in the Sabbath on Saturday was also a topic of huge debate. So these were huge topics of debate at the time. Yep, it's true. With almost everything that Jesus is, divorce, marriage, these were all big Second Temple debates. Yes, great point. Thank you, Jacob. I suppose we can move on to the next question. This one is from Kaleppa Heidiger, and his question is a long one, but I'll read it. So he says, Here's a question slash topic I never really got answered a while back and was reminded of by Jacob talking about the Messianic Age obviously not being here yet. Going deeper than the already not yet answer, that is somewhat fudgy in my opinion, did Did Jesus kick off the redemption, also known as creation 2.0, invasion, or is it still in waiting until his return? And then he continues, I guess my question more specifically is, with the two circles example often used and living amidst that middle overlap, as we get closer to the fullness of the new creation side, are things getting progressively better and clearer and redeemed, or is it instead as soon as that overlap threshold is crossed is when the wheat heads sprout? Are we through divine providence figuring it out as much as it can be amidst the overlap? Does Christ return when things are at its worst? And then he says in parentheses, I know it's the end times because the world's going to hell, or when the body is finally united or just randomly? Was the reformation the final needed progression for those that believe the reformation was indeed progress? Lol. Can we get closer to the fullness while we're in the overlap? Is the collective iron in its in sharpening itself actually getting any sharper? Is the kingdom being established more and more on earth like a growing tree? If so, does that have an effect, an observable one, wouldn't it? Or are we instead in a stagnation or I guess a plateau? I know that's a lot of questions, but it's the underlying context of the original question which presumably he asked another time. Okay. Well, someone asked about eschatology. This whole thing is about eschatology. I think Jesus, I, when I look at what the early church did, I believe, they believed that Jesus inaugurated the eschatology, the, inaugurated the messianic age with his resurrection. Now the, the assumption, you know, when you look at Jesus talking to Martha about Lazarus, Gospel of John seems to have a belief in a general resurrection, something like you would find in the book of Daniel. And so everyone, people are expecting a resurrection. And again, in the book of Daniel, let's say if you look at that in the context of, of the Maccabees, the, the idea is that how can, how can God, how can God redeem Israel when people's lives have already been taken? In some ways it's not a terribly different question from the question that is being worked on in the woke debates right now. How can the injustices done to people hauled over from Africa and enslaved in cotton picking and tobacco growing? How can the injustices done to the population already in North America when Christopher Columbus and others arrived? How can those injustices finally be addressed? Now if you're a materialist and you don't have an age to come, well, and Miroslav Volf, I think, points this out nicely in his book Exclusion and Embrace, the quote that I often read from it, you can find it on my blog. Well, well, well, well, reparations. Well, but very quickly you, you, you are forced to realize that history is a blender and those African Americans are descendants of slave and slave owner and those Native Americans are, you know, huge percentage of lineage among Europeans and Africans. And how about the Asians that came over? And I mean, human history is a blender. And so how can, how can, how can justice unblend history and how can God finally do what's right? Well, the, you know, so you have this initial, my reading at least, you have this initial vision in, an initial nationalist vision in the Old Testament where, you know, Israel will be predominant among the nations. Oh, okay. So that's one vision of supremacy, of an, of an imperial supremacy. Okay. But then when, you know, David and Solomon are long gone and the temple is destroyed by the Babylonians and the second temple is not what Solomon's temple was and the Persians are here and the Greeks are here and the Romans are here and on and on and on and on all the way to the present time where the, you know, Dome of the Rock is on the Temple Mount. The, the people of God seem to be in perpetual exile. Okay. Now obviously in the Gospels with Jesus and then with Paul and the rest of the New Testament, universalizing of the story where it's not just a story about one ethnic group versus all other ethnic groups, which was quite frankly the standard paradigm for the world. It's a universalizing story of human beings and human rights. Okay. So that, you know, the Christian movement really kicks off and Tom Holland's point is that's been dramatically successful. You're hard pressed to find people in the world that are, are not thinking in these terms. Well, maybe some of the Han Chinese are, you can find some others, you know, white nationalists, black nationalists. You could find people still playing resisting universal humanism, but for the most part that's conquered the world. Is that an example of the beginning of the Messianic age? I would think so. Hope in a general resurrection, that we obviously still have to wait for. I guess my answer to the question lies in the fact that there are multiple hierarchies and that realization is probably not completely linear and that there are probably innumerable hierarchies in which fulfillment must come. Now the idea of the consummation of the age when everything is finally realized is that all of the realization is across all of the hierarchies and there it is finished, it's completed and there's a new age that begins. So now and not yet, yeah, that's, that's fudgy. Messianic age, well what do we mean by Messianic? Jesus, the teaching of the New Testament and the belief of the early church was that in Christ's resurrection the new age had begun. In the gift of the Spirit the new age had begun. And so the Apostle Paul keeps admonishing Christians, take off the clothing of the old age and put on the clothing of the new age. What is the clothing of the new age? It is life in the Spirit. What does that mean? And then Paul keeps trying to talk about it. Is it linear? Well here's the problem of human consciousness. What is the it you're talking about? Jesus' vision of the universalizing the promise of Israel to the whole world? Well that seems to have made terrific progress. I think there are probably other aspects where, you know, anybody who's at least got remnants of some conservatism in their soul is likely saying that at this point in time in the past a certain aspect of Jesus' teaching was more fully realized or is at least being threatened today. But again there are innumerable hierarchies at which this Jesus is changing so trying to track this in a singular hierarchy will I think be impossible. And so when we look to categorize this I think we will always fail. So yeah that's my best answer. So the idea that it has been inaugurated, it is coming, yes. The idea that this is in many ways progressive, yes. Does that mean that, well here's another funny dynamic. It gets back to the martyrdom question. The closer you get to Jesus within the age of decay in all likelihood the more local and I mean local it might be in your family, it might be in your town, it might be in your country, it might be within a certain political climate, the more local opposition you are going to face. Now the really amazing thing about Jesus is that that kind of conflict is usually managed adversarially and Jesus inverts that too because the height of the conflict is seen as the height of the conflict is seen as the death of Jesus. And so symbolically again and this is why Jonathan Pichot's symbolism is so genius, this works symbolically but it's very difficult to track it linguistically. So right there at the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus you have everything you need to see. Then we say okay I want to track this, are progressives right? Yeah, in some ways in terms of humanism we've seen tremendous progress. How about other aspects? Well maybe we've seen tremendous corruption, maybe at one point in time a particular church in a particular locale really manifest this one aspect very well. Tim Keller once made an observation about revivals. Revivals are not necessarily something involving a tent and a sawdust and some really campy music. Revivals are when the Christian church goes through a population like wildfire. It can be a small population like in a city, it can be a large population as happened in Korea. And Tim Keller noted that if you look at the different streams that Richard Foster writes about in the church where you have all these different aspects of following Jesus, Tim Keller noted that when revival happens, people are more generous to their enemies, they're more faithful in devotion, they're more correct in their piety. All of these things sort of go up at once and then when revival sort of wanes we get back settling down into our, if I had a picture of an east equalizer, not all the knobs are up at the top. And so we're playing more of these games of balance and compensation. So that's my best answer to the progressive question. All right. All right, let's move on to the next one then. So this next question is from Christian T. Golden, also fairly long, so here it is. Question for this week's Q&A. To what extent does faith in the concrete details of the gospel, accounts of Jesus' life, death and resurrection play a critical role in one's salvation? In other words, as an angsty teen might argue, what if an indigenous person had a revelatory experience through which he gained some insight and faith in some true aspect of God and lived his life accordingly? He was never exposed to the gospel or if he was exposed, the contents of the gospel had no relevance to his lived experience up to that point. I belong to a non-denominational evangelical style church and I suspect most, if not all of my elders would agree that such an issue is left to the grace or mercy or judgment of God. That's what I'm inclined to believe as well, as intellectually unsatisfying as that is. I was just wondering what insights or thoughts you might have on this classic quote unquote problem in Christian faith. Forgive me if you've already addressed this countless times, as I'm inclined to believe you have. As someone who lands very close to the libertarian free will end of things, I'm bracing myself for a sort of Calvinist chosen slash predestination oriented response. Yeah, you should brace yourself. It's a good question that I get often, but each time I'm asked it, I get another chance to maybe do a little better at the answer. Salvation is of the Lord. You can find that in the book of Jonah. What do we mean by this word salvation? Well, usually in a context like this, we mean inclusion, blessed inclusion in the life of the age to come. Part of the reason we mean that is, see now I've just triggered the universalist debate. Part of the reason I keep talking this way is because I look at Jesus. Well, maybe I'm reading Jesus wrong, but Jesus has more parables about closed doors and outer darkness and all of this stuff. Jesus has phrases like depart from me, I never knew you. Today you'll be with me in paradise. Jesus talks like this all the time. There must be something to it. Now again, two thieves on crosses on either side of Jesus. Jesus offers the other, today you'll be with me in paradise, says nothing to the other with respect to this. What do we know about the post death of the other thief? Nothing. And do we have assurance of his salvation? We have that for the one thief, we don't have it for the other. What will God do with him? That's up to God. Okay, now why is that question unsatisfying? Because of a bunch of other things Jesus said. Because everything else Jesus said has led us to believe that faithfulness in this life will in fact be rewarded by faithfulness in the next. I just finished preaching three sermons about righteousness, about don't display your righteousness in order to gain status Okay, well what's implied by that? That God who sees what's done in secret will reward you. Okay, so obviously we're imagining some kind of reward in the life to come, but what about rewards now? Jesus says things like, I, you know, you will surely be rewarded in this life and the next. Living a holy life in this world, and this gets to the previous question, because all these questions usually run together in some way or another, you can connect them. If you live like Jesus, you will both be blessed because you will be in alignment with the will of God, the maker of the universe, and you will suffer because you are going to be out of step with the world, the rebellious flesh, and the devil. Okay, so right there we have another answer. Okay, now the proverbial person in the jungle, or a person who was born in an Islamic country, or a person who was born to a tyrannical person who went to church but showed the exact opposite of the love of God, and so this person has grown up to associate Christianity with all sorts of cruelty and everything that Jesus is against. Okay, if we can see these issues, do we imagine God can't? If we can see these dilemmas, do we imagine God can't sort them out? I have huge areas and questions that I can't sort out, and I trust that God can. So, I leave these questions to him. Now, the predestination, what happened in 17th century Calvinism, I think, has everything to do with the same philosophical debates that we're having in the meaning crisis that we're having in materialism, and so we're most often best looking at older sources before some of these philosophical debates. So, let me get back to the wording of your question. To what extent does faith in the concrete truth of the world, in the sense that it is a very, very important topic, and I think that's a very important point. So, I'm going to go back to the question that I was asking. So, let me get back to the wording of your question. To what extent does faith in the concrete details of the gospel accounts of Jesus' life? Okay. Now, when I read that, let's see if he's in the room. When I read that, I hear it through a modernist lens saying, when I get to the pearly gates, St. Peter's going to have a quiz, and there's a lot of debate on what quiz St. Peter's going to have for me. This quiz is one Jericho or two. Was Jesus' crucifixion on a Thursday or a Friday? Do you really believe that that man was born blind? Or was Noah's flood global or regional? Or was it a natural or mythological? My definition of a Christian is someone who trusts in Jesus more than they trust themselves. Okay. That's a Christian. And I intentionally there take it away from the propositional aspect and highlight the participatory, perspectival aspects. How about the person who has a bad, whose definition of Jesus is bad? How about the person who's never heard of Jesus? Okay. I believe that what evangelism is, is improving people's, improving the witness of Jesus to the world and upping the resolution of Jesus and inviting people to trust in him more. If you read certain passages like, you know, Paul in the book of Acts says in, at the Areopagus, God looked past your ignorance and you were not to be seen. But now he's calling you. What does he mean by now? When Jesus came or when Paul's standing on there listening to his words? And they're interested in Paul because, you know, as Tom Holland noted, in the third century and in centuries up until then, they're looking for a God that can be, that can be ruler of the other gods so they don't need to make sacrifices to a thousand and one gods just to cover their backsides. Okay. And so they're interested in Paul and, oh, do you have a God that maybe can solve our, reduce our cultic workload? But then when Paul starts talking about the resurrection, they scoff because they're Greeks, because they're docetic, because they're fairly gnostic, if I dare use that word. And why on earth would, because the work of this flesh down here is the work of a lesser God because clearly this work doesn't last because it dies and decays. Well, what does Jesus do with them? I don't know that we can answer that question, but it's not that we can say nothing because when Jesus says, you will be my witnesses, the church and Christians are called to be Jesus, to show Jesus to the world in their actions, in their words, in their lives. And then on that Sabbath with that beer, to realize with the restoration of the withered hand, to realize the way life is supposed to be. So if the question is, what kind of participation will this person have in the life of the age to come? I'm pretty foggy on what our lives are going to look like in that age. And so the more I know about all that goes into this innocent manifest image, I am clearly currently immersed in now, the more I realize how much I can't know about what my manifest image 2.0 will look like. So to get a question in that detail about a human being whose resolution is nearly binary to me now, sounds like the kind of thing that Christ is going to do. To me now, sounds like the kind of thing that Christians should on one hand admit their ignorance and on the other hand profess the generosity of the kind of God who would offer his own son for our, for us to beat and murder. And I think that's the best we can do. All right. So before I move on to the next one, does anyone else have anything on their mind that they want to ask now? So you don't have to wait through all the questions. All right. It doesn't sound like it. Okay. I'll move on to Brendan's question. So Brendan says, I wonder, does the notion of death acquitting sinners from their sins mean they would have nothing to answer for if the judgment happened right after their death? That's a good question. I wonder if the notion of death acquitting sinners from their sins. Well, see, and I'm not, why do we believe in capital punishment? I got that question recently. Symbolically, what is capital punishment? So someone goes out and does a horrible thing. Why do we kill them? Well, part of it is our annoyance. They've annoyed us, so we want to kill them. Okay. And you'll have that in a marital fight. Your spouse, you just annoyed your spouse and they might look at you and say, I could kill you. Well, what is that killing about? That killing is about removing that person from your life. And you'll have that in a marital fight. And that killing is about removing that person from your presence in the moment immediately. Now, obviously, if you killed your spouse, two seconds later you might say, what have I done? That's part of the function of consciousness and it's a bad deal. Okay. So why does the state execute capital punishment? Symbolically, what that state is doing is sort of saying, we are delivering this person up to God to judge. Now, in that sense, with our kind of interesting mixture of materialism and humanism, well now, if we've got enough money, we're going to incarcerate them for the rest of their lives. I'm not sure which is more cruel. So the notion of death acquitting sinners, that's really complex because what usually happens after death is facing our judgment where God takes a look at us and takes a look at our life and determines next steps. And so, yeah, we have to answer for what we do after our death. And that's why we have this idea of judgment day. And that's a terrifying thing. Now, in a contemporary secular context where many people believe death is just non-consciousness, you're out of whatever's left of your story as this material story verse goes on, but you're, can you remember before you were born? No. So death is null. It's not zero, it's null. And so you should not fear it. And so if you have pain, then death is an improvement. Okay. That's then an expression of faith. And people get annoyed at Pascal's wager. Well, any opinion you decide to believe on any of these matters is a wager because in all fairness to both sides of these agnostic atheist debates, what do we know? What do we mean by knowing? What are we sure about? Well, I think there is abundant evidence that the idea that we simply pass away is not well-founded. To me, no ancient thought this, or very few ancients thought this. Most people commonly thought it, that something happens after we die. There's plenty of anecdotal, but it's not scientific evidence. And so I think, yeah, we all believe in something. So if you believe that death is null, then well, that's your wager. The most common idea throughout human history, in human civilization, has been after we die, we are called to give an account for our life. Okay. Christianity believes that too. Christianity adds the drama of Christ into that mix. But even Christians are called to give an account for what they did. So then we're off in a theological conversation. So that's the best I can do. All right. So now I'll move on to Gomerday's question. So he has two questions where they tie into each other. And his question is, first, what are your thoughts on New Age beliefs or religions such as crystal healing, occult practices, sage, witchcraft, etc. Are they comparable with Christianity? And the second is, perhaps, he says, perhaps I shouldn't ask because it's politically incorrect. But he says, why women in general are attracted to these types of beliefs and practices? Thank you for your time. What are my thoughts? My answers are already too long. What are my thoughts on New Age beliefs, religions, crystal healings? Are they compatible with Christianity? Well, the word he uses is comparable, but I guess that's a valid word to use. Well, they're definitely comparable because in some senses they're trying to do similar things. So Jordan Peterson says an ideology is a crippled religion. And part of how ideologies are crippled is because they haven't had enough time to actually address huge swaths of the human experience. Religions have had that time and they've developed it. And so any religion worth its salt has standard answers to common human needs. Many of these practices are part of, now if we're going to have huge boxes of, or huge areas of human life, a lot of religion is about making life work. Post-Protestantism, now again Protestantism is where it is on the developmental track with respect to the ongoing, you might, one lens to look at it through, would be the ongoing debate between Aristotle and Plato. How does Earth, how do Earth and Heaven relate? Crystal healing, occult practices, sage, witchcraft, all of this stuff are recognitions that material reality is an expression of what we would call spiritual realities. These are functions of deeply sacramental perspectives. We can go all the way back to Owen Barfield and say all of these are parts of original participation. Now part of what I think happens, has happened along this route between original participation and then separated participation is that the separation of the participation creates hot spots in the matrix so that I'm going to try to gain, I'm going to try to move the material via the spiritual. Now if you're in a fundamentally functionally pagan perspective where you have a meta-divine realm and all of these spiritual beings up there, well it's not any different from living in a village and there are hierarchies of power within the village and there's a boss man in the village and you're having a squabble with your neighbor. Your neighbor is making noise late at night or fighting with their family and you want to sleep at night and you've gone to the neighbor and you said could you please not fight at night and they say screw you. So then you go to the boss man in the town and the boss says can you get my neighbor to stop fighting at night and it's going to cost the boss man something to shut the neighbor up because he's an ornery jerk and everybody in town knows it but he farms better than a lot of the other people so they want to keep him around. So the boss man says I'll do something about your neighbor but you've got to do something for me. That's basic religion. And if you're living in a meta-divine realm, the other gods are like the boss man, they're the bales. And so you go to the bale and you say I've only got two sons, my neighbor has six, if I want to contend at the gate I want ten sons. Well, get another wife. Well, I want to know that wife number two is going to be really fertile. Okay, go to bale. Or the crops or you go to the bale that's in charge of having fertile wives. All of that stuff is part of religion. What you see happening in the story of Israel is not only is the cult centralized in Jerusalem but all of this is about God. And again, you can see the difference between the meta-divine realm which has all of these, basically all of these strongmen and brokers to make your way in the world and it's all centralized in God, the agent and the arena in some ways together. Okay, so a lot of these in Christian theology we call this accommodation. We might look at it also as appropriation. A lot of these things get picked up and so you'll read about Hannah who is barren going to the tabernacle at Shiloh praying fervently to God to open her womb, praying so fervently Eli thinks she's drunk. But Eli is blind. So, well, in Christianity this follows this tradition and we look to God for all of our things. Now, this very quickly gets into a long-standing debate between Protestants and Catholics about intermediaries. Can you, should you go to certain departed Christians that are part of that great cloud of witnesses in order to achieve the kinds of goals? Protestants often look at that as saying this is old accommodationist code that should be laid aside. There's a whole debate that I don't really want to get into. Okay, so that's the source of a lot of these practices. Now, I think Jonathan Pigeot is correct that in some ways in Protestantism God gets further and further away that, well, God doesn't seem to be coming through with answering my prayers. So maybe I'm going to go to a different church or maybe I'm going to find a Reddit group where 10,000 people can pray for my aunt who has cancer because if 10,000 people pray for her instead of just me then maybe God will listen. These are natural human inclinations and the book of James says the prayer of the righteous man availeth much. So maybe if my prayers aren't being answered I should go and find a more righteous man than the ones I've been asking to pray for me. Or sometimes you're not healed because of sin. So that has gone through the Pentecostal churches. God won't bless this mess. You need to straighten out some things in your life for other things to be corrected. Now, this gets very complicated because it could be that some of the mess that God isn't blessing is just your own stupid stupidity and part of the way things work here below. But now I've just accentuated the supernatural natural divide. So these things get very complicated. Which leads me to the second question which is what I answer with great fear and trembling but let's not duck hard questions. Women, let's admit that women and men are different creatures. Let's admit that women and men score differently in personality profiles. Let's admit that not only nature but nurture impact the kinds of things that women have to deal with. In my experience, generally speaking, again I'm talking in generalities such as differences in trait neuroticism or agreeableness that Jordan Peterson talks about in terms of what we've discovered in terms of the number of women sampled, etc. etc. Is this all of women for all of human history? There's way more questions than I can ever answer there. Generally speaking, with the samples that we see, men and women behave differently. I think women tend to be a little bit more integral than men. Women are often very much on watch in areas that traditionally folk religion have addressed. I'm not saying women are bigger sinners. I'm not even wading into the question of whether or not women should have leadership roles in the church. I talked about that with Mary this week or last week. So whether or not your observation is how valid it is over broader things, I don't know. But could it be that there are some personality aspects that tend to steer women towards different things? Well, that would make sense. So, yeah. Who knows? But I can't really answer that question because women is an awfully big group. I can help a little bit. Oh, please do. Yeah, I agree with you with everything you said. Especially the comment that you made about women being more integral. I think by nature, women are multitaskers. They are able to focus on more than one thing at a time. And that's so I have a little theory about it. It's that they they have more of a sense of the connectedness of things because of that. And and so they are drawn into new age, nature based ideologies or ideas or religions because of that, because they see the. They have a more a more and I'm trying not to be discriminatory against men. But I think go ahead. I'm not worried about it. I think that they have a more holistic view of things because they're always the brain is always talking to other parts of their brain all the time. It's kind of it doesn't it doesn't shut off. So that that's kind of the theory that I have about that. And there and it's also has to do a lot of those things have to do with healing and nurturing. And so and that plays into their into their personalities and their preferences as well. So that's my two cents. Thanks, Sherry. I appreciate it. All right. Does anyone else have any thoughts about that? OK, let's move on to Christian T. Golden's second question. So Christian T. Golden says, I had a thought I'd like you to critique. We are each possessed by some idea or feeling or thought at any given time. Possession becomes problematic when it inherently prohibits us from breaking free and choosing a new master. Even Christianity itself seems to have built into it the freedom to turn one's back on God, thereby choosing a new possessor. To me, perhaps paradoxically, this helps keep me from shrugging off Christianity anytime I hit a bump in the road. Does this, in your opinion, cheapen or water down Christianity? I'm worried that it's indicative of a complete of an incomplete view of God's sovereignty. But then again, I suppose an earthly father is no less a father just because his child rebels. That's the question. We each are possessed by some idea, feeling thought at any given time. That's consciousness. Possession becomes problematic when it inherently prohibits us from breaking free of that thought and choosing a new master. Even Christianity itself seems to have built into it the freedom to turn one's back on God, thereby choosing a new possessor. To me, perhaps paradoxically, this helps keep me from shrugging off Christianity anytime I hit a bump in the road. Does this, in your opinion, cheapen or water down Christianity? I don't think so. So each worldview has, at least our views of them, have their upsides and downsides. The Greeks looked at a world of decay and some of them said, not only the Greeks, Manicheans, Manichean philosophy was wild. I should do a video on that. Surely a lesser God made this world. How can we account for the separation between the is-ness and the ought-ness that confronts us or compels us or that draws us? That's always the question that we're dealing with, between the is and the ought. You can look at the difference between the scientific frame and the manifest image. The is lives in the scientific frame, or at least part of the is. Possessions, ideas, feelings, thoughts. Yeah. So the mooks and knights video that I just did today, part of what I've been thinking about a lot lately has been our realization of the spiritual. That word didn't go away, even though materialists did a lot. The word didn't go away, but we're really wrestling to come to terms with what on earth do we mean by that word. And when I find myself, so if I read too much Twitter or listen to too many videos by people talking about all this woke stuff, I feel myself possessed and it's like, I'm going to put that stuff away and do something else, fill my mind with something else. So there's a lot of possession going on. And Christianity believes that at one point God will be all in all. We don't know what quite that would look like, as we talked about already before today. So this is this is what you're describing is sort of normal in terms of the process of our redemption. And this again gets to the progressive question. I would like to believe that over my life sanctification is progressive. Now, we all know that there could come a day when I lose my faculties, that I perhaps am senile and in my senility, lose what it seems that perhaps I have achieved. And again, I find Christianity reassuring because I believe that that I do not labor in vain and and that whatever whatever good I have done in this world will be not lost but fulfilled in the age to come. So yeah, I don't know that this cheapens Christianity. I think Christian has adequate resources to engage it. All right. Yeah. Anyone have any other questions or ideas they want to add before I move on? OK. So Indy Defense has a question. He says, aside from the Bible itself, what books do you recommend? I get this question a lot. I should really. I should probably just recommend authors. I think C.S. Lewis. I found I found C.S. Lewis very helpful. I find Tim Keller very helpful. I find Dallas Willard helpful. Just looking around my office. You know, if you if you start with C.S. Lewis and Tim Keller and Dallas Willard, that's already a pretty substantial library. I like N.T. Wright. I found a lot of his books helpful. It depends on on what specifically you're interested in. And that if if if someone tells me what they're wrestling with, I might be able to give a book recommendation. But, you know, my videos are so eclectic because that's how I am. But if you look at who I keep coming back to, Tolkien, Lewis, you know, all the usual suspects. Yeah, Tolkien and Lewis are definitely very good. All right. Moving on. Actually, does anyone else have a book recommendation they want to give? Maybe we could get some opinions from anyone else here. I would say to read The Church Fathers. Who are you reading in The Church Fathers? They're not easy. There are some that aren't too difficult on the on the soul and the resurrection is kind of nice from Gregory of Nyssa. It's a dialogue between him and his sister. And it's accessible. Maximus the Confessor. Origin. I know that that's, you know, not without controversy. But and and also I just I just downloaded last night St. Isaac of Nineveh. And it's just so much wisdom and it's easy to read and it's cheap. It's a dollar for a download. Onto a Kindle. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, it's it's it's encouraging. A lot of encouraging words to be found. Good. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Anyone else? Going once, going twice. All right. I'll move on to Auro Ross. Auro Ross asks, Do you think the transcendental argument for God's existence is sound? It seems almost irrefutable. What do you mean by the transcendental argument? I see you're in the room. Can you talk? Can you hear? Yep. Oh, yeah. No, the transcendent argument basically states that it's in any worldview for you to have to even make an intelligible thought. You cannot make an intelligible. I guess the best and simplest way to put it would be. What is it that permits me to even make an intelligible statement within a world you were? None of the physical events make reference to anything within any other any transcendental realm. How would if the particular particular of any earthly instantiation of something don't make reference to anything transcendental? How is it even possible for meaning to have anything, like for there to be meaning in the first place? That's interesting. I don't know that I've really thought about that argument as an argument. Part of what's tricky about all of these arguments for God is that one way or another, they all depend on what you mean by the word God. And when I look at the the forums in which these arguments are usually trotted out as as between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris, if Jordan and Sam have very different definitions of what God is, there's just a lot of talking past each other. But I'll have to do a little bit more research on this rule and check it out further. So thanks for the question. Anyone else have any thoughts on that? I think that once you understand that God is the thing that encompasses everything, then you understand that these sort of arguments for God will always fail to some degree, because how can you ever encapsulate the thing that encapsulates everything, which is why you approach God more through experience than you do through like concept. So I find like I love apologetics and that kind of stuff, but that's not the reason we're here. That's a great answer. Yeah. Amen. All right. Anyone else? Just a side note to do is a question that you skipped from Andrew. Oh, OK. Which one? Just above in the defense. In which channel? In the question for PBK. OK. That's his question. That's his post. Yeah, that was just a suggestion I made earlier. Oh, OK. OK. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Making sure my question got in there. All right. Well, I guess I'll move on to Zurich then. Unless, oh, unless anyone else has any thoughts. No. All right. We'll go ahead and ask Zurich's question. How would you recommend a teen read the Bible in general? Would you discourage a complete read through? If one did a complete read through, how would you recommend learning from the law practices, tabernacle building, et cetera, in the Torah? Would you recommend a commentary? Well, that depends on what kind of teen. Teenagers vary tremendously. There are lots of interesting, there are lots of, I mean, we are, there are so many interesting tools out there. There are what are sometimes called chronological Bibles, where someone tries to break up the book into something closer to a narrative. There are paraphrases like the message where, you know, a paraphrase is, you know, Eugene Peterson sits down and reads a passage. And he's a, you know, Eugene Peterson, you know, it was a tremendous, it was a very well learned biblical scholar, also experienced pastor, deeply Christian man. And so he writes a paraphrase of the Bible. And there are varieties of ones out there. I think, I think, I think just try it and find out what works for you. Listening to the Bible, I find, you can find that on Bible Gateway, whole varieties of audio versions of the Bible out there. And what I find helpful for me is vary the translation, vary the, you know, break, kind of in a, again, break up the patterns. And when you break up the Jordan or Jonathan Peugeot says, you are a pattern looking at patterns. Well, disrupt your own patterns so that you can see the other patterns in a different light. So try a chronological Bible. Try, I mean, there's lots and lots of different things out there. Try reading different versions of it. There are amplified versions. There are readers digest versions. Now, again, all of these are, all of these are sort of sifted through another human being and their own filters. And so keep that in mind. But every English translation has that. And so, but even say, okay, well, I'm going to learn the Greek and the Hebrew. Well, go for that. That's a wonderful thing. Well, that's another whole project. And just looking at it in its original language obviously won't settle all debates. So, yeah, try a bunch of different things. But try it. Do it. And talk to other people about it. You know, so Jeff, one of Jeff's practices is copying the Bible. And I thought, wow, that's a cool way of disrupting your patterns, of slowing you down. Because then suddenly you're seeing it through different eyes. So, yeah, study the Bible 10 different ways. Yeah, Saul just got the kingdom torn away from him this morning. Anyone else have any tips on helping teens out with the Bible? Yeah, I have a tip. I would tell your teenager you should start with sermons on YouTube. Because that way you have a better idea of what Bible verse you're looking for and what it says. Because I think a teenager might get lost. And also ratestedman.org goes through a lot of the gospels. Thank you. Thank you. That's true. There's a lot of answers on YouTube for common questions people might have. And they direct you to all sorts of Bible passages that are relevant to that. Where it would be difficult to find otherwise. And this is where the question of filters come up too. Because what the internet gives us, in a sense we have the same problem with the Bible. There's so much of it there. And so relevance, realization, filter. So I think you find, this is obviously what the church is all about. Find some good teachers that are competent, valued. There's a community around them. When you think about what the church is, it's really genius. Because you want to, you want, how do you know if a Bible teacher is reliable? Well, you need multiple factors. Well, maybe they slept with the organist. Well, there's a problem. Does that mean that everything is a problem? Not necessarily. You can look at, so multiply the numbers, but also pay attention to people. And those who are around them. And we naturally do this. Find someone that we trust and admire. Who we say, wow, they've got a handle on something. So ask them. And you'll begin putting together a good selective chain of resources. Yeah, I just wanted to add, don't fortune tell with it. Don't use your Bible as a fortune telling mechanism. I have another suggestion. The Bible Project has all these videos on the books of the Bible. I wish I had that when I was younger. They're really helpful and give you a whole picture kind of thing. Which, I got lost when I was younger. So that might be of help too. That's a good idea. Yeah, great resource. Anyone else? Alright, I'll move on to Richard. Now Richard says he has a comment, so I suppose not necessarily a question yet. So Richard says, Well, that's a great comment. Yeah, there's a real, there's a real, there's a real inconvenient observation about human nature and how it plays out in the IDW and the church. Well, and this is, you know, this is part of the reality between the is-ness and the ought-ness. And part of the reality of, okay, I became a Christian. Why doesn't God, what, put you on cocaine? Is that what you're asking? So, no. So, why do we continue to suffer? Sufferings are sometimes the sticking points between us and reality. Sufferings are sometimes God's tools to make us or someone else grow. I think a lot of this is try to avoid the spiritual outs. Try to avoid the cheap outs. The Gene Wilder Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory book was so, or movie was so instructive because here all of these children are given the opportunity to inherit a lifetime of chocolate, which is exactly what the children think they want. And they're given these tiny little rules to follow and they can't. And in each case, it's a little morality play, in each case, all their individual defects lead them astray. But the winner, Charlie, will inherit the kingdom. Well, Charlie was led astray too. So, you know, this is the Christian life and every church is flawed. Yeah, yeah, I agree. It's a great comment. And even, you know, and in that way, you know, we like, there's always this, and I think this comment really nailed it. We find a place that, well, this is really working well for me and I'm agreeing with the people and we're all on the same page and isn't it wonderful? And, yep, that's the way it is at first. And in time, resolutions heighten. Marriage works the same way. Children work the same way. Moving into a new house works the same way. Moving into a new job works the same way. Part of what moving, part of what time does is heighten our resolution and expose so much of ourselves in conjunction with what's outside of us. That's part of the power of the transjective in that we, if you're in church long enough and if you're paying attention to yourself and to others, you will see things about yourself you don't like and you will find them terribly hard to change. Well, what that community actually offers you, hopefully, is a productive place in order to grow in Christ. And hopefully, if the community is on the same page, the natural inclinations will be pulling us towards that image itself. So, yeah. Being a deeper Christian on the Discord server, it's all part of the process. Telling the truth to each other, so on and so forth. Mm-hmm. Aziz Zurich is typing, but we're almost out of time. I do. I see a question. I also have a question myself, if you don't mind. Okay, go ahead. We've got just a couple minutes. All right. So, I've had a lot of experiences here with the intellectual dark web, with Jordan Peterson, with you, with Jonathan Pageau, Jonathan Verveke, et cetera. And I have a lot of interesting theological issues of my own that I come across on a day-to-day basis. And I think, oh, gee, I should really go to my priest and talk to him about this, but he doesn't know everything I've been through and I don't really have the relationship with him that I think would be productive. So, my question sort of is, how should someone new approach, how should someone approach a new priest or preacher or something like that? And how do they get to know them in a way that they could come to have productive and meaningful discussions about theology and the problems in their lives? That is a great question. Thank you. This, in some ways, we're sort of back to where we started in this, in that, what do we do with our limitations of time and space and the fulfillment of be fruitful and multiply? We've got so many people around us. We're not living in a community where the priest has, where the priest or preacher has a dozen or 20 or 30 or the Dunbar number, 120 people to be in relationship with. And each of us have those Dunbar numbers ourselves and on and on and out and out. And we're not living in a little town where there's a little church. You know, I, one of the, when I was in the Dominican Republic, I worked with churches that, one church up on a town, up on the top of a mountain. You know, there's what, 40, 50, 75, maybe 100 people that lived in that little town. They had a church and they had a bar. And some in the town went to church every night and the rest of the people in town went to the bar every night. That was the town. Everybody knew everybody's business. They all worked the same coffee plantation. They all farmed the same gardens. That was the town. The preacher knew everyone well. Now suddenly, well then you have radio. Maybe someone in town now spending their nights, they're not going to the bar or the church and they're listening to the radio. And they got, start getting interested in some radio program. The preacher's paying all of his time paying attention to the people in the town. So we have this multiplication of worlds that has happened. And the internet has, boy that just threw gasoline on that fire. Woosh. And so, you know, but at the same time, I mean, I have this struggle where, especially now during COVID, there are members of my church that I'm not seeing. The elders and the deacons are keeping up on them. And I'll talk to them every now and then. But some of the people on this channel and over the internet I'm talking to more often. Well, what is my parish? So I think we have to resign ourselves to a few ideas. Number one, the body of Christ. Christ works on us through his body. And your parish priest will have a role. If you're part of this community or listening to my channel, I have a role. The other members of this Discord have a role. Your family has a role. It's sort of unfair to expect your parish priest to be up on what you're spending hours of your week with. Because the parish priest has all kinds of other things that he has to deal with. So to a certain degree, and I think we all understand this, to a certain degree there's an economy of attention that we're dealing with here. And so as a Christian, you'll have to be a steward over your economy of attention. And just like the question about, well, shoot, in some ways, and I knew this was going to happen when I started the channel, I knew that the earliest people that get on my channel are going to have a preferential position. They got in on the ground floor. So, you know, Job and Jeff and Luke and Sherry and then other people who come along later maybe have something interesting or particular about them or are really gifted and skilled in things like Shelley or Sam. And I get to know them better. Joey I know because Joey I know in real life. And, you know, I can just go through this. But then there are others of you and it's horribly unfair that I've never had a chance to get to know you well. So I have all the same dynamics and now it's multiplied because of the internet. So be patient with your priest. Develop relationships with the people in your church and your priest. But keep your expectations realistic about what can happen. So, and, you know, I'm dealing with that. I mean, that's one of the big questions I've mentioned in some videos that, you know, so maybe you're going to an Orthodox or a Roman Catholic church and there's not much, you know, the homilies are five minutes maybe at best. And what you're getting, you're getting through the liturgy and through the host. Well, praise God. But now you're listening to how many people on YouTube and, and, and, and, and that's the world we're living in. So the church so far has seemed to adapt and we're going to keep adapting. And there will be loss from the little town on the top of the mountain in La Isleta in the Dominican Republic where that pastor knew everybody through and through. But the amount of opportunity that is available to the people has broadened exponentially. And given the diversity that human beings are, there's also opportunity in that. So we'll, we'll keep working this through. Thank you. Oh, one last question. I'll hit Zurich and then we'll be done. All right. All right. Just because I couldn't, I saw Lyndon Washington and I couldn't pass it up. All right. Here it is. Go ahead. You had it. Okay. Okay. So Zurich says, I go to a private Christian school in a Dutch settlement called Lyndon Washington. It's a very Dutch town and I've really fallen in love with the culture. What are some fond memories you have in your much deeper experience of that culture? I've never actually been to Lyndon, but there are ways in which Lyndon Washington and Ripon, California and even the New Jersey colony and Chicago and Iowa and Western Michigan and Whitenessville, Massachusetts. You know, I just talked about the little town. There is a, it's funny because, so my mother grew up in Whitenessville and was the youngest of three daughters, was the only one to go to college, went to Calvin College of course. My mother had done very well in high school and so she did well at college. My father had grown up in little towns in the Midwest because his father was a minister who moved around. And they met at Calvin College and they, my father took a call to Patterson, New Jersey and so I was raised in Patterson, New Jersey, which was in a major metropolitan area. But part of what happens in major metropolitan areas are people group up and there are little colonies and little clusters. And so I was part of the Dutch CRC cluster in New Jersey. And then we had a lot of vacations in Massachusetts, which was only four hours away. So I got a sense of, my second home was Whitenessville, Massachusetts where my mother, when my father retired, they moved there. My mother's lived there ever since. And one of the comments my mother made to me about moving back to Whitenessville was, I didn't know how small it would be. And part of what she meant by that was that you know the mailman, you know, and Whitenessville has changed dramatically from when she grew up. Now it's increasingly a suburban bedroom of Boston. Half of Massachusetts is basically colonized by Boston. But there's something delightful about a small town and knowing and being known. And there's also something restrictive about a small town of knowing and being known. You never grow up from the part of the image of who you are in the minds of others, which gets reflected back on you, is part of who you were. And that's both a glorious thing and a limitation. I recently had a Zoom call with a bunch of people that I graduated high school with. And I went to school with roughly the same hundred kids from kindergarten through high school and then to college with a few of them still. It was fascinating meeting with some of these people. Some of them at least seem to be very much who they used to be. Others are very different. So, oh, the Olie Bowlen, all the Dutch things were fun. But so much of it was, you know, when I needed a job as a high school kid, my father, you know, knew who to call, who had generous hearts, who were businessmen. And so I got high school jobs and I had a group of people. We all need a village. And maybe you're finding your village on the Internet that's not ideal. It's nice to have a real life village where we're known. And part of what I think is part of what I think is joyful about anticipating a life in an age when we are not as bound by time as we are here is the imagination that perhaps we will escape from our Dunbar number. And I think all of these images lead us to, you know, imagining what that will be like even if we can't conceive of it. So, yeah, God bless those subcultures. And they're not just Dutch. They're Jewish and they're Italian and they're Irish. And that's one of the things that churches do. Churches coalesce those sub communities. And you can have that experience by moving overseas and being part of an expat community. And they're special too. So good. Any, you know, that's it. Let's say that's it for the question. Any feedback on this session that anyone wants to give or takeaways from this session? Thank you, Edwin. Are we still recording? Yeah, we are. Do you want me to stop? Yeah, stop it. Okay.
