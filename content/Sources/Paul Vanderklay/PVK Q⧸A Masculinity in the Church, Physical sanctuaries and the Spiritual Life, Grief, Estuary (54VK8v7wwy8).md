 Hi, this is Paul and this is our every week on Fridays from 10 to 12 I do a question and answer on the Bridges of Meaning Discord server. This week's recording is going to be shorter than most because this week, this past week I put out a video on Living Stones Online, an estuary, and obviously in the Bridges of Meaning Discord server that provoked a lot of questions and we did the question and answer without recording. Some of the question and answers we do with recording so that they can be shared like I'm doing now, but some of the question and answers we do without recording because there's a special culture of being in the room. And so I know Discord servers are not for everyone and some people prefer YouTube comments and some people prefer other ways of interacting with online content like this, but the Discord I think the Bridges of Meaning Discord server is an example of an estuary where the confluence of lots of different flows have come together and there's some mushiness and there's some chaos and sometimes imbalance, but over the long haul it's super productive like an estuary. So that's we've been talking about muck and estuaries and plants and sea monsters and over the next few months we will continue to define what we're talking about in this estuary conversation and see where it goes. But now we've got more questions than we'll probably have time for. Joey is our moderator and he's asked people to upvote the questions they most want answered so we'll take them in the order of upvoting this week. So that's what we're going to do. So take it away, Joey. Thanks, Paul. Our first question is from B Palmer and he's actually here to read his own question. Hi, Paul. Can you guys hear me? Hear you well. Awesome. So Paul, thanks for continuing to do this. So recently I have been thinking a lot about our notions of masculinity and femininity inside the church. Much of my thought kind of sparked from a lot of Jonathan Peugeot stuff and I've noticed that I'm thinking in a church in Boston that a lot of young men in my church, including myself, are big fans of guys like Joe Rogan, Jocko Willink, and of course Jordan Peterson who kind of embody a certain vision or vibe of masculinity. And I'm curious to hear your thoughts on what you think we in the church can learn from these figures. Why do they have the appeal that they have? What conclusion might we reach given the relative absence of man from the church at large? This is a great question. You have a treat waiting for you next week. We'll have to see if it's a treat or not. So Kristen Coves Dumas is a history professor at Calvin College and she wrote a book, Jesus and John Wayne, How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation. She had her publisher send me this book. She and I have some mutual friends in Grand Rapids. I am an alumnus of the history department of Calvin College and when she was writing this book she was going to write a chapter on Jordan Peterson and so she was going to reach out to me and talk to me about it but the book went a different way and so she didn't have a chapter on Jordan Peterson. But I think this book would be hated by many of you in this community. I'll reserve my thumbs up or thumbs down opinion on the book for now. We'll see how my conversation with her plays out next week because often I've done books that I've really wanted to promote and at this point this is not a book I promote but at the same time I want to have a productive conversation with her. I think there is a guy out of New York City who runs a newsletter, if that's what we can call it, sort of a blog called The Masculinist and he for a while was part of Tim Keller's Redeemer Presbyterian and he has been trying to work through, he was a single guy, New York City, well paying job, Christian, wanted to find out, wanted to, was working to figure out how to be a single Christian young man in this new milieu. Now this is pre Jordan Peterson that I started reading his newsletter, I haven't read one for a while. He wrote some really interesting stuff and one of the things that I remember one of his posts he talked about the fact and we've touched on it briefly in some of our channels that for some reason Christianity sometimes comes off less masculine than say Judaism or Islam which is really interesting and sociologists have borne that out. Now this is enormously ironic given the fact that in Christianity you have Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Son is definitely gendered, God the Father is the source of gender as we see in Genesis or God is the source of gender, the Holy Spirit that often gets debated. So what's with Christianity and some people argue that well the importance of Mary in the Roman Catholic Church is a vital balance to this and Jung and Jordan Peterson a little bit of a following sometimes almost wanted to elevate Mary in order to bring gender balance to the Godhead as such. So in thinking about my conversation next week with Kristin I'm thinking about questions like is going to work every day outside the home masculine or feminine? What is masculine and what is feminine and probably someone who has taught me a lot about that has been Jonathan Pageot because in some ways symbolic symbolism really lends itself to these really huge amorphous categories that defy easy description both procedurally and propositionally. I think that's part of the power of symbolism and I think you're dead on right that Joe Rogan, Jack O'Willing, Jordan Peterson they send out a signal that inspires men to be men and you know my conversation with Mary Cohen where she talked about this you know masculine energy and bottled up masculine energy is what builds skyscrapers and you know conquers the world and this is part of in her opinion at least and I know not everybody shares her opinion you know Catholic social teaching. There's really something to be said for that and I think we have in an attempt to try to address you know inequities if I dare use that word in a crowd like this. Inequities and injustices against women historically we have in some ways feminized our culture perhaps putting it out of balance and I think that's really what Jordan Peterson and many of these others are expressing and sensing and responding to because balance in a culture similar to balance in an estuary is a thing too big for any of us to control or even necessarily figure out how to measure well. When a biologist goes into an estuary and is attempting to get a sense of estuary health I'm sure they will certainly have all of these ways of measuring things in the water or things in the soil or counting creatures but we as human beings have this powerful intuitive sense of if you've been in a lot of estuaries and you walk into one and you look around and you smell it you might say this there's something going wrong here and I don't know why I might not be able to fix it but something is out of balance and I think we've seen that as a culture and I think as as a Calvinist I would say that in this world something is always out of balance and so figuring out the proper way for masculine and feminine to dance that's what we're always up to and so let me get back to your question. A lot of young men in the church are big fans of Jo Rogan and Jaco Willink and Jordan Peterson who embody a certain vision or vibe of masculinity. They do and I think in many ways they are uncles and fathers and they are inspiring young men. One of the things that so we had a we had kind of a core group meet up last week and no actually it was this week it's been such a busy week and one of the things that came through in the discussion was the appreciation for the age diversity in our mostly male meetup that we have older men and younger men and a lot has been made of this in terms of fatherless households and you know the fatherlessness of the house of households and the and the rise in children not growing up in a stable biological father biological mother biological children household in the culture is a sign that the ecosystem is not healthy because as Warren Farrell has noted in his work boys and girls have different things to learn from dads and moms and every dad is unique and every mom is unique every dad is you know both got some masculine and feminine qualities every mom has some masculine and feminine qualities but our sex will obviously impact the the mixture of masculine and feminine within us as will our masculine and feminine within us as will our context and everything that that that shoots out there in terms of all of our aspects and variables and and so you know this this is this is this has been going through in the church too. Ethridge you know Dumas points out some of those movements in the church mostly in her book in a negative way and so probably in the conversation it's not going to be a debate and I'm you know I want to be her friend and but so the the challenging I hope to do will hopefully be seen as as as friendly and loving because if you read the book of Proverbs you know that's that's the that's often the way that we grow and when and many of you have challenged me in many things and you challenged me in your questions and so I believe we can all grow together in that way but that we had promise keepers a generation ago in the church one of the things is one of the things that we have to recognize is that whereas we might live for 70 or 80 years those first 20 years of our life are intensely formative and so even though promise keepers happened in the 90s people born in the 90s and afterwards wouldn't know the promise keepers movement in church the promise keepers movement was a masculine movement and it challenged in many ways sort of many things that that Mary challenged as Jordan Peterson did hey you're a man is it strong to go out and rape a woman well yeah that shows physical strength but what that doesn't show is strength of character in fact that is a thing that finally will not only destroy the woman but will destroy you and will destroy your world and you know that's part of the reason it's wrong real strength is restraint and and even in these movies that we see and you know I loved when Jordan Peterson was taking his son to a to a movie that his little son was scared and Jordan would say keep your eyes on the hero that's exactly right because you know thankfully in many of our heroic epics the hero has strength but only tries to use it for good and the hero gets that wrong and most of us do but but that's why these are archetypal stories that the you know that the the masculine hero uses masculine strength to to use his power this is Andy Crouch's ideas too for flourishing in the community for flourishing out beyond himself and that's exactly why churches need to have estuaries so and and then as Peugeot has pointed out part of the problem with the Wonder Woman figure is is she's using so much masculine energy and again Peugeot points out that that there's there's a place for this sometimes but when you have a female using masculine energy as she is in a masculine way it's sort of the exception because what's what's being abandoned and of course when you look at although I don't the woman who plays Wonder Woman in the movie in the movies oh she's aw she's she's obviously also a drop dead gorgeous woman which is part of feminine power and I often tell people masculine power is impressive and in some ways at great insult to women our culture has fetishized masculine power in a certain way and completely turned a blind eye to feminine power and I'll tell people masculine power one strong man may best a weaker man but as Jordan Peterson noted and as the eight people had noted two or three not as strong individual men can best the one strong man feminine power read can redirect the attention of a million strong men which power is greater well this is where a greater hierarchy doesn't really fit so well and so in a healthy ecosystem there's masculine and there's feminine and both powers have their own excellencies and now each of us as individuals have masculine and feminine traits men be by virtue of our biology tend to excel in the masculine women by virtue of their biology tend to excel in the feminine some of us some men might be more feminine some men some women might be more masculine that's part of normal variation in a healthy ecosystem now what I think our culture has done in in the the lack of balance in many of these things is in failing to understand the that we are too small to actually track all this stuff and and this is the way our culture is faithless I believe in failing to trust that just as in an estuary balance will be restored in time we have built lots of levees and we have thought we have dammed up the California Delta and because we want to keep all of that fresh water flowing from the Sacramento and the San Joaquin and we don't want to give any of it to the ocean and like John Van Donk talked about some Dutch projects they've destroyed an ecosystem and it wasn't until the ecosystem was destroyed and and its loss was felt by all did they realize oh maybe we should have trusted the creator a little bit more maybe we should have had a little bit more humility about use of these incredibly powerful tools we've developed in the last hundred years and maybe we should work with the creator and with nature instead of against it and and I think we're seeing that in the church why do they have the appeal that they have because things are out of balance what conclusions might we reach given the relative absence of men from the church at large I don't think it's I don't think it's incidental or coincidental that estuary will at least for a time be dominated by men because you know so one of the conversations we had at our local meetup was should we should we adopt a new name that is more male exclusive and I sort of resisted that even though we're my channel is 90 percent male in terms of google analytics and I'm comfortable with that our meetup group is mostly men I'm comfortable with that and when I talked about this some of the people in the meetup said look out there in the world right now there are tons of female organizations there are hardly any male organizations there used to be 50 or 100 years ago most of them have gone away I was reflecting on the fact that in my church we without any um without any apology have men's groups and women's groups and we were struggling to get a men's group going and one of the older men that participates in our men's group he kept asking me to start when I've tried starting men's groups for a long time he so we had women's we had the women's bible study and so he went to the leader of the women's bible study and said can I join your group and the women said no you can't join our group this is a women's group and so we felt a little you know put off and so then you know when we got the men's group going he joined that so yeah um churches the the lack of men in church is a sign of something so I have a niece who is getting her PhD in marine biology studying lobsters of all things talk about irony well guess what she's studying lobsters and narragansett bay and there are not anywhere near as many lobsters and narragansett bay as there used to be 50 years ago all over the world right now in the elite universities and institutions everybody is able to say whoa while those lobsters are disappearing is there a problem we should study it well if the men are walking out and if there's even a movement that says men going their own way maybe we should stop and say there's a problem and maybe the best idea isn't just blaming men because the best idea wasn't before just blaming women maybe we should be a little bit more humble and ask ourselves what's going on let's study it let's not be afraid let's not be reactive let's have a conversation and maybe we'll learn something so that's my answer okay so we had a queue but I'm gonna cut in line because my question I ask is very much a follow-up to this so I remember like three or four months ago you mentioned this just very short yet so one of the end of one of your videos I don't remember which but you said that I can read it it's the the lack of community becomes sort of pathological for men and it's not as easy identifiable that that the cause is that you don't have any real context to put yourself in it's not as if I mentioned in my question that well if you break a leg it's kind of obvious what the source of your misery is but but the lack of it doesn't appear to you as such a thing and I'm I'm just one question I wrote here was that did you ever do a video about this because as you said I might do a video about that sometime but also if you didn't do you have any thoughts about this regarding the question you just answered I thought I gave you about 20 minutes of thought this is more about identifying the the source is sort of what I'm coming at like how does this you're ending up in mystery but but to you suffering it doesn't appear that it doesn't scream at you oh this is why I'm miserable here right well and and and figuring out why I mean miserable that's it that's a really complex thing so the church gets out of balance in terms of men and women and and the balance within church and men and women is is not disconnected to what's going on in the broader society so men men are miserable in church and so they leave okay what are men going to do about it well men can you know burn the church down oh okay so then women don't have a place to meet well that doesn't sound very productive maybe they'll have maybe we'll have a conversation okay well actually burning the church down is a lot easier than having a conversation conversations are really tough and in our current context a lot of women are like hey you know what women you know they've developed history courses and women studies and women women have gotten the short end of this the stick from men forever we call it patriarchy oh okay well they've got a whole thing that they're working on patriarchy and women being victims and you know well you know they've got some points in there I'm sure they do okay you're a man how are you gonna how are you going to engage in conversation with someone who is ideologically possessed well you know what you're going to have to learn some exorcism ways and today a lot of those exorcism ways are probably adopting some of their own tricks and that's some of the some of the most clever opponents of ideologically possessed people have mastered the tricks of the ideological possession and use it against them because eventually the truth is the truth is the truth and so if you can as a man okay so maybe your masculine nature is a woman says something you don't like well hit her in the mouth and beat her up oh okay um that's probably going to wind you up in jail and all the other women are going to hate you not a good strategy why don't instead you figure out how to have a conversation with her that's going to stretch you as a man here's one of the things that this entire cultural conversation completely misses that someone like glen lowry picks up on if you're in a weaker position what is that a challenge and an opportunity for for growth and strength because if you're in a privileged position you are going to get fat and lazy because you are sitting on top of a structure that is benefiting you so in some ways the the power of women that grew in the 19th and 20th century um they had a point men had the privilege of structure and position in some respects and grew lazy and grew dull and didn't have good arguments well women have the ascension okay men you have brains too time to step up time to figure out how to have a conversation time to engage an adversary in a way that at the end you have made a friend in fact maybe even an ally so yeah misery in many ways is the source of change figuring out where your misery comes from as jordan peterson noted well that's half to three quarters of the battle because once you get that figured out now you can do something um i think something that that we missed right there too um was specifically men who are miserable because of lack of community how will they know to identify that it's the lack of community or the lack of community that we feel and say our groups how are they going to know that they're missing that and that that might be the solution to their problem oh it's a great question that's what i was getting at that's the exact problem i want i wanted because that's what you mentioned once that you said i should do a video on that then then i don't know if you ever did i i i get i get 10 ideas for videos to everyone i do so and that's why i appreciate this question and answer session because you helped me pick up things that i should have picked up but perhaps haven't i think this is the so in a a the beginning of a a you recognize your misery and you look to a higher power to help you with your misery and the 12 steps of a are all it's all doing your own work and it's all hard and uncomfortable i have to do a fearless moral inventory of my defects and my past wrongs and i have to go eat crow and make up for all the past for all the past for the past things that i've done wrong when it doesn't hurt someone and and when you think about this from the perspective of a junkie or an alcoholic i mean i have so much dealings with junkies and alcoholics because they have burned through their families and this this really hearty institution that is supposed to give us you know a sandbox to get dirty and make mistakes these people have burned their families down and they are at rock bottom now they have to go back to their ex-wives and their parents and their children and say i was a drunk i screwed up your life what can i do to make it better and more more often than not the family says i don't want to see your face again ever wow that's hard okay but the last step of a is now i need to go to all of those other drunks and help them if there's one thing a drunk knows it's how hard it is to help a drunk because they have their reciprocal narrowing has gotten so bad that the door to their hell is locked from the inside which is part of the reason that addicts are some of the most difficult people to work with okay so men you have found something that works for you you have you have had a foretaste of community you have you have seen at least a glimmer of light that leads out of the misery you've been in it's your duty to take that message and take what you found to those other men who are suffering and and you and some of those men perhaps this is where these conversations get tricky some of those men well as a pastor one of the things you learn is timing is critical and jesus says don't throw pearls before swine what does that mean if i show a human being a pearl they'll say oh i can see the value of that if i show my dog a pearl my dog will sniff it and wonder can i eat it um the dog has no use for the poor pearl so when you're dealing with other men who you might look at and say they are miserable they need to come to my meetup they need to they need to they need what i've got okay good well don't just put it in their face that's like those stupid churches that cassidy was talking about they're not ready for it just come alongside be their friend wait for your moment wait for the time when everything is at a bottom and you can say you're having a tough day you know this group that i go to you might enjoy it why don't you come with me and they might come and say ah it's not my cup of tea okay no problem but um if you're right about the source of your misery and if you're on to something about the remedy of your misery you will naturally want to share it with people you love who are suffering from what you suffered from and that goes with a that goes with church that goes with a gym that you joined it goes with a magazine that you read so um it's the duty of men who have found life-giving productive community to share their community with other men now i'm going to say something about men and women that would be controversial i think women do that better and more naturally than men and so one of the things that we've seen in our meetup is we need to do projects together because as cs lewis said men build community side by side women build community face to face so um men do your slacklining do your gym work do your you know fix up some widows home um you know come rescue some dying church even if you don't believe anything of what's going on there and take some other men with you because well here's the wonderful thing about how i believe god created men to be and this is what mary was talking about with her masculine energy guess what when men are working side by side building things guess what happens women have a place to live and so i would argue that built right into who we are men and women both flourish when we work together now as society has gotten more and more complex men have to learn to do the face to face thing women are good at that's really hard for men well women sometimes have to learn the side to side thing that men are good at that's hard for them i've seen women come side to side and the whole thing breaks out in a fight because you know and all they do is talk about their misery and it's like maybe you ladies should shut up and do something together ah take your masculine wisdom and take a hike okay well you know women are going to have to to a certain degree work out the stuff for women and men are going to have to work out the stuff for men because men know what it's like to be a man better than women do and vice versa and so that's again that little nugget is something that critical theory is in touch with and it's a bit of truth there but yeah i don't know did that help answer the question yeah yeah a lot yeah so so basically you're saying that it's really hard if not impossible to identify it but it's also the duty of those who have found the institution useful to lead other suffering into the institution when the time is right right and and that's the answer to the mercenary puzzle that before we started recording cassidy had mentioned ideally people in church that have found oh they they have found everything they found salvation in their own words they found community they found grace they found truth they found all this stuff it should be natural for church people to want to go out and invite others but part of the problem is that churches have adopted methods like the spouses of alcoholics and so the spouse of the alcoholic thinks i'm going to make my husband sober by hiding his bottles well go to an al-anon meeting what are they going to tell you no that's not going to make him sober you're you're in fact enabling that and i think part of where church evangelism has gone wrong is church evangelism has become church evangel evangelicals have become co-dependence with celebrity atheists and when i look at some of those conversations it looks just like the alcoholic and the you can decide for yourself who's the alcoholic and who's the co-dependent spouse but no if if done right i i often get criticized by christians because i'm not inviting people to christ like they think i should and i say i don't do that because i think actually i don't often use these words i think actually the way you're doing it is co-dependent why don't you respect the personhood liberty and autonomy of that other person and well i think this is the biblical way you will be my witnesses jesus doesn't tell his disciples you will be my tyrants or you will be my jerks you will be my witnesses so if you want to know how to do it you look at jesus and you know jesus offended the religious authorities of his own day because they thought he didn't toe the party line and jesus says you can take your party line and you know anyway i'm a preacher i preach too much sorry about that thanks for a really good answer yeah thank you paul i'm just so fascinated by all of these topics um so i guess kind of a quick follow-up here it strikes me that a lot of what you're talking about is kind of similar to jordan peteran's self-authoring program you know this idea that you you could have what you want if you could only articulate it and then formulate kind of that vision and the plan for how you're going to move in that direction do you think is there a sense in which you know so you just touched on this this idea that you know we are witnesses of christ you know that god our faith is is known only by witnesses whether that's the witness of other christians or the witness of the holy spirit directly like there's a sense in which it's it's kind of tied up in that i i can't i can't produce the vision for someone else and that it is there a sense in in kind of in the church that we are kind of struggling to cast a kind of a new vision of the types of things that we ought to desire inside the church i don't know if that makes any sense no it makes perfect sense thoughts on that yeah um it's the role of the tree it's the role of the preacher to take the vision and put it into words that's the role of the preacher the role of the pastor is to create the community in which the vision can flourish one of the things one of the one of the surprising things and disappointing things about the jordan peterson wave from 2016 to 2019 and and part of the reason i stepped in and did what i did was here's a guy who studied alcoholism deeply he knew 12 step programs deeply and when i look at a self-authoring program i see the middle steps of i see some semblance of the middle steps of the 12 steps in that self-authoring program there's 12 rules for life there's 12 steps there's you know look at that um but what he lacked was community and so i think it's partly for that reason that when you know immediately when i started making videos all these people are saying you should start a meetup you should start a meetup and i was quite reluctant because i'm a pastor i got stuff to do and i i wanted to just talk about this stuff i didn't want to do anything and now people are like you're a man be a man do something okay so we started a meetup and i think part of the reason jordan peterson meetups in that moment flourished so effectively was because he triggered this but he didn't facilitate the you know to do a self-authoring program is wonderful you need an accountability structure around you because the stuff that you need other people who are both going to hold you accountable and encourage you that's the two sides to to actually accomplish what your vision says because most people i know can't do it on their own and you know i'll tell you you know so i'm married to a woman and she drives me crazy sometimes when you know this needs being doing this needs doing and that needs doing and it's like and leave me alone i want to be autonomous and it's like well you're married you can't be autonomous you've got responsibilities at home okay so you do those responsibilities you might not like it but you do it and the weakness with just a self-authoring program is that okay you just put out this glorious vision along the way for that vision there's a ton of stuff you're going to have to do that you don't want to do who's going to help you to do what you don't want to do well you need the right balance of a community that you have willfully voluntarily accepted and that you're whether out of pride or whatever you're not going to abandon and that's why you never see a a successful team out there without a coach and what does the coach do the coach encourages and the coach chastises and that's how championship teams are made jordan peterson gave people a vision but he didn't give him a team and i knew that and so we got to help build some teams here that's what we're doing okay awesome i think we're ready to move on to the next topic so this question came from jacob originally i i paraphrased it a bit to get it more focused but jacob asks hakea sofia was recently turned into a mosque which has a strong emotional impact on people of faith this was a result of various people trying to liberate these structures and others are trying to liberate it back is fighting for these buildings important or signaling of a lack of faith should we be proud of these or signaling of a lack of faith should we be praying for the restoration of the temple or other sanctuaries what about less spiritual more worldly efforts what role do and should physical sanctuaries play in our spiritual life i personally find it a bit worrying that people are more concerned about space that is being desecrated by misguided fate than the hearts which are being just desecrated by misguided faith at the same time what is the balance of not live by bread alone yeah that's a great question i i think the hakea sofia is an interesting is an interesting illustration because i i did an interview with a guy who's been interviewing peugeot and vervecky and a whole bunch of people that we've known and he's in toronto and he's a filmmaker and he made that made that film with vervecky and peugeot and some others and he's working on some more films i did an interview with him yesterday and you know i i basically i have to get back to my vervecky paper at some point but i basically rolled out for him the the secret second sister thesis of secularism in the church so in that so via tom holland i made the point that in many ways secularism is a secret second sister of the church that when the first sister is rejected the second sister conquers and so the conversion so the hakea sofia went from a church to a mosque to a museum and now potentially back to a mosque now buildings i think are let's say these as works of our hands in some ways they're sort of analogous to sauron's ring what was sauron doing when he made the ring and this is tolkien's mythology of course he he sauron made the ring in order to make himself more powerful so what he did did was he distilled huge parts of himself into that ring and so that ring both became an expression of him and in a sense if we translate this into buildings and a space to colonize others in a conversation between a friend of mine and an orthodox priest in sacramento so my friend planted his church back in the seeker days and his church has gotten quite a bit more liturgical and sacramental since then he was talking to this orthodox priest friend of his and the orthodox priest send a friend of his said well we're not really evangelizing yet because we haven't built our cathedral or built our monastery yet and to a protestant hears that and thinks huh because for protestants you build a building in order to house the body of believers which are the people that's a very protestant perspective an orthodox perspective understands that in many ways the cathedral is and a product of the body of believers but the building itself possesses the spirit of the church let me say it that way this gets into my school spirit thesis and and so what that building does is is sort of and i don't mean it this pejoratively but just kind of the dynamic that sauron's ring has what that building does is enhances the power of the body of believers that is the people themselves and so that it's it's sort of like an amplifier a sound amplifier you put a mic and an amp and the voice is louder and more people can be reached now with all of these amplifications there are always signal to noise issues and so in that sense if things are on well in the organic body of believers that is the communion of the saints and the people the dynamics between the the temple that they build or the cathedral that they build or the mosque that they build and the people will be out of will be out of sync and i think this is what we see especially strongly in the book of ezekiel where temple the temple of the lord and the people of the lord are supposed to themselves be in perfect harmony and the temple expresses well this gets even more complex and because the temple is a is in a sense an embassy and a copy of the temple that is above the firmament and and in many ways genesis one is a temple text and genesis two is the garden text that's the paradise the walled garden outside the temple you know jonathan peugeot's new image that he's constructing has so many of those elements in it so when the people and the building are out of sync the the building in a sense starts to prophesy against the people and what people will often do then is change the building and so that's what we've seen in hagiya sofia in its long history from church to mosque to museum and now with resurgent islam and with the with the in a sense what we're seeing is perhaps the the the death of the second sister of the church which is secularism her weaknesses have been exposed now converting back to a mosque yeah it makes sense and so who's going to speak up no keep it a museum well secular and secularish people are probably going to say that because what they're doing is they're advocating for their religion so so physical sanctuaries in our spiritual life have an important an important role now in plain low church protestantism see you can't build things and not express so the plain meeting house of low church protestants express something in that they are sort of saying you know what's the difference between a painting and a mirror if if if someone paints a portrait of you and you keep it in your home and you look at the portrait there's something going on between you and that portrait because there's a distance between you but the portrait itself is an enhancement of you now protestant plane houses are more mirrors or glass walls because they're trying to say don't look at the building look at the people because there's the body of christ and it's interesting the little i know of of of rabbinic scholarship and islamic theology each of them have a sense of this same priesthood of believers that the church is not a building the church is not a steeple the church is not a resting place just that little song has so much built into it the church is the people now the church should be the people which is a resting place the people themselves should be that resting place and you know we get this when jesus says you shall be my witnesses so the people are always at the heart of the cathedral but the cathedral or the temple or the mosque is sort of like sauron's ring not in a negative sense but they have poured something of who they are into it and it has become an amplification device so now if someone walks into a plain protestant building they what do i know about this people not a lot until the people sort of come into the place but if someone comes into a cathedral while the spirit of those the spirit of the church itself of the people that built that cathedral lingers on in that cathedral and as we've seen in europe and in the hagiya sofia that's a powerful testimony and so the orthodox have a point when they build a cathedral they say this is bearing witness to the great cloud of witnesses and it's right here in brick and stone and in and in paintings and artwork and there it is and the protestants look at that and say i want to be careful with that because unless the physical community of christ inside is in harmony with the cathedral on the outside and usually that harmony is is is closest when it's built then suddenly the walls of the cathedral the stones of the temple cry out against the purported shopkeepers and and maintainers of the building itself so you know this is a that's a great question and it's a very cool dynamic that i've never really explored and this is again why i love these questions because you bring me into places that i don't go myself so thank you jacob and um any any comeback on that jacob any yeah buts in this um no i you actually just reminded me um that in judaism um you can't have prayer services until there are 10 people there it doesn't matter if you're in a sanctuary um there has to be 10 well in orthodoxy 10 men there or it's it's still not it's not a place to do worship thank you thank you no that's good and and again to me what's the value to me bridges of meaning is an example of an estuary and so here we have jacob and those of you outside the the the s outside this particular estuary that is bridges of meaning don't know jacob but um i his his story is published on the discord server but that i did with him but you know so he's a he's a you know he's a jew and i don't mean just a a biological jew he's a believing jew and so he's in the estuary and that's really cool and when i talked to jacob i learned and you know i to have an estuary where dutch calvinists can swim with jews and can swim with atheists and where the the brackish water is such that um yeah maybe we're both a little bit in stress from the presence of salt or lack of salt and but but what's happening here is so productive so i i praise god for you uh jacob and um i i'm really grateful that you've you've you've become a a fixture of this estuary now you're gonna make me cry okay um i'm gonna go to our next question which is from gomer day who's uh here but not able to read it so they've asked me to read it um question for pastor paul you recently have lost someone you loved i lost my godmother this week and was wondering what do you do in order for you to get back to life i don't know if this information helps but i was the one who discovered her body and called and reported it to the police thank you for your time um i think first of all it's important our materialism does us a disservice here because gomer day you are a story that is you are an embodied story you know that that's that's the nephesh that you are that's the hebrew word and your what did he say his grandmother godmother godmother okay that's a it's an especially good example your godmother well she's not necessarily usually godmothers are chosen outside the biological family inside the church family your godmother is part of that story so when that nephesh that was your godmother died she took part of she took that that that story making power that each of us have in our flesh and our physicality and our words and our presence here in this physical larger physical world that is an estuary here in this that went away so part of your story part of the potentiality of your story died with her that's you know and i i felt this so you know obviously when my sister died i had been thinking about i've been thinking for years about how we are story before the jordan peterson thing that's probably part of the reason i was drawn to these conversations and so you know part of me thought it what a strange thing that my sister who lived on the other side of the continent who for the last number of years you know we didn't call much we didn't talk much when i'd go out there we'd see each other but we were quite close when we were younger because we were closer in age than myself and my older sister but we haven't and we're quite close in college we were in college together we haven't been that close for a number of years but when my sister died part of me died with her cs lewis made that comment with his friends the inklings and charles williams died earlier than some of the other inklings owen barfield lived a long long time well into the 90s but but lewis made the observation that when when charles williams died something in the community of their group died too we have this philosophy that has been hegemonic for the last couple of hundred years that we are just simply biological creatures and it's amazing that such a philosophy was able to spawn psychology which notes that so much of us is not physical so when you have a loss like this take your time we you know in in past centuries we have lost so much wisdom in modernity in past centuries if a a wife were to lose her husband she would wear black for a year now that could be a little tyrannical but but there is also something to that where when someone saw this widow wearing black they paused because one of the common things i hear from people when they grieve is my my world was just torn apart and when i look around me the rest of the world is going on like business as usual but it's not business as usual for me it can't be and when there was when there was via clothing or men would often wear a black armband when there was via clothing a an expression a signal to everyone around you that was commonly understood that there's a rupture in the fabric of shalom people would stop and say i'm sorry for your loss would you like can i sit with you can i pray with you can i bring you some food because right now you don't feel like cooking because there's something celebrative in the process of cooking because you're making glory when you cook if you're doing it well and you don't want to make glory because part of you has been ripped away by death and and we signaled to each other and so in small ways communities grieved with each other and marked that loss and that was right and we don't do that today and in fact today what we do is well okay someone dies so well let's let's get the funeral or the service or whatever together and let's try and get that done within a week a couple of days or a week of two and let's get them in the ground and then well they're they're not back to normal yet well well let's get them to a grief group so they can get back to normal as quick as possible or maybe send them to a shrink so they can get back to normal as quick as possible you know my brother-in-law my brother-in-law lost a wife that he dearly loved and those two were you know every relationship is different but there are a wonderful pair and because of my sister that family worked not perfectly no family is perfect but the family worked and my nieces and nephew you know they were they were working they were going it was it was and then when my sister by death was ripped out of that system and then my brother-in-law lost his wife and he's going to work and he's you know he's he's paying the bills and he's going to church and you know he's he's he's and now he's trying to be father and mother to my my nieces and my nephew and they're in college or just graduated from college they're young adults getting out into the world and he's doing his best and you know the the people they had good friends around them and they're coming around to help but you know if you look at my brother-in-law and we as a family notice this we say oh he's you know you know we want him we want him to bounce out of this and do well but part of us doesn't because parts of us knows if that happens well what did that mean about about lori and the truth is he's not as bubbly he's not as happy and you know and then sometimes people paul do something about my brother-in-law and so i'll i'll approach him and i'll message him or something and and basically basically i'll tell him i'll say you know take your time if if if if you were to walk down a street and a figure in a dark robe with a sigh came and with that sigh didn't chop off your head but took a gouge out of your back three days later and people saw it was still bandaged and you were still sore and you couldn't quite get back to work people would say wouldn't say what's wrong with him no this this guy with the sigh just took a took took a pound of flesh out of his back give him some time to heal he might need some professional help he he you know he's going to need some time to get on his feet now at some point the wound does need to heal because the the loss can't be allowed to to to to take your life completely but it's going to take time you might need some help you definitely need a community around you and by god's grace as is often the case if you're in a coherent a healthy or somewhat healthy family there are others around you who are grieving too and so you can find community in the grief and it's a strange thing that um unlike the the pound of flesh that the grim reaper with the sigh or the sickle took out of you the presence of the other wounded among you brings healing to each other and so and so yeah i i lament the fact that we as a society are no longer as cohesive so that people don't have permission to mourn publicly longer than they used to have and you know some of these traditions were a little arbitrary so the woman wears black for a year it's a it's a degree better than in india before the british where the the woman throws herself on the funeral pyre of the husband i'm not advocating that although i have been at funerals where i've seen children of deceased fathers throw themselves on the casket um and and and and in a sense want to their father in the grave you know that shows how we are not just these biological creatures discreetly separated by sacks of skin we are also spiritual and what does that mean we are embodied stories and we are one to another and um and and and so when the grim reaper has come and taken a few pounds of your flesh maybe all of us should say okay maybe he needs a meal maybe he needs some company maybe we we let him some slack and when he's together with us he's not as bubbly and effervescent as he used to be and we'll worry about him that's part of our concern but we'll not rush him necessarily now there are limits to this and just like there are limits to many things and professional help might be needed if the grim reaper with his sigh has taken too much flesh but um that's the process so gomer day i'm sorry for your loss and um thank you for sharing that loss with us because again in this disconnected cyber community we won't necessarily see it and uh thank you for asking the question because i know that there are many some here and some who will listen to this recording that um we as a society we've gotten so smart in technology and so stupid with people so often um grief is real people need time community is real i think we have one last time for one last question and maybe i'll give a little summary sorry for all the questions we couldn't get to we're probably going to have to figure out a way you know all of these questions and answers are ways of trying to trying to balance availability in an open internet realm so you know repost your questions or maybe well again i like joey's idea of upvoting questions even though we need place for fringe and place for center upvote sort of expresses center uh low vote ones express fringe um and maybe in other weeks when you know if i keep doing this every week you know maybe i'll exhaust the questions at some point so if your question didn't get answered come back again next week or at least post it in there and if others come into there and you see a question that someone has posted previously that you really like go ahead and upvote it and maybe next week we'll continue to improve our process here all right the only question i'm still holding on to is a longer one so i'd rather give uh give some time to the chat and see if anyone here has questions that are uh preferably shorter in nature perfect how would you translate isaiah 53 didn't you hear what joey said oh isaiah 53 it's a short question yeah it's a short question but it's a long answer and one that requires no i can't i can't i'm not even going to try and answer that question right here right now another one another how about a question with an answer that that even i might be able to answer in less than five minutes all right well if we've got nothing then i'm going to suggest that we uh wrap this one up now and kind of go to a post chat okay i'll just again say that um i thought we had a good and this is this is for the recording and we can have some post chat after um because i do stop the recording and we usually talk a little bit more then but um estuary and living stones online is very much church oriented and so some of you might notice that i see two sides of paul sometimes there's there's the side of paul that is the pastor paul and then there's the side of paul that is the estuary paul and um yeah estuary and living stones online are are going to be two different things um some people especially in terms of financial support some people want to give to living stones online and so giving to living stones church is absolutely appropriate some people don't want to give to living stones church and if you want to support me patreon is still there um but by supporting living stones church you also do support me because in many ways my mission and estuary is is also coming out of living stones but um i haven't figured out structures yet estuary especially is a very chaotic living dynamic thing and that'll take more time to figure that out living stones online is easier for me to figure out because i know church and there are established structures and i am working on all of the software and hopefully many of you sent in emails to say i'd like to participate i am i'm having someone go through them right now and incorporating you into the database of living stones online there'll be special emails for people who are participants or partners of living stones online and there'll be special video content on the living stones crc church channel which is separate from my channel and so living stones online though is going to be very churchy and that's because it's church estuary is not going to be churchy because it's not church but i think churches have an interest in estuary but churches themselves cannot dominate or control estuary estuary needs to be that open productive space where the water from the river meets the water from the sea and tides flow in and out and floods flow in and out and giant squid come in from the sea and kayakers flow out into the ocean and lots of chaotic fun things happen that none of us can control because in many in many in many examples human control destroys estuaries because they're too mysterious they're too complex they're too productive for us to know and so speaking as a christian i trust i trust the creator god of the world to to do right by it so that's oh god i'd like to button for a quick second if any of you are using tithely to give as paul recommended uh like you said paul there is an option to have you yourself cover the cost so that living stones gets the full amount uh that control um is hidden need to scroll down a bit in that in that form otherwise it won't show you can still fill in your credit card information and click the big shiny donate button but uh yeah that little checkbox is cleverly hidden out of view so yeah he's right it's it's a it's quite a good platform but i would like that checkbox to be a little bit more visible but hey whether whether the so also in terms of patreon versus tithely now of course ty patreon comes to me tithely goes to the church and so that's one thing to know patreon takes out a bigger chunk than tithely tithely is very economical so it's tithely is like three percent patreon's more like 10 so that's one of the differences too so thank you all i will joey you want to say something i would like to yeah before we stop recording i'd like to on behalf of all of us from bridges of meaning i'd like to just send a quick thank you to to all the folks at at living stones the in-person church both past and present without them giving us the opportunity and being generous with paul's time literally none of this would exist so thank you again for for all them and for all those who have have built living stones and made it what it is today thank you joey all right i will end recording
