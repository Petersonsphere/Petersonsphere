 listening to this on my channel you're missing out because right now Friday morning at 10 a.m. there are a group of really cool people gathered at the bridges of meaning discord server and it's certainly forgivable to not know what a discord server is or how to operate in one because it's kind of a nerdy thing that gamers use and the bridges of meaning discord server has become an online community of a lot of estuary like stuff and conversation and people and all that kind of stuff and so we are recording might not see the light of day because I I sometimes I listen to the recording or I just remember the recording say I don't want to post it so then I don't post it but most of the time I do and Rick just left the chair Rick is our studio engineer for these meetings and when he leaves the chair across the building I know he's gonna come here because he wants me to fix something and I don't want that but anyway we have we come here for conversations and we do questions and answers that's sort of how we went but I've sort of exhausted people's desires to know things and so now we do conversations and that's what we're gonna do this morning so I'm gonna start with some questions and answers and if you're in the room a lot of people in the talk chat room the voice chat room are working we've learned that and so they pretty much listen to us as if we're bad a.m. radio and we'll talk but if you're able to talk and if you have a question to ask live that's always cool because then I can ask you follow-up questions and when I give you what's on my mind you can say Paul you're full of crap I hate your channel and you'll never see me again and that happens sometimes but that's okay too because people are that are like that so the first question this morning comes from yes and knows yes and NOS E in parentheses Matthew who are your favorite parentheses early Church Fathers and why now this is a liability of being a Protestant and of having my channel grown to one degree or another thanks to Jonathan Peugeot I unlike Peugeot am NOT a Church Fathers nerd nor especially an early Church Fathers nerd so if you ask me my favorite Church Father I'm gonna take the the weenie Protestant answer and say Augustine partly because he's probably the only Church Father that I know anything significant about I always think origin is kind of cool and origins if I recall correctly origin emasculated himself because he really wanted to get his hormonal desires under control and whereas I don't think that is a good idea props to the dude for sincerity and determination or origin also had some really interesting ideas about Genesis and symbolism and so origin origin was kind of a cool guy I also want to give some props to Jerome because it's a really gutsy thing that he did and a really astounding thing that he did in terms of biblical translation into the Vulgate and about most of the stuff I know about Jerome I know from reading the book that I didn't read too long ago now it's a it's a book about Erasmus and Luther and they had a good passage on Jerome in that and I found Jerome to be a really interesting and fascinating person so but I am not a Church Fathers nerd and partly that comes from being a Protestant Church Fathers is something I want to know more about but my problem is I want to know more about just about everything and so I learn things in a really ADHD way right now I'm in Will Durant's volume 10 the story of civilization and I'm learning about Rousseau and that's fascinating he was an interesting dude so I was curious if you had thoughts about how to elaborate on God number one and God number two in regard to the Trinity or what could be a good starting point for that direction if that's even possible now the God number one God number two thing is really a duality so partly when I say God number one and God number two people jump in and say what about number three and if I say God number one number two number three suddenly they would really map it onto the Trinity and when I talk about God number one and God number two it doesn't really have much to do with the Trinity in terms of mapping on to it because God number one and God number two really have more to do with a bunch of bunch of enduring durable dualities that that tend to map on to a whole bunch of things such as heaven and earth such as mind and body such as transcendent and imminent and that's and so and what God number one and God number two really tries to get at is what happened in both the history of church theology and Western culture with respect to the assumptions of what we're talking about when we use the word God if you only believe in God number one you're sort of a pantheist if you're only believe in God number two you might be a pagan or you might be a hardcore dualist because God number two is sort of the the personal agency thing and you know my God number one God number two stuff has that's that's basically sort of a framework that I've continued to to use to try to explore really to do theology which is talking about what what do we mean when we use this word God and so that that duality that was exposed in the Vancouver one conversation between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris I keep pointing back to that conversation if you want to track God number one and God number two because both of them lay it out perfectly not perfectly but we're quite good Peterson lays out all of this God is imminent stuff and God is through history stuff when he is given an a giving an accounting of what he means by God then Sam Harris is all upset by this is like you can't you can't define God that way because God is and then Sam Harris gives this description of God that Sam Harris is basically picked up by watching Christians and and so then that when I listen to Jordan Peterson's definition of God I recognized it in Christian theology and I recognize Sam Harris's definition of God in Christian practice and because my tradition really emphasizes the Protestant Reformation and Calvinism in Calvin's time was quite a bit more nuanced and in touch with church fathers and some of that even though like I said I don't know church fathers I get some of that and so then when I talked to Brett about well God is not in the system and that that turned on lights for me and so the God number one God number two thing are really sort of two boxes that I'm using on my theological workstation to continue to explore a number of these durable dualities and and to try to to recalibrate and correct my own theology being better informed by the history of the church not just Protestant theology but church theology because Protestants magisterial Protestants let's call them such as such as Calvin and Luther they embraced church councils and I know you know if we talk to Sam Sam might kick up a little dust at that but the for the most part the reform the reformers even though as I think Brett Sackle makes pretty clear in his book the church formers the church reformers weren't really understanding Aquinas and some of there's a lot of misunderstanding going on they were reading church fathers and they were trying to maintain in their own time period theological orthodoxy with respect to those church fathers now reformers just like everybody else get a lot of things wrong and so since the time of the Reformation we're getting a lot of things wrong and to the degree that we get tribal between let's say Protestants and Catholics and Orthodox that tribalism can create sort of a distortion field but I think if we're Christians first or you know C.S. Lewis merely Christians we have to live inside of a room but if we're Christians first we should be able to critique not only the other tribes with which we have some disagreements but we should be able to critique our own tribe which means that Protestants can look at the Reformation and say okay well I'm in that tribe but the Protestant Reformation caused some damage that probably isn't God honoring so maybe we should take a look at things and I think that sort of practice is hopeful in pursuing the unity of the church so my God number one and God number two are sort of working boxes on my theological workbench and it's completely understandable that people would you know listen to my various references of them and say oh that's kind of nuanced and that kind of doesn't map on these other things and I'd say yeah because they're work boxes on my theological workbench and so that's part of the reason and then people are also sometimes in the comment section wanting me to rename them I don't want to rename them because once I call that eminence and transcendence or theology from below versus theology from above or emanation versus emergence then suddenly I'm mapping them too strongly on to particular dualities many of which I sort of want to incorporate and continue to work on on my workbench as hopefully I refine and grow in my own theological knowledge you know my whole YouTube channel has been you know I have my rough draft for Sundays on my channel but my whole YouTube channel has been one big rough draft and when I wrote this chapter for Vervecky and Christopher Mastropietro you know the thing that I ran head-on into is this is this flaw or immaturity in myself where I find it really hard to finish anything because I always feel myself so in process and I wake up tomorrow and I think that my idea tomorrow is slightly better than my idea yesterday and so I want to correct it and so I'm a little hesitant to sort of put stuff on paper that isn't a rough draft so my YouTube videos are all very rough intentionally and my Sunday sermons have to be a little less rough but just by virtue of what they are and that's in some ways why my Sunday sermons are a little less creative than what I do on my channel and why what I do on my channel is way more estuary like because I want a broader group of people to inform me and critique me and say unkind things about me and that tends to happen more in an estuary than it will in a church channel where I have status and there's a hierarchy and there are rules and all of those things and so the the defined spaceness of a walled garden is helpful for some things and the openness of an estuary is helpful for other things so yeah that's so there's my answer about Church Fathers okay next question JKH and then Joey tried to sort of help you edit I think I saw you in the room before do you want to sort of land the plane on your question if you're here and what exactly you'd like to ask otherwise I'll try my best at looking at your questions I don't see him okay I think Jesus was referring I'm oh at Job oh so this was so Joe was this in a conversation with you are you still there I have no idea what's being referred to okay if you look at questions for PVK jh k so first he was responding to you I don't know if he missed and later he says oops I've meant this to be in the general channel so he might have just simply misplaced it yeah I think this was trying to answer my question to you so okay do you have any follow-ups on now we had yet we've had a week to mull it do you have any follow-ups on the sheep and the goats question or anything that's come up since then for you from it I think I got distracted by something shiny I'm trying to figure out I used to have this idea that God number one was just way more strict and punishing than God number two in the form of Jesus but the more you read about Jesus he's pretty strict in his ways so you know you know you have it written down that you know don't don't lust after somebody else's woman but I'm saying if even if you look at somebody on the street you've already basically you know doomed yourself so combining that with with those parables around distinction and coming too late and not being invited somewhere I don't know it just made me wonder what the overall story of that was but I think you mostly dealt with that in the last Q&A so I don't think I have any any feedback on that I I find it difficult to reconcile those particular parables with ideas of universalism and to which degree that the the being cast into the fire has connects to the ideas of purgatory as used in Catholicism. That's right and that's part of the reason I'm not a universalist because well this is Jesus saying this stuff but you just as as you noticed I mean again this is God number one and God number two people map that on a lot of things so yeah God number one is the Old Testament God number two is the is Jesus and there's something to that in the boxes because you know the Old Testament you really get the idea of the the arenic aspect of God but but then if you read the Old Testament closely take a look at the character of God as expressed in the story of Cain and Abel where you know Cain just so Cain and Abel are out sacrificing and Cain in his insecurity looks around and says I think I think God likes Abel better and Cain lets this in his heart and God says hey Cain what's up with you well you didn't like my sacrifice well maybe if you do what's right things will be a little better and be careful because sin is crouching at your door and it it's lusting after you it desires you so watch your step and Cain of course does nothing with that admonition and continues to nurture his resentment in his heart and nurturing becomes probably a lot of fantasies about killing his brother and that hatches into a plan and he says hey Abel meet me out in the field so Abel goes along of course Cain's the older brother and Cain kills Abel and then that's that story I mean Peterson is dead on right in terms of pointing out that story and just looking at the absolute amazing quality of that story and then suddenly Cain and you can here's the thing there's so little in the story but but because the story is so deep and true we so it's so fruitful in terms of how we can flesh it out and so then and then Cain is like oh crap I killed my brother what am I gonna do and and then and then you have in then the earth in a sense is now crying out against Cain because the fabric of reality has been ripped and think about this in terms of a simulation argument you know the the base programming of the environment has been ripped by this action Cain has done so God comes to Cain you know very number two ness and says where's your brother and Cain of course lays out the the great line am I my brother's keeper and and then of course you know and again if you had just read Genesis 3 where who told you you were naked God comes in with these killer questions that just dig right to the heart of it and then and then Cain is like everybody's gonna want to kill me and God could have said yeah darn well deserve it you killed your brother you murderer I mean think about Gollum talking to himself and and and then and then God says okay Cain I'm gonna put a mark on it my punishments too great for me okay Cain I can't look at that Rick always puts the chat up there and I see these memes just get my attention okay Cain I'll tell you what I'll you know I'll put a mark on you so nobody will touch you what on earth does that mean and then Cain goes on to you know have a son build a city names it after a son and okay so the Old Testament God is tyrannical and unforgiving and and judgmental read about read about God in Genesis 3 and it's astoundingly nuanced and I think the problem that we have is that we can't square we can't square in our minds contradictory things such as God must demand justice and so you see that now I mean 10-15 years ago you know people are you know let let you be you you know it was just sort of the kingdom of nice and now with a little bit of wokeness it's like no racism is real punch a Nazi okay you've got to somehow square mercy and justice and they have to live in the same universe and so what we see from from the Lord in the Old Testament and from Jesus in the new is on one hand a justice deeper and more serious than then makes us comfortable and we're terrified by it and you get that picture in some of Jesus parable but then also at the same time a mercy deeper and more powerful than we think is responsible and you get that when Jesus goes to the the party held by a Pharisee and they refuse to extend hospitality to him and the sinful woman from the village comes and lets down her hair scandal and wipes you know washes his feet with her tears and dries them with her hair scandal and so on one hand Jesus is we look at Jesus and we say he's too judgmental and we look at Jesus and we say he's too merciful he's too full of grace well if you look at if you look at God in the Old Testament and you read the book carefully you'll see both of those there too and so that's where the mapping of God number one God number two he sort of fits and though you can you can work those boxes with some of those dualities and if you work those boxes you can achieve some wisdom and gain some insight but the boxes don't really map on to it and it's the same way with these low-resolution blanket condemnations that the God of the Old Testament is fierce and brutal and harsh and Jesus is so kind and loving well Jesus really is kind and loving but it's it's the low resolution projecting selection aspects you're doing to Jesus and to the God of the Old Testament that are that are feeding your feeding your conclusions about these things so that's that's how I see those dynamics but Job your observations about yeah you know people say oh Jesus is kind and loving and then you read a few things like oh yeah he really is then you read more things you say hey wait a minute but look at what he says in the Sermon on the Mount look at look at what he says in these parables so yeah your your observations Job are are very real and very common I don't know if you have any comebacks from that Job or anything you want to add not really no can't say yeah nope okay anybody else in the anybody else in the voice chat I want to throw something on top what I just said I do okay um you were talking about mercy and justice and previously you're asking Job if he had anything to expand on his idea of sheep and goats and I think that those things are integral to one another right I recently watched a pageau video the right and the left hand and of course the sheep and the goats plays into that and symbolically the right and the left hand don't always mean the same thing which I found very interesting and it and it maps on to Jesus's demeanor right being very loving and yet also being very just and kind I mean Justin and strict let's say so anyway those were just a couple of you know I just love how all these things are actually interwoven with one another they're not separate yeah and Caden able to write like it they represent those two things mercy and justice yep yep yeah yeah it's really cool isn't it and that's that's the that to me is an example of the artistry that we see in in the Bible in that that develops out of this stuff no that's really true all right hey Paul yeah go ahead real quick I was just thinking about being a father and how when you're a father how hard is to discipline your children even though you know you're doing the right thing because you have so much love for them and so I that really speaks to me when you're a young child you just think your parents don't like you or why are they doing this to me you don't really understand until you're a parent yourself and that really that kind of the the I think you use the terminology that infinitely just but infinitely I can't remember what the opposite was but we don't even as humans have the ability to understand that but I think that there's so there's a lot of young people in the forum and once you have kids in the father were the father imagery and all of that stuff really starts to hit home when it was something that you understood but until you live it you really don't understand it as much so true in Spanish they have saber and conocer and saber is sort of this propositional knowledge that okay there's that but conal said is sort of this deeper knowledge of lived experience that and that's part of the the blessings of as you get older is that the more experience you have if if you don't if you guard your heart and don't sort of fall into certain certain traps like bitterness and anger and and some of these things that will rob your life long term yeah have kids you know part of the blessing of children is that your children will teach you a ton and they will teach you how to parent them and yeah it's a it's a when I see people not having kids some people shouldn't have kids but it's a tremendous blessing and it really is so thanks Jack all right on to the next question now that we're in October did you talk a bit about Halloween and what it says about our culture and values especially from the point of view of parents should we encourage or discourage our children from participating in Halloween traditions activities etc let me say first of all I am by no means an expert on Halloween I think if you knock on Jonathan Peugeot's door with all of that symbolism and stuff he'll he'll he knows way way more about it than I ever will so again you know Peugeot has been a super helpful person for me as parents you there are different ways and different strategies of parenting and there are upsides and downsides to both of those strategies and and one way one strategy is to put up high walls to not let your children participate in things that are going on around them now all high walls are themselves expressions of value and will have their own upsides and downsides my as a parent my and our and my wife and I you know we would have some of these things because everyone comes into parenting with a with a rough draft that they're not even aware of because it was built into them from their own childhood from the decisions that their parents made either in agreement with them or pushing back from them so Halloween like many things like Christmas or Easter or Valentine's Day is both a historic Christian feast day and now has been morphed by our consumer society into a very American cultural holiday okay and I think I think Halloween is now second to Christmas I might be wrong in terms of its consumer the amount of the amount of commercial activity that's going on around it and whereas the American cultural holiday will have elements will have it's let's we'll say it this way it's downstream from the Roman Catholic All Hallows Eve and All Saints Day Reformation Day is right in there there are so there are going to be some continuities some dissimilarities many of these traditional feast days that were in Western Europe and the Roman Catholic Church also have our downstream from pagan holidays even before them one of the things that missionaries and priests and clergy and the church did was to adapt and adopt to either try to colonize or co-opt or disrupt or reform or purify some of these practices that were deep in deep within cultural communities to Christianize them in some ways sometimes these efforts bore good fruit sometimes these efforts bore less good fruit many people have noted that Christmas trees are not an especially Christian tradition but have roots in other European groups and I myself don't have a problem with a Christmas tree I think it's kind of a nice decoration and so there are there's a lot going on with these things and as parents you have to exert wisdom and I think part of what you do as parents is similar to what priests and missionaries did is I would recommend that you try to colonize some of these things now if we take it another layer deeper into the psychological layer there are some very deep patterns we can call them archetypes we can call them patterns that get expressed in these things and so it's not unusual I don't think it's unreasonable that in a culture like ours which is so which pushes nice so far up the hierarchy that we have a certain amount of compensating desire to look at the grotesque and again I I'm sure Jonathan Peugeot has or will put out videos about this and they will be full of wisdom and information and insight and so I again really point you to him now as parents you you always have to make negotiations and compromises with the other powerful factors in your children's lives when your when your child as your child grows your child naturally has to in increasing measure interact with a far broader world than the little house that you can control so when your child is two or three you'll have a great amount of say over your child as your child becomes five or six and even if you're homeschooling even if you're carefully controlling the books and media diet of your children there's plenty of stuff out there that is all downstream of all the kinds of things you're doing and even parents that really try to be highly restrictive there will be unintended consequences from the kinds of media choices that the parents make and even the kind the level of restrictiveness that the parents employ some children of highly restrictive parents go on to be sort of the same way some children of highly restrictive parents go on and push against it and sort of go over to the other way so so parents have to make choices with wisdom about what they are going to allow or not allow their children to do and parents will get a lot of things wrong so work in community with others work in community with your local church or religious community and and and make some trade-offs and choices and I think that's probably the best advice I can give to figure out now some churches have and we've done a couple of these at Living Stones Harvest Festivals and in some ways Harvest Festival sort of gets at some of what's beneath Halloween too and you can bob for apples and have candy and because your little your little kids they're not taking in all of this deep stuff they're looking at the candy and the games and the fun so sort of what my parents did with us growing up and what my wife and I did with my children growing up is we tried to include some of that fun but not but not just kind of open up the door completely so we do a little bit of trick or treating often at houses of friends we might have a little party and so we my wife and I homeschooled our children and like I mentioned a little earlier we had a little neighborhood group of families and so not we were the only church going family of that group the other three families were not so obviously there were compromises in there but for the most part these were wonderful families and good parents and so we would hold sort of little neighborhood parties and the kids could enjoy their friends and have some of that fun that you know what kid isn't going to be colonized by candy and games and so we could do some of that and we didn't have to open up all kinds of other things and so use your best judgment in continuity with your religious community understand that your there are other powerful forces that are at play in your children's lives and I would say with some craftiness colonize them and you know because if you're just if you're just the no parent well at some point your child is going to be outside of those strong walls and if you've never given your child and and demonstrated for your child a capacity to engage with nuance and productivity with a complex culture around them so you can say well maybe these kinds of costumes are appropriate and maybe these kinds of costumes are a little inappropriate and that might be because they're salacious or grotesque or inappropriate in other ways and so teach your children some cultural discernment and actually because cultural discernment again is at a far deeper level than we can usually consciously process model cultural discernment for your children make some compromises and and engage a community around you to practice cultural discernment as a community and that cultural discernment that you practice will likely wind up being the implicit rough draft that your children bring into parenting so that would be would I think be my best take on that question any any comments from the from those of you who can talk in the voice channel about my answer or anything you want to add to it? Well Tyler has a good question in the chat. Tyler, sorry I volunteered you. Oh no that's okay. I just wanted to ask some of the the audience not just Paul. So I have a just what is the what is the argument against celebrating Halloween? Like I can see the concerns about you know the costumes in terms of like more for like in college it's a very sexualized holiday with the costumes and the partying but that's kind of just goes I think hand in hand with where the partying is happening not so much a product of the holiday itself and then is that the sort of rampant consumerism and commercialization of what used to be a holy day because you know if you if you start poking holes there you're going to have to pretty quickly you know turn the calendar and start looking at Christmas pretty hard and so I'm just curious where where the if it was a traditional you know going back all the way before the medieval era where this was a celebration then what is the contemporary objection to celebrating it? There are many and most of those objections reflect the peculiar usually the peculiar issues of those communities. It could be the consumerism, it could be the kind of the salacious sexual party spirit. Sometimes it's Christians who have been sort of swamped by the culture of nice in America. One of the things that I picked up in both Charles Taylor's secular age but is also I've learned a ton from Jonathan Pageot is that in especially these pre-enlightenment, pre-reformational traditional communities they had a degree of balance in the menu of holy days and feast days that sort of afforded a stable expression of they were really nuanced and adept at managing human society and community in a way that our modern societies are not. And again I've learned a ton of from Pageot about this and so you know death is a part of what we human beings have to deal with as is the grotesque, as is the demonic, as is on and on and on and on. And so traditional societies had deep wisdom and some deep health that in as is usual the case in efforts to reform and improve were sometimes jettisoned. And so I think part of the current attraction to sacramental and liturgical traditions like the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic I think is a compensatory attempt to address some of what's been lost in the desire to reform. And so modernist Christians aren't terribly good at this. And so you know for example Harry Potter when Harry Potter came out Harry Potter is perhaps of the major Hollywood franchises the most Halloween centric because of course Hogwarts is spooky, there's witches, there's magic, there's all these things. Christians very quickly sort of jumped on this bandwagon that magic is wrong. Well yeah sorcery is outlawed in the Old Testament and but they had a rather facile shallow understanding of what literature and fantasy is. And so they sort of attacked it and it's some of that shallowness I think that is behind a lot of well-meaning Christian discomfort with Halloween. And you can pull verses out of the New Testament and I've seen this done, you know whatever is good, whatever is faithful and say what is good about dressing up like a monster. Oh okay fair enough. So maybe you're going to push your kid away from some of the from certain Halloween costume choices and what kinds of archetypes is the child expressing when he wants to dress up as Iron Man or Prince Charming and you know the same on the girl side of things. So a lot of American evangelical critiques of things I tend to find rather flat-footed and facile and shallow and that's where you know Roman Catholic communities sometimes have access and magisterial Protestant communities like my own sometimes have have deeper wisdom in terms of saying okay here's Halloween let's deal with it. You can do the same thing with St. Valentine's Day, you can do the same thing with Christmas and Easter. I'm you know New Year's is itself a rather interesting holiday because in many ways it's more pagan but even in the Christian Reformed Church Order there's this sort of recommendation that churches hold old years and new year services and more strictly speaking Advent is really the beginning of the Christian New Year but the reformers were pushing back. You had a lot of political cultural things going on in the 16th and 17th and 18th century in terms of continuing to resist this monolithic sometimes tyrannical political religious establishments and so you know they developed habits of well we're not going to celebrate any holidays and you can find that in some groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses and some groups that arose very much in the modernist fundamentalist period of those wars and there's a real dumbing down in some ways of the understanding of some of the deep built-in wisdom about how to raise human beings and support and inform them and this is part of the reason for example why so often immigrants who come to a place like the United States they you know why are why are immigrants you know doing all the manual labor in America the construction and the farm work well it's because they don't have certain educational things yeah that's true but a part of it is that they have been formed by traditional cultures that have deep wisdom built into them which American culture sort of destroys and so when you listen to older immigrants on one hand being quite happy they came to America because there's a whole lot of good things that they've been blessed with but on the other hand lamenting some of what has been lost because you know even some of these non-Christian traditional cultures or traditional cultures that have been Christianized rather late they had within them some deep wisdom some of which is still latent in some of these feast days that American culture has brought up into itself so these processes to use the Canadian pronunciation these processes are so are so huge and nuanced and so much beyond us that our little capacity to discern them and manipulate them in a frontal rational way we simply can't capture them all and that's that's sort of the way of of human human beings and again in many ways this points to the work of Jordan Peterson which in some ways ontology a little phrase I have a little say ontology is its own justification part of the reason something like Halloween and Christmas and Easter even with a lot of the let's say signal to noise stuff that happened with respect to European colon Christian colonization of these ancient pagan practices um as again I think Peugeot is really good at pointing out there's this stuff isn't always all bad and it's not all good but there's some deep wisdom in that that you know those of us who think I know what's right I'm gonna wait in and I'm going to tinker and fix this oh okay uh you're probably you might make some improvements and in fact given that you're let's say a parent you have some agency you do have to make some choices but on the other hand you're probably going to muck things up because none of us are smart enough to to recognize all of the wisdom built into very old enduring things so I probably just continued the answer I don't know if I was at all helpful to you Tyler in terms of your question yeah thanks Paul I just there there seems to be a common sort of like there's two tactics with the the sort of the rejection of the contemporary culture that it's like you have the the more sacramental so now like with the orthodox and the catholics like that they choose to kind of go underneath it whereas the evangelical more like modernist approach is to kind of just reject it and say we're going to be over here and we don't partake in that and that that seems like you know maybe with you know using Jordan Peterson Jonathan Peugeot like there's examples of that I think the going going underneath is a much more effective tool for the evangelism that the other side who rejects claims that that's their their goal and that they could they could definitely learn something from that and that's and that you can sort of re reclaim the holy day rather than sort of just abandoning the the fight if you want to think of it that way no that's true that's good observation anything else on Halloween that anybody wants to throw in all right we'll move on Charlie thought journey why do you use the word influence when talking about how humans speak to God how do you juxtapose that with I am the same yesterday today and tomorrow would intercession be a better word well intercession is the traditional word influence because I want to use a word other than the traditional word for a few reasons one of the reasons is that I think part of the reason Christians communicate so poorly today and the Christian church has gotten so insular is because Christians keep using the same words and I think they do that partly because what we're doing is reinforcing our tribal boundaries and these words sort of become magic words and holy words and so we keep using the same words but over time what happens is subtle the subtle meanings beneath the words are not as clear as the words get disconnected from the larger culture and so very quickly the church just becomes an echo chamber and that's a real problem and so on one hand the church is a walled garden and it needs the walls and the church is a walled garden and the church is a walled garden and the church is a church is a walled garden and it needs the walls but on the other hand the church needs to make sure that there are gates and ways in and out of those walls so that the mission of the church which is you will be my witness Jesus is witnessed to by those walls and Jesus is witnessed to when Christians leave those walls and try to communicate outside those walls okay so that's part of the reason I use influence rather than intercession because if I were to um if I were to let's say I'm in a store and there's a manager and or let's say yeah I'm in a store and there's a manager and I'd like to um make a suggestion with the manager and I would say dear sir may I intercede on behalf of this other of this other patron uh someone would think I just broke out of a renaissance festival and part of the problem is that's what Christianity looks like a lot and even evangelicals who who sort of pride themselves on relevance uh don't do it so well so I think it's good to find other words that communicate and I think actually influence I choose influence because I think it's the right word if you and let me take a couple of examples um one of my favorite examples is Abraham and God so three strangers show up with Abraham and this is where you have the whole yeah you are going to have a son and his name is going to be Isaac and Sarah laughs and why are you laughing um and so then two of the two of the strangers two of the strangers go on to Sodom and they're about to run a rescue operation to get Sodom to get Lot and his family out of Sodom because the fire and brimstone is going to come down on Sodom Gomorrah and the cities in the plain and now it's really interesting because pay attention to the story and it's this level of nuance and complexity that the Bible communicates a narrative that a lot of our theological language is so inept at communicating all right so three strangers go to Abraham they conduct the business about prophesying the coming of Isaac and then two of them go to Sodom to rescue Lot so even before God has already decided he's going to smoke the cities on the plane Abraham has concern God goes so there's a little monologue that God does in his heart and he says should I withhold from Abraham my friend should I withhold from Abraham the plans that I have to do to the cities on the plane and so God goes to Abraham and again this is there this is this is so nuanced because there's this there's this little exegetical fight as to whether the autograph which of course we don't have does Abraham stand before God or does God stand before Abraham because that's very important in terms of understanding status in the ancient world and the Masoretic text has has has God the Lord standing before Abraham and now in terms of the the frame of that story that's a powerful thing because in a sense Abraham is is is kind of taking the superior posture here in some sense but very quickly by his language you can say he assumes the inferior role and you know Lord may it you know may I be ever so humble I should probably pull up the story itself may I be ever so humble as to if if far be it from the God of heaven and earth to sweep away the just with the unjust and of course the frame there is that Lot is just he's a good man and he's in the midst of a city of unjust people so now right there there's there's a ton of things that you could weigh in there how just is Lot oh that's kind of debatable with some of what if you go back to the story of of how they they split up and they're standing on a mountain looking over and there's the really good land and the cities on the plain so there you have lush pasture lands for all of flocks herds Andy gets to live in like New York or LA or San Francisco and and lots like oh I'll choose California and and Abraham's like all right I guess I'm going to Nebraska but California doesn't turn out to be everything that Lot hopes it would be and that's sort of part of the problem and and so so okay so now I'm reading it chapter 18 verse 17 then the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him for I have chosen him so again you know does God not change? Well, God seems you know that how how do those how do those statements relate to the text of scripture because as Protestants we say all such statements that we generate have to be critiqued against scripture that's the Protestant move so God's asking himself questions and he's saying well shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't isn't shouldn't I shouldn't I involve Abraham in my decision process I call that influence then the Lord said the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous and Lot kind of chose to live there um it doesn't say a lot about Lot's morality um that I will go down and see if what they've done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me well what's the outcry well the outcry the outcry is all the oppression so hey let's give uh points to the woke folks here the outcry is all the oppression um Sodom and Gomorrah are are successful cities who are living the the lifestyle of the rich and famous at this at the expense of the poor and and so there's that injustice going on and so God in all fairness says and again think about this with respect to this again systematic theology is a wonderful tool but part of what's built into system systematic theology is a lot of Greek thought so you don't have Aristotle's unmoved mover here and and even some of the Greek omnis God is omniscient well why would have God have to go down to to check on the outcry and and so when we say God is the same yesterday and today and tomorrow yeah that's biblical that's scriptural and that's true but this representation of God here is canon and so this representation has to be in conversation with the other representations and so God says I'm going to go down and check it out and the men turned away and went to Sodom but Abraham remained standing before the Lord or again there's a little footnote the Lord is standing before Abraham because Abraham's sort of about to judge God in here then Abraham approached him and said will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked it's like and now if you look at in my last video that I just posted this morning I posted this morning I talk about the great puzzle and and the great puzzle is this this ongoing conversation across religions across philosophy it's it's probably the most enduring question in all of thoughtful humanity which is how can we make sense of this world because on one hand this world is so filled with beauty and glory that this doesn't seem to be the product of chance we see what we look at as chance all around us and it doesn't accomplish much and we look at human beings which seem at least within our experience to be the crown of this creation which is what the Bible says we are and we look at we look around and we say on one hand the world is full of glory and on the other hand we say the world is full of chaos and suffering and some of it seems pointless and so we keep trying to answer this great puzzle and the ancients worked on it and almost all their philosophies and theologies and narratives were attempts to answer the great puzzle and so well that's that's built into here too will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked the righteous get swept away with the wicked all the time and the psalmists the hebrew psalmists wrestle with this hebakuk wrestles with this um you know this is a constant issue throughout the writings of the old testament and and that's why christians kind of run in and say well jesus is the answer to that question and i don't want to go there too quickly because we have to sit with the question and abraham poses this question and says to the lord hey wait a minute there's good in sodom and gamora and and and some of that good is lot and well yeah maybe he's not as good as he should be and maybe he is my nephew and maybe he is kind of a turd sometimes but a lot is worth saving are you going to sweep him away and and and so he challenges god on this and and from everything in the text that you see in the book of jones it's there too god enters into relationship with us in terms of his administration of the planet and we can see that worked out in physics and chemistry in our agency and we can see it worked out in these stories and so i know i some people didn't like when i said it the first time i said it in my videos but i stand behind it god opens himself up to our influence and this gets worked out in the in the constant conversation about prayer does prayer change god or does god change us now that what stands behind that question for a lot of people is what makes us a little nervous when we think prayer changes god and that nervousness comes from good theological formation that god is the same yesterday today and tomorrow well what do we mean by that sentence what we mean is that the political malstroms and debates a god is above the fray okay god is above the fray god is enduring he changes not he doesn't change his mind and the old testament says that well how can this god both not change his mind and willingly open himself to the open himself up to the influence of abraham not only abraham how about king hezekiah a prophecy goes out and and says all right hezekiah your number's coming up and hezekiah oh lord save me please please don't let me die all right we've heard your prayer you get more time but these are going to be some of the consequences and there are consequences to it or how about god listens to the prayers of the righteous true guess what he also listens to the cries of people who don't know him that's bound up in the story of exodus it's bound up here in the outcry that's going up from saddam and gamora where's that outcry going up from it's going up from the victims of the wealthy and the powerful of the elite and saddam and gamora and god hears their cry okay what about ninova same story the cries going up from ninova well what outcry well the assyrians are brutal thugs in the ancient world and they're they're not only oppressing the slaves and the people within their own culture they're oppressing the people beyond their culture and all right jona you're my prophet go to ninova and 40 days and you're going and you're going to be overthrown and jona doesn't want to go why doesn't jona want to go jona doesn't want them to get that message jona wants them to be toast and so jona goes the other way and the lord's like let's cause a sea so then the sea let's cause a storm there's there's a storm and jona's sleeping in the bottom of the boat you got jesus sleeping in a boat later joseph sleeping in the bottom of the boat and all the pagan sailors are like we're gonna die and jona's like yeah i know i i i yeah it's just because of me and the pagan sailors like what do you mean well my god is the god of heaven and earth and like he can do this storm stuff no problem and i'm kind of running away and they're like what are you nuts and jona's like well toss me into the drink and it'll all calm down you know jona's one heck of a prophet it just just look at his skills and then and then these pagan sailors are more moral and righteous than jona they're like we're not we're not getting any blood guilt so then they throw everything else overboard and that still doesn't qualify it doesn't all right jona over you go and jones like finally suicide rather than i'd rather die than give ninova a chance to live and so into the drink he goes and god's like ah not so fast here's a fish and i'm gonna keep you in the belly of the whale then jona has a come to jesus moment in the belly of the whale and jona chapter two and then he vomits him up on the shore and he still has to make the trek to ninova and he goes to ninova and says yeah uh uh 40 days and then it was over gonna be overthrown don't tell anybody and of course ninova who are all these nazis of the ancient world who are supposed to be moral degenerates one tiny little bit of revelation the king puts on sackcloth and ashes and they all want to save their skin so the whole city repents and what does god do i remember so jona is a good book to learn hebrew with because the vocabulary is small and it's a great story and um and i remember first reading that in hebrew in seminary and you know when you first learn hebrew you don't know any words so you're just kind of translating it all into the english words and you're looking at like old translations and god repented of the evil he was about to do against ninova i read that i thought what that's theologically problematic if i stood up in church and said that i'd lose my job uh he repented of that but god can't do evil and he repented god can't change his mind and and and and then but of course keep reading the story because then jona's sitting outside the city well why is he sitting out the city he's pissed why is he pissed this gets back to jogue's question earlier jona knows god jona is jona is probably i mean probably the part of the reason the story is the way it is was jona was probably the greatest prophet of his generation you know outstanding miracles amazing revelation he knows god he knew god better than anybody else so why is he ticked off because he wants to see ninova burn and so and he's outside the city and he's like well maybe you know not only does he know god's mercy he knows human frailty and ah they they repent it now but give them a day or two they'll go back to their their nazi oppressive ways and start you know doing all the bad stuff they got in trouble for before and they're not going to really stop oppressing very easily so i'll just sit outside the city and maybe just maybe god will repent from the other evil he's going to do and really do it to him so and of course there's this little vine he's got a little shade and then he likes that and then a worm comes and eats the vine and now he's sitting in the sun and now god has just cooked him good for the big confrontation and you know then he's like okay god i'm done in the jove moment it's like all right god of heaven and earth i'm gonna step up to the plate and i'm gonna denounce you for now again read jona in the light of abraham and abraham is having mercy on the ninova of his day jona wants to see ninova fry where is god in this does god not change well in some ways god doesn't change because he's both he's both a god of justice and exceeding in mercy and again listen to what god says of himself in the old testament it's what he says you know he says i'll i'll you know punish the children for the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation but show and so both abraham and jona god opens himself up to their influence but god at the same time maintains his sovereignty and and that's really you see we think about sovereignty as a determinism and as being rigid and stuck and and unmoving that's not true strength true strength i mean the the god of the universe is all that more than we can take to the degree that if we see him you know the god of the universe is the god of the universe and the god of the universe is the god of the universe is all that more than we can take to the degree that if we see him you know we want that we cry to the mountains to fall on us to to to to to keep us from his sight and at the other and on the other side is is so generous and so patient that we curse him for letting ninova and saddam and gamora have their way with generations of people that's the picture and so does he is he the god that isn't doesn't change yes is he the god that opens himself to up to our influence and hears our prayers and will will bend his knee to us as all the psalmists implore yes and we say how can that be both and i say i don't know i'm not god but when i read the text i see both and i don't see it as inconsistent be it because i can see smaller scale versions of that commonly around us so i don't think it's impossible for us to understand but that's when the question comes well well how can we relate to a god like this the only way to relate to this god is to trust and to worship and so that's that's my that's my that's my answer because it's a great question charlie and it's a question that comes up but intercession well now we're just playing renaissance festival again influence and and then when i talk to someone who isn't in the church and say god is open to your influence they'll be like no on one hand they'll say i don't want that because if the administrator of the master of the universe is going to be open to my influence that's really dangerous because i'm not that smart okay that person has a little knowledge and wisdom and humility and i would say well that's the difference between sovereignty is that god is open to your wisdom god is open to your influence he'll listen to you he might even he might even at least in anthropomorphic terms change his mind well how on earth does that work in terms of god's point of view who of us can see god's point of view so i think we're stuck with the anthropology and the anthropomorphic terms because we're stuck with us being ourselves and a lot of this greek thought and greek ideas which is really helpful and really powerful sometimes leads us into some real stupidity that the bible itself undermines and so stick to the text stick to the story does god change not yes does god open himself up to our influence yes and i use that word to invite people into if god will listen to the prayers of the oppressed of saddam and gamora and the oppressed of of ninova and the elite of ninova because when the king puts himself in sackcloth and ashes god opens himself to the influence of the king of ninova well he's a he's a he's an elitist i mean you can you can find all kinds of evil things to say about him god listens to him too but god never relinquishes his sovereignty in that process he remains the judge of heaven and the earth and he won't end so that's that's my answer to that and i don't know charlie let's see if i don't know if you're in the in the group right now anybody else want to have any follow-up comments or throw anything on top of that well just one thing um you mentioned the notes um about the masoretic text in one of your videos yep so i looked it up um the the niv for some reason it's it's a bit curious the masoretic text says the same thing um as as all the other texts what they're actually referring to is rashi brings a midrush and he does this in other places as well i don't know why the niv decided to note it here but um there are certain places where there are masoretic traditions that the original text was different um the the midrush says the text was but it was changed by the maserets um so it's not that the masoretic text says differently but that we have a tradition that originally the torah was different and that this scribes changed it here because out of respect for god oh that's so helpful that that's that's why it's terrifying having jacob around but also so helpful because he knows so much more than i do about this stuff it's wonderful so thank you jacob i i find it very weird that you you would say i'm terrifying but okay no i don't mean that i don't i'm not i'm not running and hiding under the chairs in the sanctuary but i i just know that i'm going to get a lot of stuff wrong and you know um you know you're an expert or you know a ton about this stuff because of because of your you know because of your background so um i think it's really cool i'd really appreciate i really i really like learning from you because you know and but but that again i think illustrates the point of sovereignty i continue to be sovereign over my ideas unlike god uh i get lots of things wrong but i am also open to jacob's influence now when jacob says i think paul is the apostle paul is a hack and the gospel of john is deeply problematic well i might not agree with jacob but i am influenced and i listen to his his ideas because i learned from them so you mean you don't agree with me on everything that's why see this is this is this is to me what is so wonderful about this discord server and all of you and you know a time that we can uh spend together like this so it's really cool so thank you all right oh boy questions have continued uh we'll see if we get to them all okay why do you think cs lewis is one of the few figures who is mutually restricted respected by all the major christian camps isn't that interesting catholic protestant and orthodox this has always interested me because based on his writings i don't think he fits into any of the boxes very nicely that's exactly right isn't that funny the way we are i i think part of it well of course that's a number of things about lewis he was outrageously brilliant he was outrageously well read i mean from from the from the oral tradition around lewis the word is he read pretty much everything from the ancient world in original languages at least into the most in the most common original languages greek latin i don't know how much hebrew he knew but the dude was just off the chart brilliant man he um i'm not sure obviously had a very interesting life and was an astounding essayist he's a far better essayist than than fiction writer of course tolkien was a far better fiction writer but and and he so he understood christianity i think at a very deep level and i think and that's where he gets his mere christianity and so he was able to he was able to connect with deep resources of all three traditions and communicate it into and and and sort of bring it into the mid 20th century so and he was you know so part of what you know when you think about okay why did jordan peterson why was he so effective as he was well because of mythos because because peterson understood something deeply about our connection with mythology and he gets a lot of that from you um why is jonathan peugeot so helpful even you know again if someone just looks at tribal boxes they might look at me and jonathan peugeot and say paul vanderkley and jonathan peugeot should be mortal enemies because you've got the air of a conicalism with an icon carver yeah but jonathan peugeot is is translating and opening up very ancient ideas that are built into all of our traditions and making them accessible to us today jonathan also grew up as a protestant so um you know he's super helpful so i think there are people that are like that and then don't forget temperament you know part of part of why part of why the little community that we are enjoying right now is shaped the way it is and part of why living stones is shaped the way it is and part of why my children are shaped the way that they are is because of my personality quirks now that sometimes is a problem and sometimes it's a good thing it's my my strengths get amplified and my weaknesses get amplified and sometimes my weaknesses get accommodated for and my strengths get um my strengths get um damped down so all that is happening around lewis too but no i think cs lewis was a gift from god for the 20th century church and uh part of it was just who lewis was and and that's the thing about human beings we we aren't just smart or wise or well educated or all of these aspects that we think where we've got all these personalities and and that came so through in the jordan peterson wave uh part of what made peterson fun was his personality part of what drew that the antagonism against him was his personality that's that's how we are so lewis was lewis gift from god to us okay dave w to piggyback on yes and no's question could you say a little bit about god number two being both a transcendent aspect of god and yet being the one we have a personal relationship with in orthodox theology we believe that humans don't have a relationship with the transcendent god this is part of the god that is completely unknowable but rather the imminence of god so even so ever since you introduced the concept of god number one god number two i've been trying to wrap my head around the way you think about it that's a really great question and and part of it gets into the fact that imminence and transcendence are themselves both models that are human terms and human constructs that have limitations okay so why is god number two connected with transcendence in that way you're exactly right that one way to understand transcendence is holy holy holy that god is so holy so other so sacred so beyond that we all of our it gets back to what brett sockel talked about in terms of analogy we can't know god without analogy and every analogy we have falls short and diminishes and reduces and misrepresents that's the bind we're in and i think via the cognitive scientists that's the bind we're in because of the fact that we are small okay so that is one aspect of transcendence your your your your mike is a little noisy jack you might want to mute that otherwise i can mute it too thanks um that is an aspect of transcendence now i want to bring in my another one of my quirky ones and twos or i made it an a and a b because i already had a one and a two by group a and group b group i've talked a lot less about this but it's still those are two other boxes on my theological philosophical workbench group a are all rightly colonizable things all things that we in the spirit of geometry reduce to simple cause and effect that we can reliably track that's group a group b are where persons are now part of what we've done is we have used the spirit of geometry to penetrate deeper and deeper into personhood and we have discovered that well the ancients knew this too um they just didn't systematize it in a scientific way we have discovered all kinds of ways that human beings are hackable that you know beat this kid when he's little or or or you know what what what show was that um you know show you know find it find a three-year-old and and scare the heck out of them with a dog and you're probably going to have a dog you're probably going to have an adult who's scared of dogs okay we're hackable but yet it's that piece of us that we can't hack it's the person of the gaps that also is the aspect of transcendence and so the reason god number two is personal and that we relate to with the spirit of finesse as person is that same transcendence because once we relate once something is part of group a once something is accessible via the spirit of geometry it is no longer transcendent and so integral to personhood is an element of transcendence and it's exactly that aspect that we today look at and say okay that's why we treat people as image bearers of god because they have within them an element of they participate in that group b-ness that there is something transcendent and holy and sacred about them that we cannot penetrate merely through the spirit of geometry that's the definition of persons and when everything becomes group a then we're to cs lewis's book miracles the whole show and so when cs lewis says okay there's the whole show and all there is is the whole show but other traditions including the bible says there's something beyond the whole show that's transcendence and whenever we deal with people as people and not as things that's we're actually integrating transcendence and that's the connection between god number two and transcendence and holy holy holy god is other and so we approach it with the spirit of finesse as a person and that is part of the reason that we approach people differently than we approach our dog now we have limitations of knowledge with respect to our dogs but they are not image bearers of god they don't have and they don't participate in that same transcendence as a person does so that's so so your what you're learning from orthodox theology is not wrong but in this case connect up the personhood of god with his transcendent quality so does that i don't know if davi are in the group of does that help you uh yeah actually that was an incredible answer i'm gonna have to go back and listen to it several times but uh yes it helped a lot okay so connecting personhood to transcendence is that that made it click into place for me good all right that that's your question is outstanding because you're exactly right and and it's just that you have to kind of and that's where pascal's spirit of geometry and spirit of finesse is super helpful so good all right thanks so much uh jimmy d jimmy da thing jimmy da thing that's a new name that i've seen here i haven't seen jimmy da thing here before so i lean more towards orthodox i was baptized in russian orthodox church on the dad's side but raised catholic mom's side that's interesting until i was about 12 or 13 got first communion was an altar boy but then left when my mom found out we were watching football at sunday uh yes and you know it's so funny when i watch um when i it's it's just natural to you know converting to something else or finding something delightful is sort of like falling in love you get a connected with its transcendence and you think i'm gonna become i'm gonna become orthodox because orthodoxy will be the answer to all my problems and part of me thinks god bless you i mean i'm not i'm not challenging you going to orthodoxy but they have their messes too just yesterday i was listening to um some some youtuber just you know complaining up and down about bishop barron even though i'm you know it's like yeah that we're human beings that's how we are all right that's the question question is this i feel the orthodox church can be blinded to what they could incorporate in fear of tainting that's exactly right do protestants have a blind side with things that they could or should reincorporate that they have left behind the fun thing about protestants is we have so many blind sides because we are so chaotic so disorganized so disjointed so idiosyncratic that we got blind sides all over the place and the thing about protestants is that that not all their blind sides match now that doesn't mean that there aren't any blind sides inherent with protestantism and that's not the case with protestantism to the degree that you can find the essence of the group but yes and and so one of the things that i do sometimes and this gets back to charlie's answer or question about language choice when i when i look at colossians one let me pull that up here in my uh um um i hate when i spell a bible verse wrong okay here we go when you look at colossians one verse 15 and i'm reading it in the niv just because just because it's easy the sun is the image of the invisible god all right and um so then because i can then maybe trip over to the greek and then you read uh oh come on then you trip over to the greek um there's this funny word uh icon that's the greek word the greek word is icon well in english we have this icon and protestants get allergic to icons and there's a real reason for that and you know you know mary is the theotokos what does that mean and protestants get nervous because of all these things and and that's the amazing thing about these wisdom and also corruption traditions that built into me are all sorts of sensitivities from not genetic ancestors but traditional ancestors from centuries ago and so you know people are sometimes like well paul you know what paul when you're going to convert to roman catholicism i don't know i look at bishops sheen with his vestments on and i can't help but think liberace it's like i'm i'm a plain dude um i don't think i'm ever going to be roman catholic i don't think i'm ever going to be orthodox i i think the cake is baked and i've got all these protestant sensitivities but my protestant sensitivities have given me certain bigotries and biases against certain things that i should be more open to you know it's an it's an astounding story and pull up the bible again um it's an astounding story i'm going to pull it up because i don't i'm not going to get the chapter exactly right probably uh uh stephen x chapter 7 stoning of stephen simon the sorcerer philip sol's conversion sullen Damascus cornelius x chapter 10 at sisteria there was a man named cornelius a centurion and whom was an italian regiment he and all his family were devout and godfearing well what does that mean he didn't want to go under the knife of circumcision who can blame him this is the first century things are sensitive down there um you know i'm not going to go there uh he gave generously to those in need and prayed to god regularly so he seems to be almost all the way um stop quoting the bible pastor unbelievable yeah well a lot of people don't listen to the q a stuff anyway so i'll just uh i'll be a little bit more walled garden in the estuary space he gave generously to those in need and prayed to god regularly one day about three in the afternoon he had a vision he distinctly saw an angel of god who came to him and said um and said cornelius cornelius stared at him in fear that's again all these people i saw an angel they ever read the bible if you ever really do see an angel you'll probably mess up your pants uh what is it lord he asked the angel answered your prayers and gifts to the poor come up as a memorial offering before god hey god god sees everything he even sees old cornelius doing this stuff here now send men to japa to bring a man named simon who is called peter he's staying with simon the tanner whose house is by the sea when the angel who spoke to him had gone cornelius sent two servants he's a wealthy man he's got slaves cornelius is a slave owner and a devout soldier who was his attendance he told him everything that had happened and sent them to japa about noon the following day as they were on their journey approaching the city peter went up to the roof to pray he became hungry ever have your hunger mess up with your dreams well here's one and wanted something to eat and while the meal was being prepared ever smell something while you're napping and think ah and it affects your dreams well there it happens he fell into a trance oh boy he saw heaven open and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners it contained all four all kinds of four-footed animals as well as reptiles and birds now peter is a first century jew he knows what to eat and he knows what not to eat and he's a good man and he ain't gonna go there then a voice told him get up peter kill and eat surely not lord peter replied i have never eaten anything impure or unclean peter's a good jew the voice said to him a second time uh um the voice said to him a second time do not call anything impure that god has made clean and of course what's being set up is peter's gonna have to go to cornelius's house and he's not been circumcised and you know probably the the level of kosher that that cornelius's kitchen and is probably not up to speed and peter's gonna get stretched but you know peter's probably gonna stay sort of on the line of team judiizer a bit um you know acts 15 they relax some things but they're not gonna go all the way to paul and paul's gonna confront peter that's talked about in the book of galatians and you know it's it's it's kind of a mess but god works through these things and does paul get everything right just because paul wrote letters that the church considers canon does not make paul a perfect man points to jacob um and just because peter is the head apostle does not make peter a perfect man i don't know what jacob thinks about peter um but here we are and so protestants have blind sides and i think part of why we see protestants in trying to address now i i won't i won't spread this too far i mean luther was addressing the church that luther knew calvin was addressing the church calvin was addressing the church that calvin knew that they're trying to reclaim some of what had been lost in corruption in the period that they were addressing almost every attempt at reform goes overboard and i think part of what we're seeing now some 500 years later in the areas that we're living in the areas that we're living is that we're living is where you know i've been through this process had to really grow in terms of what's a sacrament i've got more respect and esteem for both the roman catholic and the orthodox churches than i had four years ago i've learned some things and i've seen some protestant blind i remain a protestant for a whole variety of reasons and you know so so mark galley you know an editor that i respect he he went over to become roman catholic that's wow that's a big deal he didn't do it until he was no until he was retired though okay fair enough he had a job and a family to feed he couldn't do it probably while he was editor of christianity today but he went now and there are blind sides in protestantism that i learned from both talking talking to roman catholics like mary listening to bishop barron videos there are blind sides in protestantism that i that i that are challenged by talking to nathan jacobs or jonathan pageau and listening to jonathan's videos there there are elements of the contemporary form of christianity that jacob the jew and the bridges of meaning corrects me in um i am a and to me this this reaffirms my calvinism that i am a i am a sinful creature who is small-minded and gets a lot of things wrong and by virtue of that calvinism i can have a posture of humility and not have that humility threaten who i am in christ because i already know about myself i'm going to get a ton wrong so why don't i listen to roman catholics and orthodox now i am going to as a protestant take what i learned from them and check it with the scriptures that's the project of protestantism that's the project of the christian reformed church that the idea in the christian reformed church i mean i hear sometimes people saying wow but you christians you're so blinded by your tradition yes sometimes we are but it's updatable but how is it updatable we we we learn things i listen to jordan peterson and from what i learned from jordan peterson i try to check it against the scriptures that's what it means to be a protestant and so that's what i do and i'll get stuff wrong and other protestants will come along and say no you've given away too much or no you're in error and yeah protestantism is a mess it's an estuary of its own but um i i'm i'm deeply appreciative to um to what i've learned and so when i read and now when i read colossians 1 15 and see jesus as the icon of the invisible god i think maybe i shouldn't be so reactive or allergic to you know some of these elements in the roman catholic and the orthodox tradition yet go listen to my sermon on the second commandment at the same time i i remain i i remain uncomfortable when i see more so now than four years ago when i see michael angelo's depiction of of you guys keep putting liberace up in that chat room and i just can't help but look at him what does that say but i i can't look at michael angelo's god and adam on the sistine chapel and not think i i think i think that representation mr michael angelo did the church some harm i think it oughtn't to be there but but that now puts me in are you saying paul are you an iconoclasm that if the christian reform church gets hold of the sistine chapel we're going to destroy it no no i am in that way not an iconoclast and i am not in favor of i am not in favor of taking down the roof of the sistine chapel nor am i in favor of blowing up you know like the taliban did these these enormous buddhist statues that were on the silk road i think in some ways letting history remain as a testimony even to our foolishness is important let's let's leave let's leave um auschwitz up so that it can be a memorial to to what we do to each other um do i think michael angelo making that was a bad idea yeah am i in favor of taking it down or banning it or censoring it no i think we're better off talking about it and um yeah so that's these are some of the things that i've learned how about how about any of you anything that any of you have learned in this process or want to share along these lines well i have a question a follow-up question about the sistine chapel okay why i must have missed it if you explained so i apologize but why why do you think it was a bad idea if you so i put my rough drafts on the on the on my personal channel my rough drafts are really very rough drafts some week and i always get tinkered by the time i preach them and that's over on the church channel because again and this has been shaped by how i've grown i believe i've grown in terms of my understanding of what we mean by this word god once that i believe that the second commandment you should not take you should not make for yourself basically a little statue and call it god well why would god say that when making little statues are really helpful things to bond people religiously you can find go out there and search hebrew google hindu idols and you'll find websites that will say yeah we use idols idols are really important idols really help people yes little statues really help people but god says don't represent me by anything within my creation because if you do you will reduce me to that thing and the entire sam harris reduction of god to an old man with a gray beard in the sky is i think in some ways attributable to this habit of ours of representing god in that way and god is not an old man in the sky now jordan peterson had a point when he said you know a demanding father is not a bad representation of the universe and fair enough but when christians we really quickly we need representations to relate to god and god gives us plenty in scripture and and in a sense in all fairness to to our jewish friends when jesus really elevates father in that way boy we're really close to our father in heaven how would be your name well what is my father my father is an old man where's heaven it's up in the sky one and put those two together and you got michael angelo so you're close there but yeah and so we can't represent don't make a thing basically the command says don't make a thing that represents god and imprint that too hard on you because god is going to be representing himself in so many different ways in a burning bush in a still small voice in a storm in in what looks like a volcano or a storm on top of sinai and then finally in the icon of the invisible god that is jesus christ so i just think it if michael angelo had been a little bit more cognitive of the second commandment we might not have the flying spaghetti monster so what about icons though like like the sorry i'm a box of more things because okay i don't know the i don't know that i've actually seen an icon um created of god but like there are icons of christ and mary and baby christ and they're all the saints and like what where do those come in then i don't see those as violations of the second commandment i'm sorry what i don't see those ike a representation of jesus okay i misheard you i was like i thought you said you were okay with icon i i i representations of jesus or mary or these are all these are not gosh again language gosh again language gets difficult here because i'm about to sound like sam these are not what the second commandment addresses and this is this very much gets into my god number one and god number two because what happens when we represent god as an old man on the clouds is we start to lose god number one that's my point in this now god represents himself in jesus christ and again if you listen to my sermon on the second commandment there's a lot of deep stuff going on in that and our ability to articulate it is limited because in a sense you know well what is the image of god well it's human beings so when god represents himself definitively the expression you know a he uses a human being as you go all the way back to genesis one so so this is this is why i think it was unwise and if i if today you know an artist came and said we're going to do up this the this is so laughable if you'd ever been to living stones we're gonna do up the living stone ceiling to to rival the sistine chapel and i'd see i'm looking at rick and i would say okay but let's keep the second commandment in mind here and again the second commandment isn't against all statuary which i think the protestant reformers sort of went overboard there because if you read the text that the holy of holies has the seraphim in it and the ark of the covenant and so there's statuary and representation in the tabernacle and in solomon's temple that's what the text says and so god is not against images or art but he says when you represent me this is the lord of the old testament as a christian i say the triune god when you represent me as an element within my creation you misrepresent me because i am transcendent holy holy holy and so that's that's my feelings about it and at the same time iconography makes me a little nervous for some other reasons too because when i listen to jonathan peugeot and when i understand the art and the thinking behind it i'm less nervous about it because i am more in tune with the language but when i see that creepy protestant picture of jesus standing by the door with and he's looking like you know fabio had lost a few pounds and he's knocking on the door i think you know just we got to be really careful with images because very quickly someone's going to really connect that with jesus and one of the most amazing things about the new testament and about the gospels is there is not one hint of physical description about jesus that's an astounding thing and and this i think is important for us that we got to be a little careful with these pictures of jesus now again i've got one behind me on my wall which was a gift given to me by an intern of mine derrick zile and it's a really interesting pictures because you've got all these heads of people in the picture of jesus and so i keep it on my wall so i'm obviously not tyrannical about this but there's enough protestantism in me that a little too much statuary and visual imagery realistic imagery puts me in the wrong direction which is why again when i listen to jonathan peugeot i'm growing and i'm learning but again i'm 57 years old my brain is not anywhere near as plastic as it used to be i am who i am so all right oh jimmy da thing had one last thing in there is this connected to why god has so many names yes no representation or definition of god can complete its can be complete in itself yes that's god's holy holy holy we cannot exhaust that's why the good place or upload all our attempts to imagine the infinite we we when we when we're looking at ourselves and we get to a point say yeah i'm going to be bored with myself and this is why when it comes to the age to come and god's plan beyond this age and for us beyond this age i unlike atheists that say well i think about infinity and it would just get boring yeah because the sandbox the imaginative sandbox you are playing in is you my god is holy holy holy and so i suspect i can go further up and further in and just keep going because it's not based on me and this is part of the reason that preachers should keep preaching from the bible and why jordan peterson noted the bible seems we can't seem to find the bottom well we've only been at it a couple thousand years or longer if you're a jew but why can't we find the bottom well maybe that's evidence of god who is bottomless and again to talk about the other video i posted this week i i really thought both of my videos that i posted that my monologues videos this week were really important it was a good week on my channel i think because we had poe and then we had these two videos because the other point that from my other video is um when i listen to christian atheists debates about god they almost always suffer from thinking about god as a thing god is not a thing and that's why we can't represent god as a thing now jesus was a man yeah he's also god so jesus is you might say it's an inconsistency if you're jacob or if you're sam or you might say it's a mystery and something we can't adequately express if you're a trinitarian so but that's that's where we're at and we even though i see myself i see myself as getting bored with myself i'm too shallow of a pond to be infinite i am still deeper than i know and you know a story i told i don't remember it might i haven't posted my conversation my new conversation i had with um with ryan bennett yet i had one it was mostly political so i'm still on the fence as to whether or not i'm going to post it but so my wife and i have been married 32 years now and we regularly have the experience of looking across the couch and like who are you and we've known each other for 34 years and if i can't exhaust another human being that i've been as intimate and close with more than i've been any other human being in the world well that says something about human beings we're pretty mysterious and pretty deep there's there's an element of our trans of god's transcendence in us that's his image so so all right it is 1201 i think it's probably a that's a good note to end the recording so we'll end the recording and we'll have some post recording chit chat how's that sound
