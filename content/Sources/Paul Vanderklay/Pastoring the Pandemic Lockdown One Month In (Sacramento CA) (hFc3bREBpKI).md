 The truth is I suspect Eric Dirksen is not wearing any pants. I've already started recording so there you go. I did I didn't see an article that that a lot of the stores are selling a lot more tops than than pants or skirts so uh wow yeah that that much stuff going on on zoom. Well with that with that beautiful introduction I'll just for the sake of the recording um I decided to gather some of my friends and colleagues together to do a video on pastoring pandemic pastoring and let me arrange my screen a little bit here just to talk about well what what things are like right now for for pastors in at least the Sacramento area. So with with me today are uh Eric Dirksen he and I have have done a video before and Mark Holland and Noel De Luna and I think maybe what we'll do first is sort of go around the circle y'all can give brief introductions say a little bit about yourself a little bit about your church and then we'll take it from there so I'll I'll just go in the direction I have you. Go ahead Eric a little bit about yourself. My name is Eric Dirksen I'm the pastor of Christ Church in Davis it's a Christian Reformed Church of nearly 10 years we'll have our 10th anniversary this fall. My family and I have been in Davis for 12. What else do you want to know Paul husband three kids. That's good that's good grew up in Iowa grew up in Iowa yeah Midwestern transplant. That's fun we lots more information about Eric on my first conversation with him. You're always looking to mine that that Midwestern aspect of my history aren't you. And and he's very active on Twitter and you can always tell when he's present preparing his sermons because there's all these Augustine and Christostom quotes that he's or John Calvin quotes he's putting on Twitter there so I always really like that. Yes it's quarantine time these aren't sermons these are these are meditations. Oh we will we will get into that. All right and next is next is Mark Holland. Mark why don't you introduce yourself never been on my channel. There no I haven't been on I don't know how to get on you won't invite me on. Just kidding yeah Mark Holland City Life Church in downtown Sacramento. And you grew up in the thriving metropolis of. Well I was I was Babs baptized exactly 80 feet behind you in that building in 1977 and then I grew up in in Ripon that's the metropolis you were probably talking about. That's right the thriving metropolis of California the beating heart of Christian reform dumb in northern California. And Amund production and the being hard of Amund production. Hard of Amund production and Mark was a he was an intern and resident at Living Stones back in the day and has a church in area of Sacramento known as Midtown so that's what and how long have you been when when did you guys have your first service Mark. 2007 2007 okay yeah 13 years y'all. 13 years y'all been doing this all right and Noel why don't you introduce yourself. Yeah hello Noel De Luna I'm the pastor at the River Rock Church it's over in Folsom California. River Rocks been meeting since you know I don't really remember. 1999. 1999 that's right that's right so I came on board there as a commission pastor in 2016 officially so okay if you're on the job. And you have the distinction among us as being bivocational. Yes that's right I am a bivocational pastor. So what's your other job. I am a reliability engineer for a semiconductor company here in Folsom. Okay okay well thank you Noel and well let's let's start with when when did you first. When did you first begin to imagine that this strange thing happening in China might change the reliable and predictable patterns of your life. Any of you. I'll be honest and this is not a it's not meant to make me look good. The first time I raised my eyebrow at this I was having a parent little league meeting in mid to late February and you know I heard it on the news or anything but but recognizing that it was coming to California sort of faster than anywhere else is because I had a parent in my little league team meeting so the season hasn't started yet right it's just get to know you know your new coach and yada yada yada kids aren't involved it's just the parents. And there's a woman there who is I think a lawyer for the air air force but she's at one of the local air force bases where some of these initial COVID-19 patients were you know getting off of a cruise ship in the bay area and then they were being held by the U.S. military well anybody around here knew where that was and this woman in my group was she was wearing fatigues and she was like yeah you know I'm I'm there making sure people aren't leaving and yada yada yada and of course we started peppering her with questions but that was my first inkling that oh what you know is in my living room somebody very intimately connected very early but my thoughts didn't immediately go to what's this going to do to church to be to be honest it just went to what's you know what's next in the state any the rest of you I would I would say that I really lacked any any vision for like what you know what we ended up having having happened you know I remember traveling I think January 20 I was traveling to Florida and the news was about you know talking about this happening in China and I thought you know this is probably the last time I'm comfortable doing you know being in airports like this then I still ended up having like a March 2 trip to Michigan and it and that was that was right when it was probably out there spreading in all kinds of ways but there was still kind of this public cloak of oh well if you just you know wash your hands and all this kind of stuff you'll be fine and then and then yeah right after that trip it was like but I would just say that I yeah I didn't really have any vision until until some stuff really started coming out within a couple weeks of stay at home sheltering in place orders some stuff started to come out or that I was at least paying attention to and it was started to be like oh this is going to be you know some changing some things and and yeah so I but I guess that was pretty late that was we were we were we stopped doing our Sunday service and it almost felt like we should have stopped one week earlier but a lot of churches still went like another week after we went but yeah so how about you Noel? Yeah my first inkling that it was going to affect us was some what sometime around last week of February when the company that I work for made it optional for some people to stay at work especially to those with with that are what do you call this? Immune deficient? Yeah immunodeficient yes that's right so I do have a few colleagues decided to stay at home and started wondering gee okay when this gets worse and you know all of a sudden you know gradually you could see more and more measures being taken social distancing and whatnot and March 8th I think we were a little bit later in responding we stopped meeting March 8th I believe as a church we said we will we will honor the the Sacramento Public that would have been that would have been the 15th yeah well actually the 22nd was when it actually came down so Eric you were the first one in terms of our cluster that the week before from the I on March 1 I flew to or much to I flew to Tucson and we had some meetups and some stuff going on down there and as I was in Southern California began to watch state of emergencies happen and some of these things and still didn't quite know what to do and then flew back that Friday the 6th and I remember flying back from from Chino California and walked down the plane and the plane just smelled like you know someone had just recently wiped the whole thing down and there were fewer people on the flight and some people were already making comments about it but then we had service the 8th but then that week Eric you sent out an email message basically to the cluster which is our group of pastors locally and said uh you guys having service that would be the 15th you guys having service and what so what what what provoked that Eric uh two things almost simultaneously one was a um a larger church in Davis I had heard sort of through the grapevine that they made a decision on Tuesday of that week so I think that'd be the the 10th the 10th um and I think I sent out my my email to all of you shortly after I heard that Wednesday morning about 60 minutes after I sent out that email like hey what are you all doing I got a phone call from one of my deacons who's in public health she works in the private sector but for a very large company and she's got a master's in in public health and this is her job and she was reaching out to sort of um so what I did what I did was actually I sent an email to colleagues and then I sent an email to my council which is elders and deacons in the christian reform church our leadership team and I said hey what um somebody like what's the deal what how should we be thinking about this um I feel pretty strongly that you know I'm clergy I'm going to stay in my lane here and um sort of rely on other people in this realm and and we just happen to have a deacon who is on the front lines of you know news who had contacts in the cdc and the state department and things like that and um she took it very seriously very early and encouraged all of us to do the same so we followed her lead and we had made a decision by Wednesday the 10th or Wednesday the 11th I think and then sent it out to the congregation that Thursday and you your initial decision was to suspend services for three weeks yeah she was pretty candid with us and said let's go ahead and say three weeks but listen it's gonna be longer and um I think I made some off-handed remark like well okay that I'm gonna pray for Easter and she's uh she said something like we can pray for that but that was her tone so I did spend three weeks praying that we could get back you know for services for Easter but we all recognized I think within a week or two that that wasn't gonna happen but that's I was just following the lead of people you know that do this for a living well at that during that week I was still sort of contemplating because there was another leg of the trip that would be kicked off the Sunday the 15th where uh Job and John the Dunk would come up from Southern California and participate in the service here we were going to do a meet up on Saturday in Fresno and then Sunday Sacramento they were going to drive all the way up to Seattle of course we're watching everything going on in Seattle which was earlier so then by Thursday that Thursday night the 12th we had a council meeting and part of the question I had for the council meeting is do we do we have worship service or not and we at the council meeting at first the idea that we would not worship on the 15th just seemed sort of crazy but the more but given the fact that we have so many senior citizens in our church and so many people with diabetes and other underlying health concerns we knew that if we just say admonished some of our older members to stay home they wouldn't so we decided well we'll cancel church for this Sunday and then it became very clear pretty quickly that things were changing very quickly so I said let's not make any big plans let's just decide for this week and then and so since then we've been doing weekly Zoom meetings as a council but that's sort of how we got rolling how about you Mark how did how did that week look for you yeah I mean that was the week I remember that really clearly because we were all we were all trying to figure out what what to do I think and so I just remember every like I remember a few things I remember like within each 24-hour period you know just things shifting you know substantially like the heaviness kind of dropping a level each 24 hours almost like you're just were watching the news every five minutes to see you know I'd get a notification through either like the the one of my sports apps that would tell me that the NBA canceled the season and you know when stuff like that was just coming in it was like wait a minute so something right it right in there like I dug in one day and just just I dug in and tried to read some things to really get a little more educated and watch a couple videos so I think you had pointed me Paul to this Dr. Campbell and I've been watching him ever since that week but I dug in and it took me a couple hours of just digging in and really looking at things and I think Italy was just this test case for what what this is like and by the end of that like couple of hours of digging into that stuff I was just completely changed I think it was maybe the Tuesday or Wednesday but I began with everybody just that I was talking to just like you know this is this is going to be huge you know I think I think we're going to see the writing on the wall increasingly with each day that this is you know we're not meeting and we're and it's going to be a long time and you know but there was that week felt really kind of intense that way and I remember us having like a staff meeting in person reviewing kind of how Sunday went and we just spent the whole meeting it was like that same day that a whole you know these these things were coming out about the NBA canceling and other things and I remember we're sitting there and I said the NBA just canceled their season and we're at the stabbing but this meeting just we talked that's all we talked about in fact one of our staff members wasn't there because she had what seems to have been she never was able to get tested seems like she had COVID-19 and it took her like until about four or five days ago now it took her about over three weeks to recover she just kept battling this thing and she was young so but anyway yeah that was my I remember that distinctly and and and I had I had we didn't have anybody on our like our leadership team who was this you know health background or strong voice so I felt like I was trying to get it you know solidified that we're not meeting because because I just felt like the writing was on the wall and now now Noel your situation's a little different in that both Eric and Mark planted the churches that they serve in you were a lay person and then you were on staff part-time and then Chuck you're the senior pastor took a call to another church so your leadership structure in your church has been in transition what what was that like in terms of your leadership that yeah for you that was interesting so we we took the cue from Eric we looked at Sacramento County's guidance and so we we didn't have a medical professional on our leadership team as well so we we took advantage of Sacramento Public Health and and they interestingly enough they did say okay at that time prohibit anything above 50 and we we our church attendance is less than that and so I think that was kind of like the basis for it there was no the strongest voice has said let's continue so we did decide to meet that week with guidance on we prepared a church cleaned it up social distancing communion you know change the way you can do communion so that we don't we minimize having to touch things and so on and so forth so that was that week knowing that next week could be different so we took it week by week and the call that week was let's go meet but when the guidance changed the next week it was very clear that didn't so no debate at there at all once it says we got to prohibit everything so so when so when your church decided okay at whatever point to say okay we're not going to meet this week what kinds how did you get the message out to your people and what kinds of feedback did you get in our case it was everybody agreed and there was no by that time there was no debate we had to the situation was getting worse and and news from idli and the nba season being cancelled and all of that right the other organizations my company decided that we all work from home and so on and it was it just became clear that we had to go that was the week where nobody could yeah the the the city i think you're right noel the by the 15th sacramento county was saying groups no you know no groups larger than 50 and of course then by the 22nd it was you know you're closed yep anyone else feedback from the people of your church we were pretty early and you asked how we communicated we we sent out a church-wide email we posted it on our various you know social media networks and then as a like as a leadership team as a council we immediate like part of our decision making process was well how are we going to you know go forward at least for the first week and one of the things that we decided to do was we're not a huge congregation either was we had if we had just made this directory actually which felt like this old church thing to do but people wanted each other's you know addresses and so not everybody that considers christ church their church do we have all their information so we had to rely on email but then we also if we had phone numbers and stuff we had each council member take about six to eight people and call them directly and let them know that this is you know the plan and here's our rationale and do you have any questions and at least for me personally and hearing from my council there was zero pushback at all in fact i only got positive things being even you know maybe a week earlier than some of you all i i got like a few text messages and phone calls and emails saying thank you and and and that so other people were apparently more you know forward than i was because i was like well i'm just following you know the pros but we it was overwhelmingly positive what um now i think and part of the reason i want to walk through this is one of the things that becomes apparent is that within a month of a lot of these events we very quickly forget exactly what happened i mean our memories are are quite unreliable and and so part of what i wanted wanted to do this video for is just to kind of leave a record for you know what it was like in terms of what it was like in the middle of march in that second week in the third week because as mark said each things happened so quickly that in a little period of days it seemed like we were living a lot of life and there was a lot of attention and all of that going on there was in those earlier in those earlier weeks there there was sort of a meme that was getting going among pastors sort of riffing on the idea that during the plagues churches didn't flee churches stayed put and that sort of got translated and you know first things reno and first things had written a rather prominent piece that sort of got translated as you know any any churches that close are are you know basically are not are not trusting in god or not you know are basically doing something wrong and so that aspect has been interesting to watch that that conversation have have any of you seen that heard at have any reflections on that one other riff on it was that are we giving in to fear rather than fear rather than faith that got up during that week that was one of the conversations so the certainly we i tried to look for in the past for guidance there's never anything that happened like this before right and so worst precedents and so on and i couldn't find any i did find that article too about what the churches did during the plague and there was even this story about john calvin you know being you know sticking with the people with the plague and and then praying for them and you know he was being so brave and whatnot and and so on his health was always crappy if you read him yeah but to me paul it was really more of um it never it that was probably the the theological discussion i had are we giving into fear versus faith not so much on you know are we doing the right thing or not it was more of that way and and we wanted to comply with the government order as much as possible right and we never thought that this would be the state imposing something on us right uh that in print that infringes our freedom of religion or anything like that yeah yeah i mean i kind of feel like that's that's really insightful noelle and um i don't know it just seems like it's it's a crisis that um you know it brings out some of the crazies in the in the bigger christian world you know the the and you know so you know people choose their hill to stand on or to die on or whatever or to go to jail on if you're the pastor in florida who the order for their state was not to meet um and it just you know it's just interesting it's like it's an interesting okay here's a leadership movement movement you know or moment and the and the people are anxious and they're panicking and they're looking for leadership you know okay here what do you do as a as a pastor or as a as a leadership team or as a council or board so it is kind of a crisis that people are looking for leadership you know okay here what do you do or what do you do as a pastor or as a council or board so it is kind of interesting to just watch how different people react to that you know and because i think that not only are the people who there's examples out there that people took that route of of this is the faith route we're not going to be told what to do by the government or something like that there's also the people who kind of just just only reacted to you know what was they're being forced to do um and then there said this is where we're you know we're gonna out of compassion you know for people in our society we're going to you know and in fact we're we're gonna try to um to tell our neighbors and friends and other people you know that they should they should be social distancing and that's a work of christ's church you know to of compassion for those who are vulnerable you know so there i felt like there's a lot of places you could go with that leadership moment so it was kind of interesting to see um where people went i kind of like to uh i think paul and eric i read the emails and the communications you guys sent out and and i remember distinctly the love for neighbor angle of this i think of and that idea started to come out and and that kind of changed my way of thinking in the way of seeing this too of us staying apart temporarily as a way to love our neighbor right protect and limit the spread of covid virus is a loving act to do so that that framing helps us to also at least for my church when i communicated the same thing to them when we were decided to shut down and and you know and and met that so that one was helpful really and and you know what you got how you guys framed this now now eric i hadn't heard um uh reno on first things i hadn't seen that article until you tweeted it out you had some strong words on twitter maybe you're uh he's gonna he's gonna block my me from following him now on twitter because i i follow eric closely because i respect him and he he finds interesting things and so so dirksen you responded to uh reno on on first things what were some of your thoughts and then where are you at now strangely twitter is my safe space paul and you're ruining it for me twitter is a very poor choice for a safe space my reaction to reno so reno's piece if you if you didn't read it which he then followed up even more bizarrely to my mind with like two or three more sort of doubling down um i i thought um i thought reno's piece actually had some interesting points to make which which perhaps could have been made thoughtfully but couched in the language and tone that he did just felt like sort of the knee jerk um the feel of it to me was like okay well this is knee-jerk political you know anti-anti-trump kind of thing not that i immediately want to go there but that's how it felt when i read it first one first one to name donald trump in a video there you go i think that the tweet that you're referencing i i think i said something like this reeks of of dualism and i was a little bit surprised as a segue both the reno piece and then even some of the things that that responded to it and even some of the sort of internal dialogue in a denomination that is reformed i was surprised at how little reformed reflection we seem to be having along the lines of um you know sort of a forgive me for this too but a doya weirdean sphere sovereignty kind of angle to well who should we be listening to and while yes it is very much my job my role to um shepherd the spirituality of the people under my care to teach them to pray to love them well and so forth and so on i also feel like this was an opportunity to be reformed and to say like hey you know there are health experts and dear clergy let's stay in our lane a little bit here um we're being told this and you know you can respond to it as the government's telling me something but i didn't feel that way i didn't we weren't responding to the government we were responding to our own leadership and um and others that you know you just had to be online and read some of these things and so um yeah i thought the reno piece and some of the responses um reeked of sort of a dualism between uh that that kind of thing that noel mentioned um either you're loving your neighbor or you know you only care about materialism or something i mean it was sort of growth i thought it was grotesque and and click baity um but got me to click yeah i read all three pieces and then got angry and stopped tweeting about them so and you know i really i really like you know part of what i think this moment affords us is a time to see ourselves in what for many of us is a rather unique situation where there are a lot of things coming at us quickly uh playing armchor quarterbacks observing people in past centuries or other countries judging them for the decisions that they make now suddenly when things come quickly at us we have leadership moments we have to make calls you know what what goes into these decisions what responses do we make i think all of this is is interesting is interesting for us now another comment very quickly on the heels of this was and just like that we're all televangelists um and that that wasn't that one i don't know if you tweeted that eric um so suddenly god forbid so suddenly we're in a situation which is now a little bit of digging in history you realize that the pandemic in 1918 1919 1920 you know church is closed for that we that you know suddenly there we don't have a response to this for many of us in our in our seculum in our space that we have institutional memory for so now we have to go digging in files and googling and all of this to begin to read how past leaders paid attention to it but it's also unique in that whereas let's say in 1918 churches might suspend services well what then what does the pastor do does the pastor do home visits does the you know exactly how to respond and one of the things that i think a few years from now which however that looks we will begin to pay attention to is how in this moment we had all of these social media tools and the internet through which to try to do something okay and i think my church is a little different in that it became very quickly it became apparent very quickly that a few of my members don't have broadband at all the one technology that was ubiquitous within the church was the telephone and the mailbox but you know in terms of zoom or something like that so let's so let's now kind of go to the moment when you realized um yeah folks aren't going to be coming into this room now for at least a few weeks and now the further we get down this we're beginning to realize maybe a good bit longer but we don't know how do we care for the flock and then we're going to have to think about i mean all three of your churches to my knowledge do weekly communion yes um and so so walk through some of that for me well we we decided to um we're a fairly young congregation um with a few older folks but they they seem for the most part to be pretty technologically savvy so we decided we wanted to try to um have various touch points as far as like direct care early on so we were going to try to um care for our people and that's kind of language that we were using right away like it wasn't uh it wasn't how do we get more clicks in a time of covid it was um we have people that we care about and that are that consider this their their congregation and it's our it's our job it's our role to care for them well so how do we do that well um we talked about print so like the very when as soon as we made the decision we made a couple of decisions simultaneously one was um i'll write a daily reflection and send it out via email um one was let's do some evening prayer for people uh via zoom just to give them that kind of a touch point during the week um and then the third was um i was sending liturgy i was i was creating an at home liturgy for people to use and the first few weeks we didn't do anything online in terms of like sunday we can talk about how that developed a little bit but um the first few weeks i i wrote a liturgy and then people for them to use at home so our goal was um print or you know email um a couple of things per week of the opportunity to gather via zoom and then sunday at home liturgies and i just encourage people those first few weeks do them let's do them together at 10 you know i kept saying we'll be together in practice if not in person and so we'll be doing the same practices here's the liturgy that we're working through here's the prayers that we're working through um i think i even made some kind of cheesy reference to those early videos from like spain or italy of people singing out their balconies and you know go ahead and throw up in your windows and sing the doxology at 10 10 and maybe you'll hear a neighbor doing it i doubt it but you know hey why not that's that that was our initial response um okay and that came out of and you know we can loop back to this once once we hear from mark and noelle but i think that came out of our philosophy of ministry and how we do things and um that i'll leave it there for now talk about what everybody else did are you still writing daily reflections yeah okay okay yeah there they go out to our email list they're on our facebook page and they get they get put out on twitter by our church twitter account i do not retweet those how about you mark what what um i mean what what did that look like for you yeah we we decided to give it a go uh with zoom we have a pretty young congregation so and it's been working out pretty good little learning curve each week um what do you do via zoom yeah so so we actually just take took our liturgy that we already were using and it um it is more you know liturgical compared to a lot of american church worship services so it starts with a um you know like it has these main parts of like this gathering part where it's like a call to worship and then uh confession of sin time where there's a prayer we all kind of say in unison and then some silence and then there's you know preaching and then there's uh or there's passing of the piece there's preaching there's communion and then kind of like the benediction so all these pieces are there um and we just did all the same things and we were surprised to find how with some tweaks each week that we could we could have a i mean the the distance is still there the social the distance and the awkwardness of just and a little bit of that hollowness of we're just not with each other in the same way is still there and it's just it's a sad hard part of it but with that there they've they've worked out really well you know as far as they can can to make it a kind of an engagement together and um and they've allowed the format has allowed for like a participatory feel so that and there's some technological things along the way that have helped that to figure out and figure out how to do that but um yeah i was kind of surprised and then we have a few people who are maybe above 50 years old in our congregation but not very many so and those those folks loved it and they they figured it out and um yeah so that's what that's what we did do you do music over zoom we actually do yeah so what is what does that look like i mean are you at home doing this because mark's got some musical skills and so are you just doing it all is it this is this the mark show over zoom on sunday morning and you do the music and you preach and yeah right no it's actually a very big very much a group effort so that i'm um i don't want to get too in the weeds on it but i'm not doing i'm doing a small part in the same way that we had been before so i'm sort of like this pastoral presence stabilizing factor and i'm also the kind of i'm a little bit techie enough that i can i'm like the host of the call the way you are paul so you're you know you're dealing with people needing to come in the call and stuff like that and so i found i'm able to do that and yet so we have like a liturgist and so that person would do most of the service you know up to the like the sermon part and then there's a there's a feature for breakout rooms so i i'm the host i i can click on that and shoot everybody to these smaller groups for passing of the piece to just have five minutes to chat with some other random people who are on the call and say hi and catch up so and that so you know and then we balanced it i think one of the things right away that i sensed was um we needed to have some because everybody's muted throughout this thing except for the few people participating and so the first first sunday it seemed clear to me we had to have like a hey stick around if you have prayer concerns and we'll have a prayer time over the call for anybody wants to stay on and so that that was that it's worked out great so we've done that every time and that's where okay and everybody's unmuted who's on and it's usually like you know eight to 15 people and it's just worked out nicely and then we discovered the breakout room thing to allow for a passing of the peace moment towards the beginning too that that loosened things up and warmed things up a little bit too so yeah do you how many people do you get on your zoom call then just i mean is it 15 30 i mean zoom could go to 100 yeah we've been we've actually um stephanie is the administrative assistant and she right after the first week she started this like spreadsheet keeping track and it was interesting because i you know you might see so many boxes but she kept the totals of well how many people are in all those boxes you know maybe there's like a couple kids running back and forth in the background and you know people coming and going but um yeah so we we got a really we've been getting way better turnout at this this this way than we were getting live so i don't know what to do with that maybe we'll just keep doing this but uh yeah we no longer have to pay rent we're a strict right zoom church yeah yeah yeah you know there's gonna be weird things that come out of this there might be some strictly zoom churches that and we'll get we'll talk about that eric don't worry we'll talk about that strictly zoom well you know paul that it's a good question so like we happened to find a musical person that got that was able to deal with this technology and we made connected with him and he had only played at our church one sunday before this and it was a brand new like here's this guy we're trying him out and then the next week and he's got these gifts to be able to do this you know on a call and so it's kind of like you know it's not like it's like hey there's a song playing it's really good and it's drawing you in and some people are singing along you can see the words are on the screen because we integrate like a google slides thing and then there's a couple of musicians who are volunteer musicians who are just playing along they're muted on the screen but they're playing along to the song because they just love music and so they're and then we do communion but we just we're just like hey you know you have you're gonna have to gather your own elements and so those those things have just been interesting how to do music how to do how to make it a little bit warm how to do communion because one of the first things i emailed our group or a couple people in our group and i said hey what are you guys thinking about what is the church if we're all stopping meeting we've had this real the safety net of like you know the preaching of the word and the celebration of the sacraments and as these two of the three marks of the church so okay i mean i it honestly took my foundation out a little bit like i had to have some dialogue and and figure that out you know what are we right now you know so all that's left is church discipline you better show up there better be a box if you're not on a zoom call we're coming for you i'm sorry pastor my webcam doesn't work i swear the third mark of the church well we'll come back we'll come back to some of the theological reflection noel what what happened what happened with you guys yeah so uh that tuesday when we decided not to meet um it was immediately just getting to improvise and um we we decided to record our my sermon so we did a video recording uh first time ever i had to do that i should just do audio so that was interesting and it wasn't too big of a deal it was just get a phone and a good audio going on and and uh record it and uh put it up um i didn't want to have to do any graphics you know uh you know editing and graphics and so on so we just decided to put our tv display up there for the verses and illustrations and whatnot and when we posted it online i had to prepare liturgy the same thing as you all for them to do at home that changed somewhat but we tried to keep the same uh flow um a lot of prayers uh prayers for covet and um calvin's issue of worship was really helpful they had those resources there and i could just go use and see what others were doing which was great for our denomination that was really helpful um we had a prayer meeting on facebook messenger and that first sunday we had our highest attendance ever in our prayer meeting it's interesting and just praying for everybody and for the situation and for our members and so we're sort of doing the same thing still i do wednesday night discipleship training and we use webex it's just our bias we didn't want to use zoom we had a member that was with cisco and used webex so we use webex just simply because we were used to it some say it's more secure i don't know um but yes we're and that's been our mo since you know for the past few sundays now so so what so now pull up my calendar again to do a little bit of counting um so now we've done this we'll get into the lenton easter aspect maybe a little bit after this but now we've done it for a few weeks and various different things what what are you reflecting on what have you learned what is what you know what are you thinking about with respect to this what have you learned about the church and what it is and what it isn't and what it should be well paul um well i think i was thinking right before i i jumped on here that in some ways um things aren't that different and and by that i mean um what's what's really unique is we're all going through the same thing at the same time it's a global pandemic well what's not unique is that everybody has their own experience of it and their own response to it so and that's that's true in in church too right like you have i've got people that are clamoring for community and so they're going to be on every zoom call that we have um i've got people that are working uh 12 hours a day on zoom and so they're sending me text messages like thank you so much for what you're doing but god help me i cannot be on another zoom call and i you know i love you i appreciate what you're doing but no it's not going to happen you know my evenings i'm just i'm gone maybe not even sunday morning if you know we do something like that so um and then you know there's the there's everybody in between who's you know going to do things once in a while and not do everything so in some ways i've been like yeah you know people are people and we've got different responses to each you know to the same what's what's unique is we're all responding to the same thing we're just responding to it differently any of the rest of any what have you what have you learned at least from doing this on zoom or or not being together social media is definitely helpful um and i've had to you know there's a i think for all of us crash course in technology i have a little bit of a experience with technology and so on so it wasn't a difficult transition but i do i sense that some of our members aren't very fond of it of having to go and you know simple things and particularly for the older folks in our congregation of having to install an app and join there it was it was hard it's it's um there's challenges to it basically right and a few of our small groups are meeting online still and uh again using web x or zoom and um hey it just felt it's awkward i think it takes um we're i'm still not used to it and we were in it what like four or five weeks now it doesn't um i long for going back to the way things were i miss it the way it works for a while but i don't know if it's sustainable that's the way i feel so it's so it's just and and what when you not sustainable what does that what what activities what would that look like not sustainable i think the challenge in connecting and um being able to see and each other when you're having that conversation the the absence is felt right yeah that's it i think it's hard to be hospitable that's the best way to go say it it would not that's a good way to say it actually yeah it's a good way to say it now eric you've had some pretty strong you made a comment if it was on twitter or the effect of it was on twitter too i love the the the window into the dirks in mind via twitter is is truly um a precious thing but to the effect of you know the churches the churches that don't practice weekly communion were the ones who jumped at you know virtual online communion the quickest something to that effect you made that way more scandalous than it was it was a simple and i felt like i stepped in it it was a simple um observation anecdotal but it was seemed to me a simple observation that i had a lot of colleagues who very early were clamoring for how do we do communion online and most of them in the circles that i am in seem to be churches that didn't take weekly communion but i thought it was a really important observation because i think there's something there i think there's plenty there uh i just want to note that i wasn't making anything other than an observation on twitter but everybody just assumes you know you say you say a thing and they're like oh well he means this maybe i did but i didn't i didn't say it that way now i you know i know that there are there are plenty of churches that take weekly communion i don't know about plenty but there are some marx is an example who have who have done it online and continued to but my experience has been he's the exception city life is the exception and others haven't and so it came primarily from you know friends in anglican churches but it was also the rca pca others like that yeah do you have communion in the liturgy that you send out me yes no no we have not been taking communion virtually a few weeks ago i started including a prayer for spiritual communion which i jonathan warn is an anglican priest in pittsburgh i think he is now and he wrote to me a pretty compelling piece on spiritual communion and how the church has often historically been in times where it couldn't partake together and some of it was just like a personal bias like i'm i had no desire to do communion online but some but primarily it was the logical like i thought i thought it's okay to long for it for a bit now you could ask me again in a few months if this is still going on you know are we still doing it i i kind of hope so but um so what's the problem i kind of hope that we're still not um i hope that because i have theological reasons for it um you you hope that if we're not meeting together we because because i want to be clear just for the sake of your reputation yeah thank you if we're not meeting together you're not doing communion separately in your liturgy that's what you meant that is what i'm hoping yeah i i don't want to um because there's a principle behind it now and so just because things get more difficult down the road i don't want to abandon the principle that's that's the simple point that i was trying to make there poorly but okay trying to make it any now mark you are doing weekly communion have you done any theological reflection on that not a lot um just initially just to say um um i think kyle brooks the church planter in in uh oakland just um said something that seemed compelling and to to to give it a shot you know online and um you know and the idea that that i felt like um you know my role as a minister of of the word and which includes the kind of the blessing of the church to oversee communion um you know the kind of the idea that well we i can still effectively oversee it through this call you know that was kind of the thing that i had to the hurdle i had to get over so but it has been um it has been it's not like we're getting this in fact i created a feedback kind of form that is going out like today to our church just of ministry in general over this time and how for our whole church of like how has ministry affected you good bad what would you change or what's been great and so i look for it because i don't i don't feel like i'm getting this huge amount of feedback about how we're ministering but i am getting just uh you know people are coming like very faithfully to those calls and they're participating in the communion and they're staying afterwards for prayer and so attendance seems to be saying they're it's connecting you know um so that's in terms of communion that's it has it has been non-problematic and anti it hasn't been like a conflict area or a problem area in any way so yeah noel what have you done with communion uh we're we did communion together online for easter that's the first one and i we have this liturgy for communion and i focused the camera there they saw me physically breaking bread and pouring the wine and of course all of us had to prepare our own bread and wine at home but that was the first time we did it and we never did communion in the whole you know those previous weeks i don't anticipate us doing it again together and like i think for theological reasons i also would rather do it when we're together well probably do what mark is doing now that i've heard you doing it it's do it all together just copy you guys you know shamelessly um ironically my that first sunday we were that we weren't you know we had to meet online um my text was in matthew where jesus you know on Passover and you know was uh breaking the bread and pouring the wine and teaching his disciples this is his body and his blood and i couldn't do communion but i didn't want to change the sermon so um that was a very good explanation for why yeah that sunday of you know why we couldn't do it and why you know what it was so it was a teaching moment and providential to that i happened to be in you know scheduled to preach on that text it's it's interesting to me too also in this moment we're so i was fascinated you know when i was thinking about the communion aspect i was fascinated by the fact that bishop baron who is a obviously very high profile roman catholic bishop on you know they were doing you know daily communion on youtube with or on the internet with people and and the roman catholic church is an interesting case because they the i mean roman catholics had large television ministries going on fairly early radio ministry and so for a very ancient church their um embrace of technology is is is noteworthy i don't know if the orthodox are doing anything similar to it um and and so then these questions of physical presence non-physical presence communion what does our what does our physical presence mean together in one space how does it impact us psychologically emotionally theologically what's the significance of it you know suddenly all of these issues which are things that i hadn't given a tremendous amount of thought to um suddenly are all at the fore and are not just sort of little corners where we're thinking you know what is it what is it when i visit a shut-in and bring communion to the shut-in or the nursing home or something like this now suddenly we have this on a on a large scale um what i mean obviously time we don't know sort of how this is going to unfold in terms of meeting together what what have you learned in terms of as you've been trying to care for the congregation because so i've been doing just for those who don't know i've been doing weekly videos not unlike other videos that i had been making for a while because that's what i knew how to do we don't have any professional um musician well we it didn't seem that the musical the anyway that's the way we've done it so far and we didn't go to zoom partly because i knew that i was terrified at what it would mean for if i could actually deploy it with a lot of our older members and so we've been doing facebook and youtube for some sermon videos and people can you know watch along with that there's some interchange in facebook um facebook comments during the during the rollout and the playing the first playing of the video but one of the things that we did early on was the council is trying to keep in touch with the members of the church each week they have some kind of touch point that might be a phone call it might be a text but making sure that everyone's okay what are what are you learning about um the well-being of your flock during this period and now that we're weeks into this and don't really quite know when lockdowns will end what what are you learning on that score how are people doing i just i'd like to jump in because i like when we decided we weren't meeting and i my brain was sensing and my heart was sensing a like this is a moment you know this is a and something kind of a switch win in on inside of me in terms of leadership and just like this this this sense of like i want to step up to this moment i want to be you know this is this is big this is a flock i'm i'm you know shepherd of the flock and i have to wrap my mind around what where we're going and how i guide them there whatever and and i don't i still feel like my attitude has been i'm very curious i don't know where this is all going i don't know what god's going to do through this but to keep voicing that to everyone else too we don't know but god is up to something and just guiding with that open curiosity of not knowing exactly how god's going to use all this but one of the things that i felt very clear about is just to call as many people every week as i could so i i just made a list or i took the list and i just started making a spreadsheet of calling people and just trying to get through the whole list it's still a few weeks into trying that and i don't even know i might be a little over halfway but because it just it takes time but it's actually i've been really struck with how meaningful that is and praying with people over the phone you know ending every call if i almost every call like with praying with them about the things that they have going on in their lives and so it's been a real practical way that like i've been able to stand behind what i've been telling the church at this time is um let's see if in this time of mandatory social distancing if we can't come out the other side of it closer instead of more distant from each other and so my way to do that is to just call everyone up and just say how are you doing what prayer requests do you have how's this affecting you and just listen you know and then pray for them so um that's been a huge that's been really enjoyable um it's been i don't know just it's been really meaningful and enjoyable for me to be able to do that what have you heard from people i mean nothing specific obviously right let's hear that dirt out of single life church i think you know just the variety you know it's so different everything's so different um it's striking to hear to hear the real struggles that are on you wouldn't think of so like the the husband who's uh like an icu nurse and the wife who his wife is a teacher and then they have these two little ones at home like that are preschool age uh like toddler based and and teachers having to supposedly still teach from home so the struggles of all of that you know the fears and all the things wrapped up in just that couple just that household you know of the icu stuff but also the education stuff and um you know just just like i'm trying to keep my kids you know on several days like i got it in our house lisa's off three days a week doing at a clinic so she's in the health profession and i'm three days a week now i'm the boarding school director with the class lessons and the and oh it's time for me to make a meal for everyone again you know it's like just oh it's snack time you know just like whoa this is crazy um and so to think of doing that but also have a full-time job that i have like you know i have to be keeping these students that are all over the place going on their work while i'm dealing with my new home situation so some of that stuff just blows my mind and then there's some people who you know job insecurities or losses that strike me we've had a couple people who um coming being connected virtually has been a brand has been like a breath of fresh air because they had certain things going on in their life they couldn't come on sundays for like a half a year or whatever and all of a sudden they feel way more in touch and ministered to and integrated um it's been a huge blessing for some people you know that way so those are some of the just some of the things that i'm picking up on but interesting yeah any other observations from what's happening in people's homes well for me personally um because i'm bi-vocational um and the company i work for is profiting pretty well because a lot more people are buying computers because they're working from home um it's in use so um but there i i there's a blur between i i i struggle with separating personal time and work oh yeah because i'm working from home you know every every morning and of course there's river rock so from a bi-vocational perspective um i do have to go and make sure that the time i have is you know you get work done in that job as well as river rock i've been grateful with uh how these existing small groups have you know we have a women's group we have a friday bible study group we have this discipleship training wednesdays and a few other people are meeting through zoom praying together and so on and you know we have praying together and so on and just the community figuring out ways to go online with themselves um it's good to meet them you know in these meetings i try to be in those small group meetings so that we because we talk about our lives and how we're affected and who's affected and you know who do we need to be praying for um sunday prayer meetings are always good that seems to be our de facto sunday meeting time is to just meet for prayer so i while i don't have as much time to go talk to them one one by one at least these small groups are helping me at least keep in touch with them and and uh somehow still be able to to understand know what's going on in their lives and how i can be praying for them um but yes this this thing's just uh the home and the home front and churches to me the juggling those two is uh it's been an interesting experience so far everything happy and davis there dirksen well i was going to repeat what i said before that i've been struck by how people are responding differently to it you know some similar to mark i call some people and they're like now we're good thanks for checking in um maybe talk to you in a week or two um and i call other people and um they're barely hanging on by a thread you know they got small kids and they're like i didn't sign up for this i you know you could just see it um we delivered so on palm sunday um we delivered palm fronds to everybody and maintained social distancing and it took like 10 hours oh it's crazy over two days i should say friday yeah um it was a delight just to see people first of all but even the reactions there were so varied it was like a window into kind of where people are um some people were like i had somebody say to me not that long ago you know i actually i feel guilty that that i i'm doing really well you know and i i know the world seems to be coming apart in various places and i've got friends who are whose nerves are frayed but i'm going to be honest with you i just had a really busy like two months at work and home life was kind of chaotic and i felt like i never saw my kids and all of a sudden i get this i get to be with them and it's kind of quiet and i'm doing pretty good and i feel guilty about that um i delivered palm fronds to the home of a young family and the moment we could hear them through the door they're like it's the dark sins and the moment they open the door just tears yeah um just that kind of contact was so missing and they've got you know small kids and i can barely imagine i've just got teenagers these days and that's a different ball game but um i've just been struck by how you know people are doing it differently and handling it differently not not some better than others just differently you know the introverts seem to be doing the best revenge of the introverts the extroverts get all the and now the introverts are like huh huh how do you like me now i'm at home and happy yeah yeah yeah i do notice a lot more social media activity some of our members you know how to see how they're doing it's a window into their lives and how they're coping with kids at home a few of our members have college kids that are at home and um spending more time together doing things together and um yes you're right eric it's people respond differently and um seems to be a lot more family time now than usual for many and appreciate that a lot if there's one positive thing that's for that we have a few members that lost their jobs and uh coping so it's various different things and experiences that that brings me to my next topic which is finances and church now in our congregation we you know most churches survive financially off the donations and gifts and offerings and tithes of their membership which at least in our congregation still works with passing of plates and physical paper checks going in we have hardly anyone in our church that gives online and so many of our members have been mailing in sending in i've yet to get a report from the deacons in terms of what you know it'll be interesting to see what march and then especially april looks like i've been thinking about the fact that well this church is this building is paid for you know we have my salary we have utilities a few other little things deacons have a benevolence fund that we haven't really had to tap in and help anyone directly with the majority of my membership either works for the state or is retired and so their income you know the stock market going up and down but for the most part a lot of their incomes are sort of set but i was i've been thinking a lot about you guys because um your churches are younger you have probably more people who have lost their jobs had financial insecurity um what's what's been happening financially with your church and how long can you ride this out and do you think about that let me start um we did get our january to march financial report and we were probably down about three thousand from where we were a quarter ago but that's smart that's so it um i was it wasn't as bad as i thought it was and i think we have enough in the reserves to last us through the maybe in the next few months where we will be in a reasonably healthy position um giving has definitely been down april's going to be interesting we'll see how that that works um it's good that i'm a part-time pastor so you know that helps somewhat with the expenses it's really just me and the rent uh that we're and the lease that we uh have to pay so financially we're okay um online donations that's what we're relying on um we have that set up in our website that's where most people give how about how about you guys you guys you guys are both full-time um salaried by your churches um you both have you're not new new churches um neither of you well i don't um you don't neither of you have i i think actually think a lot about churches that have big mortgage payments and because you know all of us here know some churches that have you know five figures a month that they're paying on a facility and they've got staff salaries you know in especially in evangelical churches if you have a church that grew fairly large you got a fairly healthy income stream let's say in an affluent suburb but also fairly high costs usually almost no savings but but first before we get into speculating about the future where are you two at uh river rock and or not river rock but um city life and and christchurch davis how are you guys doing well i can just go quickly um i'm really curious to hear about eric you know having bought a bought a building right like in the last few years so but um we still rent our rent's pretty cheap and i'm i'm a pretty big expense as the only full-time you know um staff person but um we've been stable and there hasn't been a noticeable change one way or the other um and we'll see how that all goes you know and i plan on everyone in our congregation giving half of their stimulus check to just kidding totally kidding totally kidding joking i know they're not they're not watching this video i'm totally kidding um yeah no we that that has come up though we're actually encouraging people who you know we know there's some people who really need it and there's some people who have you guys have already talked about people who say well i'm i actually feel really blessed right now and so we've been um some of us feeling like we're in that position and so then it's like just just encouraging people here's some things you could give to when that check comes but um yeah we're not really scared financially of anything right now and i think that's part of the curiosity and the trust in god during this time like what is god doing how is god sustaining um so um so so far as i know we're doing okay i think i haven't gotten any notification from our deacons or finance team that you know any alarm bells are ringing i think um we're doing there's literally someone sitting over there that just said we're doing okay in my experience clergy are reticent to talk about this lay people are a lot more practical and pragmatic about it yeah i was you know as a church planter i get technically i still am so for years i was signing my own checks and then we grew up and i've got a leadership team and deacons who follow and track these kinds of things and so i i it's no longer my job praise the lord to check on what the bank account looks like and i'm perfectly happy to keep it that way um even though we're yeah we're fairly young but i think i would be curious i don't know the number but i think a pretty small percentage of our our giving is actually on sunday not not none but you know i think a pretty small percentage um so in that sense so far as i know um you know the not being there on sunday may have had may have had some impact uh similarly a lot of our people have been able to work from home and so um uh yeah there's you know some furloughs but for the most part even just sort of thinking out loud a majority of our people are are still pulling a paycheck um and as far as buying buying a building um we bought a building two years ago uh but decided when we first were going to do it very quickly in that story that we weren't going to do it unless we could pay cash and it was a smoking good deal so we don't have a mortgage um thankfully and that turned out to be you know hindsight is 2020 and the lord is kind and merciful but that was a really good decision to not take out a big loan and be worried about things these days yeah so what's what's going on in other churches around you guys that you're noticing i mean we all have you know we have our internal christian reform network but then we also have other networks in other churches what kind of things are you hearing out there in the broader church you know there's the different levels right there's the things you see in the news like the the group in southern california who's suing the governor um pastors for telling them not to meet you have but it's interesting because i i think eric might have alluded to this or you talked about a tweet a tweet that he tweeted um about uh just what people jumping into the virtual thing so it's been interesting to see how this brings out the personality of churches because what city life is doing right now over zoom is very much us because it's we're not really worried about oh this this looks real shiny and has a we got a green backdrop and we're doing everything perfect and we're dialing in a mixer with sound but um thank you it's coffee delivery wow yeah it's decaf for the afternoon there's lisa there's lisa hey lisa hi it's so great to see you photobombing she's photobombing my channel paul says you're photobombing his channel oh end the meeting end it next she sends in the kids exactly oh that's good what were we talking about oh yeah i i would just pass it on i just find it interesting it brings out the personality of churches because i'm on some lists of churches and so i see like oh you know join us for worship or the video has released of our worship and it's like oh that's that's very much them and that would not be us you know and um and even sometimes you'll pick up on some some folks in your church who say all these other churches are doing that and you you know them well enough to know they've got a little part of them that would love a glitzier thing or a whatever thing you know and and it's just kind of it's kind of cute and but you know i i watch them i just i'm like man i'm so glad i'm i'm a good fit for my church and for what we are because i'll look at something else and i'll think that just doesn't feel feel edifying to me and i don't think our people would would like that but and i'm speaking specifically of the ones where it's more of a almost like a music video song and then it's a you know like a ted talk video of a person with no audience and you know it's kind of okay but some people love it and i've heard i've heard neighbors talk i just moved and so i moved in this new neighborhood and some people are introducing themselves and saying how they go to a church but how so-and-so put me on to this brooklyn tabernacle website and i've been every sunday turning on one of their old services and it's wonderful and you know for one person that is church you know that nails it and that wouldn't be what they wouldn't have that same reaction if they came in on one of our zoom calls so well i i had so i so we did this little video thing and i was talking to one member of the church and she was like she's like oh i was just you know this is an older person so i just go to tv church now and it's like whatever i'm doing i mean she's not going to be able to find it on the internet or anything like that and so it's you know it's it's charles stanley for the duration and you know i was talking to my mother and my mother does my mother does her church pleasant street and then park street which was my sister and brother-in-law's my brother-in-law's church his first sunday pastoring was the first sunday of the pandemic the only church he's known as the empty park street congregational and then my and so on sunday me and my mother's just kind of clicking between all of these churches and comparing the sermons and so mark your point there is that gets going to get us to the the next point which is going to be the future but this people are watching and i look at what some services are doing some videos out there it's like you know wow these people have staff they have production quality they have camera work and it's like yeah um if it's if this is a competition between shows um you know the the balls corner of the office show but anyway don't sell yourself short yeah i tell you the uh the words of tim blackman and chuck dillander uh still like you know remember it well the uh what you win them with is what you win them to yeah yeah i think that's showing up quite a bit and resist the temptation to make it into a production yeah so yeah try to be a little bit more i said if we were going to do online it's just going to be for river rock and not not use it as a marketing tool i think is what we try to keep it as much as possible so yes and even remember that in this time i uh i actually um i talked about this in my easter sermon this sunday but i actually really am concerned about um i don't know what quite quite what to do with it but i'm thinking about cornelius hearing the easter message from peter um and inviting everyone he knows and packing the house and and um i had some fun with that about social distancing and um jews you know jews supposed to social distance from from gentiles but but i honestly i yeah it made me want to talk about and try to figure out how to guide our church towards considering we've always had from the very beginning the idea very crucial to who we are who is yet not in the room and who who you know who thinks church is just for people with their beliefs screwed down tight and so we're never going to step in there and to be a church that that people get the sense of this is a place where i don't have to have my beliefs screwed down tight and i can just be there for as long as needed so so so that part of our identity you know the the cornelius inviting you know thinking of all the people who don't know the easter message yet um you know it just makes me i don't know a combination of like just curious nervous you know i don't have the answers on how the church continues to embody that um in this time so you know any other observations any of you have about the church beyond us and our congregations in terms of what's what you see or hear going on with this i've been fascinated to see maybe three maybe three not that not that it's this tidy but um i've observed i think sort of three main kinds of of churches there are those um well maybe i'm backtracking already but it seems like uh philosophy of ministry is now to the four once again and so you either have one and you're embracing it i guess let me put it this way you either have a self you have a stated philosophy of ministry and you're embracing it um or you don't realize you have a philosophy of ministry and you're just doing whatever um or yeah i don't know i lost my train of thought there but um i'm i'm sort of fascinated by my colleagues who say we just seamlessly put things online and it's been no no big deal um there's something there it's a great sound effect by the way eric thank you that's my tech savvy thing um there have been other uh congregations or colleagues that are like you know i don't know um it just seems like everybody else is doing this so we're gonna do it too without seemingly pausing to reflect whether that does fit them in the way that mark talked about you know their zoom call fitting city life and um so that that's sort of fascinated me to kind of watch whether whether people are being reflective in how we go forward or whether you're just doing stuff because that's what other people are supposed to be doing but or because that's what you think you're supposed to be doing um i've i've observed i've thought the last couple of weeks for sure that uh similar to mark just the last two weeks on palm sunday and then at easter we've been doing a zoom call for our services and uh the response to that has been overwhelmingly positive what i was doing was um an at-home liturgy that people would work through themselves and then i would do like a five minute video of a meditation not a sermon but just five minute video usually sitting right here on the text for the week and then people could watch that on their own um the last two weeks though we've done a zoom call and that has felt very christ church as well and people have been really responded really positively um to that and and i'm so i'm i'm meandering way of thinking i've also got colleagues so i've heard they're like i'm i'm fatigued by live stream i am fatigued by uh preaching to an empty room um and that's fascinating to me as well i mean i'm sick of zoom but that feels different are you when you are it sounds like noel you're doing sunday morning from your rented facility from your worship space mark are you doing yours from home or do you go down to right there in your new home yeah this is where you'll find me sunday mornings and it's a closet so you'll find me here every morning picking out my shoes that i'm gonna wear for the day it's a walk-in closet yeah and how about you eric do you do it from from your church building uh no you do it from home yeah i i thought about going to um i thought about being at our our facility fort easter and then i was actually planning on it and then that just didn't feel right like um i didn't feel like solidarity with my people who couldn't be there but wanted to um so we you know we stayed home and we put the whole family on on one of these zoom calls and wordbox that takes up five people and we work through the liturgy together that way so let's imagine i i think it's i would imagine that there's going to be a slow opening of things i mean the governor had a talk yesterday where he talked about some of it's a dimmer switch not an on off switch and i would imagine churches are going to be at the tail end of things that open and so it is conceivable i kind of doubt we'll see anything in may it's conceivable we might not see anything towards september maybe they'll open with smaller groups and social distancing and older people stay home well what are some initial ideas and again i'm not going to hold anybody to any of this prognostication by any means because if there's one thing i think we should learn from this is that we don't know what's coming down the road because especially in those early days things looked very different one day to the next but what what how's this going to change you how's this going to change your your church how's this going to change the church i'm trying to think of some kind of joke about a plan to pre-record services for you know 20 services in a row so that i can just have all summer off i guess that's so that's the joke actually i just told you the joke i was trying to come up with and that was funny enough but yeah clever image you know i i think it's yeah i think it's gonna you know i i think it's yeah i think it's gonna be way longer than we think and i think there was a new york times piece someone told me about but i didn't read about four think think in terms of 14 months of you know um just you know if the if the if we're flattening the curve and a huge chunk of the people uh haven't been exposed to this virus then it's not just woohoo we're back open because then you just keep going through these waves of right but um and then i just saw a notification while we're on this call that um i think somebody like the mayor of la or something like that said they don't expect that we would they would expect that we're not going to see big gatherings like concerts and things like that in california until 2021 um i mean i think people are just starting to say okay let's look beyond flattening the curve and what does that mean and i i'm intrigued by that i'm really intrigued i don't have a lot of answers yeah at first it felt so far off to think like oh we have a summer camping trip planned for the church you know i'll probably 50 50 on whether that'll happen or not you know and that now it's starting to feel to me like that you know people will be saying like we don't want to be part of this you know maybe we can go here or there but we don't want to be responsible for a second wave you know a new cluster of an outbreak because we got 100 people together at a campsite you know especially in a church in sacramento after the church in rancho carlova it'll be you on the sacramento b mark being persecuted i'm fascinated by what what comes you know what the next month two months look like as well and it feels to me like postulating is just a fool's errand i don't know how i'm going to feel i i certainly don't know how anybody here is going to feel i i would imagine it's going to be as varied than as it is now you know if you can if if if the guidelines are no gatherings over 50 you know that's easy enough for a church my size if our weekly worship is around 100 on a good day then two services and we should be fine you know i have no idea what my colleagues will do who have a church of 500 or a thousand like you know no clue that looks much different from them i've i think maybe i said this already there are certainly some benefits to being a small church pastor during time like this but it just feels like who can guess what people's psyche is going to be and it's not it's certainly not going to be monolithic you might have people the first sunday that you can open your doors maybe you're expecting it to be packed because you think people are going to be clamoring in but maybe you get 20 people wearing masks and latex gloves looking at each other really like you know i don't know and you might have plenty of other people that are just running around waiting to give each other hugs and your elders are at the door you know punching people in the face for time i don't know who can tell yeah yeah nobody can i mean we we were talking about ventilators ad nauseum two weeks ago we're not talking about ventilators anymore are we i don't even know that much i'm talking about the economy now yeah yeah yeah one thing though i i did notice it's doing at least to me and and to a few of our members is it was amazing sunday easter sunday i went out because i had to go get some looking around for some electronic stuff there's a shortage of webcamps amazing enough but the big box stores were closed and around fulsome these geese and ducks and turkeys were just walking around the roads and few cars and i'm going like this is sabbath you know yeah and like man i can get used to this on a sunday like this that's how it looks like you know the strip mall has gone fallow it has yeah oh that's good mark you know and uh my we're in the suburb um kids sports are gone you know it's it's yeah it's new normal yeah yeah i hope it stays well any any any questions or things you all i've sort of been directing and guiding this but um anything points you guys wanted to make or questions you have or anything like that that we haven't talked about i i the similar to your question paul i've been sort of intrigued listening to not even listening but just kind of hearing casually here and there from some people who are wondering you know what is religion not just christianity but what does religion look like when this is all done and i'm sort of seeing two camps on this too like uh is this the final straw of secularism that it just you know breaks the camels back and and um you know if if if the economy is all about mergers and acquisitions and who can survive is the same thing true in the religious world where you know you just like the small church disappears because they run out of funds or you know all you've got left is the the glitz and glam of the of the thing online in the christian world or at least in the evangelical world or is this the end or is this secularism you know that that kind of comes in and this is the end people are like well i made it through without faith and i'm fine so nobody returns to church or is the opposite happening you know is this the beginning of a revival religious revival in in places around the world that was uh there were people making two opposite points in my twitter feed and one of them um i might butcher his name so uh forgive me it's uh sadi hamid is a muslim who writes for well he writes about a lot of things and i find most of them really interesting and compelling and um he was saying his opinion was this could very well be the beginning of a religious revival throughout much of the world like this could bring people back into or for the first time in touch with a religious experience or the desire for religion and um he was saying that as as a practicing muslim and i was sort of fascinated by that so there again i you know i think it's a fool's errand to postulate too much but there's a whole host of things that we don't know that i'm curious about about what happens you know the economy is fascinating churches are fascinating people's psyche is fascinating the number of people who have time to think that haven't had time to think i wonder about things like clergy like how many pastors have a whole lot of time now and they've just been like nose to the grindstone getting it done for 20 years maybe they've never had a sabbatical and now all of a sudden they've got a lot of time to think and reflect how many people are going to leave the ministry when this is done they're like you know what i i don't want to go back to it or how many people are going to redo their philosophy of ministry for their church and be like i'm not either i'm all in on the show or i'm not doing the show anymore i'm there are so many unknowns and so many things that are fascinating about this really good this huge thing that's happening right now that i don't know i just have a hard time believing we'll just all go back hmm wow yeah and i can just imagine the um where consumerism you know i i can see where ads and and the way we frame is for people to go back to normal we'd go do this buy this do that right um it'll sound hollow to many people i think that was the article that i read this morning that was posted by a member on facebook i just seem as if don't believe that right because we're we're not going to go back to what it was before i think that this does this is affecting people deeply in many ways and the absence of what they used to do normally i think is helping them realize what are the essentials and um i think a lot of people love church i i don't know that to me erik is where we're at least for me and a few others that i've talked to they do miss the church and i think it is i've just personally for me i've i mean this has been this has been really hard not being together on sunday i i probably didn't realize how dependent i am emotionally on that and so i my sunday routine now is i'll i'll walk here to church deal with the homeless people outside my office and that's normal and you know the irony is that i have more communion with the homeless than anyone else outside my family right now in terms of face to face um which of course makes my wife nervous but like nowhere to no other way to deal with it um but you know so i'll come in here and i'll i'll i'll make my video on eat on in the morning and um i i gotta upload it i've got faster internet at home so go back at home and upload it from there and um i just i just so miss being together with the people that i've shared the last 22 years of my life with in terms of my faith and it's um yeah it's it's really hard and actually some people in my church have talked about well maybe we should do a zoom type thing i i think i would find that even more difficult because it would feel that would make the distance feel that you know everybody monkeying with their phone and how does this work and you know suddenly unmute everyone and everyone talks at once and whereas at least talking to people individually on the phone it's you know that at least there's some connection so yeah i i agree that i i i don't know that any of us know what's coming out the other side of this and um yeah i we'll see we'll see we'll see and i i think that's you bring up a good point paul that um the colleague or two that i've that i've heard say we seamlessly put things online i actually worry about that for reasons of um like this should cause pain right this this this is something to lament and you know our zoom calls are um imperfect and um that's okay with me that's that like it should be a little bit messy it should be awkward and you should leave i think something like that with a bit of a pain and that's you know one of the reasons why i also were not taking communion which is not meant to be a judgment or anything but it is but um i also didn't want to rush right to let's just make it all be okay right like i think it was sort of a gift that this started in lint that it gave us the opportunity to to lament in in unique ways and be like yeah this isn't the way it's supposed to be um christian worship should be communal and embodied and participatory and those things have been ripped from us and so let's be sad about that and not just rush right into you know the christian world can just be another consumerist pill of let's just make the pain go away instead of what does faithfulness look like in the midst of suffering instead of trying to alleviate our suffering so um that said i'm very glad that it's easter time because that was getting to be a long lint and it's still not you know fun like our our easter time was both delightful and sad at the same time and um that just strikes me as i think where we're supposed to be you know at least this kind of a gut reaction like it's there's there's pain involved and um i think it gives us all like we're we should name that i uh i have a great curiosity for all this about where where god's taking it and just feel like a satisfaction sitting in a curious place and being a little bit anticipatory about what the future holds but when i guess about it then i what stands out most of probably just the two things of a lot of people are going to get sick and die and um it's already clear that a lot of people are going to be economically affected by this so if you just picture like people are saying this is a longer period so if this is another year or two of waves of covid 19 and the economy fall out i just think that we are going to have plenty of work to do as pastors and we're gonna it's you know two years from now i think we'll be a pretty banged up humanity who's had to just hold each other together in a lot of ways like i think that's where my mind goes but um yeah and then that makes me just want to grab whatever tool it doesn't really matter how just to get in the ditch with people through this time and um minister and let the gospel shine you know so good maybe that's a good word to end on unless any of you have anything else you'd like to put in um well i appreciate i don't know if we're if we're are we going to do our our our monthly cluster meeting next week on zoom on tuesday have we talked about that i we haven't talked about it but i would vote for a yes except that tuesdays are now one of my boarding school days so i might not be the best if we could switch it to wednesday or thursday but yeah maybe we should send out an email and yeah yeah because i would because i've i've enjoyed i've enjoyed talking to you guys about this and this is online and so we you know it's not appropriate to necessarily be as personal as candid as we are normally in a cluster gathering but um hi mom i didn't know this was going online sign was i supposed to sign something do that little red light up in the corner consent consent oh great now some lawyer's gonna you violated mark holland civil rights i'm like what again uh anyway thank you all for um participating and i i wanted to do this both in terms of documenting because we're not going to remember i've been reading um nassim talib's black swan and that first chapter where he talks about growing up in in and out of lebanon during the war years he talks about the fact that people's reflections in the middle of it are very different from their reflections afterwards and so i do want us to remember march and what we've been through and i want to document some of that but i think it's also you know one of the things that i actually got distracted by the roman catholic idea but you know so where how does leadership emerge in things like this and mark you talked about that so in some ways um andrew cuomo has you know his daily youth his daily presentations i mean in many ways he's been somewhat of a national leader as the the center of the crisis has been in new york but how does leadership emerge how i mean denominations i i think you know noelle you you talked about the the calvin um the calvin center calvin institute of worship which is is not specifically a denominational leadership but some of the denominational uh stuff have been helping and putting out things the network and network and but um so so again i i i find events like this ought not to be wasted by not taking a step back and paying attention because here we have an opportunity to watch individuals families communities and the church disrupted and i think eric i think eric your observation about um you know churches and their philosophies of ministry um you know having an intentional one or not having one sort of exposed and brought out to the world i think that's very true and on many levels a time of disruption like this helps it's it's apocalypse it's revelation and a lot is revealed and good and bad and so i think we ought not just have it fly by and 10 years from now oh yeah remember 2020 and the covid pandemic and blah blah blah blah blah blah so so what we're going through now is important and it won't be remembered unless it's articulated somehow and noted whether anybody ever cares go to go back and look at it who knows but i i think it's important and i like it on my channel because there's so many different people looking some people not at all involved in church some people skeptics about the whole thing or even church haters i like opening up the window and saying these are real pastors and real churches and this is how they're dealing with it and this is how they talk about it and this is how they think about it and i think that has value and i i know just listening to the three of you i've i've i've really appreciated and been helped just just hearing how you're going through it and that helps me so i appreciate it yeah thanks for hosting it this has been really really enjoyable well yeah wait for the comments tomorrow it goes up tomorrow morning so uh feel free to mark flips over yeah he's learned something on zoom sorry my next meeting is about to start all right let me just plug this www.riverrockchurch.org there you go all right all right i'll put all the links in the show notes .tv thank you my brothers this has been wonderful thanks paul thank you thank you guys take care see
