 Hi, this is Paul. Now, one of you sent me this video and this person who sent me this video sent me Malcolm and Simone and this person has a really good track record of sending me stuff so when she sends me things I usually watch them. And clearly from the beginning of this podcast I am doing it wrong because I am not wearing a black t-shirt and I am not working out as I should and I do not have a black background so that my, the whiteness of my beard could be just, you know, could just shine in the darkness but this was a really good video and it actually gives us a lot to talk about not just in terms of what is going on with YouTube and podcasting because that is sort of integral in terms of this community and I think it is in some ways integral in terms of what is going on but actually maybe I should play a different video first. It sort of happened on Twitter a couple of days ago or yesterday, seems like a couple of days ago. Paul Anleitner tweeted, the unedited long form conversation videos are going on Patreon these days using YouTube channel more for video essays. And I thought, oh that is interesting and so then I sort of retweeted that and said hierarchy is happening all over because here is these payment things and I do not know Paul's situation right now to what degree he is relying on social media for income or I should, Paul and I should probably talk again. I gave a video podcasting talking head thing a good try for years. Never quite landed in my corner of the internet like it has yours despite the overlapping spheres. Probably 90% of my YouTube subscribers came for the shorter video essays on philosophy, theology and movies etc. My best videos do not even have my face in it which I am trying to not take personally. Paul is a very good looking man if I do not say so. Got a great name too but your channel is a sign and a wonder Paul. I think you looked, I think if you looked at Karen Wong, Meaning Code, Parker Setteke, Sam's channel or even Preston Sprinkle who has some heavy hitters you will notice a lot of great conversations that can go virtually unnoticed in comparison to yours. Yeah, it was actually a few days before this that I went over and looked at Paul's channel and Godzilla minus one is an Oppenheimer sequel, 101K views. Godzilla minus one is a masterpiece, 250,000 views. Rafe Kelly, 369 views. And so again I have noticed this about YouTube that it is really interesting where the algorithm goes and what it does and what it does not do. It is a strange thing. And then Parker Setteke came in and he said seriously I started a new channel with shorter videos and I hit 125,000 subs. I cannot hit 30,000 subs myself but that is okay. And 4.5 million views in 10 months. I thought people liked Long Form on YouTube because of Rogan and Lex but they just like Rogan and Lex. And then Paul says Parker I definitely like you more than Rogan and Lex which I agree I like Parker better than Rogan and Lex too. And there is a lot of good stuff going on here but again it makes me think about okay what on earth is going on? And I mean my videos do not really get that. I know whenever I say this some of the other channels say but your videos get more than mine but my videos do not get a lot of views. Now there are some out there that have my biggest, no surprise, my biggest viewed video is my conversation with Jordan Peterson and then after that what does Jordan Peterson think of institutional racism? That is a very early video. But yeah not really a lot of things. Food Truck Emily video 1500 views. I was going to actually take a screenshot of that because even minus one subscriber. So I don't know. Sorry Emily someone doesn't like you they unsubscribe because of you. They probably unsubscribe because of me. The little short one I did with Guy that I put the wrestler on. That is fun. I like doing thumbnails sometimes. If I take the time to do it it's fun. Yes Jory video 619 views. The Dunbar number one 1.2k. Islam make me so so many of these videos. You know again John Vervecky between the two of them you know 6000 views. The biggest video I've had recently was not unsurprising my conversation with Jonathan Pigeot. That's over 20 views but most of my videos not that big. Not that many views. Every now and then one will go up above 3, 4, 5,000 but not that often. So what's going on? And then this morning I was listening to Christian Baxter and Pete talk and Pete has really been sort of following Joe Rogan which is super helpful and again I think it's part of this distributed cognition thing that we have going because ever since Joe Rogan went to Spotify I have this weird bug with this massive monitor I have right here that when I open up Spotify on this computer this monitor goes out and I've changed drivers and so I just never opened Spotify here and I don't use Spotify anyway but if Joe Rogan comes back to YouTube I might keep a closer eye on him but I don't really follow Joe Rogan so it's really handy to have someone like Pete follow Joe Rogan and so if Joe Rogan does something the feed will probably Pete will probably make a video of it and then that will come up and I can at least get the information from the title and thumbnail even if I don't have time to to watch the whole video. Now I really enjoyed the section talking about Thomas Kinkade that that that really moved me but that's not really the point of this video. It's more the question about what what is the internet doing? How is it changing things? That's what's happening and it did seem like this thing that well only a Joe Rogan can do this. Only a Dax Shepard can do this. Right. And you know like and because they're celebrities they were already celebrities and it's like well and it's only worth doing if you can have a following of X you know it's like yeah no maybe there's maybe there's something else going on here because I heard you say uh and I think we hit on this rent you know a little bit of conversation we've had but it's like you know I wish I could have been in those conversations or been having those conversations and being a part of that it's like because I'm not and that's a piece of the corner is like I'm not getting and I think Christian's exactly right now in the live stream this morning I talked about the well we want to I started this whole doing these commentaries on Jordan Peterson's video because I would have loved to sit down and have a conversation with Jordan Peterson. I would have loved to have had the uh good fortune or providence of being Jonathan Peugeot and finding Jordan Peterson early before the status rocket ride and becoming a friend and getting to know him because he had such interesting things to say and I very quickly realized that even with 300,000 subs at that point and all this drama around him I wasn't going to be able to sit down and and get to know him and and so then I can interact with his avatar on YouTube and the more I did this the more I realized that I don't have this is back to the Dunbar number I don't really have time in my life to actually have relationships with all these people so I'll sort of have relationships with their avatars there's something really weird and creepy about that but if you really want to know weird and creepy there are descriptions of things in this conversation between Malcolm and Ayla that are seriously weird and creepy about what the internet is doing and what AI is doing and what this is going to do with us and to us and so there's a lot going on here and you know just like sort of Paul and Parker look at what's happened around my channel and think huh and I don't know I don't know we're just trying to figure this out as I said in the the live stream this project is like six years old and developmentally we're sort of in the place of a six-year-old in terms of this this subtle body that we have and its self-consciousness because it's about four five six that children become self-conscious and they realize that they're naked and so we're all trying to figure this out being this in the real world but there has to be people that this is this is a vibration for them right I definitely definitely think it's changing things yeah well and I was even I was thinking about it as I as I saw your message come through I was you know again like time management is really bad for me but whatever I'm like sitting there and I'm like trying to repair a fence because my chickens keep getting out you know and I'm like I'm like oh yeah yeah yeah let's I'm gonna pop into a conversation with Christian and I'm thinking I don't know where you live you don't know where I live you know we don't have to tell people on the internet where we live but I'm assuming it you're you're not down the street you know so it's like the fact that I could go from repairing my fence to you know running up here and starting a conversation with you is there's something different to that there there's there's certainly a double-edged sword and you know you could have that conversation but it's like people need these conversations in their lives and as we have you know sort of moved into digital worlds that's where the conversations are going to be had and I I 100 agree with you I don't think you need to be a Joe Rogan or somebody with some popular following I actually think that some of that is going to even fall off because you know I think people are probably what will happen is as these celebrities go into trying to make more authentic comment uh content that people will find they don't really like Mr. Beast you know they'll stop watching his stuff because they just didn't connect with him you know or his personality for whatever reason and and you'll find um you know you'll find other people and and I don't know again we're not exactly sure where this will will pose so for sure anybody that's like what is this little corner I mean in a way and it's something that's not really defined it's hard to define but essentially the way you would see it expressed is a bunch of people who have conversation create content engage in dialogue and and then those pop up on the internet and you can find them and you know Paul VanderKlees is sort of the orchestra conductor to some degree like I don't know what to call Paul but you would if you found Paul VanderKlees channel or some of these other channels it would almost be like a how like one of those swirly pictures I'm doing a really bad job um that like as you zoom in there's more swirly pictures inside and you zoom in and you zoom in so right you find Paul and what does Paul do he sort of zooms in so now I find Chad and I find Christian and I find Grim Grizz and I find Grail Country and then I then I zoom in on Grail Country and I go hello who's this Luke guy and then I sort of zoom in on Luke and and and so you can there's like a sort of a kaleidoscopic phenomenon you know so and I think fun yeah so finding Paul or or maybe even I don't know who you find these days you know to sort of start that process but um and I think that's part of it because you know even if you look at even if you look at the tweet let's see if I can go straight to the tweets tweet tab um Cornus Natali says by the way your conversations have been what I've gravitated towards meaning to Paul and Leitner you've had some really great ones so in other words people stop watching my videos and hopefully they're going to an estuary or a church or um having you know better sex with their spouse and not with an online avatar and all of those things but they're not they're not stopping with me they're the churn continues but hopefully the churn is taking them maybe to smaller channels and to smaller places and to better connecting between people and and and I think that those people are fascinating I think that's what it comes down to like I've yeah it's a it's a rabbit hole but it's also it speaks to the nature of how fast because I've been doing this a month and right right like right that's fast and now in all fairness Christian you've made a lot of videos in your month so um you've been you you've put in the time and it was because like you basically like I would say that I'm in this conversation right now because you made a I think you made a comment you may have been in the stream but you made a comment it said something about does anyone know what the rabbit room is oh yeah yeah it was like two it was probably three weeks ago yeah and automatically like Andrew Peterson has played like a big role in my life as an artist and I was like oh okay well we're in this thing but then there's like well here's another corner you know it is yeah like a quarter of the quarter I was like well I would hope that maybe I could have a conversation with yeah strange strange theology which yeah Pete which yeah that we could you know that could play a part in and then you you kind of are zooming in on Joe Rogan phenomenon which obviously that's been talked about a lot but I think I think the thing that you're doing as say a Christian is engaging with Joe Rogan where a lot of people would oh you know there's foul language or oh he's talking to this person you know like right so you're like engaging with that in a way that somebody like Paul who would have people told him like uh Jordan Peterson's a heretic why are you talking about Jordan Peterson right so it's kind of that that flavor of I'm not scared to engage with the world pretty secure in who I am yeah so you know there's Andrew Peter thing the Joe Rogan thing I thought was interesting yeah so the link for this video is below and again check out the Thomas Kincade portion of this video it was it was really good and you know of course Chad starting with the uh Bridges of uh Bridges of Meaning Hub channel where he did news is now going he's got randos conversations he's got other conversations his his commentary mashup videos are are doing their thing and then he had this this very interesting video about um and one of these videos that I really um that I really enjoyed recently which I didn't show on the channel but Chad's been putting out some really good things this question about where are the other frotillas and you know it's got all of 69 views so far and Chad's got Chad's got 500 how many subs does he have 531 subs with 666 videos Chad do you have something to tell us is that why you wear the mask um you know again this is a this is a flotilla of tiny channels in the YouTube world and what's interesting is that Chad's little channel of the Friday Morning Nameless might have a bigger impact on a small group of people than major major major channels have on whole ranges of people in other words when it's all said and done Chad's tiny little Friday Morning Nameless channel might have kind of a bigger a more meaningful impact than channels that are dozens of times larger now I did a tiny little video with Grizz two days ago uh member Barry dead reckoning um Grizz's titles are always very interesting and and he talked to me about his so on one hand Grizz is the one who a lot of the memes a lot of the memes in this little corner come from Grizz you don't see them right away but they sort of seep up from the bottom so you got verveki language kind of coming from above you got grizzwalled grip memes coming from below and so this flotilla and and Grizz is talking about fire ants and fire ants apparently in a storm cluster together to to preserve the queen and her eggs and and and they themselves become all of these little ants and that's really a that's really a power maybe I can find a little YouTube video that shows me so here's this video and here are the fire ants and yeah yeah yeah and then there's a flood and oh look at them look what they're doing so this is so this is grim grizz's image of what's going on that all these tiny little channels are sort of locking together and trying to hold up something trying to preserve something trying to to because you can think about the ants as individuals or you can think of the ants as a collective as a body because in many ways ant hives are are more than one thing are are one thing and they're more than one thing and they they do this they do this in order that the hive can survive that the group can survive and so of course grizz with his apocalyptic vision is seeing that well what we're sort of doing all these tiny little channels are creating creating something that will endure the flood and of course the flood is a biblical apocalypse now apocalypse happens it always happens and there are big ones and small ones if you go back over my body of work and you can listen to me talk about the day of the lord the day of the lord comes to individuals the day of the lord comes to cities the day of the lord comes to communities the day of the lord comes to platforms the day of the lord comes to ways of communicating the day of the lord comes to epistemology the day of the lord comes and destroys because we're living in the age of decay where everything gets taken out this this earth is a very unstable platform and human beings have known this and felt this for for a very long time we know this deep in our bones and we're always anxious about it and this video is about the downfall of modern podcasts and i really glad that he used the word modern because it's also the downfall about modern ways of viewing the world which in many ways is what this little cluster of fire ants floating on the flood is about so here we go i'm sure you've realized ever since the pandemic that absolutely everyone you've ever met has now got a podcast and there's a lot of truth to that there's a lot of i'm starting a podcast well there you go join the crew remember i'm starting a blog yeah i remember that too this it's not even plugged into anything but there is a big problem on the horizon that we're already starting to see i like this guy already because he's already playing around with the black t-shirt and the black set and the black that he's he's he's made us he's got the the more the much more expensive shore mic than my little uh blue yeti here which does pretty good experience follow me now you probably like what were you filming then is it too much to ask to keep the camera on me now problem number one is if you're like me i like listening to the joe rogan podcast so when you went over to spotify we celebrated it and we were happy to pay that spotify membership but then for some reason although we're paying spotify the money he's still putting ads in the podcast so i'm there in bed listening to an episode about to fall asleep and then bam this episode is brought to you by athletic greens oh he's so right he's so right and that's why i hate well that's why i hate emplacement ads so you know you can listen to the audio podcast you don't have to look at it there's no ads in the audio podcast so like hold on i'm paying you spotify so i don't get ads and i'm getting ads either way and they don't even yeah that's how i feel about youtube premium and remember the video i just made about that youtube has figured this out that they're like yeah you know um we're gonna put ads every 30 seconds and you're gonna have an ad blocker we're gonna figure out our way around your ad blocker and one way or another you're gonna get ads and so then you know i still have a i'm in my second year of daily wire and i don't i don't listen to hardly anything on it usually the the last little bit of a jordan peterson thing on the rare occasion if he's got someone that i'm interested in really listening to and the main reason i'll do it is because the daily wire doesn't have any interstitial ads in at all from hallow or exodus 90 or gold or any of the things that they advertise but you know yeah but he's going to talk about this too this is a really good video even play them at the beginning like lex friedman so you can skip for him and pretend you listen to him they put him down come over here over here come on for many of you you've probably heard of a podcast called diary of a ceo with stephen barker and congratulations they just hit five now with your aussie accent i have actually no idea what podcast you just told me about but i love australia and i love aussies so and i think your accent is totally cool but i have no idea what you're talking about and i probably don't even need to know because the main points are coming right now million subscribers on youtube which is amazing but there's a lot of controversy between the guests at the moment and all the guests seem to contradict each other and say different things but they're all renowned experts but being an expert isn't merely enough because ah we use the e word they're experts they're experts we had a little conversation about experts a little while ago and i just want to listen to experts i want to listen to people who stay in their lane because they're an expert you think about it if two companies are suing you now before i go too far with the expert i did get because i do read the comments and there is an md and i'm not going to out you in the comments but there's another md that said hey wait a minute this whole caring thing that we talked about in that podcast caring kills and he's right caring does kill i see it all the time i see children caring for their parents the reason you have a doctor who is an expert and i have a doctor and i like my doctor and i listen to my doctor i listen to my doctor more than i listen to the internet about what i should do because he's an expert because he's been to medical school and because he knows a lot of things that i don't know so i still very much do listen to my doctor but i don't listen to my doctor all the way and some of that is personal stubbornness my doctor would still like me to lose a few pounds but i do listen to my doctor in other words expertise isn't going away what we're doing is sort of continuing to figure out where expertise is sort of in the matrix because the funny thing there's a funny thing about influence that it's nowhere near as straightforward as this entire facade of expertise is now what's really interesting about him is he's going to talk about well why do you listen to podcasts because you get information okay and that triggers the vervechia ism where where do you go for information well google podcast youtube facts where do you go for knowledge books where do you go for wisdom what is wisdom wisdom is trying to figure out how to live trying to manage information information don't forget that funny word knowledge facts trying to manage it into one cohesive whole in terms of how should i live well churches i suppose each other both companies will have experts and those both experts in the same field would disagree with each other just making someone an expert doesn't mean they're wrong oh experts disagree with each other no right or you wouldn't have people on different sides there are several components to operating a podcast in 2024 that people aren't thinking about podcasts are businesses they are not vessels of means of there you go chad your podcast is a business not really getting you free information although it may feel that way places like youtube will pay you adsense but when you start looking at these okay chad so if you can get up above 500 you can get adsense and then you'll discover as grim grizz discovered you're not going to make much money from adsense you're going to make much you're going to make more money basically through donations or memberships but even that is all part of the adsense thing and you're probably not going to make enough to not no longer have to lay tile there are other routes to making money this is only a fraction maybe 10 to 20 percent of what that business is earning is being paid for by google one of the main places you earn money in a podcast is sponsors and the sponsor will pay depending on the amount of downloads or the amount and that's not quite the shadow cabal so say we all amount of views because you are putting eyes and ears in front of their brand podcasts also use discount codes but they're not discount codes they're commission codes when you look at cuberman promoting athletic greens if you use this code for the discount it actually allows athletic greens to understand where they're giving their commission to and if we use athletic greens as an example you're not only looking at 50 commission and it was really interesting when athletic greens was advertising on alex o'connor and it's like oh oh and what's so amazing about our strange world today of course alex o'connor gets this degree from oxford in philosophy and theology i think that's what he got his degree in and the most lucrative thing he can do in terms of his job is youtube all these people that want to become youtube influencers i guess but if you want to become a youtube influencer don't look at my model i've been surprisingly fortunate with my hapless self but look for look at someone who's going to grow look at look at look at chris williamson i mean look at what he's done it's pretty amazing you know up above a million subscribers big names jordan peterson sponsors black t-shirts you know good tan well put together upper body a sale but every sale they're on in so no doubt a sponsor will not just pay the person to be mentioned they will then pay the person every time there's commission on their product and sales on their in so when the likes of huberman are saying athletic greens is really good and it makes some people so much better they're not just looking at commission they're looking at recurring commission now what makes things interesting now i don't have a problem with any of this because if you watch set commercial tv it's the same model mostly uh you watch i love lucy and then you see a commercial and you watch some more i love lucy and then you see a commercial and it's it's just kind of it's the same thing now early on i got tivo so i could fast forward through the commercials and now with streaming i tend to pay for the added thing of no longer having to watch the commercials like i pay for the youtube premium so i no longer have to see the ads etc etc etc etc that's not really the thing that i'm interested in this video about although that's interesting too and keeping keeping some understanding of the platform you're using for your community and your sense making it stands to reason that's pretty important that's not what's interesting to me about this man's video interesting so if we look at a company like hule steven bartlett is a non-executive director of hule which i assume means he has shares in the business so although i'm sure that hule pay directly for ceo money every time steven bartlett mentions hule he's also inflating the portfolio of a business that he's got shares in and wow that's pretty cool before i say that's terrible i do that every time i tell you about newtonic the world's first productivity drinks all my shares in the business just went up so so i love it so far nothing really is wrong with this picture the problem starts becoming apparent when you start looking at guests in the beginning you want ah guests now he's not talking randos and in fact the randos are going to be a totally different thing because his whole paradigm of knowledge information wisdom is going to fall apart with randos because why would you ever have a rando on your channel and again i didn't 10 years ago i didn't set about and telling myself how i could build a a community empire by um putting randos on the internet just packed into this thing because i'm a pastor well let's continue fantastic guests who can arrive and change people's lives and give people so much information and get massive amounts of views and grow your channel to five million subscribers give people matt give people information that you're going to guest for information now you're also going to guest for wisdom because those other three p's in the four p's of knowing you can google that if you need to know what they are those other three p's in the four p's of knowing is about i'm looking for wisdom and and i think in a lot of ways people look to jordan peterson they got information out of them and they got knowledge out of but they're really looking to them for wisdom and so when it comes to and look at the language we use when it comes to online gurus we look for wisdom but what about this expert thing what about this lane thing but you will exhaust the amount of great guests very soon and you can get those guests back on or what we're starting to see is you bring on guests not who are known for being factually correct or objective but that you know will cause controversy cause a rift between the okay not for who are factually objective oh oh in other words the guests are these little buckets of facts and we want really you don't need a guest to be a little bucket of facts that's not really why you have a guest you can just you can just send them a text you can send them a message that's not really what's going on you get a guest now then he says well you get a guest for controversy the followers cause massive amounts of engagement cause people to be so outraged that they go and watch the podcast just to see what's factually incorrect in it and of course and again they don't watch it to see what's factual and there's some people that they're I hate watching but jordan peterson will often make the point that my videos have on average 98 percent up thumbs versus down thumbs well of course they do that's what happens because the number of really objectionable hate watchers is always going to be low and yes there's even some people someone out there that every now and then down votes the freddy and paul show which i can't figure out why but there it is i'm not worried about the freddy and paul show and the youtube algorithm i used to worry about that i thought what if a million people watch the freddy and paul show and you know what it doesn't happen and i don't think it ever will and i'm really happy about that and that's my position sorry freddy if you get to this point if you watch this i don't want to ever watch the freddy and paul if you're gonna freddy if you're gonna have if you're gonna have a million followers it won't be because of me but anyway but just watch the framing of not so much the stuff about youtube is interesting and the stuff about this ending is inevitable but the stuff about knowledge and how he's viewing this and how people work is the really interesting thing and i've made this point many times before because i learned this a long time ago as a pastor because the way it's supposed to work as a pastor is something like this well here's stuff from the bible the pastor takes the stuff from the bible and puts it in the mouth of the little birds with their mouths open puts the little biblical worms in and and and then and then but then you push them and say and then what now we talked quite a bit in the live stream today about feels and and all of those things and then t grog came in and you know was skeptical you know was skeptical about all these things and skeptical of course we talked in the live stream today about how most people are just sort of wandering in and out of places and they're looking for something and you know even you too i still haven't found what i'm looking for but he's already a christian well he's not the right kind of christian you know if you go to the orthodox church if we go to charismatic church or if we go to a truly reformed church or if you go to a mainline church if we go to ba ba ba ba ba doesn't matter one of the most interesting things about this entire journey and this entire guru-osphere is that if you if you really ask someone what is it exactly we're looking for now you might grab a fancy theological word like sumum bonum go ahead clip me sumum bonum all grim grizzles little fire ants sumum bonum that's probably chad gonna do it you can say a word like sumum bonum but wisdom we knows is pointing us to something we don't know and everything he's about to say is all still sort of built in this idea that if i get all the facts right then well then what i'll i'll i'll look as good as him i'll have arms like him i'll have hair like him and his hairline's receding he might have to get in there and get those plants or whatever you know massage that scalp it's because scalps are anyway my chair was i'll leave it alone i'll leave it alone i still haven't found what i'm looking for what are we looking for for course get huge amounts of views you'll even notice that the thumbnail for the episode is changed every hour on the hour 12 hours after the podcast is released to see which thumbnail causes people to click on the most there is a you'll notice that it's true they do it the title gets changed science to this and they're choosing titles that are provocative intriguing but we're now at the point where people are just looking to piss people off and if that and so okay so we played the title game we paid the the thumbnail game and now we're playing the provocation game because anger and fear motivate people and what's really important is that they click and that they watch and that we have their attention but then there's the there's the there's basically the cloying effect which means you see enough of this and you and you just finally click away now here's the beauty about randos hierarchies bind and blind and when you get a high status this is part of the reason i don't really like going out and looking for high status people to interview because they have been formed they're on a hierarchy and that hierarchy binds and blinds and and actually i am in the same hunt for knowledge and information and wisdom but i find that actually it's god places it all over the place and there's there's all this interest out in the wildness of the world we're far more interesting than fire ants he was really open about it and uh so i've had a couple of conversations with him at this point and then like uh i'm now invited to host a conversation on judges with someone oh good with uh with jason almond tree um and uh yeah so it was like who else who else wants to have these conversations with me who else is interested in this kind of stuff um and when i go to a church it it's very difficult i'll talk to people and it's very difficult to find people that are interested in these topics and um yeah so i kind of searching for that kind of a thing to to find i think so i did a video this week on you know auto didax you know sam sort sam teeterman sort of you know when he said that word i thought oh they're part of i know a bunch of people like you came into our local jordan peterson meetup when we started and right there i thought usually we have the problem of churn on youtube because you you need again the video is definitely made better by that dog barking don't don't settle for anything less than the original which has dog barking some sirens in the background and cars with really obnoxious booming sounds coming from their massive speakers and a near infinite amount youtube tends to provide that but what that means is you're going to churn through stuff and after you're churning on youtube a while the the shallowness of youtube itself because of the rituals of youtube means yeah you're going to churn all the faster and and actually the resolution of that are people yeah and that's part of again the reason why my vision of my vision which has sort of manifest itself in what some people call the corner is the the end of churn is people because you know even it was so interesting because verveke with his last conversation with peterson talked about his you know he's made a lifetime commitment to his partner which is sort of like marriage but he doesn't use that word yeah yeah but you know he you know i hear people say well i wouldn't want to live forever because i'd get bored but here's the funny thing about people um you know you can to a degree sort of hit a plateau with people they sort of become um they sort of become mapped territory but what at least we've seen in our lifetimes with something like marriage is that i've you know lived i've lived i've been married to my wife 36 years we've known each other 38 years right and because we're both changing you know there there still is mystery and we're even mining our childhood sometimes and so it's that's the that's the in part soylent green is people that means you're using misinformation if it brings you views and it brings you listens and it brings your attention that's not only going to bring you more money from sponsors it's also going to give you more prospects to sell the business in which you're promoting and all you need to do is check the comment section of these guests when they're announced there was even a post by the vegan doctor that i was meant to show you guys here but i think it's been deleted because the comments were so bad on it but although you can cause a lot of controversy from the amount of people that are coming to your page if it boosts your revenue you will continue to do that habit or endeavor it's a positive feedback loop now remember with the expert plan you still have the problem of selection of experts and the selection of eps experts and you're black back into that black box of relevance realization you're going to need your biases but you're going to have to deal with your biases so the biggest issue you see in models like dire over ceo is that it's very apparent this is becoming more of a business operation than it is trying to get good quality information to the forefront of the listeners let's have a look at something good quality information to the forefront of listeners now remember sam's comment about google in terms of well the more google messes with it and so we sort of have this idea that the marketplace is going to decide but again read history of scientific revolutions it basically says that science is a marketplace but if science is a marketplace you don't actually escape all of the dynamics that he just pointed to and how the marketplace distorts and then he plays this then he plays this this video which is really interesting where some guy was on hooverman and gave this little study about people who drank such and such a thing and then talked about the fact that well he didn't even read the study correctly fortunately put the study in the notes and then someone who did read the study correctly will begin to see that well but then you begin to notice that well what about these studies and peer reviewed journals have you listened to any jordan peterson about that game the woozling and and all the kinds of things and so well let's say maybe your your main goal is in fact to to well we're back to the summa bonum problem what in fact is your main goal where will you find wisdom how will you know what is good is the most important thing to have black t-shirts and nice tan arms that look good well if you listen to home math that might get you laid but part of the problem with home math is at some point okay you got laid good you get laid again good so maybe maybe you can you know the whole thing of 40 virgins oh great um maybe you're just like a real athlete and you can enjoy all 40 versions in one day well if 40 is good maybe 50 is good if 50 is good maybe 60 is good and then i don't remember how i came across it but i found a story from the daily mail of a man who suffers from 100 orgasms a day for the past two years well boy wouldn't it be great to have an orgasm a day well if one orgasm is good how about two how about three and then if that's good how about a hundred but but this poor dude i mean i really shouldn't laugh but because there are women who have a similar it's a similar disorder it's an illness and they they can't then when i began to think about what this must be like i thought yes i could see how this is horrible the poor man is disabled by orgasms and some of you think yes if vanderklaay is one loose cannon but it makes the point about what is good what is the summa bonum what is good what is the summa bonum getting up now we're back to the book of ecclesiastes all that i see under the sun heaven it's it's meaningless it's where can you find wisdom podcasts information experts experts on what experts on life oh now we're talking if you go back to pete and and pete made a really important observation that you know people watch joe rogan because you know he's got comedians on he has mma fighters on he has all but you know what people are really interested in at least in this little corner they really are what about is religion well why because because religion way at the bottom is really where the whole thing is at now what i'm going to read about read to you is a in the islam video someone dropped it said well you should read thomas carlyle on muhammad so i don't know anything about that so then i do a little bit digging and i find thomas carlyle and i read some reviews of what thomas carlyle said about islam and oh that was interesting but actually i found the the whole book to be you know to be far more interesting um and let's let's get what we um you got the marlboro man on the cover which is kind of funny and and then i found that oh there's audio there's some guy reading this book on youtube what he's a pretty good reader it's not too bad it's not an easy book to read well it's not not hard book to read but carlyle as many people noted uses words in kind of his own way but right from the start he started talking about religion and now in the earlier part of the book he basically is a deconstructed scotsman from um from the church there and it is well said in every sense that a man's religion is the chief fact with regard to him and i thought wow yeah he's right a man's or a nation of men's by religion i do not mean here the church creed which he professes the articles of faith which he signs and the words are otherwise asserts not this holy in many cases not this at all we see men of all kinds of professed creeds attained to almost all degrees of worth or worthlessness under each or any of them pick the best church you can find and you'll find the worst men and women pick a really bad church and you might find some gems that's really interesting so carlyle notes that of course i'm not going to say profession is worthless no but it's it's just more complicated than that and of course jesus says that too um you know you say do you come to me and say lord lord did we not heal the sick and raise the dead and i say depart from me i never knew you oh so relevance realization it's about knowing jesus okay so you go to knowing jesus churches with discipleship and or or all of those things and and you'll find the turds there too and some of the turds are gems and some of the gems are turds and again this is the way it goes this is not what i call religion this profession and assertion which is often only a profession and assertion from the outworks of the man from the mere argumentative region of him if even so deep as that but the thing a man does practically believe this is exactly what jordan peterson says a religion is what this isn't coming out of people's mouths a religion is what they act out of yeah yeah yeah yeah and this is often enough without asserting it even to himself much less to others the thing a man does practically lay to heart and know for certain concerning his vital relations to this mysterious universe and his duty and destiny there that is that is in all cases the primary thing for him the creatively determined that and creatively determines all the rest that is his religion or it may be his mere skepticism and no religion this is 1840 so um yeah skepticism's been around a long time the matter it is which he feels himself to be spiritually related to the unseen world or no world and i say if you tell me what that is you tell me to a very great extent what the man is now it's a little bit of tension with what he said before in other words even though on one hand your religion yeah you're you're at the same time your metaphysics matter your community matters your formation matters just an information dropping into you from a podcast make sure you get good sourced information just like good sourced veggies and i say if you tell me what that is you tell me to a very great extent what the man is and what the kinds of things he will do of a man or of a nation we inquire and so back to Plato's republic you know the we scale up first of all what religion they had was it heathenism plurality of god's mere sensuous representation of the mystery of life and for chief recognized elements there in physical force was it christianism i didn't know andrew sullivan didn't develop that term here it is 1840 faith in an invisible not as real only but as but as the only reality time through every meanest moment of it resting on eternity pagan empire of force displayed by nobler supremacy on and on it goes very interesting chapters enjoying the book now it's a thousand interesting qualifications i could give you but that's not the point of the video basically what he's going to say is podcasting can't trust it it's getting corrupted it's it's getting corrupted by the marketplace because there's this huge chasing after experts there's this huge chasing after experts and the experts are corrupted and so we used to believe the information we got because we got so little information and i don't think any of that is true at all i want to i want to relisten to the end of my conversation with john vervecky because it's there's all optimal grip here because wisdom is very much like optimal grip but it's it's far too many variables and so it does actually get boiled down into living and into life but so much of your life you can't choose you can't choose your sex you can't choose the time you were born the parents you were born to you can't choose any of that the the number of things that you can pursue the ideas that you can pursue and really the deep things not just sort of the the myriad of information i mean one of the main things that i see today is that we are bombarded with so much information most of it just flows through us like a warm cup of coffee information it's it's we're sort of oh we we find some information think that'll change my life oh there's another oh there's another oh there's another so then we have all kinds of other psycho technologies to slow down and do lectio divina so we can narrow it and again all of these things are fine and good and profitable and they do things but we can't save ourselves well what do you mean save what what pastor he's pastor this pastor talk just invaded what was a perfectly enjoyable video save from what save from who save for what save how long all of these are the questions that are worth asking and so whether we're watching joe rogan or you know i don't even know the greens because i avoid the commercials like the plague but this is what we're about this is what we're after and and we and it's hard to even just sort of lay on the table and say that clearly but it is because once you find something and you have a degree of fittedness and then then then you're still trying to optimize that fit it that's good that's the end of this video leave a comment let me know what you think
