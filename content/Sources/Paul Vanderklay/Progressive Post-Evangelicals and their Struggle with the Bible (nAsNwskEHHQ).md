 I decided to make a little front end to this Bible about the Bible video and it was very much connected with the progressive evangelical question because the Bible so often for them by virtue of their story stands as a major impediment and I paused to post that video because talking about the Bible is so conflictive, so hot, nothing will get me into more trouble than talking about the Bible. But I wanted to at least give a disclaimer which I don't usually like doing that I do believe the Bible is the word of God and if someone says that I would very much in a rather Jordan Peterson way ask them well what do you believe God is because the main point of this video about the Bible is that I don't think the Bible is what we think it is and I don't think we are either and what I've found in my life is that the Bible I have I have found no greater guide to living than I find from the Bible and so I think some of you are going to listen to what the rest of this Bible video has to say and are going to have problems with one thing or another that I say about the Bible and that's okay. It's really hard to talk about the Bible it's really hard to grapple with the history of this book and what this book has meant for the entire story of civilization on planet Earth. So I wanted to give a little disclaimer and maybe I feel more comfortable about posting this video with this disclaimer. So there it is. Hi this is Paul. I wanted to do a video on how the Bible and people really don't work the way we think both of them work and this was this was touched off by there's a guy in Sacramento used to be a pastor Christian Missionary and Alliance pastor got his education in Canada now he's working as a therapist in Sacramento he's written some books he blogs and just via some other connections someone said you know just kind of sort of pointed me to him on Twitter and he wrote a piece recently about the Bible and the tweet says get your head around these facts God commanded sex slavery God commanded slaughter of children and so I tweeted back at him he also drowned the world except for one family I'd suggest the whole this whole way of arguing over God and morality has a significant frame problem so I cruised over to his blog and took a look at it and then I thought it was there's a whole genre of this type of observation in fact just today I saw a piece that's getting a lot of attention from Rolling Stone of Alex Morris who's an author who did a telling her own story about growing up in Alabama she was part of the Christian right and it's sort of a I call it sort of a progressive evangelical subtraction story Rachel Held Evans very much majored in that genre Rob Bell another big light in this genre and basically it's you know this the way that that these people were taught to read the Bible it doesn't work and and God isn't what they you know this this whole rave wavering the Bible doesn't work and and I thought this blog post was another nice piece of that this morning I texted my wife and asked if she would read numbers 31 again I suggested she read it as if she were not a follower of Christ and someone with a high opinion of the Bible as we digested its contents together we realized it was saying that God had ordered the Israelites to kill all the Midianite boys make all the virgin girls their sex slaves sex slaves a little pejorative you might you might argue that the many accounts of let's say Native Americans and European settlers in the Americas who kidnapped children or or took children from the other side and incorporated them into their tribe were making them sex slaves and so kill all the women who had sex before kill all the men set fire to their town reward the most violent soldiers with more spoils from the massacre now what anybody who pays any attention to Bronze Age or Iron Age history knows this is all pretty much standard operating procedure through most of world history you know well into the medieval period it's it's only in the modern period that we we sort of have some scruples about this but but shouldn't God have gotten that right and it's a very fair question and I I think it's important to stop and say yeah very fair question I can completely understand why people today read this and say and are just simply horrified by it but we don't really think much about the Bible and we don't really think about what we mean by the word God or how any of this is supposed to work or even how we work we don't think about what the Bible is we don't imagine we don't we don't even imagine we don't even think about what we imagine the Bible to be we don't explore our expectations of the Bible we don't think about how it's supposed to work but we have many expectations along that and and we and what we and what we are as we imagine ourselves reading it so in a sense if you want to look at this we have to watch ourselves read it and I think this is why Jordan Peterson's biblical series was such a revelation to many it just was a bolt out of the blue which is what CS Lewis called Tolkien's Hobbit stories Jordan Peterson comes on the scene and bang suddenly people see the Bible in a whole new way because Jordan Peterson is talking about it and I don't know that anything moved the needle more on what how a large number of people read the Bible than Peterson's biblical series and this obviously isn't a thing we keep statistics on you know perhaps the the the coming of the NIV in the Bible publishing world which completely revolutionized it because it the NIV was sort of like Procter and Gantt Zondervans and NIV was sort of like Procter and Gamble and soap the problem with selling soap is that there's just so much of it and it's all over the place and what you want to really learn how to do is repackage and remark it and refragrant soap that you can sell it over and over and over again so that people have all these different kinds of soap products in your house that's exactly what happened with biblical publishing once the NIV came out that that publishers and that's why Zondervan got bought up in order to purchase the NIV by I don't remember which secular publishing house owns it now but they bought it up because you know you could have the NIV study Bible and the life application Bible and the pastors who do YouTube videos Bible and the Oakland Raiders fans Bible and you could repackage the Bible in innumerable ways well Jordan Peterson comes along and does his biblical series and you know this is why I started making YouTube videos because I'm watching the effect that that series is having on people and notice the Bible doesn't change at all but it's everyone's assumptions and expectations and presuppositions about the Bible that change you know the Bible project is doing a similar thing but but I don't know that the Bible project has this huge sea change thing like Jonathan Peugeot have the Bible now the Bible is by far the most influential book in all of human history nothing else is even close now someone might take a look at data on the Quran it's very important to think about Northrop Frye's observation at the beginning of this little video series that he does and you can find it on the servers of University of Toronto when Northrop Frye makes the observation that Christianity begins in translation that is so fundamental to Christianity and and right there at the heart of Christianity's power to leap into other cultures there are a variety of websites out there on the internet that will demonstrate that for most of the world religions their base has sort of sort of stayed the same Islam is still based in in Saudi Arabia Hinduism is still based in India Buddhism is still based in the East but sort of the center of mass of Christianity has has sort of moved all around at least a certain window of the world quite dramatically when you think about the heart of Christianity you don't think Jerusalem anymore really you think you know perhaps Europe or America and that's likely going to change and be much more Africa and Asia when you look at the total number of people and part of the reason for that is that unlike the Quran the Bible is read in translation that began already with the Septuagint the Old Testament translated into the Greek and Koine Greek the common tongue of the Eastern Empire became the the language of the Bible and then the Latin Vulgate became the language of the Bible and the Bible is translated in more languages than any other book in all of human history it's been printed more in any other book in all of humans history and you can't even look at sales really because the Bible is given away more than any other book in human history you might say oh that's just because of the past but it's not slowing down expect it to increase the internet is only going to make this thing explode more and and as as the Christianization of China and India and Africa take root it's just going to get bigger and and this is something that people in the West don't really have a sense of because we're living in a different part of the world but you can look up this data on the internet it's it's all there and you know one of the things that Tom Howland said in his deling pod interview which which continues to continues to I just can't shake it because it's just such a astounding observation imagine you've got to write a story in which for the first time somebody who suffers the excruciating death of a slave is going to be cast in some way part of the creator God who fashioned everything and he's got to be convincing not just to people now but for 2,000 years and across the whole span of the world it's really an astonishing thing to have pulled off as a literary feat and that four people did it it is Now what's even more amazing is that you're not looking at Shakespeare or Dickens or Stephen King people who wrote book after book after book and a start and repeated astonishing literary feats three of the four books were really pretty unclear about who the author was and the fourth Luke the one we know the most about all of these people did it within a short amount within you know what years couple of decades maybe and and what that says obviously is it doesn't necessarily speak to the the literary artistry of the four authors as much as it speaks to the person that the authors were writing about and the words they were taking from that person and the fact that this all happens in translation I mean this is this is the most astounding thing I can think of in the history of literature in the world nothing even comes second but now we have a zeitgeist of the nuns of those people who are sort of walking away from religion and and what I would call progressive evangelicals tend to be on that spectrum a lot closer to the tabletop where people sort of fall off and that's as I've watched people that's sort of how it's happened that you know the the article that Mike and sack here wrote you know very much the same arguments very much you know the same observations very much the same feeling that I was raised that the Bible was a certain thing and once I start reading the Bible for myself I realize it's not that thing and so this whole matrix this whole framework that they were raised in have to give way and no surprise at all it gives way often in a certain cultural direction what cultural direction might that be that might be the most popular the ascendant morality of the culture the way the whole culture is sort of sliding and moving you know how would we imagine the Bible should work let's sort of reverse this and think about it the other way if if the nuns were going to imagine the God that they were taught to believe in was going to write a book what would that book say that God would present himself in that book as perfectly moral never doing anything that we would judge to be wrong God would be irresistibly attractive that God would come and once God would speak once people would read his book everyone would fall in line and do whatever the kinds of things that people imagine Christians are supposed to do that then they would go to church every week and and all of these things I keep reminding people I mean who is the greatest Christian preacher that ever lived I made this point to I made this point to Andrea in my conversation with her Jesus Jesus is the greatest Christian teacher that's ever lived we can say that and Jesus preached and well he had a mass following in the Galilee and they all left him in fact Jesus meets all sorts of people who walk away from his teaching and they're not just all sort of in love with him and want to be his disciples in fact a good number of them want to kill him what does that say what does that say about our assumptions about how God is supposed to work in this world and I would recommend reading the first the prologue of the Gospel of John because here's the problem we want to imagine the world is a different way and that if God would show up it would be rainbows and unicorns and we would all swoon when basically the Bible says when God shows up we call to the mountains and ask them to fall on us because we don't want to see his face now this is not the kind of God we like to think about we'd rather have the God of of rainbows and unicorns and and and and lovely and and us swooning because oh it's just so wonderful but that's not the God of the Bible and so when people read the Bible they're legitimately shocked because they have these expectations about who God is and how our emotional response to God is supposed to be and they discover no it's not like that numbers 31 is in the Bible and like I said in my tweet well pretty much Genesis 9 through Genesis 6 through 9 God drowns the world saving only one family and and and sort of sort of you know doesn't really I'm I'm stereotyping here but you know the big turning point in the Noah story is God remembers Noah and we hear that what he forget about him he only saved one and God's like oh yeah Noah maybe I should maybe I should pull the plug on that flood and drain it all out and and and and then as I mentioned in my sermon last week God saves one man the best man in the world and the next story after Moses gets out is Noah gets out as he plants a vineyard now if you understand Isaiah 5 and and wine and glory and grapes and how that all works together in the biblical imaginary it's a very biblical thing to do to go out and plant a vineyard and to and to drink wine but what does what does Noah do he gets drunk on the wine and one of his son mocks him and it's really shady sexually what's what's happening in that whole story and Noah gets up and curses him you know I I completely understand why people being raised with a particular image of God that is very much in keeping with the far broader idea of what God is like would read the Bible and be completely horrified see we project a lot onto God now one of my favorite zeitgeist test things is to just do a Google image search of just take especially just take any idea and put it into the Google image search and look at the kinds of pictures that come up just look at the pictures that come up with God you know it's is it you know it's easy to believe why people say God is an old man in the sky that's what everybody thinks there he is and and in all fairness when Jesus says God the father we think about God as a Jewish father even despite the the prohibition in the Ten Commandments to not make a graven image but this is this is how we picture God and he's sort of a big person up in the sky and now we we take this idea and we project it and so then we see well God's ordering it's right there in the story he's ordering Moses to do that to the Midianites and where well that's that's not nice so you got to remember that again as I said sort of the two political polls in the American okay politics is to weather as religion is to climate politics is to now as religion is to always so right now what we have in the American political scene is we have two parties one is the party of nice and the other is the party of strong okay and and they just keep going back and forth and so when when people want strong they'll vote Republican and when people want nice they vote Democrat so it makes perfect sense that if you're Republican keep promoting fear and if you're a Democrat keep promoting outrage outrage and fear there we go back and forth that's how you'll get your votes because you're pressing large numbers of people's buttons in order to produce either the desire for nice or the desire for strong that's right now how our political system is working and so now when we read the Bible we read this God and we're like hmm this isn't nice this isn't nice at all God was giving rules and so we can judge the morality of God by judging the morality of these rules but we never pause and ask ourselves what yardstick are we are we using for this morality morality we imagine is just self-evident what are we really looking for we want we want someone that agrees with us all the time basically what we want is what Sigmund Freud said religion is which projecting ourself into the sky and again many people have noted that if you're looking if you're trying to figure out where religion comes from well the Bible for most Americans is not what they're looking for because it's it's just way too not from us but but if we were to write the Bible ourselves which people do regularly this is what you get we write ourselves up into the sky Tim Keller regularly makes the point that any real God is going to upset almost everyone at least some of the time and again if you don't understand why read the prologue of the Gospel of John now I also got this from a Tim Keller sermon years ago because he had caught this Tim Keller was an avid magazine reader and he probably caught this in the Chronicle of Higher Education here in 2000 in 1995 is an anthropologist complaining about cultural relativity and that was supposed to be of course the hallmark of of an anthropologist an anthropologist was supposed to wade in with their clean room monarchical vision perspective on these native peoples and do their anthropology completely without moral judgment this is very common in in in social sciences and again just watch the the Sopranos where Dr. Malfi is is kind of fit to be tied because she's trying to help Tony Soprano deal with his problems and she's having to deal with the question of morality that's part of what made the Sopranos such a such an interesting show so one of the most so this is what Carolyn Fleur-Loban writes one of the most contentious issues arises from the fundamental question what authority do we westerners have to impose our own concept of universal rights on the rest of humanity it is true that western ideas of human rights have so far dominated international discourse on the other hand the cultural relativist argument is often used by repressive governments to deflect international criticism of their abuse of their citizens at the very least anthropologists need to condemn such misuse as cultural relativism even if it means that they may deem permission they may deny permission be denied permission to do research in the country in question personally i would go further she writes i believe that we should not let the concept of relativism stop us from using national and international forums to examine ways to protect the lives and dignity of people in their in every culture because of our involvement local societies anthropologists should provide early warnings of abuse for example by reporting data to international human rights organizations and joining the dialogue of international conferences when there is a choice between defending human rights and defending cultural relativism anthropologists should choose to protect and promote human rights we cannot just be bystanders are you anthropologists or are you missionaries in fact it is it never ceases to amaze me that i find people who are very quick to launch into complaints about colonialism basically doing colonialism in the name of universal rights or whatever now again a lot of sympathy here because absolutely you don't just check your moral framework out the door maybe what you might want to do is ask yourself questions about where does this imagined clean room monarchical vision come from how maybe i should ask deeper questions about where my own morality comes from because what we find is that well we just imagine it's self-evident and do people even work this way now we think people read the bible and then they do what the bible says and i can tell you as a pastor that is absolutely not true because i read the bible all the time and people do not do what it says and then people will come to me as a pastor say pastor you should preach a sermon on that because they're usually thinking about the behaviors that other people are doing and they want the other people to stop doing those behaviors and so pastor if you preach a sermon on it then they'll stop doing those behaviors and i think have you not been in church that's not the way people work at all i could just stand up one sunday and say be good not bad sit down and not have to preach another sermon ever again right is it that people are unclear about what the lists are of rights and wrongs that each church or each sub community or each subculture bequeaths to its people i don't find that people are at all unclear about the big items about right and wrong in fact you could even just take a little subset of the 10 commandments even the subset that almost no one doubts you shall not kill you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness just take those four i almost and take them far beyond the christian community take them far beyond a biblical community as c.s lewis notes in his in his appendix to the the abolition of man everybody agrees on those things are we unclear about the idea or the concept no we don't want to do them and we find ways of justicating justifying circum circumventing them whenever we feel justification is warranted just like this anthropologist when she sees something that she thinks is wrong anthropology be damned she's going to do what's right and it's by no means all that clear either there's a wonderful piece wonderful well it is a fascinating piece in the atlantic a few years ago where some woman wakes up to the fact that her family had a slave and in fact when i lived in the dominican republic i regularly saw that well if there was a wealthy family who maybe had a connection with a poor family the poor family would send a son or a daughter to live with the wealthy family they would live with the wealthy family they were on call 24 7 they would cook they would clean they would do everything they didn't get paid and that relationship would go on and on now sometimes they would help these people get an education and the people who lived that way would would say you know that was a wonderful opportunity because if i stayed in the poor village my life would have been a mess other people just kept them working there now by any definition it certainly looks a lot like slavery and and in this case in the atlantic piece the the woman got old and then suddenly the family didn't quite know what to do with her because well she got old and she couldn't work anymore and well they're gonna put her out you know and suddenly well i don't know should we put her out well what is she what is our relationship why isn't she on social security because you never paid her this is in america but yeah when i listened to celebrity atheists talk about christianity and taught you know we're gonna debate slavery and i think when's the last time the family down the street that you know who goes to church every week owned a slave our our church is sort of having you know slave markets is that what we do when we close the door at night i mean come on this this stinks on both sides of the argument and and nobody seems out there you know detesting the amish because if there's a group of people that say well here's here's a group of people try who are fundamentalists trying to take the bible literally well this the amish sort of preserve a a way of germanic life from the 17th 18th century with their horse drawn carriages but but people don't look at amish quilts and amish pies and amish baked goods as somehow you know the moral equivalent of nazi leftovers i mean we we we play around with these ideas and we simply don't take them seriously christian people today live remarkably similar lives to their non-christian neighbors which is something preachers often complain about but at the same time preachers are living just that same way as everyone else the modulation of these ideas goes on constantly cnn just picked up an an item from grand rapids michigan and i talked about it on crc voices because there's a bunch of people there from grand rapids and it's a small enough place that people are known and so here's this here's this judge who grew up in a very faithful catholic family grew up in the catholic church even gave sizable donations to the catholic church the bishop drew a line that the local priest enforced and and would no longer allow her to take communion in her church and this was devastating for the woman and understandably so and the other side says yeah but you know this is roman catholic teaching and other people look at this as this is this is what's wrong with evangelicals they're not evangelicals they're catholics and you know just on and on and on and on but this is we might see this as a a point of moral outrage but what this actually is is a point of watching the ongoing process of religion as as it modulates remember politics is to weather as religion is to climate and here's a little storm that kicks up and in this storm everybody's watching and working through this stuff and again i completely understand why many christians see this and say i don't want to have anything to do with a god who doesn't like gay people because of the seven clobber passages and so on and so forth my admonition is why don't we all take a bigger step back and ask more foundational questions about what is the bible how does it work how does christianity interface with it and in fact what you'll find is that there are hundreds and thousands of years of tradition and many many layers of culture that are going on in that are involved with this now every every so often this was very popular in the 18th and 19th century what's actually happened again and again throughout christian history where someone will say i want to reestablish the axe church well the mormons tried to do this joe was witness tried to do this the um many other you know st francis tried to do this you can even hear willow creek willow creek church in chicago we want to be an axe to church and the pentecostals tried to do this we tried to do this all the time and in many ways people's hearts are in the right place with respect to this but it isn't so simply done so what we find is that you watch religion in real time modulating all of these things religion and christianity is constantly running different social experiments with people taking very different positions all along a near incalculable a near incalculable spectrum of possible positions and playing these out in their lives what we're seeing is this massive experiment and that's what's happening with religion and so you can get involved with it and you can watch it and so when mike and sack writes an article he's jumping in and when alex morris writes a piece and in in the in in rolling stones she's jumping in and when i'm making videos i'm jumping in and jordan peterson is jumping in and we're all working through this stuff together now the beautiful thing is that it's well documented it's innovation versus preservation one of my one of my favorite places in the jordan peterson sam harris brett weinstein conversation is is is peterson is noting change yep we don't know how to change stay the same we can't stay the same problems on both ends all the way around peterson was dead on right there and i just want to say amen that's that's what we're stuck with because we if we think we're rational and can figure this stuff out none of us are able to figure this out because of back to vervecky combinatorial explosion there's just way way way way way too many things for any of our little brains to figure out so what we actually do is we're all working on them all the time we're how we have a massive procedural laboratory extending over centuries but again fortunately it's well documented it's all here we're all trying to figure out what is morality what does it mean to be a human being you know what is god what do we mean by that word now the rolling stones piece i thought was sort of a subtraction story of progressive evangelicalism and and in many ways you know someone in the in the twitter response because i i got tipped off to this because twitter of course gives me gives me notifications and then sometimes it gives me notifications which are you know here are these 10 of your friends just subscribe to this person over here and usually i'm a little annoyed by those because i think i don't want that for a notification but i saw it today and thought maybe i'll click on it and i go there and i looked at everybody who subscribed to alex morris and i said ah this is interesting and sure enough when i read the piece it's like i know why a lot of people are following this rachel held evans is gone this woman just wrote a very rachel held evans like piece and somebody made that comment to her in twitter and she said that's you know about the nicest thing you could say so you know it's it's it's filling out this particular segment of society that is working through these issues there's a massive moral dissonance rippling through the generation gap and and you know alex morris is a good writer and she's very transparent and you know very bold and and sharing her story in this piece because you know how can she how can she continue to have those bonds with her parents when her parents believe like this i regularly talk to people and run into people there was a an atheist woman that i i used to have a bunch of back and forths with on faiths but she was a friend of mine who was also also an atheist and you know she she married a black man and she you know i whether it was because her husband was black or exactly what it is but you know she completely divorced from her parents over over this issue or other issue and that gets pulled into her whole animosity towards religion because well there it is religion now i don't want to repeat the the last monologue video i made about dave rubin but but i made a comment and made a little twitter story about this because when i read this it's sort of like this is 2006 plus trump and we're sort of in some ways it's sort of moved beyond that but culture doesn't work that way things move slowly the world is large people take time to think through their issues but there is there is a degree of order and there are patterns that sort of go through so we've got this massive moral dissonance rippling through the generation gaps over christian exclusivity over heaven and hell over nice gay people and why doesn't god love them and why won't god why won't god affirm the love that they have love is love right and then and then andrea posts um this whole pattern of of nazis in love and i thought that's that's love is love and that's exactly why the world is enormously complex they're in love but they're nazis um you know nazi prison guards who are who are who who adopt kittens and are wonderful to their children i mean that's history that's how human people that's how human beings are but again we've got the one that the side of nice that that is so dominant right now in certain areas of our of our of our social imaginary so we're working hard to try and make sense of that and again let's see see the alan jacobs conversations and the um you know the movie that he made morality itself again i i recommend this book and a bunch of other books by christian smith because he you know he did the basic sociological work by sitting down and doing the hard work of talking to hundreds of american young people and going more going deeper than just a survey and listening to them talk talk and coming up with this moralistic therapeutic deism and say this is sort of the religion of everyone that god is nice and wants everybody to have a good life and so if we were to write the bible today that's the god we would write and then that god would probably be a little bit impotent to deal with all the horrible things of the world and we can see this god expressed in movies like um like avatar where they're all pantheistic until there's a fight and then god is on their side god suddenly grows a personality and a will and an agenda and now can marshal all of his powers to to make the outcome light to make the outcome good you know the same problems are with the star wars mythology well it's kind of a general pantheism and and the force is out there and there's the dark side and the light side well balance to the force well i thought you were looking for good no you want balance of good and evil is that what you really want so you know we need enough nazis over here and we need enough democrats over here and there we're gonna balance them you know it's americans believe that morality is self-evident that's one of the big takeaways of his research that we say everyone knows what's right and wrong well then why are we talking about it everybody knows gravity works we don't have big discussions about that apparently we're paying so little attention to each other that as we are to the bible um again read c.s lewis and again i think in c.s lewis is the problem of pain you know he gets into some of this stuff because again nothing in this i don't want anyone to listen to this video to imagine that i don't understand why mike and sac or alex is writing the pieces they're writing i can't read numbers 31 and just walk away and say but to watch to read numbers 31 and and walk away and say oh therefore clearly and i was like therefore clearly what well i don't believe in the bible okay what do you believe what do you believe in i mean let's start there what do you believe in how does your world work is there a god if there isn't a god i mean that's easy to do too i don't believe there's a god okay well um then the world is just about chaos and power and us getting our way for this short time while we're here but there's absolutely no guarantee that anything's going to go good at all that's an improvement i don't see it as an improvement we have moral intuitions and that's true i think we do we have moral intuitions i think jonathan height makes makes some strong cases about these moral taste buds there's stuff going on it's not just software it's also hardware this stuff is built in we have moral intuitions but somehow need to keep forgetting that we are formed and this is where we get the the myth of the secret sacred self where you know if i just sit and quietly listen enough then you know just follow your heart and it's like what what do you think we are we we forget all of our social science in a moment of romanticism i i appreciate what what vervecky has to say about romanticism and many people talk about the bible i think well what's in the bible there's a whole bunch of narrative a whole bunch of stories there's laws that's actually relatively small part of the bible there's lists of of numbers of people and genealogies and things a massive part of the bible is prophetic poetry that if you read boy that'll mess up your um your poorly formed uninformed theology um there's proverbs and a lot of people sort of like that because oh it's it's at least telling us what to do but you know you put you take two proverbs and you put them right together about how to answer the fool and it's sort of tells us something about well this isn't exactly just okay i'm just going to read this and i'm going to do it no it's not really how the book seems to want to work and then there's letters and we don't we don't often know the other side of the letters and then there's the apocalyptic which really drives people to read it and then there's the apocalyptic which really drives people crazy some little portions and in the gospels and of course the book of revelations some portions and daniel and what on earth is apocalyptic literature anyway that's the bible it's a really complicated book now i'm a protestant i'd tell you to read it i'd tell you to study it i tell you to think about it because here's the amazing thing about the bible people have been doing this for centuries and people say yeah they've got stuff wrong okay they've gotten plenty of stuff wrong without it why do people keep reading it again this is the beginning of jordan peterson's biblical series what is with this book people aren't being serious about people aren't being serious about the evidence people are not robots running code to people um do people do what everyone knows i'll tell you on the news what to eat and what not to eat do people do it your doctor will tell you what to do and he has science behind you behind him do you do it even dumb simple things and one of the some of the people i follow on twitter are you know the darwin awards where just people are doing just stupid things this is what people do everybody knows nope we don't and even if we do we don't do it do people read a text and apply it without self-biased interpretation no as evidence from massive interpretive pluralism as christian smith says in a later book our massive capacity for denial and self-deception and self-justification we are not very logical we are not very scientific we are enormously human most people i find read the bible for inspiration they sort of maybe they're gonna they got a bible reading program i'm gonna read the whole bible in a year and they kind of you know struggle their way through a lot of long parts of the bible and whoo they hit they hit a piece where something just kind of meshes with their life and they a little thing goes off inside of them and they just feel inspired and i don't i'm not cynical about that because i see the bible i see in my opinion god working through the bible in many people in many different ways and through me and it's just it's just how the works but respect the enormous complexity and how little we know about it and and don't let that that the the little amount of knowledge deter us from doing and getting involved and reading and trying and thinking and listening and being out there in the world and look at the bible wall hangings i've got one on my wall here from a little passage in jeremiah and someone gave that to me it was a very kind gift at a rough point in my life and you know i keep it up there but i i have a little bit of chagrin with that when i look at it because we take these nice little inspirational tidbits and we rip them out of their context and well there's god's word for me today well if god can speak through a donkey can speak through a plaque bought at a little bible house which is now gone because amazon and the internet killed it look at the history of the intra and interpretation in the bible i back in uh late 90s aughts ivp was putting together this ancient christian commentary on scripture and i again i still for the life of me don't know why i've never done this before i've never done it since but i subscribe to the thing and i pay it every month and every time i get one and i have to write the check to pay for the dong-ong thing i think why am i doing this but i did it for all 66 books and so i have i have this entire series it's the only commentary series that i have the whole thing of and part of why i like this is when i open up a when i open up and i read what church fathers thought about the bible and i grab something from um well let's pick uh let's pick a a much more a much more contemporary commentary much more critical these guys are living in different worlds they're reading the same text they're all experts on reading it but they're living in different worlds now does that mean total relativism that we can't learn anything and we shouldn't read it no it just means we have to do a little bit more homework and understand that not only does the bible come out of a particular place in time and space as as john walton says the bible is written for us even if it's not written to us um in the whole miss mixed up mess of humanity god somehow works through all this stuff and does good things now maybe you say no he doesn't okay but but then where what what what what do you have left your power the power of your political your particular tribe right now this tiny little space in time that a virus can wipe out we have a massively overestimation of our own importance especially without a god who says we are important much of the new testament is simply interpretation of the old testament that's that's really what the new testament about it's it's basically a guide to reading the old testament and and part of the reason the new testament comes about as it does is because christians need help in reading the old testament and it's the idea of the the apostles that that kind of gets perpetuated this is how we read this he these hebrew scriptures read the church fathers and look at their interpretation and their application listen to sermons from around the world you'll find wow enormous diversity this is massive experiment that's happening all the time throughout the world and again you say well i don't believe god is in charge of it okay so i don't understand how that's changing your analysis we're all gonna have thoughts about it kathy keller in and really interesting book kathy keller is tim keller's wife and kathy keller tim keller met kathy keller at gordon conwell seminary she was in seminary too and kathy keller is a very smart woman and kathy keller has almost the same education that tim keller has kathy keller doesn't believe she should be a pastor or an elder in a church that's her take from the bible i know a lot of people listening to this will say that's horrible another other groups of people listening to say absolutely i understand that well and she writes about it and in fact she has some really interesting talks about it about no picking and choosing about the bible yeah and that's right that's a good that's that's it's sort of like the the kinds of laws of nature rules that scientists have you have to go with it and so if you're trying to make sense of the bible you try to make sense of the whole bible and you try not to pick and choose even though we can't help but pick and choose both of those things are true so kathy keller wrestles with women in church office we want to have some rationale for not revisiting numbers 31 without just bending to relativism and throwing the thing away and the whole history of christian biblical interpretation is that we wouldn't have the western world if john calvin hadn't basically reinterpreted the biblical rules on charging interest on loans calvin basically says well christian shouldn't charge interest on loans if people are doing this for necessities so no credit card interest when you're buying groceries but if you're using money to invest in something well then you can charge interest well i would think that john calvin probably would have a problem with with our mortgages but again the world has changed even since john calvin so is it is it is it wrong for a christian to pay a mortgage because they're contributing to to usury when's the last time you heard a preacher preach about that it's a real issue it's a biblical issue there's plenty of passages in the bible about lending money at interest and i i know that there will be some people in the comment section that say my mom and dad have never borrowed money at interest and they saved money and they bought their house with cash they probably didn't live in california but this is the way the world works um jesus says it's not what goes into your mouth that makes you unclean it's what comes out of your mouth well what do you do with the entire old testament dietary system people say yeah but christians today they'll eat shellfish and shellfish are prohibited yeah that's because of what jesus said if you don't understand how religion works why people aren't holding slaves today why christians in the in the period of the reformation uh reformed christians would go out and eat sausages in front of their catholic neighbors to prove that they were reformed and not catholic not eating meat on on fridays and the fasting and the monastery i mean all of this stuff this is what happens in religion you say yeah i don't like it i think and i saw carl's comment on my dave rubin that um carl's definition of religion well that that involves certain cultic activities okay but my definition of religion is a lot bigger and i don't know what you call the rest of the stuff then because and i and it also to me gets involved with what you imagine god is so i i personally think we're better off understanding that all life is religious and no god is a religious position just like a god is a religious position but use a different word from religion i i think it's all the same system working together see the council in jerusalem there's no text in the old testament that imagines the teaching of circumcision will be laid aside and there it happens this is what happens this is what happens in religious communities so how to understand it well we need a massive collective communal wisdom project that's how i understand john vervecky's goal in this because he sees that we've lost wisdom and john vervecky wants to bring the best tools from cognitive science and the best tools from religions around the world and bring this all together and a project like that sounds great to me and i'm more than happy to talk to him and to and to work with him on this and this is part of the reason we do meetups where usually at least half the people at the meetups don't believe in god and more than half the people in my meetup don't go to church but let's talk let's think let's wonder let's communicate let's be involved in this project read your bible and say i have a problem with this good i've read my bible probably more i got problems with way more in it than why do you say the word of god it's probably the best name for you could imagine if your god isn't all god number two and a tiny little god number one one of the toughest bubbles to break is the bubble of now okay and actually being involved in studying and not just thinking about it in an abstract way but living into it is one of the best ways to break the bubble of now the diversity of time let your ancestors gk chesterton give your ancestors a seat at the table let them speak into your life why because they survived they brought us here maybe we have something to learn from them maybe we should go on into the future it's a baseline text you might not even believe the text but just following the history of interpretation what you can do is learn massive amounts about past cultures and how they worked their stuff through and we have just tiny tidbits of history left but most of it flows through the bible and even richard dawkins notes that if you don't know the bible you can't consider yourself an educated person you really can't because you're never going to be able to deal with if you live in the west the culture that you've inherited or the culture that went on to colonize the entire world we have massive recorded conversations around it scholars and innocents constantly working through all of these things whether they know it or not now i was doing quite a bit of thinking about religion the other day when we were playing a game my son um my son jared brought home a new game which basically goes through the the great game which was the british you know the british's attempt to subjugate afghanistan and and i was just thinking about how you know it's it's probably not on the personal level that most of these things really take it's on the communal level because what really motivates us is often status it's it's it's gaining it's gaining we adopt the beliefs of those that are attractive to us and we seek opportunity to gain status and we're attracted to people who attract other people who are attracted to us read the mimic desire mimetic desire and renais garrard and so what's so often happening is it's not that people are reading the bible and applying it to their lives it's it's that many of the ideals and not just in the laws but the ideals in the narratives and the images and and and all of the dreams those get into the community and and certain that ideals sort of rise to the top but it's by no means even that even that simple it's read a book like richard foster streams of living water and he notes six different streams in church history the the stream that was that was into prayer and and meditation um the stream that was into virtue living a virtuous life the stream that was in the into the charismatic that the the participatory holy spirit comes upon us and and and we act out of the holy spirit and we wait for the holy spirit to speak the stream of of compassion of service to the poor of of giving our lives to the poor the stream of of works of of work centered you know the protestant reformation stream the sacramental stream which is sort of the opposite one of the things that um and and and so you have all of these different communities manifesting different themes and streams and things from the bible and and and they all have status and hierarchy and rewards and punishments and and this is embodied in a vast vast array all making its way through time that's what's happening you know i have this problem with this in the bible well everybody's had problems with things in the bible the real question is okay what's at the top of your hierarchy is your hierarchy really informed by history because that's probably one of the best that's about the only guide we have is looking behind us and seeing what others have done oh the world has changed yeah the world has changed what are you going to do with that change how are you going to respond to respond to that change one of the things that again i get a bunch of this stuff from tim keller from back when i was studying his stuff um he made he actually got this from a professor at one of his seminary professors made the observation that when revival happens all of the streams come together and they all work together now what i mean by revival doesn't have anything to do with tents or sawdust or anything like that there was a thing called the fulton street revival that happened in 1857 in 1857 there were 30 000 men idle in the streets of new york city i think we have homeless issues now in our streets today 30 000 men idle in the streets of new york city imagine how small the population was in 1857 compared to today drunkenness was rampant the nation was divided by slavery god raised up a praying businessman jeremiah lampfear just a dude a businessman on september 23 1857 he began a noontime prayer meeting on fulton street in the financial district of manhattan now there are a lot fewer people percentage-wise going to church in 1857 than there were in 1957 at the height of the cold war point i made in my last video 1857 he began a noontime prayer meeting on the fulton street of financial district of manhattan out of a city of one million people six people showed up a half hour late did he give up no the group decided to meet the next week and there were 14 the next week there were 23 the following week there were 40 within weeks there were thousands of business leaders meeting daily again these weren't pastors these were businessmen they saw the problems they didn't know what to do they didn't have advanced degrees in biblical studies what did they do they started to pray and that's all they started to pray what happened god moved so powerfully what do we mean god moved so powerfully it's sort of that you know it happened well if it happens blame god right that's how the bible talks half the time sometimes other things not so much i mean we're not going to do that math god moved moved so powerfully that the prayer meeting spread across the nation it is estimated that nearly a million people were converted out of a national population of 35 million think about that today so multiply that times 10 say not quite 350 million people in america that would be 10 million people being converted that would be massive and it started because one dude in new york city saw way too many drunk and homeless people and said i'm going to pray anybody want to come six people throw up a half hour late i'm surprised it wasn't in california some people show up at church a half hour late including 10 000 weekly conversions in new york city for a season between 1860 and 1920 as answers to prayer the evangelical social movement was birthed through the bowery mission but cauli street mission salvation army began in london the student volunteer movement between 1865 and 1900 more african americans came to christ than any other ethnic group in north american history and they still per capita are the most christian population in america today this is our heritage this is the legacy we hope to infuse the hearts and imagination of christ followers for decades to come that was from christianity today stuff happens surprising stuff and and and stuff that i would count as negative too the rise of islam that just completely gutted the eastern church history is wild uncontrollable so you say well there is no god all right well there you're left in the wild uncontrollable history things change my takeaways the bible is not what you think it is and neither are we it's way way more complicated than oh here's something i don't i don't like what god did well i don't like what god does in my life sometimes and and i have questions about those it's its impact is as much communal as individual i think that the bible shapes communities as much as it shapes individuals through this through through our constant desire for status status and motivation that's one of the things i learned from peterson so deeply intertwined you know that's that's why social media is is just such such a deadly drug oh i got a like oh i got a ping oh i got a notification oh why is twitter putting notifications of who my people who people i follow are are following oh i want to follow them too oh she wrote an article oh this my salient's landscape of relevance realization here we go don't count the bible out it's betting betting on betting on the bible's departure in human history is about the worst bet you could make if the last two thousand years is any indication because it's just continuing to pick up steam and you might say oh no what is it going to mean it's going to mean that banks are no longer going to charge money for mortgages really the bible has picked up a lot of steam since the since the days of john calvin and banks are giving out mortgages more than ever despite every verse in the bible against it does that mean we're sinful i know we're sinful and that's not a proof of it but demonstrating our sinfulness is like demonstrating our stupidity that's far more self-evident than our capacity to understand the moral or even define it so go ahead read your bible and talk about it talk about it with other people find a group to talk about it with find a group and and again i would i would far rather have a bible study where people and and there have been plenty of bible studied methods like this out there again as a pastor you see all these things come through people read a passage what do you think about it and i've been in plenty of those bible studies people think crazy things about the bible all the time it's just part of the process people think crazy things about everything all the time it's just part of the process keep talking keep watching keep thinking if you're a christian you believe in god keep praying keep working keep in the game it's really the biggest game the longest game that we've had in human history and it's not going to stop because we read numbers 31 and think this is horrible yeah it's horrible so are people so let's keep working on it
