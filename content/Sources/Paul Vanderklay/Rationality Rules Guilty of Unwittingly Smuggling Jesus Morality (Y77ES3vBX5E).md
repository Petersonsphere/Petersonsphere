 Hi, this is Paul. Friday afternoon I was just looking at some YouTube and rationality rules came up and I noticed, well, I saw a bunch of videos he'd made about Jordan Peterson and I knew he had done that, but then I saw one that was just recent. He had just made a video about Jordan Peterson and this really sort of surprised me because of course Peterson hasn't really done anything for the last seven or eight months. Why is rationality rules still making videos about Jordan Peterson? To me that says something about the impact of Jordan Peterson even on a celebrity atheist who wants to continue to use him as a negative example. Now actually I really liked this video, Jesus Smuggling Is Jordan Peterson Guilty? I really liked this video and I thought the video was accurate in many respects about Jordan Peterson. I know rationality rules and Adam Frended have sort of had a feud in the past. Adam Frended is an atheist but not an anti-theist and of course rationality rules is an anti-theist and in many ways I thought rationality rules sort of made Adam Frended's point in this video. I want to just play a tiny little bit of it which is really the conclusion of the video. While Jordan doesn't Jesus smuggle himself, he facilitates an environment that makes it incredibly easy for others to do so. In other words, Jordan Peterson is Jesus smuggling adjacent. He's not the ant that carries the foliage but he is the ant that clears and protects the path. He doesn't hate certain people. Jordan Peterson is is an enabler and this is really the critical phrase right here. Because of who they are. But he is the ant that clears and protects the path. He doesn't hate certain people because of who they are but he clears the path for those who do so that they can enthrone and maintain their bigotry and law. They can enthrone and maintain their bigotry and law. This is the great sin that the enthronement and maintenance of hate and bigotry and law. Now I've noticed this before amongst the celebrity atheists. There's this really fascinating appearance of Richard Dawkins on Justin Brierley's unbelievable program that I think is in like 2013. You can find it on YouTube. Here's you can look at the thumbnail here. I'll put the link in the description. And what's interesting is that he's having this conversation with a Christian minister and a rabbi and he basically tells them you're not the bad kind of people I'm worried about. The rabbi just tells Dawkins that Dawkins glass meaning Dawkins summary of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah the rabbi's down with the rabbi's fine with it and then Dawkins sort of tells us exactly what his game is. I still worry about people who I know you're not one of them but there are people who think the Bible is literally true. There are people in America many many of them who want to have the Ten Commandments hung up in courthouses contrary to the Constitution and although you can find a decent commandment among the ten thou shalt not kill thou shalt not covet thy neighbor etc but most of them you wouldn't actually want to base your life on. Now I found this comment extremely interesting because okay well let's say you're an atheist so the first few commandments we'll just wave for you I'm the Lord God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage you shall know their gods before me you shall not make a graven image honor your father and mother I think Dawkins would probably be down for that you shall not kill you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor that's about testimony in court you shall not cover your neighbor's wife he even signed on to that one so number one I don't think the Constitution has a lot to say about wall hangings in decorations in courthouses and number two I'd really love to know which of the commandments he finds as incredibly objectionable at least the ones with respect to human behavior but again what we see here and this is a common pattern among the celebrity atheists what they are really concerned about is politics they are really concerned about morality in politics and rationality rules said so they can enthrone and maintain their hate and bigotry in law so if they if their hate and bigotry is apart from the law that's okay and a little bit later on in the video I found this section particularly interesting he was gonna end the video but then he adds this he gets another twitchy celebrity atheist called destiny and again rationality rules completely completely acknowledges this position I did what I normally do while gaming I listened to YouTube videos and in this specific case I listened to destiny and interestingly he essentially voiced the criticism of Jordan Jesus smuggling but in reference to politics the problem with what Jordan Peterson does is Jordan Peterson makes a lot of descriptive claims but he never makes any normative claims so now again I what rationality rule says about Jesus smuggling is true and I think it's exactly what Adam has admonished me a number of times saying well you cross the line into you know supernaturalism or something like that well I'm a Christian pastor so that's that's that's something that I regularly do but but here again this critique is Jordan Peterson tends to keep to the descriptive not the normative but Jordan Peterson will say things like women are not as happy today as they used to be women and men don't get along in the office men tend to be better at this thing now is he saying that Jordan Peterson's descriptive comments here are incorrect or that Jordan Peterson's descriptive comments here are inconvenient or his descriptive comments here are incorrect now the sin that Jordan Peterson is charged with is essentially a religious crime and then that's all he ever says he never goes he never takes a step further to make a prescriptive claim to say like what should we do it's a it's a sin of omission about something and the problem is a lot of people will take the things that he says and then they'd like jump to very bad places kind of obviously it's where you would expect someone to go based on what he said but then he never takes responsibility for any of the kind of normative leaps people make off of his descriptive ones and that's kind of the annoying thing with dealing with Jordan Peterson. Jordan Peterson should take responsibility for the leaps that people make off his descriptive claims that seems rather far-fetched to Jordan Peterson is it seems to be guilty of their atheist religious crimes what do I mean by a religious crime if you watch my last monologue video one of the ways to understand religion is a human authoring program and Jordan Peterson apparently fails to salute the human authoring program that these particular atheists care about more specifically the political human authoring program remember as I've said many times politics is now and religion is always and so Jordan Peterson is guilty of not preaching rightly in their church of what's happening now riffing on an old Flip Wilson sketch he's leaving room for bad people to do bad things as if it's Jordan Peterson's responsibility or ability to stop bad people from doing bad things based on his descriptive claims in other words if Jordan Peterson is making descriptive claims and even true descriptive claims or warranted descriptive claims he ought not to make district descriptive claims if these descriptive claims sort have enable or support or leave room or be the little ant making way for the other little ants to do what this group thinks they shouldn't do who made Jordan Peterson responsible for everyone Jordan Peterson is guilty because he's descriptive but not normative but do you or don't you want him to make normative claims I mean that's that's kind of funny to me it's it's sort of mirrors I've never been one who's been pro prayer in public school that'll put me on a weird divide from a lot of other Christians but that's quite frankly the way the church is and my argument for that is well do you really want these public school teachers offering prayers to me that's it does that doesn't really make any sense I mean what's the religion of the public school teacher going to be they're probably gonna offer a prayer in alignment with their religion and it's not in my opinion it's not the job of a public school teacher to formally offer a prayer on behalf of the public school because it's the way it is so do you or don't you want him making normative claims when you have suspicions about the norms that his norms are immoral they never tell us who these immoral people are but I'm sure they could quite readily say well all right I'm still not exactly sure who those people are and and what their ideas are it's sort of all the usual suspects and it's just obvious now this this charge of insufficient enthusiasm for the church of what's happening now is a very old one and CS Lewis's fine little book which is really just three not very large essays entitled the abolition of man treats this because CS Lewis saw the same kind of thing in the middle of the 20th century in England in the in the 40s and it was this war between traditional morality versus today's evolved ascendant morality today's new and improved morality and CS Lewis goes through and says essentially the argument I'm going to make here that the only way they can actually critique traditional morality is by actually using traditional morality and this is where Richard Dawkins comments about the Ten Commandments are really strange because again apart from the commandments which are specifically theistic let's say which of the commandments do you really have a problem with I'm genuinely curious now usually a whole bunch of contemporary issues will flood into the same sex marriage trans rights the pay gap traditional monogamy till death do us part as an aspiration this is something that we should put away according to many of these people supporting the wrong political party well what's also interesting about this is that this is really quite a multinational conversation Stefan Wolffert from I think that's his name from rationality rules he's in the UK Jordan Peterson is a Canadian Richard Dawkins seems to be quite upset about American politics well okay well mind your own country and there's Australia too so is it just the English-speaking world can we include the Netherlands or Germany or some of these other countries I mean what exactly what exactly is the religious crime that that you are upset with part of this goes into some really sloppy thinking about morality there's a lot of inconsistency going on now I think if you listen to rationality rules he very much brings up what I should really put this book here what Christian Smith noted in his book soul-searching that many people today believe that morality is self-evident that destiny and rationality rules seem to imagine that morality is self-evident everybody should just be it should just be obvious what morality is and anyone who doesn't doesn't salute that self-evident quality and admonishes caution and nuance which Jordan Peterson does regularly in fact if you listen to him you won't you won't hear him decrying same-sex marriage or trans rights or the pay gap or he will admonish traditional morality but in almost every case what he admonishes is hey look be careful with these changes past changes Jordan Peterson is a thoroughgoing Darwinian and he basically has a Darwinian view of morality and says you ought to be very careful before you just willy-nilly start going around changing things because you don't really know the consequences Jordan Peterson would say morality is not self-evident we ought to in fact take great care in terms of looking at morality but anyone who doesn't salute that self-evident quality or admonishes caution or nuance is insufficiently affirming and that's Jordan Peterson's crime you know Adam and I have gone round about objective morality I personally don't like the term objective morality one aspect of objective morality which I think the term is trying to point to which I would agree is that morality is out something outside and beyond ourselves but is it objective sort of like gravity is objective I don't think it's a very good term and I don't think the term points us in the right direction but what we find from his a convenient lack of warrant to identify his source of morality and this is this is very very common and and so morality on one hand is self-evident but morality is also both progressive and universal so so somehow even though morality is self-evident ancient peoples who very well could have understood gravity obviously didn't understand the morality which is so self-evident to us and it's universal so I mean this this whole conceptualization of morality is deeply problematic they keep reminding us of the calendar as if on one hand morality is supposed to be progressive and it's supposed to be universal at the same time well how really does that work does is something right in 2020 that it's wrong in in 1900 see I think actually there is a lot of nuance that is needed here in a lot of conversation because in many ways morality is sort of progressive and universal but you're not going to get it with your charge of it being self-evident and then obviously feels free to judge ancient peoples and their heirs by today's standards sort of a dead naming revisionism about morality and history now groups today should pay for the sins of groups in the past this is a really dangerous precedent something that actually religion has dealt with a lot in the past for example I think it was immoral for Christians to you know blame the Jews for killing Christ because first of all Jesus himself was a Jew that hardly seems like the the particular aspect of Jesus identity that should be highlighted in terms of the crucifixion of Jesus but but this idea of of one group being the heirs of one group being responsible for the sins of their of their ancestors this gets terribly difficult but again in Christianity you've got ideas of original sin and original guilt and it's helpful to to actually look at those doctrines and the conversations around those doctrines in detail before you just kind of go off and say well you know Jordan Peterson is guilty of all of the all of the thought crimes that people who listen to him commit this gets into the second point that morality is both libertarian and legislatively demanded Jordan Peterson is too libertarian in his complaints about bill c-16 compelled speech I would imagine these guys would say are demanded by the new ascendant morality okay so so morality is legislatively demanded which again as a Christian having lived through a number of decades of conversation about morality in the United States at the left would say well you shouldn't try to legislate morality and now suddenly we're very much trying to legislate morality in fact we're trying to legislate the thought of people expressive individualism Robert Bell identified in his book habits of the heart expressive individualism is one way to look at sort of the the normative default religion of our culture expressive individualism is the highest goal if someone in their secret in their hidden secret self feels themselves to be one particular gender or one particular expression well government ought to mandate them the right to express that but what we begin with very quickly see is that some expressions are ought to be confirmed by this group by morality people should be free from government intrusion in their personal lives that used to be an argument about all sorts of things as long as they aren't harming anybody else but others must affirm the lifestyle expression of their neighbors regardless of their own moral intuitions so expressive individualism goes out the window you can express your secret furry self deed out deep down in your heart and the government ought to allow you to dress up like a cat and prance around in streets and maybe use a litter box I don't know but if anybody has thoughts or that are negative and wishes to express those thoughts well now the government has to shut them down well what what kind of a morality is this what kind of expressive individualism is this this is simply incoherent and it's it seems again to just simply pass our fail the fairness test now here's what's really interesting might even their unexamined and inconsistent morality have assumptions in common with Jordan Peterson and an article those of you who follow my rough draft for Sunday know I plucked out an article where this observation is made CS Lewis said nothing strikes me more when I read the controversies of past ages than the fact that both sides are usually assuming without question a good deal which we should now absolutely deny you can find that with the Greeks you can find that all throughout history they thought that they were completely opposed as two sides could be but in fact they were all the time secretly united united with each other and against earlier ages and latter ages by a great mass of common assumptions so in fact it might be helpful if we look at what perhaps is the common assumption between beneath both rationality rules and Jordan Peterson well Western morality I secular humanism I did a couple of videos a little series on on secular humanism just recently about what exactly is secular humanism well if you're trying to avoid listening to religious people you know read John Gray as a very competent historian notes secular humanism is sort of Christianity light trying to strip out all the supernatural stuff and there you have secular humanism that's in many ways what Matt Dillahunty and Sam Harris argue for when they say well we can get to these things without the religious books and we can derive them ourselves now I think Glenn Scrivner really pressed Matt Dillahunty well on that episode of unbelievable about that ability to actually do that without the religious text and without the the community but both have this you know both want to have respect for the individual both want to assume the existence of human rights there's a progressivism built into that which Tom Holland notes in his book Dominion Christianity really starts that secular him humanism is really Christianity when you try to strip away the some of the metaphysical claims and the supernatural claims progressivism really starts in the church and you know the the idea of the New Testament is a progressive revelation upon the old the idea of the revelation of Jesus Christ is a progressive revelation built on the old and even the idea that human activity can can make the world better of course implies some sort of objective unchanging universal moral yardstick CS Lewis at the beginning of his book mere Christianity makes that point that everybody seems to have this moral yardstick where does this moral yardstick come from and now a lot of the inconsistencies I point out here I agree I think morality is both progressive and universal but how do you get there and actually Christians have been working on those ideas for a very long time Tom Holland in his book Dominion has refer Matio it's a self critique that that that that develops in Christianity and and this in fact gets pulled into the modern era and something that rationality rules and Sam Harris and Matt Dillahunty would all be very very comfortable with it's a balance of respect and critique for authority that's very much what you hear Jordan Peterson asking for and at the heart of all of this is an ethic of love now this is exactly where the Jesus smuggling has happened and it has happened a very long time ago and has been happened so successfully that rationality rules can't even see the Jesus smuggling he's doing you don't need to smuggle Jesus you demand his ethics already yourself and again if you don't believe this take a look at the work of Tom Holland take a look at his Delling pod his Delling pod interview on YouTube read his book Dominion this is the point that he's making this is the point that John Gray is making this is a point that people have been making for centuries but rationality rules doesn't see the Jesus smuggling that he's doing Rene Girard said it really well in the first sentence of this quote they complain because they have Christianity to complain with and that's in many ways really what rationality rules is doing in his video as his destiny they're complaining because they have Christianity to complain with they're assuming Jesus ethic of love and basically saying to other people other Christians in fact sometimes rightly you're not living up to the ethic of your master and Christians more than anybody could say yeah I'm probably guilty of that because I don't think the ethic of love in every instance is self-evident what I should do I find love to be often a weighty ethic something that is not particularly self-evident in any particular situation of what love requires of me today Rene Girard said it well they can complain they can complain because they have Christianity to complain with I'd love rationality rules and some of these others to actually explore more deeply their religion their church of what's happening now their human authoring program explore the inconsistencies of it they offer no footnote to the morality they demand they assume the universality and self-evidence of the of the recent innovation they seem to have no awareness of the hazard that ten years from now their church of what's happening now will look sort of old too and be critiqued you know we've seen this very quickly it's important to remember that in 2008 Barack Obama was for civil unions in the United States when's the last time you heard anybody talk about civil unions that was Hillary Clinton's position until 2013 but now seven years later anybody who's insufficiently insufficiently celebratory about same sex marriage is now a moral pariah who must be condemned in fact even if they're not like Jordan Peterson isn't making comments against same-sex marriage he's just offering descriptive questions that might try to lead people to maybe ask deeper questions about whether or not very fast change in public morality is a very good thing this is his crime well Stefan Wolfert is a young man it's in many ways the it's the glory of the young do not know history because they haven't lived much of it well I'd admonish you to be a little bit more humble take a little closer look at your morality ask yourself where do the roots come from ask yourself what do you have in common with Jordan Peterson is your morality both libertarian and legislative legislatively demanded yeah in a lot of ways I'm not in favor of laws against adultery but I do believe that thou shalt not commit adultery is an important moral precept one that in fact of all the changes in sexual morality recently one that hasn't gone away expressive individualism is the highest goal but if if you watch people talking this way you'll notice that they're extremely selective about what they imagine should be allowed to be expressed in public and Jordan Peterson somehow was guilty of making comments about about description and not norms well do you really want him on there so yeah so they can enthrone their men maintain their hate and bigotry in law needs a lot of work now I'm going to do two versions of this video if this if you're watching the short one it ends now if you're watching the long run I'm going to take this conversation I had with Vouch which I thought was an excellent conversation he is someone who's very much wants to is a proponent of polyamory and a whole bunch of these things so he's sort of on the other side with me from me but I thought we had it's sort of framed as a debate of whether Jordan Peterson did more harm than good but I thought we had an excellent conversation and I think in fact the kinds of conversations that Vouch and I had are important to actually have us gain a higher resolution about what is morality what should politics look like traditional morality versus today's evolved ascendant morality I think these are the kinds of conversations we need to have because I actually think all of this stuff is complex so again if this is the short video it ends now if it's the long video it'll go on for a while because I'm just going to splice that other video into this so we'll see how the sound goes I'll put links to them in the notes
