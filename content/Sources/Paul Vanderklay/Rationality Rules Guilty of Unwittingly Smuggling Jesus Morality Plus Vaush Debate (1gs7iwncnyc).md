 Hi, this is Paul. Friday afternoon I was just looking at some YouTube and rationality rules came up and I noticed, well, I saw a bunch of videos he'd made about Jordan Peterson and I knew he had done that, but then I saw one that was just recent. He had just made a video about Jordan Peterson and this really sort of surprised me because of course Peterson hasn't really done anything for the last seven or eight months. Why is rationality rules still making videos about Jordan Peterson? To me that says something about the impact of Jordan Peterson even on a celebrity atheist who wants to continue to use him as a negative example. Now actually I really liked this video, Jesus Smuggling Is Jordan Peterson Guilty? I really liked this video and I thought the video was accurate in many respects about Jordan Peterson. I know rationality rules and Adam Frended have sort of had a feud in the past. Adam Frended is an atheist but not an anti-theist and of course rationality rules is an anti-theist and in many ways I thought rationality rules sort of made Adam Frended's point in this video. I want to just play a tiny little bit of it which is really the conclusion of the video. While Jordan doesn't Jesus smuggle himself, he facilitates an environment that makes it incredibly easy for others to do so. In other words, Jordan Peterson is Jesus smuggling adjacent. He's not the ant that carries the foliage but he is the ant that clears and protects the path. He doesn't hate certain people. Jordan Peterson is is an enabler and this is really the critical phrase right here. Because of who they are. But he is the ant that clears and protects the path. He doesn't hate certain people because of who they are but he clears the path for those who do so that they can enthrone and maintain their bigotry and law. They can enthrone and maintain their bigotry and law. This is the great sin that the enthronement and maintenance of hate and bigotry and law. Now I've noticed this before amongst the celebrity atheists. There's this really fascinating appearance of Richard Dawkins on Justin Brierley's unbelievable program that I think is in like 2013. You can find it on YouTube. Here's you can look at the thumbnail here. I'll put the link in the description. And what's interesting is that he's having this conversation with a Christian minister and a rabbi and he basically tells them you're not the bad kind of people I'm worried about. The rabbi just tells Dawkins that Dawkins glass meaning Dawkins summary of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah the rabbi's down with the rabbi's fine with it and then Dawkins sort of tells us exactly what his game is. I still worry about people who I know you're not one of them but there are people who think the Bible is literally true. There are people in America many many of them who want to have the Ten Commandments hung up in courthouses contrary to the Constitution and although you can find a decent commandment among the ten thou shalt not kill thou shalt not covet thy neighbor etc. but most of them you wouldn't actually want to base your life on. Now I found this comment extremely interesting because okay well let's say you're an atheist so the first few commandments we'll just wave for you I'm the Lord God who brought you out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage you shall know their gods before me you shall not make a graven image honor your father and mother I think Dawkins would probably be down for that you shall not kill you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not bear false witness against your neighbor that's about testimony in court you shall not cover your neighbor's wife he even signed on to that one so number one I don't think the Constitution has a lot to say about wall hangings in decorations in courthouses and number two I'd really love to know which of the commandments he finds as incredibly objectionable at least the ones with respect to human behavior but again what we see here and this is a common pattern among the celebrity atheists what they are really concerned about is politics they are really concerned about morality in politics and rationality rules said so they can enthrone and maintain their hate and bigotry in law so if they if their hate and bigotry is apart from the law that's okay and a little bit later on in the video I found this section particularly interesting he was gonna end the video but then he adds this he gets another twitchy celebrity atheist called destiny and again rationality rules completely completely acknowledges this position I did what I normally do while gaming I listen to YouTube videos and in this specific case I listen to destiny and interestingly he essentially voiced the criticism of Jordan Jesus smuggling but in reference to politics the problem with what Jordan Peterson does is Jordan Peterson makes a lot of descriptive claims but he never makes any normative claims so now again I what rationality rule says about Jesus smuggling is true and I think it's exactly what Adam has admonished me a number of times saying well you cross the line into you know supernaturalism or something like that well I'm a Christian pastor so that's that's that's something that I regularly do but but here again this critique is Jordan Peterson tends to keep to the descriptive not the normative but Jordan Peterson will say things like women are not as happy today as they used to be women and men don't get along in the office men tend to be better at this thing now is he saying that Jordan Peterson's descriptive comments here are incorrect or that Jordan Peterson's descriptive comments here are inconvenient or his descriptive comments here are incorrect now the sin that Jordan Peterson is charged with is essentially a religious crime and then that's all he ever says he never goes he never takes a step further to make a prescriptive claim to say like what should we do it's a it's a sin of omission about something and the problem is a lot of people will take the things that he says and then they'd like jump to very bad places kind of obviously it's where you would expect someone to go based on what he said but then he never takes responsibility for any of the kind of normative leaps people make off of his descriptive ones and that's kind of the annoying thing with dealing with Jordan Peterson. Jordan Peterson should take responsibility for the leaps that people make off his descriptive claims that seems rather far-fetched to Jordan Peterson is it seems to be guilty of their atheist religious crimes what do I mean by a religious crime if you watch my last monologue video one of the ways to understand religion is a human authoring program and Jordan Peterson apparently fails to salute the human authoring program that these particular atheists care about more specifically the political human authoring program remember as I've said many times politics is now and religion is always and so Jordan Peterson is guilty of not preaching rightly in their church of what's happening now riffing on an old Flip Wilson sketch he's leaving room for bad people to do bad things as if it's Jordan Peterson's responsibility or ability to stop bad people from doing bad things based on his descriptive claims in other words if Jordan Peterson is making descriptive claims and even true descriptive claims or warranted descriptive claims he ought not to make district descriptive claims if these descriptive claims sort have enable or support or leave room or be the little ant making way for the other little ants to do what this group thinks they shouldn't do who made Jordan Peterson responsible for everyone Jordan Peterson is guilty because he's descriptive but not normative but do you or don't you want him to make normative claims I mean that's that's kind of funny to me it's it's sort of mirrors I've never been one who's been pro prayer in public school that'll put me on a weird divide from a lot of other Christians but that's quite frankly the way the church is and my argument for that is well do you really want these public school teachers offering prayers to me that's it does that doesn't really make any sense I mean what's the religion of the public school teacher going to be they're probably gonna offer a prayer in alignment with their religion and it's not in my opinion it's not the job of a public school teacher to formally offer a prayer on behalf of the public school because it's the way it is so do you or don't you want him making normative claims when you have suspicions about the norms that his norms are immoral they never tell us who these immoral people are but I'm sure they could quite readily say well all right I'm still not exactly sure who those people are and and what their ideas are it's sort of all the usual suspects and it's just obvious now this this charge of insufficient enthusiasm for the church of what's happening now is a very old one and CS Lewis's fine little book which is really just three not very large essays entitled the abolition of man treats this because CS Lewis saw the same kind of thing in the middle of the 20th century in England in the in the 40s and it was this war between traditional morality versus today's evolved ascendant morality today's new and improved morality and CS Lewis goes through and says essentially the argument I'm going to make here that the only way they can actually critique traditional morality is by actually using traditional morality and this is where Richard Dawkins comments about the Ten Commandments are really strange because again apart from the commandments which are specifically theistic let's say which of the commandments do you really have a problem with I'm genuinely curious now usually a whole bunch of contemporary issues will flood into the same sex marriage trans rights the pay gap traditional monogamy till death do us part as an aspiration this is something that we should put away according to many of these people supporting the wrong political party well what's also interesting about this is that this is really quite a multinational conversation Stefan Wolffert from I think that's his name from rationality rules he's in the UK Jordan Peterson is a Canadian Richard Dawkins seems to be quite upset about American politics well okay well mind your own country and there's Australia too so is it just the English-speaking world can we include the Netherlands or Germany or some of these other countries I mean what exactly what exactly is the religious crime that that you are upset with part of this goes into some really sloppy thinking about morality there's a lot of inconsistency going on now I think if you listen to rationality rules he very much brings up what I should really put this book here what Christian Smith noted in his book soul-searching that many people today believe that morality is self-evident that destiny and rationality rules seem to imagine that morality is self-evident everybody should just be it should just be obvious what morality is and anyone who doesn't doesn't salute that self-evident quality and admonishes caution and nuance which Jordan Peterson does regularly in fact if you listen to him you won't you won't hear him decrying same-sex marriage or trans rights or the pay gap or he will admonish traditional morality but in almost every case what he admonishes is hey look be careful with these changes past changes Jordan Peterson is a thoroughgoing Darwinian and he basically has a Darwinian view of morality and says you ought to be very careful before you just willy-nilly start going around changing things because you don't really know the consequences Jordan Peterson would say morality is not self-evident we ought to in fact take great care in terms of looking at morality but anyone who doesn't salute that self-evident quality or admonishes caution or nuance is insufficiently affirming and that's Jordan Peterson's crime you know Adam and I have gone round about objective morality I personally don't like the term objective morality one aspect of objective morality which I think the term is trying to point to which I would agree is that morality is out something outside and beyond ourselves but is it objective sort of like gravity is objective I don't think it's a very good term and I don't think the term points us in the right direction but what we find from his a convenient lack of warrant to identify his source of morality and this is this is very very common and and so morality on one hand is self-evident but morality is also both progressive and universal so so somehow even though morality is self-evident ancient peoples who very well could have understood gravity obviously didn't understand the morality which is so self-evident to us and it's universal so I mean this this whole conceptualization of morality is deeply problematic they keep reminding us of the calendar as if on one hand morality is supposed to be progressive and it's supposed to be universal at the same time well how really does that work does is something right in 2020 that it's wrong in in 1900 see I think actually there is a lot of nuance that is needed here in a lot of conversation because in many ways morality is sort of progressive and universal but you're not going to get it with your charge of it being self-evident and then obviously feels free to judge ancient peoples and their heirs by today's standards sort of a dead naming revisionism about morality and history now groups today should pay for the sins of groups in the past this is a really dangerous precedent something that actually religion has dealt with a lot in the past for example I think it was immoral for Christians to you know blame the Jews for killing Christ because first of all Jesus himself was a Jew that hardly seems like the the particular aspect of Jesus identity that should be highlighted in terms of the crucifixion of Jesus but but this idea of of one group being the heirs of one group being responsible for the sins of their of their ancestors this gets terribly difficult but again in Christianity you've got ideas of original sin and original guilt and it's helpful to to actually look at those doctrines and the conversations around those doctrines in detail before you just kind of go off and say well you know Jordan Peterson is guilty of all of the all of the thought crimes that people who listen to him commit this gets into the second point that morality is both libertarian and legislatively demanded Jordan Peterson is too libertarian in his complaints about bill c-16 compelled speech I would imagine these guys would say are demanded by the new ascendant morality okay so so morality is legislatively demanded which again as a Christian having lived through a number of decades of conversation about morality in the United States at the left would say well you shouldn't try to legislate morality and now suddenly we're very much trying to legislate morality in fact we're trying to legislate the thought of people expressive individualism Robert Bell identified in his book habits of the heart expressive individualism is one way to look at sort of the the normative default religion of our culture expressive individualism is the highest goal if someone in their secret in their hidden secret self feels themselves to be one particular gender or one particular expression well government ought to mandate them the right to express that but what we begin we very quickly see begin to see is that some expressions are ought to be confirmed by this group by morality people should be free from government intrusion in their personal lives that used to be an argument about all sorts of things as long as they aren't harming anybody else but others must affirm the lifestyle expression of their neighbors regardless of their own moral intuitions so expressive individualism goes out the window you can express your secret furry self deed out deep down in your heart and the government ought to allow you to dress up like a cat and prance around in streets and maybe use a litter box I don't know but if anybody has thoughts or that are negative and wishes to express those thoughts well now the government has to shut them down well what what kind of a morality is this what kind of expressive individualism is this this is simply incoherent and it's it seems again to simply pass our fail the fairness test now here's what's really interesting might even their unexamined and inconsistent morality have assumptions in common with Jordan Peterson and an article those of you who follow my rough draft for Sunday know I plucked out an article where this observation is made CS Lewis said nothing strikes me more when I read the controversies of past ages than the fact that both sides are usually assuming without question a good deal which we should now absolutely deny you can find that with the Greeks you can find that all throughout history they thought that they were completely opposed as two sides could be but in fact they were all the time secretly united united with each other and against earlier ages and latter ages by great mass of common assumptions so in fact it might be helpful if we look at what perhaps is the common assumption between beneath both rationality rules and Jordan Peterson well Western morality I've secular humanism I did a couple of videos a little series on on secular humanism just recently about what exactly is secular humanism well if you're trying to avoid listening to religious people you know read John Gray John Grace as a very competent historian notes secular humanism is sort of Christianity light trying to strip out all the supernatural stuff and there you have secular humanism that's in many ways what Matt Dillahunty and Sam Harris argue for when they say well we can get to these things without the religious books and we can derive them ourselves now I think Glenn Scrivner really pressed Matt Dillahunty well on that episode of unbelievable about that ability to actually do that without the religious text and without the the the community but both have this you know both want to have respect for the individual both want to assume the existence of human rights there's a progressivism built into that which Tom Holland notes in his book Dominion Christianity really starts that secular humanism is really Christianity when you try to strip away the some of the metaphysical claims and the supernatural claims progressivism really starts in the church and you know the the idea of the New Testament is a progressive revelation upon the old the idea of the revelation of Jesus Christ is a progressive revelation built on the old and and even the idea that human activity can can make the world better of course implies some sort of objective unchanging universal moral yardstick CS Lewis at the beginning of his book mere Christianity makes that point that everybody seems to have this moral yard stick where does this moral yardstick come from and now a lot of the inconsistencies I point out here I agree I think morality is both progressive and universal but how do you get there and actually Christians have been working on those ideas for a very long time Tom Holland in his book Dominion has refermatio it's a self critique that that that that develops in Christianity and and this in fact gets pulled into the modern era and something that rationality rules and Sam Harris and Matt Dillahunty would all be very very comfortable with it's a balance of respect and critique for authority that's very much what you hear Jordan Peterson asking for and at the heart of all of this is an ethic of love now this is exactly where the Jesus smuggling has happened and it has happened a very long time ago and has been happened so successfully that rationality rules can't even see the Jesus smuggling he's doing you don't need to smuggle Jesus you demand his ethics already yourself and again if you don't believe this take a look at the work of Tom Holland take a look at his Delling pod his Delling pod interview on YouTube read his book Dominion this is the point that he's making this is the point that John Gray is making this is a point that people have been making for centuries but rationality rules doesn't see the Jesus smuggling that he's doing Rene Girard said it really well in the first sentence of this quote they complain because they have Christianity to complain with and that's in many ways really what rationality rules is doing in his video as his destiny they're complaining because they have Christianity to complain with they're assuming Jesus ethic of love and basically saying to other people other Christians in fact sometimes rightly you're not living up to the ethic of your master and Christians more than anybody could say yeah I'm probably guilty of that because I don't think the ethic of love in every instance is self-evident what I should do I find love to be often a weighty ethic something that is not particularly self-evident in any particular situation of what love requires of me today Rene Girard said it well they can complain because they have Christianity to complain with I'd love rationality rules and some of these others to actually explore more deeply their religion their church of what's happening now their human authoring program explore the inconsistencies of it they offer no footnote to the morality they demand they assume the universality and self-evidence of the of the recent innovation they seem to have no awareness of the hazard that ten years from now their church of what's happening now will look sort of old too and be critiqued you know we've seen this very quickly it's important to remember that in 2008 Barack Obama was for civil unions in the United States when's the last time you heard anybody talk about civil unions that was Hillary Clinton's position until 2013 but now seven years later anybody who's insufficiently insufficiently celebratory about same-sex marriage is now a moral pariah who must be condemned in fact even if they're not like Jordan Peterson isn't making comments against same-sex marriage he's just offering descriptive questions that might try to lead people to maybe ask deeper questions about whether or not very fast change in public morality is a very good thing this is his crime well Stefan Wolfert is a young man it's in many ways the it's the glory of the young do not know history because they haven't lived much of it well I'd admonish you to be a little bit more humble take a little closer look at your morality ask yourself where do the roots come from ask yourself what do you have in common with Jordan Peterson is your morality both libertarian and legislative legislatively demanded yeah in a lot of ways I'm not in favor of laws against adultery but I do believe that thou shalt not commit adultery is an important moral precept one that in fact of all the changes in sexual morality recently one that hasn't gone away expressive individualism is the highest goal but if you watch people talking this way you'll notice that they're extremely selective about what they imagine should be allowed to be expressed in public and Jordan Peterson somehow was guilty of making comments about about description and not norms do you really want him on there so yeah so they can enthrone their men maintain their hate and bigotry in law needs a lot of work now I'm going to do two versions of this video if this if you're watching the short one it ends now if you're watching the long run I'm going to take this conversation I had with Valsh which I thought was an excellent conversation he is someone who's very much wants to is a proponent of polyamory and a whole bunch of these things so he's sort of on the other side with me from me but I thought we had it's sort of framed as a debate of whether Jordan Peterson did more harm than good but I thought we had an excellent conversation and I think in fact the kinds of conversations that Valsh and I had are important to actually have us gain a higher resolution about what is morality what should politics look like traditional morality versus today's evolved ascendant morality I think these are the kinds of conversations we need to have because I actually think all of this stuff is complex so again if this is the short video it ends now if it's the long video it'll go on for a while because I'm just going to splice that other video into this so we'll see how the sound goes I'll put links to them in the notes hey everybody today we are debating whether or not Jordan Peterson has hurt more people than he has helped and we're starting right now ladies and gentlemen thrilled to have you here this is gonna be a lot of fun you guys I am excited so what we have tonight is two you could say veteran debaters when it comes to Jordan Peterson although they've got debate experience in other ways we've had both these gentlemen on I can tell you by getting to chat with them I'm like I really enjoy both of their personalities so I'm excited that they're meeting tonight and that I would say these guys are also very experienced in terms of the the work of Jordan Peterson one of the most controversial figures of our time and it's good just gonna be a blast to hear them so first I just want to say up front thank you very much for Vash and Paul VanderKlay appreciate you guys being here thanks for coming on tonight it's my pleasure the pleasure is mine entirely thank you and to those of you who are watching in the modern-day debate channel a phenomenal channel you should go check it out if you have not already I apologize for my invisibility my second camera crapped out on me okay so you're gonna be enjoying Paul's face and you know what I am going to be too be perfectly honest phenomenally goon goatee we are all lucky to be in its presence very it in champ buttering you up that's the debate that's debate tactic number one now it's harder to be mean to me an enchanting goatee indeed and we are stoked I want to let you know both of the speakers have their links in the description already so if you're enjoying listening to them you're like mmm I like that you want more excellent you can get it at those links right down there in the description see so glad to have them here and also want to mention if this is your first time here consider hitting that subscribe button if you want reminders about future debates we have coming up for example we have a tag team debate tomorrow night Skyler fiction and none of the none other than his friend and partner dr. Josh will be on here going against Joel and Tyler on Christian ethics so that will be a provocative one another juicy one and also want to say whether you be Republican Democrat one of the many strange creatures in between Christian atheists you name it we are glad that you are here it's a nonpartisan channel we have no stances other than we just think dialogue and debate are good things and we are glad to have you here so with that you're going to jump right into this discussion thank you again gentlemen want to just basically we get I guess since Vash has taken the affirmative and kind of let him get the ball rolling in terms of why he would take his stance and then from there is just kind of right into the discussion so Vash the floor is yours yeah absolutely thank you very much so Jordan B Peterson is a figure that I've had conflicted feelings on for a while I don't I don't personally like him very much but then but that's largely irrelevant you know that can be aesthetic preferences when it comes to his content though when it comes to the stuff he does on one hand I don't actually have much of a problem with the prescriptive judgments he makes and concerns to psychology and self-help now now I now I admit I'm not you know I don't have a doctorate in psychology I don't really have the professional background to understand the extent of and the nature of the claims that he makes or their validity specifically but the broader takes that he has for example the need of order in one's life to take care of your of your surroundings to be prescient to be disciplined and responsible to take happiness as a measure from one's accomplishment to not allow yourself to such-and-such you know chaos is a dragon I don't actually disagree with a lot of that and there are probably a lot of young men there are a lot of young men who stand to benefit from that advice and in that respect I have nothing but where my problems come in is that he is not actually known for his self-help he achieved prominence when he published that video series following the voting into law the the legislation c16 in Canada and he did that he he did this very this very performative oh political correctness free speech on campus I will not be arrested for my views kind of thing and you know it's fun and glad and dandy but he's his political takes his historical takes basically everything he does that deviates from his from his background from his field are deeply troubling I mean there's the obvious and inescapable sort of misogyny behind many of his propositions chaos is feminine women wearing lipstick in the workplace we don't know if men and women can work together there are a lot of views there that I take issue with but last but not least and I guess you know Gish Gallup the main one that really gets me is his neo-cultural mark I'm actually forgetting the particular way he strings together these words these neo-Marxist post modernists or neo postmodern postmodern neo-Marxist there we go it's leaving aside the problems in that terminology he propagates this myth and this is a very troubling myth to me because it leads inexorably towards fascism and it is the myth that our institutions are crumbling under the weight of a conspiracy a far-left culturally Marxist conspiracy theory that has infiltrated essentially every aspect of Western society that is now enforcing its its authority by forcing us to use perhaps gender pronouns you know that the recipient wishes to have used on them and this is essentially fascist propaganda it's mostly indistinguishable from cultural Bolshevism the conspiracy theory that was so loved by the Nazis the Nazis and it makes me wonder how much of this is poisoning the discourse how many young men are getting a good sale on personal life advice mixed in with a lot of bad that's what I worry about okay you bet all all yours Paul oh well the question to me was interesting because I don't really know how many people he's hurt but I got interested in Jordan Peterson not so much because of the culture war issues those things caught my attention I didn't know why a professor of psychology at University of Toronto would be kvetching over over gender fluid pronouns what caught my attention was the fact that I heard a lot of people listening to him and saying things like they were interested in the Bible and they're interested in going to church and as a pastor I listened to this and I listened to Jordan Peterson and I noted he's not much of an institution builder and so then my concern was who was going to come after Jordan Peterson with the people that he is talking to and help them find something a little bit a little bit more sustainable to work on their lives with and so then what I did was I you know I made a video about Jordan Peterson I intended maybe to get some other interested conversation partners and what began to happen was I started getting a steady stream of emails and requests for speaking to people and as that happened I started making having conversations with people who had been watching Jordan Peterson quite a bit and as I began talking to those people I began sharing some of those conversations online when with the consent of the people that I was discussing it with and discovering that a good number of people found themselves finding relief from depression and probably probably depression from nihilism or something of them of something of that fact and finding themselves feeling a lot better performing better having some motivation to work on their personal lives to work on their relationships and I've just spent the last two years mostly talking people that have pretty much said my life is better because I listened to Jordan Peterson and he I followed his you know some of his advice like do what is meaningful not as not what's expedient and along the way my life is better and what I've done as a pastor is try to gather these people together so that they could support each other and make good goals and keep moving forward and in that group have been mostly men but but a certain probably 20% of them have been women many of the women that began to follow me and seek out conversation with me were mothers who had seen sons and nephews who had been struggling in school and after listening to Jordan Peterson actually began to get their lives on track so I'm uncertain as to how many people have been hurt by Jordan Peterson but I've got a pretty good sense of how many people have been helped by him I am okay is are we are we moving into open debate or is there a you bet got you gotcha hell yeah oh oh yeah I'm so I'm so happy I was afraid we were gonna have like another like like bad faith shouting match this is fantastic okay so I don't disagree with anything that you said I strongly disagree not sorry disagree that's a very light word for what I feel I despise the alienation that has gripped so many people in our society you know the this this detachment from oneself one the detachment from an ability to sort of pursue meaningful work and there are a ton of there are so many um there are so many disciplines that try to pursue this question for example like the the anti-capitalist wrote like method of describing this would be like alienation from one work and one's community brought about by the material like modernization of social student and the the commodification of life you know but there's a million ways that you can approach that I would love very much so to help or to see people help with their depression my concern though is have you ever heard I don't know how much you like what like horrid corners of the internet you like poke your head into from time to time have you ever heard of a a place called the red the red pill I've heard of the red pill sure oh yeah okay I'm glad its reputation proceeds it's this community and I don't know how much exactly you know but it's a community on on reddit though it has like branches elsewhere and it's it's a very virulently misogynistic self-help community that advocates men are like intrinsically superior to women and women should women women should be like the the second in command of their own lives and men need to be strong and learn how to manipulate women's emotions in order to maximize their gain out of life and women enjoy this process because women are designed to be like emotionally subservient and and the red pill isn't as relevant as it used to be but I remember back in the day when talking about whether or not this was a horrid place people people would say like this place is disgusting it's filled with virulent misogyny these people talk about like why rape should be legal like these people are beyond the pale and then somebody else would say true okay fine fair however they have given me a lot of advice you know go outside you got to exercise eat clean and they would list off these like self-help tidbits that like that resonated with them to which the the response you know is don't you think there are there are other ways and from other communities that you could have learned those messages and that's my problem with jbp and you i think might partially agree with that because you if i'm understanding what you said correctly you're of the opinion that there's not much longevity to the advice that he offers because it's centered almost around a cult of personality he holds i don't know if the advice centers around a cult of personality but i think we've i think now since his retreat from the stage because of the um i think the illness of his wife and then his hospitalization i think that sort of marks the end of at least the first jordan peterson wave we have we have yet to see if there'll be a second wave when he publishes his new book if he does another speaking tour many of the people who have watched his videos reached a a saturation point at some point and so they they got motivated to clean up their room but again as a pastor i know that people can go to a church service they can see hear a sermon or see a presentation they can be moved and they can make all kinds of pledges to improve their lives but what does it take to actually improve your life that we are far more shaped by our habits than are by our habits than we are by our intentions and so the community that has gathered around me i highly doubt too many misogynists would want to listen to one to two hour messages and conversations by a christian minister because they're not going to get that sort of anti-woman slant and so that's that hasn't been the community that has gathered around me whether some people would pick up certain strains of what jordan has to say and interpret it in a misogynist or in you know in a in a certain light peterson himself has on various occasions rejected this this alt right tag and i think i think reasonably so because at least i mean canadian politics are a little bit to the left of american politics and if you listen to a lot of his older messages he was sort of a moderate canadian in terms of i mean he believes in the canadian health care system and all of this so in terms of tracking him in that way but people are prone to listen to messages and interpret it in the ways that they find useful and then propagate it with their own slants and so that people would take this with his messages that's fine but i i don't know what if there will be a chapter two for jordan peterson on the public stage like there was a chapter one and so my intention was well those people who have been energized and motivated by his message what can i do to build a community around them to make their lives better that's been my goal okay yeah i think i mean i think that's an extremely reasonable goal what well obviously i think it's an admirable one what so so distancing peterson from the the community he often fosters which i think anyone could charitably describe perhaps as a mixed bag you've experienced from his community a group of people who are earnest in their desire to seek self-improvement and not bog down with with the with the the milo of reactionary politics what specific um what specific pieces of advice do you think he offers that really resonate with um with the people who need that help like i know that obviously like the clean clean your room like i know i know that's like a classic one but in your experience what parts of what he says like really hit home with those people i i think so so for many of the people a lot of the the impact they received at least again this is part of a this is part of a sample bias because i'm a christian minister and i started making commentaries on his biblical series so then my question was and really i got into him and started studying him because i wanted to know why there are you know thousands of churches including my own that have plenty of empty seats and this canadian psychologist could fill a moderately sized concert hall in toronto charging 40 bucks a seat selling out each time giving two plus hour lectures on the bible i mean what is that about and to me it showed a hunger in our society for a level well for a certain kind of biblical commentary of all things that people had an intense hunger for and those people who listened to it couldn't really tell me what they were getting out of it and so that drove me to ask those questions and to try to figure out what on earth is going on and i think it has a lot to do with the the emptiness of a secular life and the resonance that our connection to the past via nearly you know very the age-old stories offers to people who look around and say what what why am i alive what does it matter and you know that was obviously something that in terms of my church background mom and dad was saying for 20 years yeah exactly um okay wait hold on i gotta challenge you on that do you feel there's an inherent emptiness to secular life or do you think that secularity might correspond or like there might be a correlation between the two i think a lot of people felt a void so there's been another canadian psychologist that i've done some work with named john burvaki and and he's he's labeled what he calls a meaning crisis now this isn't new you can you can pretty much pervasive throughout the 20th century people have been struggling with meaning and nihilism and and meaning actually is see for jordan peterson meaning is a sacrament it connects us to the transcendent and the divine and i think a lot of people struggled with meaning especially men because i don't think men men in our there's a whole lot here before the age of 22 many people in our society are given no responsibility and they're expected to just keep going through school until they get out of college and then maybe someone will give them a responsibility which is a very different thing from how human beings have lived for just about the rest of human history and i think what jordan peterson helped put on the map is that their life does mean something and they should get going with it and some people took him up at his offer and discovered yeah that's that's really important and but again i saw that you're motivated to do something in a minute you're gonna need something to help you um yeah i don't i mean i don't disagree that this is typically a problem that men face especially because masculinity has seen so much deconstruction over the past 50 years in a way that i don't believe femininity has and then there are a wide variety of social reasons for that and i mean i'm a gender abolitionist i support that process i don't want there to be men or women or anything really but i do recognize that as they exist now men as the construct are struggling and i do want something done about that the issue that i have here is that it's very easy to um it's very easy to ascribe solutions that end up having really bad consequences down the road after all the the the characteristic alienated young man you know lonely not particularly good with women these are all fairly rote tropes this is the um this is the pool from which pretty much all political radicalization stems from uh whether that be far left socialist um whether that be isis suicide bomber this is like the this is like the the the the the still water mosquito breeding ground from which you can get a lot of really extreme political views and i think it's unfortunate that a lot of people are brought about to political radicalization through what is essentially loneliness and alienation but i'm also worried that some attempts to fix that might end up leading these people down roads that are unsustainable or or or actively detrimental to society which is why and i have to bring it back to this i in your experience you've met a lot of people who have benefited from jbp's teachings or or at least the message resonated that's great i wouldn't no problem with that um the issue i have is that in the context of his broader popularity which is aligned for the most part with right leaning politics what with him getting his start with the trans pronoun thing and c16 and such and such um it feels as though it's very difficult to distinguish people who genuinely could benefit from jbp and his advice and his outlook and people who are just along for the ride who might end up going down a really bad road a year or two or three down that way and there are secular people i know too who have jumped in on jbp quite a few of them and it's probably not for his biblical talks it's probably for the political ascriptions that he sort of pushes into his self-help rhetoric i think jordan peterson was something of a Rorschach test a lot of people gathered around him from a lot of different agenda areas one of the things that i did early on so i started making videos and people are like well people in sacramento started talking to me well we should do a meetup and i thought i don't know okay i've got a church building i'm used to leading small groups let's do a meetup and so i you know put something on meetup.com and people started coming and i began to who's going to show up to this thing most of the mostly men probably again um eight out of ten were men and i was curious are these going to be the proverbial basement dwellers who are living in their mom's basement covered with cheetos dust playing video games and looking at porn all day most of the men that showed up were in fact doing very well in terms of you know they had a job they they're earning very good money they're they're actually quite well put together many of them single um a few people struggling in some of those ways that that we imagine jordan's followers were one of the things that came out very quickly is that many of the men are dealing with a difficulty in terms of what i call the generational handshake and which is men and women finding each other establishing a stable monogamous relationship having children and being able to manage a marriage which is not an easy thing for anyone being able to marriage manage a marriage well for the long term i think part of what got people's interest is ironically jordan peterson comes out and starts advocating for some of these traditional positions and so that's why a lot of conservatives sort of gathered around him but what i so it was it was interesting because i suddenly have this group of men around me and my wife goes off to tahoe with a group of friends and she comes back to me and says you know do you know any guys who are like in their mid-30s and have good careers on our single because i just spent the whole weekend with a whole bunch of 30-something women who have been successful in their careers and they would love nothing better than to find a man to settle down with and so what we've seen i think is good news fellows well except you know most of the men in my group are just a little bit too young and the difficulty is that i think you're right in that society for the last 40-50 years has been trying to renegotiate what what it means to be a woman in our society and so there have been there's been a tremendous amount of emphasis and focus on that aspect and there's been relatively little work done on the on the men's side of the equation and so what we have right now is we have a lot of men and a lot of women who have a lot of dissatisfaction with whether men and women can find each other and settle down and get married have children and continue the species and so i don't know and jordan peterson sort of came out and said you know what you should you know you should stop living with your girlfriend you should marry her and you should settle down and form a family i found a lot of women who are i i was i find a lot of women who are actually quite excited to hear that someone is telling men to stop using women for sex and to make a commitment and to actually be a man which means follow through with your word make a commitment stay in there when times are hard because that's what it means to be a man and people got that message from jordan peterson and i thought that's a positive message so i i agree with what you've said there has been reconstruction done in in what we understand femininity to mean and not so much done in regards to men i know and i i say because i i live stream you know i talk to a decent number of people there are a lot of dudes who have absolutely no idea how they're meant to live their lives on one hand there's the archetypically masculine the hegemonic um uh you know you you just get your job and you settle down you marry you know quickly and you have the children and um and then on the other hand like many of the social institutions that made that a viable choice 40 50 years ago are starting to wear a bit a lot of the social and literal institutions what with the wages not rising to meet uh cost of living standards and it leaves people in a in a bit of a bit of a bind when it comes to where to move forward from that point and i don't i don't know if what jordan b peterson advocates this sort of christian traditionalism is that way i don't know i don't know if it's sustainable in the long run it feels to me like everything that we had upon which that gender dynamic was built is is on a train and it is hurtling towards a mountainside and what jordan b peterson is doing is making sure people don't jump off the train before it hits i feel like the the systems he's trying to advocate for are worn thin they're wearing and what we're going to see even in regards to the people who are just earnestly interested in self-help is that a little bit down the line they've moved forward without realizing the rugs kind of been shuffled a little bit to the side i imagine we're probably going to see people who in their pursuit of sort of a traditional gender dynamic um aren't really capable of keeping up with society's rapidly evolving expectations for how people are supposed to behave it's in essence a reactionary wave a a response to alienation from society with what has worked for centuries but may no longer and that's why i'm i'm hoping you say that jbp's self-help may not have the longevity it needs i'm hoping that if something comes next or something substitutes that it might be a little bit more um institutional it might be more interested in tackling what it is with society that is causing people's problems than the idea that a a dearth in personal discipline and traditional responsibility are responsible for the loneliness that so many men feel you know what i mean yeah i'm not sure what what you what you're referring to when you talk about the train hurtling towards the mountainside what what is that train or what's on that train i feel like the traditional gendered expectations jordan peterson talks about it a lot himself you know we don't know the rules for how men and women are supposed to work together in the workplace um and as segments of the society become more sort of progressive marriage is becoming less and less of a viable option for people it's marriage rates are declining divorce rates increasing i feel like that this this almost it's not necessarily counter-cultural this this revival of cultural efforts to impose traditional gender standards might inadvertently put people in a position where they are forced to break rather than bend not meaningfully address what's going on with society and try to rectify that with your personal expectations but rather stoically continue the course to plant your feet firmly on the ground and act well and act traditionally and act like a man in spite of whatever might change between now and the future and that's a little worrying for me i don't know i don't know how that's going to pan out in the long run you know what i mean yeah from what i'm seeing it's that women women are being so i did a meetup in san francisco um just beautiful city it's gorgeous city um and i did a meetup in san francisco in conjunction with a jordan peterson event the the the people setting up the event offered me a room to do a meetup and you know i could get tickets sold and stuff a a fair number of women came to that meetup that don't usually come to my sacramento meetups and most of those women were in their mid-30s and a lot of these women were angry because a lot of these women said when i was in my 20s people told me my career would be fulfilling and i've pursued my career and i've been very successful and now i'm in my mid-30s and i look at my mother's life who had children and a husband and a home and i think she made the better choice and i feel robbed now i also talked to men that i remember talking to one man and he was in his he's in his 30s and he had been together with his girlfriend lived with her for about three or four years and he told me he said she's been she's been putting more and more pressure on to make a commitment and get married and have a child and i kind of feel like the relationship has plateaued and there's a there's an opportunity in another city and so i'm kind of thinking maybe of of you know he didn't say it but basically of ditching and what he had done is lived with his girlfriend for the last four years or so which for him you know he moves to another city's in his mid-30s finds another girlfriend maybe in her 20s or 30s and moves on with his life this and you know hey no harm no foul i never promised you anything but in the meantime that's a strategy that's right this woman has spent four years of her life investing in him and getting nothing out of it i now know more and more women now in their 30s looking at in vitro fertilization in order to try to have a child without a man now i have i have had five kids and so i i know with my wife and i've been together 31 years i know what it takes to raise a child and it is not easy and it is not getting easier and so people keep talking about well this traditional this traditional landscape maybe that won't work i've yet to see someone that has is proposing that something that would work especially for children because what i've seen in talking to a good many people is that the nihilism and the depression almost all of them have told me stories about their parents breaking up and their parents their father's new girlfriend or their mother's new boyfriend and on and on i don't see a lot of hope in that in that line and i don't have a lot of confidence that we're just going to make something up that works better than what we've done before as difficult as what we've done before has been i am i i worry that a lot of the um a lot of the ascriptions we make of past times are are are tainted by rose-colored glasses a lot of people this is commonly cited for example a lot of people speak about how women are now less happy than they were back before it was commonly accepted for a woman to work that women's liberalization in the workplace has or sorry liberation in the workplace has has come at a cost to their happiness and that makes a kind of intuitive sense after all i mean it's work is you know and it's probably not as intuitively fulfilling as as raising a family as people everyone loves raising families i mean being around kids i think these are just dopamine machines i'm not okay i know i know i'm sorry do you have any children no i do not um um i know i was and i was about to say caveat not a parent i don't know i like kids they're nice you know i can devil to raise i i do not doubt it i do not doubt it but i think fundamentally people like raising kids and in a broader spiritual sense and um but at the same time you know there are a lot of things we'd like to gloss over when we look at how the traditional dynamic happened sort of in the past back with the with the nuclear family you know when it was more common we can choose an arbitrary time period 50 60s but there was a there was a lot of abuse in fact spousal rape wasn't even recognized until fairly recently in some states um and there was a lot of i think genuine unhappiness that was painted over by the um by the expectation that everyone keep going and pretend everything's fine that's stiff upper lip mentality that's not to say it's necessarily worse than what we have now but the reason why things fell apart i don't think is because of like feminism or or radical progressive or cultural marxism or anything like that i think it's rather because the economic circumstances that allowed people to support themselves in the nuclear family just kind of fell apart you can no longer live off one income in a family at least not for 90 percent of americans so now people are working gig jobs the the unemployment is incredibly low but underemployment is radically high people don't really know if in six months they're going to have the same job people don't really have a sense of attachment to their workplace and people are owning homes with less and less often more and more empty properties are getting bought up by um by exorbitantly wealthy companies that are using them as like investment opportunities and it seems like the american dream is is dying and i think those gender roles were part of the american dream i and and this is where this is where i unveil my true power level because um i i believe that humans work best um operating communally i think that one of the most horrific things that that modern liberalism like capitalism the the you know anything post-enlightenment one of the most horrid things it's done to us is it's forced us off to cordoned us into these little suburban boxes where you don't know the name of your neighbor across the street where you you work gig jobs you barely know the name of your employees before you're fettered out to work your next you you're alienated and i think that's what people are suffering from really and it happens in our relationships too nobody has the monetary sense to commit there's no the bedrock is gone it's just people now lonely and and trying not to end up on the street which is easy there are a lot of support programs out there at least it's easy for some but to live comfortably that is incredibly hard now and i wonder if we couldn't accommodate this this new frenetic life which we'll surely soon see changes with a different type of dynamic a different way of addressing that alienation socialism i i i throwing it in at the end see socialism underneath just need to slide it underneath the paper slip under the door oh socialism how'd you get in here i you know i agree with a lot of what you a lot of what you're saying it's interesting however that in almost every case women initiate divorce yet divorce is almost always catastrophic for the women and children and so whereas i certainly agree with you that the um the past the past let's say the the past corporate model where in the 50s and 60s you had the company man who had a pension being managed by the corporation and good job security and sufficient income so that his wife could you know stay home with the kids i think a lot of people would give their eye teeth for that today and and that's simply gone and so there's there's no question in my mind i've lived and worked most of my life in black communities in america my father planted a church in the struggling black community of the first ward of paterson new jersey i live in a multi-everything community in sacramento california and the the economic factors undermining many of these communities ability to sustain a marriage is significant on the other hand and i i very much agree with you that humans work best operating communally and as a pastor what i would say is that the question is how can people work communally because the struggles that people have work in community are sometimes financial but again in most cases even if there's one of the members of the family is marginally or underemployed the other member of the family is better employed you've still got two income earners if they can get along you know managing to keep one household together and generally speaking financially people do better that way i've known people there was one young man who was coming to church for a while and his parents were divorced and still living together they hated each other's guts but they couldn't afford to live separately and so on one hand there certainly is the economic aspect but on the other hand what it actually takes to for for two people to get along over 20 30 years goes way beyond some romantic notions of love and i completely agree with you that a big part of this has been the demise of institutions and institutional learning that not only encourages people to work hard on their marriages and their relationships with the people with which they share a home but also provide support to help them get along in many cases if a marriage is in crisis within six years they'll work it out if they can stick with it and work on it and negotiate it out and and there are you know just the way that society is structured now and i think it's a good thing that society you know a woman can get out of a marriage just as easily as a man can today and i think that's a good thing the difficulty that we have are when people come into marriage with sort of a selfish personal aspect that says i'm going to stay in this relationship for as long as it suits me you're never going to be able to build a marriage on that and there's going to have to be another foundation upon which the relationship needs needs to stand for the marriage to be sustainable and have really legs going into the future okay 100 agreed i think i think two points to that the first thing that i would ask is so i okay so i i'm really split on this on one hand and i can be open about my position on this i believe very much in like polyamory i want like polycules to be an ideal relationship i think that people are generally stronger in structures of more than two people obviously as being young i've met plenty of people who have had less than successful you know um triages into that type of lifestyle but i but i i think that under certain circumstances it can produce pretty stable bonds and i i wouldn't be opposed to seeing this explored kind of as a broader model so my bias here is evident and sometimes i do think in that way that you just described rather disparagingly this i'm in here for my own benefit excluding a kid by the way of course i don't have a child i wouldn't just like ditching a child but i'm here for my benefit and i'm not having fun i can dip that's my right i have that right and on one hand there is some validity to that i get one life you know i i don't believe in after life personally even you would agree we have one life here um i've got you know my one chance i don't i don't want more than one here that's you know that to the reincarnation folks i believe in reincarnation you want to come around again listen okay don't don't depress my chat members it's listen look life is suffering it's good character building the um god i i um how do you how do you strike a happy balance between getting people to commit and i mean that in the healthiest way imaginable not like to your dying breath you're bound but how do you get people to invest in one another without getting people to paint over the red flags um because abuse in relationships is like a really common thing in in every segment of society every race every type of relationship homosexual heterosexual every age this happens like a lot and the ability to divorce easily is good in a way because it lets people get out of that situation unless they have kids or unless they don't have the money to but on the other hand a frivolity of thought when we when we approach relationships probably does lead to us feeling kind of empty at the end of the day how do you how do you find a working ground between painting over abuse and horrid relationships people should get out of and encouraging people to stick it out to be together a couple nights ago i i watched the on netflix i watched the this the documentary surviving r kelly and that was a fascinating program in terms that was a hot one yeah oh wow and so you know you've got you've got women who are living in separate rooms in his studio who you know are peeing into a bucket and have to check in with him to leave their room and he's having them in all kinds of different permutations taking videotapes of it a bunch of these women are underage and towards the end of it there's one mother who is trying to get her daughter out of there after nine years and you know there's no there's you know they haven't been able to lock this man up because none of the women seem to want to you know go to court and say yeah this is what he did and so that i think is an illustration of just how tricky psychologically dynamics of abuse can be and anyone who's who's dealt with battered women and some of those dynamics know just how just how difficult this can be when you really have a monster manipulator someone like r kelly at least that that program certainly portrayed him to be so that is certainly that is certainly something i think deep i think the deep problem with our contemporary approach is simply this we look at people as means to an end this person or even this relationship is a way to make me happy and and that's the commodification of other human beings and i believe that human beings are not to be used but are to be loved now you have the question now then we say well how can we get people to well first of all let me tell you as the pastor there's no getting people to do anything you know i i i make a living talking to people and telling what they're all willing to support me saying to them and then turning around and not wanting to do it because it is not natural for us to love in the kind of ways we all want to be loved and what it takes and i think you're very much when you say humans work best operating in community because what it takes is for the community to be gathered and focused and an agreement around certain values and factors such as human beings are to be loved and not used and what that means when you go into a marriage is that you say i am not going into this marriage for my happiness i am going into this marriage for the sake of the other now there's definitely that can get twisted in an abusive relationship and that certainly does happen and there needs to be intervention when that does happen but what it takes is for one person to basically say i'm going to lay down my life for another person you know usually not to that extreme but you when you have a child you lay down your life for that child because there's no more selfish individual in the world than a newborn because that newborn wakes up in the middle of the night and says i want to be fed i want to be changed i want it right now you talk to that newborn all you want it ain't going to make a difference and so what we do and what marriage actually teaches us is to learn to love and what love means is to lay down our life and give our lives for others and how do you how do you create a community where where people live that way and are surrounded by that value well that's what i do as a pastor we as a society have looked at that and said well we don't think we want that it's like okay but then you get that then you get the consequence of people saying i want to find someone who's going to make me happy well that's sort of a nice way of saying i'm going to use this other person for my happiness and i'd say long term whether it's two people or three people or four people it doesn't work there are a lot i can see in my chat scrolling by there are a lot of people who like that take to clarify what do you mean by it's not natural to love someone in the way in the way you want to be loved i think all of us would like to imagine we can be with someone who will love for us and care for us and let's say something would happen to us we'd get in a car accident we get alzheimer's something like this that our spouse would stand by us until the day we die that's what we all want but for that and i've i've seen enough spouses who's you know who their wife or their husband had alzheimer's or a stroke and and they you know they they cleaned up after them they fed them they cared for them and they did it sometimes for years even decades we all want that out of others but what it takes to do to give requires not just i want to be the kind of person that takes care of my spouse it actually does take a community that has the values that reinforce that kind of sacrificial giving and one of the things that you said earlier i think comes into that when we say in our lives i have just one life this is my shot to get happiness and meaning and everything i want out of it if you go into life that way at some point you're going to look at the equation and say i'm sitting here tied to this person that has alzheimer's i could dump them in a hospital and no one would this person wouldn't even know they don't even remember my name and then go out and get my happiness because after all i deserve it that's what society is saying and this is the the results we're seeing in society is what you get from that kind of valuation and now i would argue as a christian minister that actually if in this world you make this world better if you actually can imagine to say you know what i can i can sacrifice my time and my life for this spouse that i've had a complicated relationship with but i'm going to be faithful to him or her until they die because actually i believe i have you know i have eternity to live which will be a lot better than this place right here so i can do that now again i appreciate the fact that most of us hear that and say i don't know about that but that's because we're looking at life through one set of lenses but we sure want our neighbors and our spouses and our children to believe that and so if we want them to believe it well it takes a community that actually keeps raising up those values and puts them forward and i think that's part of the reason that we have all of these ideas that we deserve to be loved well do we have what it takes to actually love pretty convincing i am there's a deep philosophical split on this one i think um not even a split necessarily a split perspective or or maybe um a um an incongruence between two values because i agree with everything that you just said in regards to the the the validity and loving people beyond utilitarianism the to to to be able to appreciate one's company or to um to to care for someone even if in some broad hard numbers sense you recognize that the um the the the your life uh you you know utility is not being maxed out by those actions it's it's important however to stick by those things and everyone's fondest memories of compassion and trust i think are from people who did that if they were sick or unwell and somebody else cared for them even though it would have made all the sense in the world for them to leave for many people this would be parents for some people it would be a close partner for some would even be their children and and and that's what everyone wants and you're right not everyone has a mindset which is um amicable towards that mentality though i suppose if you really went back on it if you really you know parse the numbers or something you could argue that the sublime experience of deep reciprocal un unconditional compassion between two people would maximize utility but that's it's it's a mindset thing um hmm a question then in regards to jbp then to cycle to cycle it back i think to the man himself this is one issue that i have with him that i think extends to his self-help more specifically than it does his politics he said somewhat hypocritically it turned out because he's now you know i'm being taken care of for his addiction problem which i won't make fun of i don't think that's proven at all but um he did say that it is um one should ensure their room is clean before trying to change the world essentially that you should make sure your own house is in order everything's set you're fine you're good before affecting change but you and i agree on something a lot of the reason why people are experienced this horrid alienation from their life their inability to form meaningful bonds is because a lot of the institutional structures that made those livelihoods possible and affordable have begun to crumble and this is one key distinction i have here i think that in many cases one's room is unclean because of the society in which we live and in order to clean that room that society must be changed i would see for example the economic superstructures that are failing so many people right now changed not necessarily by people who have the rack together but from the people who don't because of those systems do you do you agree or disagree with that i i agree the difficulty that we have with systems are that they are made of people and so what you know what's sort of you know it's always it's always hard to know well just think about you know whatever group of people you're living with now if you're living with other people maybe it's in the the context of an apartment building or maybe it's in a neighborhood or maybe it's within one house one household you could say well you know what does it take for us to be a household that keeps our own house clean and and does this is and so if you've ever lived with roommates in college you know you have some roommates that are slobs and some roommates who are neat necks and so you could say well well which is it is it us as a group or is it us as an individual and it's always both and my you know one of the one of the when he said you know keep you know you know keep your house in perfect order before you go out to fix the world basically perfect was such a poor choice of words there because the truth is none of us are perfect but the the question of society first or the individual first that's always a very difficult one what i like to what i like to say is that without individuals nothing changes and without institutions nothing lasts and so part of what we're seeing is that there's certainly you know the market in some ways likes to incentivize um likes to incentivize the commodification of people and and that's a real problem and i agree completely and so employers who you know i and you know politically i mean so i i mean you might have you know you probably don't know anything about my politics but it doesn't matter i i i have a problem with with with industries that don't give health care to their employees if we're going to have employers if we're going to run health care through employers and i would be in favor of you know a lot more than that and so i there's no question in my mind that we can use some structural change but the question of individual versus societal that's a weakness i think with jordan peterson that i i think was manifest in his program that i saw as a pastor because again i saw he's out there talking about the individual great you know it's very true that i can't change anyone i'm living with i can only change myself i should be the change to use that little thing and act the way i will want others to others to act i have to do that first but you're exactly right and that's what i'm saying in terms of marriage there needs to be an institution and a community around us that reinforces those values and community certainly works better when we have some assurance that the others with which we are sharing this community have the same value it's being reinforced and we can all work on it together yeah um if you uh i'm trying to i'm trying to think like what would so politics aside and and of course well there is no such thing all this is deeply political but i should say um the um political differences between myself and jbp aside i'm trying to think now what would be what would be the the optimal jbp if you could if you could construct them somehow somebody a person sent i don't know if you're from god i don't know so somebody constructed to help people out of the alienation which seems to accompany modern society when i think of that person i think of i'm of course biased by my politics i think of somebody who's who's very far left who wants to build a really strong economic base to allow everyone to live a dignified life um because we have the money for it at least here in america we could with with proper incentive structures have everyone live at least a lower middle class living with um with um with no like substantive economic issues to to ensure everyone can enjoy a baseline standard of living which is certainly above what welfare provides us today which is which is pitiful in this day and age in this country um and which encourages people to to form strong communal relations with others to be trusting and open to be disciplined absolutely that's important but um but also to be open to the possibility that sometimes the the issues that are affecting their life are are not a an evidence of of personal failing but rather evidence that the the the house in which they live the society in which they live needs correcting to ensure a revolutionary mindset in people a a willingness always to challenge social institutions so that there will always be a um um sort of the civil spirit necessary to maintain the common dignity of the average citizen what would what would be what is an ideal jbp look to you like how do they deliver that oh i think i think we we have the jbp that there is and i think he's done a lot of good and i'm satisfied with that i i'm reluctant to boil i'm reluctant to boil these issues down to economics i spent seven years of my life living in the dominican republic working mostly with haitians and i cannot recall a single instance of a suicide attempt amongst those haitians and these people for the most part were illegal immigrants in a far poorer country than the united states living in glass in brass huts and shacks made of garbage and basically working for tyrannical either government organizations or coffee growers and scratching out a living you know working gardens i watched the david chapelle thing on netflix last night and he makes the point at the beginning of it anthony bourdain has about the best job that any of us could imagine flying around the world eating the world's best food talking to the world's most interesting people that's his job and he kills himself and the haitians living in those huts in the dominican republic i never once heard of a suicide and so the confidence that i have that a predominantly economic program would yield the kind of well-being we imagine i don't think actually pertains because as a pastor you get to see the lives of people and i've seen a lot of very unhappy people with a lot of money and a lot of people who enjoy life you know i grew up mostly around african-american folks and you know some of the best times i've had have been with just hanging out with junkies and poor folks and and you know yeah life is hard but they've got meaning and happiness and i think again one of the one of the main things that peterson communicated was that the quest for happiness is not as simple as we imagine it to be and what's actually true is that meaning is a far more sustainable is a far more sustainable entity and that which in fact is most in distress every now and then i'll do a sermon that touches on suicide one of the things i know is that one of the places in the united states with the highest suicide rate was a high school in silicon valley the the children of the titans of industry that have more going for them in terms of economic security than any of us on this channel would ever hope for and so i think if we're looking for well-being predominantly from an economic rearrangement i think will be dissatisfied uh yeah i i mean that's that's one of the grand paradoxes right right now the suicide rate in america is at its highest for um middle-aged white men who are demographically much better off than many of the other constituencies suicide rates are as you noted for the at least for the american black community um substantially lower than they are on average for the white community it's the same for hispanics i'm inclined to believe this is because of their family structure also there's a which is traditional oh no denying that but i wonder if the um if the conditions of traditional family structures and how they positively affect one's well-being could be supplemented in a less traditional way that nonetheless keeps the spirit of the original organization i remember this is this is something that's always stuck with me it's something that i read a very long time ago um i bothered till i did i did bother to look it up it is true as even if the citations have left me now but i remember there was a greek philosopher who existed some 2000 whatever ancient greek philosopher and he was interested in the study of happiness which i guess we would now term as like meaningfulness or well-being or contentedness because it wasn't just like haha happy um and what he discovered and he was laughed at he was ridiculed by his contemporaries because all the other philosophers were learning about form and meaning and the the essence of consciousness and he was off trying to find how to have a good time and what he discovered you know from from his uh teachings at least was that the best way for a human being to be happy would be for them to live along with eight to twelve friends in a villa which was suitably sized such they all had private bedrooms but shared communal spaces such as living rooms dining rooms kitchens and such and he believed after all of his life that this was the optimal way for human beings to live and he died as one does and other people i think um eventually took towards following his writings after his passing epicurus epicurus chat says that's him yep okay thank epicurus i sound much smarter now and and other people took that teaching and i am i am deeply moved by that idea because i kind of wanted the same thing my life too i grew up with very good parents you know and i'm very happy for for everything they gave me but it was nonetheless a boxy home or i knew not the names of my neighbors the idea of living in a shared space is almost like a dorm i think that's why so many people have fond memories of their dorm experiences and probably corresponding negative ones as well um the idea of living like that it's it's very enticing to me and if you want to branch it out into sort of more of a a relationship dynamic there's the there's the potential for sort of segmented like your space with you and your partner then the broader space with other families and maybe you have kids but you know the others well enough that they could babysit for you like on the way out you shared like two of you share a kitchen or two groups this is it's very compelling and what would be needed to see changes like that or changes like how we structure homes so people live together or changes in the workplace to ensure that workers aren't like just getting through the day with no ability to talk to one another due to really oppressive corporate rules all of these are economic changes the how we design our homes how we build our workplaces how our schools are designed how do we teach resource officers to deal with those who are suffering from depression how much emphasis do we place on people's well- being following a depressive episode all of these are economic or social changes and that's what i really want to see not just making everyone wealthier but building these structures that are that are facilitated around human happiness rather than than capital acquisition and i feel like at least from what you said that at least in regards to the sentiment you may agree with a lot of that well the question i would have is 2300 years ago epicurus tried this why didn't it why didn't it win the day and then my question for you would be when you go on vacation do you stay in a hostel or a hotel well i will admit that i stay in a hotel i have heard people say that they have positive experiences from hostels and there might be other reasons why that's the case hostels tend to be very um disgusting for example um but if for example there was a way to make them disgusting oh well of people of course but if they're people you care about and know and live with epicurus's ideas didn't take on because there's not much money to be had in making people happy there's money to be had in making people scared but we got close i think with villages and feudal um in feudal times well i mean obviously people there were barren wretched and miserable and had shit on their face all the time at the very least they had meaning within a community who they cared about things were dirty there and that's an eye on that and it was the people mostly it was the horses i imagine who made it dirty but they lived their lives and there was a meaningfulness to that and i think we can extrapolate that um that communal spirit into how society functions today without returning to this post like this this modernist liberal traditional idea of like i mean liberal in like the enlightenment sense idea of like the nuclear family where people get locked off into these boxes i just it feels like a grim return to an attempt at replicating the joy of an earlier and perhaps less profitable but nonetheless superior system do you know the american corporation that has the um that has the division statement make people happy um i mean i've heard it before okay um is it is it facebook no no it's disney is okay uh that's so i should have gotten that that one's a that's a clear and do they make much money i mean hey listen i mean if you're if your point is that capitalism does a poor job of meeting human need then i'm i'm with you i'm with you all the way my point is that happiness is people i don't think people finally want happiness they will trade their life for meaning and ironically i think you know when if we come all the way back to the question of jordan b peterson that is what's actually at the heart of you know the first book that he wrote is is more important book which is not very readable is maps of meaning because people will people will go to war and be killed on the battlefield people will put their bodies and lives at risk in childbirth people will sacrifice everything that they have for meaning but they will even in fact sacrifice their happiness for meaning and i think if we can get an understanding of that we might actually be able to figure out what kinds of institutions and social arrangements would actually give us more well-being than just i think epicurus in the end uh didn't succeed in changing the world because he was wrong and i would i would argue that someone named jesus christ actually changed the world far more than epicurus and i would argue that he did so because he was right i don't think you can meaningfully extrapolate the validity of a position for how popular it is there have been plenty of intelligent and wise men who have died penniless in the sewers and plenty of idiots who have been elected to high office i mean you know jesus didn't make any money jesus christ's uh uh elevated reputation nonewithstanding there is plenty of empirical evidence to suggest that communal living is a is a good way about to live one's life and i think that you you see facsimiles of this in in poorer communities as well now i admit and i admit i'm speaking here not from experience but only from reading because i am rather privileged in my upbringing but in everything that i have read and scantily encountered in some of the poorest communities in this country um the whatever whatever glimpses of meaning and validity they picked from their lives were in a shared bond with their neighbors with their community and a willingness to do whatever it took to maintain the well-being of that community but to an irrational degree people get the more isolated they live and that's exactly what we're seeing in north america agree yeah the family size is shrinking the more money we get and so that's why i argue if you put the emphasis on economic well-being you're not actually going to address these questions of community what if you put the emphasis on on economic socialization redesigning social structures in a way that facilitate human contact everything our workplaces our schools um uh the way in which we like get services from others now we just like click a button on amazon it arrives at our door our families all of it is getting more expedient and more distant if we could find ways to to to to streamline these systems in a way that facilitated human contact i think that you would see people form a much more genuine bond with their community and i think really good things can come from that i think i think the most expedient way to do that would be to have them have less money and they would be more people living together and you would is that a pesadist i hear do you support do you believe that true happiness can only come from the flames of apocalyptic nuclear hellfire only after we nuke the country can we rebuild and become truly one no have you not heard of pesadism no all right okay listen hey listen i don't get to those dark corners of the internet very often i'm just listen i'm just saying i mean if if if you want to go hard in the poverty happiness correlative scale then a nuclear winter sounds like a really really quick way no i don't i don't disagree though be like flip it to your side um um i do i guess i guess on the whole i do think that right now the commodification of human life has made it difficult for us to really appreciate one another and form bonds it's really difficult you're we're obviously of different um generations so things maybe are different for me or for you than they were for okay don't give me that face i'm 25 oh yeah okay we are you're my children's age yeah yeah don't give me that face i'm sorry i know my face not on camera i don't know if you forgot i'm just remember a beard like oh god it's 30 40 um whatever the case may be things are it's really hard to make friends now like it's really genuinely difficult to make friends um and there have been studies born out of this a lot of it is part is because we don't leave our houses as much anymore and listen internet okay i'm not i may make my money here i i'm not defending the internet in that respect though i'm not going i'm not going to bat for that but in terms of um also of like our irl like our in-person friends um so often the economic like um uh um meandering of life the fact that you have to move to get jobs or how much we have to work or how fastidiously we have to dedicate our time to a profession it kind of prevents us from making friends outside our work even within that work field usually most workplaces are nightmares they're horridly alienated you can't form friendships there and in fact you're not supposed to they don't want you to yeah it's and it's disgusting and it makes them more money but it's disgusting and this is like our only chance it's eight hours a day five days a week for some people some people work more or less i don't know and that's their like main shot at socialization and they're expressly systemically prevented from doing so and and i and i and it's really sad and there are so many people i know that that are losing their friends um or who don't have any friends and who find other ways of accommodating the desires that come about from friendship like like feeling validated um by others and that's like the i consider that the the alienation from friendship i would consider this like a um like like an apocalyptically bad social problem like a lot of people make fun of incels you know the term is involuntary yeah a lot of people make jokes about this i try not to make jokes about this this is like this is like actually a real problem we're gonna have to deal with and whether that the solution comes from a return to more traditional family structures or like some broad systemic reevaluation of how our our our social structures affect our ability to make friends i will agree with you on this it is glad to have people talking about that and jordan b peterson has definitely brought about that conversation in the way that many others haven't well and so i would say well what if you had a what if you had a a place where people could come together weekly and you could reinforce the values and principles and do some singing and have some food together and oh no make friends and find potential spouses gosh what it'd be amazing if someone thought of a place like that but yet churches are dying including my own so no i'm sorry we're in a mess and it's a mess of our own making yeah i know this is great we uh wait can i wait can i ask what um can i ask what um what church or sector branch or whatever the proper terminology it is you follow if it's not polite i'm i'm a pastor in the christian reform church in north america which comes out of the dutch calvinist tradition from dutch immigrants so would that be that would be catholic then right if it comes from calvinist oh sorry sorry calvinist okay i mean i'm i admit i'm very ignorant about christianity the only thing i know is that the catholics build the prettiest churches i don't know where they do yeah okay that's my orthodox built some great churches too yeah and listen the only thing that's okay i will say this okay in in rods work so credit where credit is due okay in almost every town i've ever been in the churches synagogues mosques whatever it doesn't matter religious institutions far and away the most beautiful buildings that i that um that i will ever see everything else is dull gray concrete office buildings and that is genuinely that one of the last excuses we had to bust out our architectural shops is is is falling to the wayside so from an artistic perspective at least at the very least deeply saddening to me i agree i agree that may be a point uh we've gone over our normal hour of yeah sorry that's i did not expect to have a good faith conversation it's been so long it's actually extraordinary oh this was enjoyable i enjoyed this i couldn't speak to you as well
