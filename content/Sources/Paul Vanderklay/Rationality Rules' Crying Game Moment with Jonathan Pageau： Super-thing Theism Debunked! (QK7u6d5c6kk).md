 Hi, this is Paul. Last week on the YouTubes we were treated to a conversation or debate, each of them sort of pitched it their own way, about metaphorical truth or really just a good conversation between Jonathan Peugeot and and Stephen Wolford. Stephen Wolford is the creator of the channel Rationality Rules. Now I'm a pastor and pastors both receive confessions and if we receive confessions we should take them. I was quite dismissive at a point in my little YouTube career about Stephen Wolford and a bunch of his videos. I was really surprised this happened at all and I was my take on him was mostly that he was sort of a fast and cheap debunker and that he wouldn't know anything about Jonathan Peugeot. But Stephen Wolford has more than most let's call them celebrity atheists, Jordan Peterson's term, more than most has really kept up with Jordan Peterson. I mean I noticed not long ago he continued to make these videos about Jordan Peterson even when Jordan wasn't making videos and I thought that was a that was a rather strange thing. Well apparently he's been listening to the videos that he's been debunking and those have sunk in and I really appreciated his posture, the way in which he approached this conversation and I'm happy to make this confession and I'm more happy to be wrong. So good for you Stephen. I hope this conversation continues and it's really caused me to reassess his his project in a whole new way. Having said that I think many of the people including myself felt a degree of disappointment at the end of this video because like so many attempted conversations of this kind there was a lot of talking past each other that happened. Now part of the reason I have part of the reason my channel looks the way it does is because as a pastor I know it takes a while for people to find each other. What I mean by that? If you'll notice I don't do a lot of celebrity interviews. Part of the reason I don't is because especially the first time I talked to them I want to take a couple of hours and I want to get into their story because it's way too easy to simply project onto other people our own biases and preconceptions and and that makes it very very difficult to really understand the people's arguments. Now gosh this gets into a whole bunch of things even before I get into the video. What we tend to see on YouTube are chattering heads where people are making arguments and again back to all the cognitive science we've been talking about that for the last three years we have to filter these things and so when we see Stephen Wilford or Jonathan Peugeot Woodford I have to say his name properly Woodford or Jonathan Peugeot we if you find my first videos where I used to butcher poor Jonathan's name we simply project a whole bunch of things onto them which may or may not be accurate which may or may not be fair and and what tends to happen if we sit down and take a half hour an hour to just get into someone's story we build up empathy we subtly recalibrate how we approach them even if they are in a sense our rivals or adversaries in a tribal dispute or even even just a friendly tribal reassessment we we don't we don't treat them or their ideas fairly and so that's why when I do conversations and if Stephen ever wants to be on my channel I'd happily have him I'd like to spend an hour just talking about his life where he grew up the kind of home he grew up in his his experience with religion I mean all the conversations that I've done on my channel before and if you look at my first conversation with Jonathan Peugeot was the same thing because and I'm happy to be subject to that interview by any anybody as well if they're curious about where I came from I'm a pastor and so part of what I've known with people is you're not going to be able to really build the kind of warm emotional friendship might be too strong a word but just a generous regard with a person until you sort of know where they're coming from and that's especially important if the person is sort of on the other side of an ideological or religious divide or even just a philosophical or theological divide and and this is why when there are conflicts and issues we're far better off talking to each other face to face and understanding each other's story so that we see each other as to a degree that we can far more 360 degree human beings okay and so I you know I've been in you know especially in this conversation with Jonathan Peugeot who over the last three years I've got a chance to know at least a bit Jonathan I and I have never met face to face but you know I certainly have a great deal of affection for him so I was I was really impressed by this now part of those of you who follow my channel my exhaustive hours of video which obviously many people have no hope of ever catching up on and probably shouldn't spend their time doing it the atheist Christian debates are really an exhausted trope and and part of the reason they're an exhausted trope is a lot of the stuff that I've gotten into over the last few years and God number one and God number two the video I did a while ago belief in God is not the key difference between Christians and atheists and actually this conversation between Jonathan Peugeot and Steve Stephen I don't know if he's like Stephen or Steve Fenn Woodford is is I thought an amazing example of my point that belief in God is not really the difference a lot of it has more to do with actually the conception of God as I've mentioned on my other videos the the most common conceptualization of the Christian God by many is that God is another thing and this comes up actually this is this becomes really the defining moment of this conversation I think that that God is a super thing that somehow lives out in the universe someplace or in another dimension and Christians access this super thing by prayer and other rituals and the super thing can intervene in history but it's it's again with with a lot of my videos it's it's really addressed by the ancient Hebrews and brought into the modern world by Ezekiel Kaufman in terms of his understanding of the way the God of the Hebrews differed from the other pagan gods with respect to a meta divine realm the meta divine realm is the thing that in which the gods of the ancient world live and this is of course why the God of Christianity differs from Zeus or Thor or any of these other gods and this is a this is a subtle but pervasive point and if you find some of the better conversations between much more rigorous philosophical theologians they'll often make this point but it's a it's a difficult point and one again that goes over the head of many Christians and so it's it's hard to blame atheists for conceiving of God in this way it's really a product of centuries of development critical of which is obviously the rise of deism Christianity's historic conceptualization of God many Christians assume a mostly materialist framework and append a God to it and it tends to be this God that the celebrity atheists usually don't have too much difficulty debunking and and many will will acknowledge that you can't really prove a negative that this God doesn't exist but you can certainly seem to address the ways in which the expectations of people who are trying to engage this super thing by obedience or prayers or things of this nature that well you know it's does your does your super thing really work out well for you all you have to find is someone who it didn't work out well for in terms of their expectations and boom you you've made enough of your point that you can say what good is your God if your God doesn't show up now obviously this was an issue in the pagan world as well but again the real issue is not really the is God or isn't God out there it's much more what we how we conceptualize this idea of God and again part of what I think Jordan Peterson did from a psychological perspective simply showed that God is in a sense a a potent imaginative variable in our using again Charles Taylor's language in our in our mental imaginaries that it's it's this conceptual at this the idea of God is simply too useful to do without if you want to construct a productive and peaceful and well civilization the kinds of which many of us who are listening to this video in the West have grown to appreciate and desire so again what went wrong in this conversation basically what where many such conversations tend to flounder many such conversations are doomed from the start how we see the world is dependent upon our perspective and this of course is the is the dominant thesis of post-modernity not necessarily a new thesis that well the world you see is dependent upon the place that you're standing to see the world and the world looks different from different perspectives so Peugeot is remarkably not a non-dual atheist in his perspective now I know that's gonna really excite some of you that I use that term but he is that's and and the longer I listen to him the better I think I understand him the more clearly that is that that that the more the more clear that comes to me Stephen aspires to a non-dual materialism in other words they're both they both have in a sense competing non-dualities and there's not a lot of room for these competing non-dualities and so finding enough common ground between them is going to be no easy thing the kind of sort of late-stage adaptive Protestantism that most atheist debunkers address has an element of dualism in it there's sort of the world and God now again subtly the God is sort of imagined to be within let's let's call it being and so God is another being within being and so then again the question is either is that God out is that super thing that super being out there or not and even if you can assert that the super being is out there if the super being is unreachable or can't are unrelatable then what point is the super being in your life and what point does the super being what point is there having this super being engaged in our world in a public way and again this is very much the framework of modernity which very much comes on the heels of the rise of deism in in post-enlightenment Europe and in many ways into the fabric of the grand American political experiment and many of the achievements of that political experiment were copied in one way or another throughout the West and so this is this is deep deep in our imaginary and in our social structures now Peugeot has a very different perspective on this Jonathan understands the the particular conceptualization of non-dual on non-dual materialism and I think when I look back on what first attracted me to Jordan Peterson was in a sense to get rid of another dualism that I saw in the church which was sort of a sort of an insular isolated biblicism within the church where on Sunday we would go and we would read we would read Genesis 1 and we would imagine well here we are reading Genesis 1 that there's the world is sort of flat on a tabletop and there's pillars below and there's a firmament above and then we go out into the rest of the world and we see you know the earth rise over the moon and we conceptualize the Sun the planets as balls going around and so in many ways what caught my attention from Jordan Peterson is okay how can we address this and this is why I had been reading CS Lewis's book miracles over and over again to try to address non-dual materialism that was always sort of making inroads into my thinking how can we put these two worlds together so there are a lot of different kinds of dualisms and when I say non-dual theism it's basically you see that gets really tricky because there's a lot of there are a lot of non-dualities out there more than two and so here really you have the the conflict between the non-dual theism of Peugeot and the non-dual materialism of of Stephen or Stefan now Peugeot is difficult for many of us to understand and I remember when I first started listening to Jordan Peterson very quickly in comment threads Jonathan Peugeot's name would come out and I heard he was an Ike Orthodox icon carver now I had been noticing in my own church serve circles increasing affection and attraction to sacramental theological traditions within Christianity I had noticed a lot of younger clergy coming up and looking in some ways a little covetous at Anglican Orthodox and Roman Catholic ideas and especially rituals the ancient modern of course was had its rise in the wake of the seeker movement in terms of church practice and ecclesiology and so I started listening to Jonathan Peugeot and when I first started listening to him I had a very difficult time understanding what on earth he was talking about now the insights he was offering with respect to a symbolic interpretation were quite impressive and to the degree that they sort of lined up with some of the conservative culture war stuff that Peterson that was sort of fueling Peterson's rise it's easy to see why you could get attracted to Peugeot but the more you listen to him that the stranger and stranger it became and his theological guiding lights were you know Ephraim the Syrian and Maximus the confessor people I had never heard about these these seemed like sort of B team church fathers and of course I had had a little bit of introduction to church fathers in my Protestant Dutch Calvinist seminary but but really not nearly enough and so it takes a while especially for a Protestant to sort of understand where Peugeot is coming from now most atheists are sort of post-Protestant in many ways what that means is they've sort of moved through moved through sort of the psychologizing of the Protestant Reformation into the split world deism where well there's a creator God out there and he sort of establishes morality to a degree and and ushers in the creation but then the world pretty much runs on its own and the whole conceptualization of nature that CS Lewis nicely talks about in miracles of that which runs on its own in other words it runs on its own there's no mind or consciousness guiding it there's no purpose that's guiding it and and really the next stage after deism was well if if God is so far out and unreachable and we can't actually relate to him and he's not paying any conscious attention to us then what good is he and of course the origin of the species middle of the 19th century at that point many just sort of cut the ties with God completely whereas Voltaire and and many before the 19th century sort of maybe kept God in the wings you'll find that in the deist founders of of the American you know the American democracy at some point God becomes useless and well he's just sort of ignored and jettisoned and really only a few people would come after God in the way that post 9-11 the new celebrity atheists did and they came after God really for political reasons and and Stephen is very much in that tribe as this video recognizes so these two are really coming at each other from very different worlds now it's pretty clear to see the tenets of non-dual materialism this is in many ways the majority public posture of the West and has been for a long time especially with respect to public spaces science technology and education this has been the secular worldview the secular frame in many ways and I think as as Tom Holland pretty convincingly demonstrates is in fact sort of a second I like to call it a second secret sister of the church secularity in this way is actually historically dependent upon Christianity and we can see that in places like India and the Islamic world where they are very quickly de-secularizing themselves we see this in certain certain new age corners as well now this gets into the whole atheism plus business which we won't go too far into but the tenets of non-dual materialism basically go like this and there are there are a variety different evolutions of this as my conversations with JP Marceau and John Vervecki have been pointing out because JP Marceau has really been keeping up on this stuff and he just wrote a another piece about miracles which is something I want to engage in a video but but not for right now so the universe we experience is a product of physical emergence from below and Jonathan Peugeot tried to bring in some of the emanation emergence conversation which has sort of been the way our conversations with John Vervecki have gone especially now with JP Marceau in the mix and the universe we experience is a product of physical emergence from below one can account for everything we know and think by virtue of purposeless processes that have yielded this physical world, physis, goes on its own to grow as Lewis points out in his book miracles this physical world and the and the psychological processes we experience that are dependent upon it now Lewis characterizes this in his book miracles as the whole show and there's an element to that but now obviously if you look at let's say John Vervecki's physicalism there's things that are self-organizing self-developing that that try to get away from some of the determinism that you'll find in the likes of Sam Harris but but the process is this it's a non-duality it comes from below obviously the Achilles heel of this is something that Jordan Peterson and many others have noted which is this really only works once the laws again we're we're we're barking we're we're knocking on D isms door the laws of physics are established once these laws are physics are established and things sort of go on their own the Big Bang gets things started but you can't really get beyond the Big Bang so it's you know give me one miracle and I'll explain the rest one comment and Jonathan Peugeot's posting of this in the beginning evolutionary psychology created the heavens and the earth the difficulty of course is that if you take away the laws of physics you take away this physics this growing this nature this things going on their own and and basically the argument would be well we can't get beyond that but for everything else we can sort of imagine that it just sort of happened on its own but the key thing again is this is Darwin's contribution and you can read that in the metaphysical club is that there's no purpose to this there's no there's no consciousness with a tell-all defining the trajectory reaching an outcome and all of these things well we're highly evolved primates and just the way physics and chaos and as things rolled out this is the way it would be basically following the laws of physics now there's a meaning crisis hidden in here since purpose is not in the world from the start purpose is something we project onto the world and this is sort of the emergence that comes up we develop consciousness in order to adapt and be superior over beings that are less conscious and don't have all the faculties for it and all of these things develop values are therefore telek they have a telos they have an end they have a goal they have a purpose that we evaluate something based on whether or not it's it's moving us closer or getting further what we want and there's actually a really nice part in the conversation here where where Stephen gets into this and that's one of the reasons why it'll be hard for you to understand too like when how much I position because I know where I stand like I know where I am I am in this story I am in the Christian story I am in the Christian I participate in the pattern in an active real way and so when you tell me that we need to apply different patterns or choose different pattern because the reality underneath has changed my question is where are you like okay now this will be something that again I think will frustrate listeners because they keep trying to make the same point back and forth throughout this video and the point that Jonathan is making is where is your telek yardstick in terms of how you can evaluate you've got the fact value distinction here how you can evaluate good bad right and wrong you talk about metaphorical truth being well we actually find this this story like the porcupine doesn't can't because can throw its quills or that there's bad air and so because they thought that that the plague was was was was spread by bad air people would go out to the country and they would achieve and add an adaptive advantage even with a misunderstanding of the actual mechanisms that were at work okay and so now they're debating about this and Jonathan is going to keep coming back throughout this video to the question of of telos what's your standard what's your telos and this is a very interesting interchange because what what Stephen can't give is an overall arching telos which is obviously what religions provide but there are instrumental smaller teli that function within the world smaller goals fall smaller purposes and this is what he's gonna lay out basically where do you stand from which position do you stand that you are able to judge this and then what then is your purpose like what is your goal what are you reaching towards what are you trying to to make happen because you say good and you say bad you say better but I'm not sure I know what that is like I don't know what it means to say that we need to let's say patriarchy is not acceptable anymore we need to replace it with something else but I'm not sure like what is this good that you see either in the future or in this new pattern like is it more equality is it is it equality is it like I don't know what it is the good that you're referencing okay so an answer with a question I don't think that words such as good and bad right and wrong have any intrinsic meaning the meaning comes from essentially a Kantian hypothetical imperative of the teleological aspects in consideration it's the okay okay through a bunch of words out there but basically what he's saying is good bad right or wrong are a function of a telos a meaning a purpose a goal if you have a goal out there might be a moral goal might be a more instrumental goal good bad right and wrong are all in that way dependent upon the goal and so because there's no purpose built into the universe those terms don't really help you so much apart from their instrumental aspect of moving you towards that goal the goals that make it whether or not it's good or bad so it depends on your goals as to whether or not something is good or bad so if you see something through the vision of Christianity you're gonna say it's good if it lives up to the expectation of Christianity if it okay so you have these things like religions that provide goals and so something is good if it pushes you towards that goal now Jonathan is looking for looking from Stephen for an overall overarching goal which he's not really going to provide here partly because he says well look we'll get into that lives up to God if you if you're seeing it through say communism you're gonna say it's good if it is something that emancipates the proletariat and and removes power from the bourgeoisie you know that's that's how good or bad works I'm in the same boat as you I completely recognize this in the sense that I'm trying to my intrinsic axiomatic definitions of good or bad are a product of my psychological evolution the same as you but okay now they're a product of a non-telec blind process because again in a non dual materialism it's critically important the whole point that Darwin makes is that evolution is not telec evolution does not pursue a goal the only goal the creature has is survival and propagation and getting into the future it's very much a time-oriented goal but you can't really say that a highly evolved primate like a human being is better than a chimpanzee now you might say better at second-order thinking imaginative problem-solving really that one of the key things seems to be both communal language to share with each other self-restraint chimpanzees make terrible pets because they have zero self-restraint and what people seem to do is be able to collectivize in a much more powerful way all the second-order thinking all these kinds of things that we do there's a very interesting book out there name the difference between us it basically is making that you know it's not that we're so much smarter as such than chimps you know it's it's it might be a comparison that you know we've both got you know core i5s in terms of our brain power but humanity has Wi-Fi and and networking capacities that the sort of that the chimp their their networking capacities are far more limited than our networking capacities and then so culture and imagination this culture track is really what gives us the the power that we have to collectivize and to work together and to and to really conquer and dominate the world but again by virtue of this non-dual materialism there's no purpose built into the system there's no reason the world is here in the way that we understand reason or at least in Aristotelian terms a final cause now the goal sort of gets smuggled in from Darwin and and that goal is survival or getting yourself into the future this gets into some of Brett Weinstein's illustrations about a genocidal spelling bee that that the goal of of not only myself as a as a creature with a high degree of consciousness as opposed to creatures with far lower degrees of consciousness but even certain enzymes and certain even a virus which we would assert has unless you're a pan psychist has no consciousness the goal of the virus is to propagate itself among human beings or and to and to infect one after another and this sort of to grow physics to go on its own now we we find it instrumental and helpful in terms of our networking capacity to to afford something like a virus agency but the world view doesn't really afford the virus agency as such that's sort of the the language that we are left with to try to talk about agency and so we can't divorce it but again the I would say the theological assertion is that there is no purpose beyond it the virus isn't acting on purpose the way let's say a human being acts on purpose with the full complement of consciousness but the whole show as C.S. Lewis calls it there is no purpose behind the whole show there is no purpose for life having developed on planet earth there is no purpose with human beings subjugating and eventually eliminating their evolved primate rivals such as neanderthals there there is no purpose beyond any of this this is just all sort of running and this of course invokes the the dreaded meaning crisis that you know the terrific phrase that John Vervecky has has really helped to popularize and I think something which really helps frame the rise and and power that that Jordan Peterson sort of stepped into that suddenly there were thousands and thousands maybe even millions of of people out there who were suffering a meaning crisis and and Jordan Peterson comes along and is able to infuse agency in them and and suddenly their lives are better they're cleaning their room their relationships are being restored I mean that's that's really beyond the culture war stuff which has its own meaning dynamic the whole thing behind Jordan Peterson was this infusing of certain elements of the western population with a lot of meaning it's sort of energized and things took off so there's this meaning crisis beyond here now this particular non-dual let's call it non-dual materialism struggles with we and should we simply can't operate in the manifest image without these things and as C.S. Lewis nicely points out in his book the abolition of man we have instincts we have desires but the problem with instincts and desires are that there are so many of them and it's I'm gonna move my move my face here and the problems with instincts and desires is that there are so many of them and figuring out which should be at the top of the hierarchy at any given moment is an issue and again which should be I can't even say that sentence without using that word instrumental towards what well instrumental towards obeying or satisfying this instinct or satisfaction or instrumental towards let's say spreading my seed my genetic seed into the future or that's at the culture layer or at the biological genetic layer or maybe at the culture layer spreading my ideas so that my ideas will go and now this gets very interesting because ideas are immaterial but they're sort of acting just like genetics and so at some point you're gonna have to ask yourself does this start with ideas and then colonize genetics or does this emerge from genetics and sort of colonize the ideal world because of course in a in a non-dual materialism the ideal world is is simply dependent upon their being physical material creatures to host these ideas that's essential to the non-duality of non-dual materialism and some of you who have watched a lot of Jordan Peterson know that in in one of his public appearances might have been in in one of the biblical series might not have been I don't remember offhand but someone basically asks him you know if God would exist if there were no longer human beings essentially to host the idea of God and Jordan sort of equivocates on that and a lot of that has to do with um with modernity with Kant and with Jung so there's a lot going on there modernity in terms of well those are sort of private ideas that you're allowed to hold privately but are unseemly to bring out in public and I just read a very interesting piece by a professor at Wheaton who I think wrote up really quite a a helpful piece for me there have been a couple of good pieces out there that have been sent to me since Jordan has sort of re-arisen in terms of helping to understand Jordan and Jung in their relationship and that comes through quite clearly in this in this video as well but again we have difficulty with the should and with the we all throughout Stefan's argument he's saying we must choose the better but he has in this moment sort of undermined a grand better there is no better apart from pursuing a goal now okay I can understand why you have a goal there are biological instincts and desires and urges that you are trying to satisfy those become goals but on what basis do we have a goal together now it might be that well there's a there's a collaboration if we collaborate we can both if if I want um let's say if I want sex and you want money well prostitution seems to be in order so here we go we can both pursue these goals together and so human beings are we cooperate again and again another great Brett Weinstein we cooperate in order to compete or sometimes we compete in order to cooperate and so we're we're all this competition cooperation matrix is going but the should and the we really have trouble living together not that they don't and not that we don't see them and can't understand them and see and tell stories of how they do but ultimately they don't because ultimately there is no tell us there is no purpose and well this tends to have its consequences in people's minds Peugeot keeps asking for this but but Stefan really doesn't offer it and he doesn't offer it because at least at this point he admits he really can't because underneath there really is one in our culture and but but to sort of say it out loud and to finally be able to justify it and to build it upon non-dual materialism well the then I'll get into what this is for our culture it begins to look a little arbitrary so his anthropology I think is then comes to the fore well we're we're these evolved primates well okay well well where does all this go and how does all this end what human beings are really are sort of these choosing navigators now again if you listen to Brett Weinstein he sort of has a atheist compatibilism going on and you know we're we disagree whether or not this these choices are real or if they themselves are products as C.S. Lewis says of the of the whole show that that all of our desires and instincts have simply been built into us by evolutionary psychology and the genetics and the hormones and there's no purpose to them we're just simply running the programs of the of the successful programming of our past ancestors and this in many ways will set up the big complaint that rationale that that Stephen Woodford basically gets from Brett Weinstein that well all of these all of this old code because we keep tinkering as we develop this cold we keep changing our environment and we're living in a very different environment than we again we're finding some unity with with past homo sapiens and pre-homo sapiens then we had and again this is a highly imaginative we it itself is very much a mental construct then we had back when we were living on the savanna or in the 18th century or in the third century or yada yada yada but but human beings are fundamentally choosers we are navigators and we make choices based on implicit or explicit instincts or desires and we're not purely based on instincts or desires to achieve the good which we pursue so when we're driving down the road we have all of these brightly colored signs lit up that are promoting sugar and fat for our consumption because when we even though none of us have individuals have ever been biological programming is carrying us forward. When we were out foraging for food, we didn't have a lot of access to fat or sweets. And so now I pull into McDonald's and I get a a double quarter pounder with cheese and a chocolate milkshake. And it's just full of fat and sugar because I have been programmed by my past to pursue these things. Now being an individual in my mid-50s who has eaten this diet has a very sedentary lifestyle even as compared to people who lived just a few hundred years ago. All of this fat and this sugar is not good for me because it will, well I'll live a shorter life because of this. And so you have to go on drugs and have to do all these other things that we don't want to do in order to counteract the old programming. And basically the assertion is that religion is fundamentally the same thing as this. We adapted and created religion. So again, Brett Weinstein, we're two track. We've got the culture track and we've got the genetic track. We've got all this culture track code that has brought us forward via religion and has helped us in the past. But because just like the way fast food along highways and at truck stops and at interstate exits here in the United States fools us. So also religion is this old code and it fools us. And so what we must do now is make rational decisions to say, nope, I'm going to stop at, well there used to be a train chain called fresh choice, which is basically a salad bar. And I'm going to eat paleo, which is sort of weird because what we're doing is we're keep monkeying with these contexts. I'm going to eat paleo. I'm going to eat vegan. I'm going to eat one way or another in order to counteract the deceptive coding that's in me. And again, the challenge here is that, well, religion is basically the same coding. But again, notice that all of this is built up on non-dual materialism. All of this has these assumptions built in. This non-dual materialism has in effect spawned a whole degree of stories and the kinds of stories that I've been telling that I've been getting from Brett Weinstein and others are all built upon that system. Okay. So it's an entire worldview. Now I've been talking about religion S, which is sort of this secular perspective on religion and religion W, which is religion as worldview. Well, this is sort of a religion as worldview. This is the way we see the world. This is the truth that we perceive. Now this is where again, where it gets tricky because we have trouble with we and should. We should together try to help each other achieve our individual goals through systems of freedom and affordance. And I would say this is sort of the kindness, tell us what I mean by that. Well, it's sort of a pragmatic collectivism whereby more people can succeed in their individual and communal attempt to secure their, what they desire. And so because there's a fair amount of commonality, well, fast food and, and debit cards and drive throughs now in the chat in the time of COVID, it's good to have a system where lots of people can collectively get the fat and the sugar that they desire. Oh, but then we worry because, well, they're getting all that fat and sugar. That really isn't good for them. Maybe we should also have a system where there are really a lot of people who are getting the fat and sugar that they desire because what's happening in the system is that, well, we have like public health care, which both of them have. One's Canadian, one's English, not so much in America, but to a degree, yes. We have this public health care and that in fact is, is draining the coffers on all this needless fat and sugar and all the cows are bad for the planet and all of the bad conditions for Haitian cane cutters, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, yada, so maybe we should restrain this. So in other words, we have this vast complex system that attempts to in kindness deploy and afford for individuals a maximum around a maximum amount of psychological satisfaction as compared to other systems. And that's in a sense, the implicit telos of the system can be a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very And that's in a sense, the implicit telos of the system. Can we deploy as well as possible? Can we maximize the amount of psychological satisfaction in the system overall? But now we have to pay attention here because we might look at people and say, this one looks satisfied and this one isn't satisfied. We might have them do a survey and say, this person is more satisfied and this person is less satisfied. There's been quite a bit of happiness studies, but that's sort of the idea. We pretty much have a, we pretty much have a a utilitarian worldview happening under the surface. And when, for example, Brett Weinstein had his conversation with Alastair McGrath, Alastair McGrath was very patient and very kind and listening to, to Brett Weinstein. And he basically said, sounds like utilitarianism that, and I've had conversations, a variety of conversations with people and basically say, well, yeah, the, the assumption of a good world is that we make, we maximize the degree of psychological satisfaction for as many people as we can. Now, this obviously isn't a new idea and it was an idea that was played with by, for example, by, by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World. And it runs into the problem that Jordan Peterson has been pointing out for, for a while now that actually happiness isn't a, a good ultimate tell-ass in terms of what we want. And in many ways, the kindness tell-ass and the happiness tell-ass sort of go together in terms of how we use them. And Peterson makes the point that we regularly will exchange meaning for happiness. People do that, they die for their country, they sacrifice for their children. And in fact, Peterson makes an argument from below that happiness is not a good ultimate tell-ass. It's a good, it's a good argument that we are more programmed for meaning than we are for happiness. And he goes into this quite deeply with his conversation on it with Justin Briarley and unbelievable with Susan, with Susan Blackmore. And it's, it's a potent point. But now how do we necessarily handle this point? Because, well, if kindness is the tell-ass, then is it kinder to afford meaning? Well, meaning and happiness are often rather inverted. Anyway, one of the really interesting parts about this conversation was the basic, is it a collapse? Is that unfair? Acknowledgement? Surrender? On the whole point of truth and evolution. The older position was that, well, sort of a pragmatic thing that we are evolved to know the truth and successful competition is, and truth, truth finding is a success, is a successful aspect of successful competition. Now, both successful and Alvin Plantinga pretty much destroy that argument philosophically. And Donald Hoffman in terms of the atheist space has been destroying that argument in terms of evolution. And Stefan Wolford basically completely concedes that entire point that it used to be argued that human beings could know truth by virtually nothing. And that's the point that we're trying to make. And that's the point that we're trying to make. In general, there's a huge issue of trial and error plus rationality. When we found what worked, we knew truth. We evolved into truth and basically says we don't evolve for truth, we evolve for survival. And this is, again, he's done a lot of videos on Jordan Peterson's Evolutionary or Darwinian truth sort of debunking it but in many ways It's kind of what he's employing here because we don't evolve to know truth. We don't evolve to know truth, especially propositionally we evolve to compete and survive and achieve satisfaction and There are tricks and hacks and all of this and this of course is one of the adaptive explanations of religion It's also one of the adaptive explanations of how religion satisfies meaning religious systems basically exaptation use all of the visual because the visual then gets you know sort of stepped up into the Imaginary and then all of our story capacity gets used to afford meaning To our lives which basically give us a buffer against suffering and human beings with meaning can endure a great amount of suffering so The relationship between truth and evolution it's pretty much gone out the window and again CS Lewis made that point Alvin Plantica makes nearly the identical point in his book where the conflict really lies Basically, it seems like the celebrity atheists are for the most part simply conceding The difficulty they're going to have is that once you concede on this evolutionarily you're going to have to ask yourself scientifically if science actually affords truth either And and Thomas Kuhn and the history of scientific revolutions, I mean that door is getting knocked at too in other words Skepticism is moving up the feeding chain. Oh, well evolution would afford truth. No evolution doesn't afford truth It affords meaning and adaptation and commute communal, but it doesn't afford truth because religion is you know Displayed to be an adaptive advantage now again religion both SNW but Well science well this threatens science itself Because what we're doing in science is we have really these tiny little Correspondence mechanisms and these tiny tiny little physics Connections that if we do this we get this outcome. We do this we get this outcome. But again, that's in the matter verse All right the conversation begins with metaphorical truth and He uses and it's good to have another Example of metaphorical truth, which is bad air and talked about how and I don't think this is a particularly helpful Illustration what this really shows is simply low resolution because air well, what was air air wind spirit? that's where it sort of operated in the conceptualization and obviously as the scientific revolution progressed they had more and more ways of Discovering that air wasn't just spirit Spirit wind air ruach panuma air wasn't just spirit air was this substance and that there could be things In the air and obviously when we got to the germ theory There's more and more things in the air and there's oxygen in the air and there's nitrogen in the air And so air really the conceptualization of air changed dramatically But his point was that even without the germ theory of infection or an understanding of viruses The idea of bad air which again, I think is just sort of a low resolution Compared to the higher resolution things we're dealing with today People who were avoiding bad air Well had an adaptation had an adaptive advantage over those who were in bad air and You know if you walk into a place and it reeks of urine or feces or some other smell we naturally get out Even if we don't know what the compounds are then we went back to the porcupine throws its quills now. I Want to do some work on see us loose as miracles and some of these things because again notice When we say throw when we talk about throw we think of picking up something in our hand and throwing it this way No one ever imagines porcupines go like this and throw What do we mean? They throw their quills? Well, they don't really throw their quills Jonathan comes back with a very interesting response and he argues that most religious traditions don't emphasize the sort of scientific cause and effect with respect to their prohibitions Which is again, he's making a generalization and you can easily find in the Bible certain Certain exceptions to that one of them in the Ten Commandments honor your father and mother that you may live long in the land Which your father which the Lord your God is giving you now if you listen to my sermon I just recently preached the Ten Commandments there is actually sort of a cause and effect that one might say this is sort of a just so story that we see with a lot of evolutionary things if children are raised watching their parents care for the grandparents of the children That gets imprinted on the children as good bad right or wrong And so if it's the duty of the parents to care for their aging parents then children will then grow up and follow in the footsteps of their parents and Care for their own parents when they age in other words there could be an adaptive advantage right there built into the the fourth commandment On your father and mother that you may live long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you It's right there built into the commandment as the Apostle Paul says this is the first commandment given with a promise if you do this You will then get that but as Jonathan Peugeot mentions Most of the prohibitions and again prohibitions on same-sex sexuality Weaving linen and wool eating shellfish These are not put into a cause-and-effect Relationship they are put into a an interpersonal relational covenantal relationship where in many ways the the cause and effect are Delayed are not necessarily direct as we see in sort of a scientific pursuit of reality it doesn't say that if you eat shellfish you will die of Poison or anything like that. It's that eating shellfish is a violation of the covenant. Well What is the violation of the government and again it we might better understand some of these prohibitions Let's say that you have a spouse who believes that oh Listening to 80s music is an offense against all of reality Because no good music was made in the 80s and So if you get caught and so your spouse tells you you shall not listen to 80s music And then you get caught listening to 80s music well, suddenly you're in real trouble because you have sort of violated the terms of the covenant this very much gets into the relational exaptation personal relationship aspect of the God of the Bible and That is a much more interesting conversation, I think in a whole conversation for another video, but Peugeot makes the argument that when we're hearing these prohibitions, we're not really doing science and in some ways some of Jonathan's Symbolism How should we say it some of Jonathan's symbolism Concordance arguments, which is in a lot of ways what some of his symbolism argument arguments are is that well There's a natural impact to doing this That's the way now again for Jonathan. That's the way nature plays out And if you want to understand how that works in Jonathan's mind and what's interesting to watch people listening to Jonathan Hearing him do this symbolism concordance arguments They're hearing Jonathan within their own framework and I think that's exactly why When we get the big moment in this video Stephen Woodford is surprised about what Jonathan Peugeot really thinks about God and Why Jonathan Peugeot is very much a Non-dual theist and we're probably gonna have to be working on that term for a while now now Woodford will say now that science has come we can put away these childish things. It's really okay to eat shellfish It's really okay to have a blend of different materials in your fabric. It's really okay for a man and a man to To have sex together. That's really okay. There's really nothing wrong with that. But again Let's go back to this question of right and wrong because as Woodford normally said I don't think right and wrong There's any Ontology, it's only it's always dependent upon the goal and then Peugeot keeps asking Well, what's the big goal in your system and Woodford never directly answers that point and there are reasons for that Because once you state that big point you get rid of in a sense your your non-dual Materialism that doesn't have a telos built into it and that in fact as many ways what's beneath the meaning crisis Now as navigators we can use science to deliver the outcomes we desire But then where do our desires come from? How can we establish hierarchies of desires, especially when? Desire really is in competition with meaning and I think as Jordan Peterson has been pushing pretty hard meaning Trump's desire and we all sort of believe that to be true because in many ways the whole motivation behind let's say affording deconstruction of conservative Christians is For good for what good for good of the kindness telos One of the most interesting aspects of this video I found was Peterson's impact on Woodford Like I said, he's been doing more videos about Peterson than just about anybody else I mean he's continued to do them and that really surprised me and so part of me was thinking You know, I always think about people as pastors would think about people If I am I not the The pastor of the IDW For whatever that means so, you know if well Stephen would be sort of the anti IDW and so well again this gets into this whole issue, but He's done so many videos on Peterson Peterson has quietly colonized him in some pretty significant ways He has to acknowledge a lot of Peterson's argument and him coming to Peugeot I think is I think he imagined that Jonathan was sort of a Petersonian surrogate and He quickly just well not quickly, but by the middle of the video discovered. Oh, no There might be some agreement. There might be a partnership There might be some agreement there might be a personal relationship between Jordan Peterson and Jonathan Peugeot in terms of their views of symbolism and their approach to some of this and even some of their Postures with respect to certain issues in society Yeah, there's there's some alignment going on there. But when you dig down far enough Jonathan Peugeot was coming at this from a very different place and those differences are not insignificant So now remember Stephen's position is from a non dual materialism he is working from below stories metaphorical truths that may not be physically true or scientifically true Afforded past religious individuals and communities and adaptive advantage now we should use better tools to assess Such things for today now again Peugeot quite rightly keeps keeps coming back on him and says, okay So we've got this metaphor this metaphorical truth. Tell me on what basis you are assessing whether or not this truth as a story should continue to endure in the culture net or if it should be taken out and retired just as ideas about bad air or ideas about porcupines throwing their quills or maybe My favorite example is Brett Weinstein's example of the Boxing Day tsunami Where you had this one religious minority that lived in houseboats that had a tradition of understanding the spirits that moved the waters when the waters recede you'd better get to high ground because Well the spirits or however they conceptualized it angry or doing or hungry or doing what they're doing and in fact that religious idea saved that community while a whole bunch of People of various other religious traditions who have been deeply impacted by secularity and ideas about science and materialism drowned and so well there's an example of an adaptive advantage because all of the people that believe that the spirits were moving the waters went on to Share their genetic material and there to a degree their culture warm at their their culture net material Which has probably been losing pretty significantly to the dominant paradigms in the world But they all went on to pass on their genetic material to future generations And so quite rightly Jonathan Peugeot keeps coming at him on this, you know You did it's it's incredibly important but often overlooked with respect to okay. We're going to Evaluate all of these metaphorical truths, which yardstick will you use to evaluate these? Well in some ways we are always Evaluating these stories and part of my argument is that religions are actually always changing and adapting but built into their systems of many religions and especially across a let's say the Spectrum of Christian traditions. You've got all of these aspects of both adoption and resistance to new ideas an example would be prior to the Protestant Reformation It was the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church that lending money at interest was wrong now John Calvin comes along and makes an argument from Scripture that You may lend money at interest if you are lending money not for necessity but rather for another Capitalist endeavor and here we see the heart of capitalism growing out of theology because John Calvin adapted the biblical material with an argument and Removed a prohibition that had been binding Catholic Europe for quite some time and affording some Both positive and negative relationships between Catholics and Jews in Europe There's just a historical example of well religious traditions are adapting all the time But again Peterson's impact in in Stefan Woodford has been significant And I think this is part of the reason that he sort of wandered over for a conversation with Peugeot Now there's a lot of kindness tell-off smuggling going on here based on Stefan Woodford's non dual materialism and Anthropology the good just seems self-evident and again this is a conclusion that Sociologist Christian Smith came to in his massive study of the moral and religious assumptions of American teens in the 1990s that for many people Morality just appears self evident. It doesn't seem to be based on anything They've just absorbed it from their parents and from their culture and this of course is really the great human superpower that we have All this networking machinery that the lesser evolved even that word is subject to a lot of Telos That that the chimpanzees don't have that we are these absorbers and we all absorb these these implicit unconscious first drafts of parenting and and Partnering and morality as children were just absorbing absorbing absorbing and we're always sort of Evaluating on and on and testing and seeing this is exactly what we do. And so we have a very noisy Culture net that is always sussing out these things so so the good just seems self-evident because we haven't really explored it and Especially if you haven't lived in other cultures that have very different moral systems Now again pluralism plays in this in very interesting ways But Basically as Tom Holland is saying this is just you know, we sort of get the kindness part of Jesus that Jesus basically gets reduced to kindness and and you see this all the time if if Like me your part of your life is embedded in religious texts. Yes, Jean Jesus was in some ways extraordinarily kind but other times not kind at all, but and Cs Lewis actually picked this up. He said, you know kindness is sort of the prevailing morality of our culture But as is true of hierarchies all the time If you put kindness at the top you're demoting other things and depending on what value you put at the top that is actually going to impact the other Competent or prominent values that you see and as I've said before in the American political system Republicans sort of manifest strength Democrats sort of manifest kindness and you see that back and forth but whether someone chooses strength or kindness and uses to either to justify kindness at the expense of strength or justify strength at the at the At the expense of kindness that usually involves some kind of justifying story that says well in this And you even see the adaptation in our language Well, this requires tough love well that it that is sort of Justifying strength at the expense of kindness, but we sort of jury-rigged the language to say well This really is kindness but in another form and of course, we're always playing these kind of games. They're not just games They're all adaptations that we're working. So we afford as much organized liberty to allow individuals to pursue their local goals and desires because of course kindness and Achieving desires is Sort of what the game in our culture is about Religious systems might have worked in the past, but we know more like gay sex is harmless and desirable So it's time to put away these bad old ideas. That's basically the argument and the point I've been making I Don't really think you would have had same-sex marriage or This sort of pride about same-sex Sexuality apart from the Christian ethos of kindness The Romans yes, it's true. The Romans and the Greeks didn't have the same sorts of stigmas As Christianity had with respect to same-sex behavior, but they had plenty of stigmas, which are fairly blind to us. For example a The superior they weren't egalitarians at all Okay, the superior had the right to penetrate the inferior and that had to do with male and female But also same sex so there was no stigma against penetrating and inferior if you wish to that was the way that was basically the way sex and status worked together If I say something like that in our culture say yeah you you're allowed to go and have and have gay sex But if your social if your social credit score is higher than the other Then that impacts the position that you will assume in terms of who is giving pleasure and who is receiving pleasure All right, so I mean these things get complicated Part of the Christian story simply assumed and is not justified in this and again one of the comments on Peugeot's On Peugeot's copy of this was that it was very interesting when making this video I'd often have to go back to YouTube and you know want to read the comments or go back to the source every time I searched for Peugeot rationality rules I would always get Woodford's video top of the order and Jonathan's video wouldn't appear on the same page even though I watch a lot of Jonathan's video I would have thought it would have given me both copies of them, but it didn't is YouTube biased let the conspiracy murmur Run wild and Then you get the crying game moment of this video Which is really the sort of the aha in the video and this is how it goes Now maybe some of you aren't old enough to remember the crying game and the surprise that the movie Rippled through the culture with and thinking back it was I think it was they out and I think 1992 You never hear this movie mentioned anymore, but it was a it was a big deal and I think I kind of understand why The movie's not mentioned anymore. But anyway, this was this was the crying game moment of the video Religion is the cancer of of archetypes Okay, that is a very interesting statement religion is the cancer of archetypes Basically what Woodford has done so you've got your non dual materialism which comes up from the bottom So at the bottom you have this life on its own the physics going on its own and then there's Basically what he's taken is inserted Jung and Tien At a lower level that's where they sort of come into the stack and what religion does is basically Constrains the archetypes and destroys them because again in Woodford's mind Religion is this very static system now speaking as a religious person. I would say religion is far from static the The practice of the The practice of even Dutch Reformed Christianity within my tiny Denomination has changed radically from the days when my grandmother was a little girl I've told the story before my grandmother in Grand Rapids, Michigan went to church one day in Flesh-colored stockings and an elder stopped her and said young women should wear stockings And if you this is the beginning of the 20th century if you look at Pictures you've got yet people are wearing stockings or hose but technology technology afforded then flesh-colored stockings and my grandmother Not one to be slow of speech or terribly Submissive in some ways Pipes up at the guy and says I mean this is a story that was significant enough for her that she told it to me I have flesh-colored stockings. So there Elder religious community religious traditions are always Reassessing and interpreting but they're doing so within their own framework So the idea that religion sort of nails things down I think you're better off thinking religion is sort of a drag on selective elements of innovation But there's always change within Because it turns them into something dogmatic that you can't question anymore I think I think that's the big problem and then He's obviously never been in religious traditions, there's people questioning stuff all the time. It's just It's there's a there's a filter over that that makes some things easier to question and some things harder to question But I would assert That's universal over people in every culture There are things easier to question and things harder to question and anybody who's paying any attention to the the dominant conversations in religion Anybody who's paying any attention to the the dominant conversations in place like YouTube will know that there are some questions Which may not be asked because you will get deplatformed It's not new to religion. It's just how human society works And then you also have this issue where you actually have a lot of people that literally believe at least some of the aspects Which is what you have in every religion like okay literally believe that word literally should probably go away You should probably physically believe or believe in this physical thing because that's sort of what they're using Literally for and if you look up literally in a dictionary, they'll say the base level so it literally really has a lot to do with sort of where it is in the stack and In terms of this non dual materialism well, the the physical layer is the location in the stack of is the foundational layer in the stack you Have people most people just simply really do believe that conscious being called God exists That is looking at who he sleeps with and on what position you don't have that position From my understanding you don't even believe that there is a conscious being called God out Wait, I don't believe that God it can be limited to being but I believe that that God I believe that there is Something above all categories and that something is the source of everything and that it's not something it's a it's a it's it's st. Maximus describes God as being a non-being at the same time and and so there are different ways of describing this absolute and Consciousness is is a good way to understand God. It's it's a good way to understand God because It because it's going from heaven comes meaning and pattern and so patterns come from above and so our capacity to Notice patterns and to engage patterns and to produce patterns is is let's say culminates in the infinite and culminates into God and Then they're gonna go off but there's the crying game moment of this video when well You don't believe in this and and you will find these moments reliably especially on unbelievable Again, the one of my favorite episodes is Richard Dawkins on unbelievable and he's having a conversation with a Jewish a Jewish scholar and a Christian minister and Basically Richard Dawkins says well, you're not one of the bad Christians out there who believe and and well, why is this well you're a non dual materialist, this is your stack and Peugeot is a non dual theist his stack comes from above and so this is why in the recent conversations We all this emergence which is from below and emanation which is from above This is why you have all this directionality in these conversations and Peugeot basically says You know, okay You have all of these patterns from below these patterns don't come from below you haven't in any way Accounted for the shape of any of these patterns. You simply say they are in other words this physics is sort of your God well my God is Actually has Consciousness and consciousness is a good way to understand my God He is not a conscious being in terms of a super thing that is out there in the world He is not even simply being itself He is and again now this when you start getting into this language with Peugeot and others it gets esoteric very quickly because well, what do you mean by being and and This is where Jonathan will basically go and say well And to put some words in Jonathan's mouth and bring in some vervegy things and some of my arguments I would argue that and I agree with Jonathan where he goes here. Is that actually the conceptualization of God as a father or as father is really helpful for human beings because This is how we are built to relate to The world and again going back on my videos when your car won't start. Why do you talk to it? Getting into Pascal the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geometry. This is how in fact Dare I use the words we are? biologically evolved and culture wise evolved to engage with a world that Is too complex for us to manage We approach it with all we approach it with all of the tools that we have So that is why we worry about the tiger in the bush this this overactive agency detector that has been Argued for this is why we employ all of this mental psychological Machinery when we approach a world too large for us to Understand you can understand it from below and you can understand it from above and This perhaps might be the place in which these two might be able to continue the conversation because that's I Think actually that's a that's a good way to proceed so So there's the crying game moment It's when Stephen Stephen Woodford has a moment of discovery about Jonathan Peugeot non-dual materialists It's easy to assume God is a super thing because again. Well God this is where Jordan sort of Expands okay. God is not a super thing now to use this word that John Verbeke Introduced God is maybe a hyper thing and even the conceptualization of God is a super thing Even the conceptualization of that term a hyper thing Just betrays sort of the non-dual materialist roots of it It's a hyper thing But it has to be a thing remember the beginning of Jordan Peterson's maps of meaning the world can be conceptualized in two different ways a place of objects Things are dominant or form for action. I'll look at my conversation with with the two With the two Michaels are we talking nouns or verbs in many ways? Jonathan Peugeot's non-dual theism dominates with verbs Stephen Wolford's non-dual materialism Dominates with nouns now, of course in order to have a sentence you need nouns and verbs but How do we get these things do together and you get? Verbekeans sort of back and forth back and forth back and forth. It makes perfect sense and that's probably the direction we're all going philosophically and Theologically, but that's what we're working in. So now again, I you can't blame Stefan, you know Stephen Woodford for Listening to Christians and take them at their word in terms of their conceptualization of God this is late stage Protestant ideas and Post-dism God sort of becomes a thing now As that recedes as as c.s. Lewis notes people when they sort of lose whatever scraps of Christianity Judaism or Platonism that's in their philosophical worlds. They'll tend to They'll tend to devolve back into pantheism, which is sort of older style got a meta divine realm You've got gods up there but non-dual materialists Well now we're gonna have ideas functioning instead of gods and now we're gonna have ideologies But all of those again are going to be dependent upon our mental frameworks Christians have this sort of weird adaptation if you don't go all the way in Peugeot's way where Well, is God a thing is God a being? Well, that's exactly where this conversation went and why it went there So many Christians immersed in western prodigious presentism think likewise and again, this is that terrific moment in vancouver one where They get to the end of the night and sam harris is like we've never got to the big issue Well, what's the big issue jordan peterson? What do you think? God is jordan peterson opens his his um His surface book and starts reading his description and sam harris says no, that's not God But again if you're immersed in enough older theology and you listen to what jordan peterson is saying It's recognizable and it was in fact recognizable to me Who's a protestant but based on my formation? In documents like the heideberg catechism and the belgian confession which are reformational materials, but they're Pre-deism, okay the canons of dork comes a little bit later and so gets entangled in some more of these ideas but This is basically where the where the where the conflict is So stephen wolford doesn't have time to assimilate this conversation yet At least not on the fly and so it's going to be very interesting if they come back together They're going to have to get back to this point because the real difference is Is there or is there not a super thing again? That's how this trope plays out and peugeot says Uh, no, there is not a super thing Wait What? Well, then why do you continue to be? in terms of jonathan peugeot And adhere it to a very conservative religious tradition well This is the hopefully a potential takeaway from this conversation And I hope they both kind of think this through and that gets built into the next conversations Both christians and atheist conversations don't get this far. So in that sense This moment alone was really the was really the was really the takeaway from this conversation Now This gets into the question of what religion is to jonathan peugeot and this is religion w and now It's when jonathan gets talking like this that he loses a lot of people because he's Trying his best to make it clear and less esoteric. But well, i'll let you decide religions or religion The word religion is such a complicated word because it tends to separate things But let's say traditional societies. Let's use it that way traditional societies had rituals and patterns And stories that would celebrate and participate in this frame of reality that I tried to describe to you Sometimes I mess up which button to press so so this is where peugeot's non-dualism comes in because What's fundamental the fundamental Goal of The fundamental goal of the human being is to participate in the divine, okay Now again if we're going to have this conversation within between christians In many ways we're going to start Tripping over a bunch of what happened in the protestant reformation And and perhaps even some differences between east and west but that's and and To language this in a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very stuff gets really hard but Notice where jonathan peugeot begins here And stories that would celebrate and participate in this frame of reality that I tried to describe to you Right. So here's the frame There's an they're usually in most traditions even though people don't tend to realize it But there's an absolute like something which is above all categorization Which is which is beyond the the basic opposites I say most most religious systems end up having that even though sometimes they don't talk about it so much But you have an absolute which is beyond all categorization You have these opposites and then you have the world playing itself out within these opposites. And so religious traditional societies they celebrate that and participate in that through architecture through How they lay out their buildings how they organize their societies their storytelling their dances the liturgical year how they qualify time How they see themselves as part as as playing out this pattern and so it's okay. So again This is why the emanation Emergence conversation has emerged from the conversation between peugeot and vervecky because emanation Comes from above And so what we're doing what what's happening in the religious traditions is they are working their way up to heaven okay, as it well now again you get to something like late stage modern protestantism and Well, the goal is for the soul to go to heaven notice how some of that is in there But also then notice the gnostic issues involved And what peugeot is saying is that this isn't a dualism between say matter? And spirit this is a this is the tensions are in there But it's a it's non-dual theism, but it's coming from above and All of reality is nested in that now. That's a really difficult ask for people who have been soaking in non-dual materialism In many many ways, but if you if you think through that psychologically the fact that That the basic orientation is itself an abstract idea Suddenly you have a point for the um for the spiritualists Okay, what is oh gosh this stuff is so hard. What is spirit again? Go back through all of my videos What is spirit spirit is the thing that moves the thing that forms the thing that again get into aristotle the The the cause that the formal cause the cause that gives form to reality in other words The spirit is the thing which which gives the laws of nature the Which gives the laws of nature That's what spirit does it gives the laws of nature laws are given laws are given from above And and the fact that we continue to have this in our language shows the shows the theistic roots even of this non-dual materialism Because if you ask a non-dual materialist, where do the laws of nature come from? Well, they're just there. Well were they created? That's where you have the difficulty and that's where These two are really working from different areas and it's very difficult for them to find things together This is religion w. This is the very deep coding and assumptions and now for us as psychological Culture net creatures these things have been programmed into us at a very early age And we don't just very quickly think our way in and out of them They are the assumptions of our culture and just as jonathan noted they are built into our architecture They are built into our art. They are built into our music. They are built into our politics from top to bottom they are built into things now this doesn't give the theist sort of a sort of a A terrific advantage because someone would say hey, wait a minute Haven't the hasn't Hasn't that i'm going to use the other language I use the closing of the one eye to take all of purpose out of Reality hasn't that afforded? Economic power military power scientific power technological medicine all of that Yeah, strong point. It's part of the reason a lot of people looked at some of these other spiritual emanation systems and other religious texts and they said These are out competing those But this is where it's interesting that jordan peterson comes in and says now wait a minute There's a lot of legacy code in this that we don't know we can get rid of So traditional society see patterns in the world and organize everything from collective to individual to fit into the nested patterns To achieve or fulfill the telos of the great pattern christianity. Peugeot would say is the true pattern The christianity is true because as c.s. Lewis said not because Because I see the world correctly through it in christianity. I can understand my world Okay, it's the light That illuminates the patterns That lay out and explain the world. That's what christianity is now Of course, Stephen Wolf, the great christianity Of course, Stephen Wolford already has a pattern religion it's just that it's water for the fish and He's born born into it and Over the course of time again, look at the enlightenment read Voltaire and the philosophs It's very very interesting This this is a very old long conversation and Wolford would Woodford would say, you know Ours has out competed yours the germ theory is Superior to the bad air theory Why is it superior? Because I can avoid covid with a germ theory better than a medievalist with their funny mask Can avoid the plague but now pay attention Look at the strangeness of these medieval masks. They're working on different levels there. It isn't just air There's other stuff going around and again, I really want to dive into C. S. Lewis and barfield on this at some point The presumed telos is experiential satisfaction of our desires see The difficulty is that As human beings a telos will always sneak in We're not going to get away from it There's always going to be a reason and and again a nondual materiist will say a reason we project onto it Fair enough, but that reason is going to govern and that reason is going to shape and again this is one of Jordan Peterson's arguments that Our our culture net is going to is going to shape the physical world So right there you have a peugeotian direction of once human beings are operating in the culture net In the theory and we're doing it communally Already we have Seriality being colonized by by mentality Okay, and and so peugeot's argument keeps coming around because we keep living that way because We might say okay. Well my hormones are telling me to have sex with whatever woman is attractive to me, but Society is functioning at this culture net and saying no you should deny your desire Why because we have these reasons up here. Well my gonads Aren't listening to those reasons. Oh, but your head should govern your libido See in a way you've already given into The peugeotian emanation because your head governing the the libido is an example of this and when you construct this broader ought in Society Well, we should remove the stigma against same-sex relationships That's all up here, too It's not down here so This is the fight that is not going away And it's better if we can understand some of the directionalities of this fight This is why those who stand against this pattern by perpetuating non-libertarian moral norms to children For example must stop in the mental imaginary of the non-dual materialists who have an implied and implicit telos of kindness Even if it violates the personal satisfaction of the religious person again what you basically say is Here is a group of people It is okay to not be kind to for the sake of these other people that are In a sense higher up in the hierarchy. Well, why would this tiny little group of same-sex? Attracted people according to a particular imaginary. There's a whole nother conversation in there Why should they have preference over the mass of religious people that are heterosexual by orientation? Why should they be given a privileged position? Well now we're barking at the door of christianity once again because that's been dominating the mental imaginary And In many ways the movie ended the movie the video did end with a bang With a with an evangelistic plea by stefan to to to jonathan Here's a question for you. Okay, given that we have these mutually exclusive religions these mutually exclusive motifs And what's interesting is these two have mutually exclusive imaginaries with respect to the world and so So Yeah, if you two can find each other well That would be something worth watching these mutually exclusive Patterns of being unless you wanted to find them all in some something so basic basic as order in chaos and be vague about it Which is one of the frustrations I have but if you have all of these religions with these different views and these ideologies With different views and we recognize that they're not arbitrary but rather They are a product of they are they are a manifestation of our evolutionary psychology. How the hell do we navigate? But you see what he did right there They're a manifestation of our evolutionary psychology. He just grounded them in his non-dual materialism, which of course he's going to do but Is that really scientific? Can you really demonstrate that? It's tough Which one of them which of them are features? And which of them are applicable today because okay. So again, so here we are. We are choosers and we are choosing in order to Afford our desires but we have already assumed the mental position it's been reinforced in us from society that if we Cooperate in maybe limiting some of our desires we can get more of our desires reached You're not playing along in this game as you should be if I can convince you in the mental imaginary Bring you over to my side. But again, all of this is assuming his own world view. That's that's you know, that's not a That's just how we work and to get beyond it is really really hard The only way I feel like real progress can be made is if you're willing and able to Real progress progress in terms of what progress in terms of whose agenda? Is if you sacrifice your imaginary for mine It is just as it is just as imperialistic. It is just as colonizing it is but again, i'm not casting a problem on that that's how we work in order to Be able to cooperate in order to compete Oh Come on youtube one of them which of them are features And which of them are applicable today? Because the only way I feel like real progress can be made is if you're willing and able to recognize that christianity isn't the best Thing since sliced bread. It's it's a great thing and it has and I let me make that clear I really do think it's a great thing it has it has better patterns of being say than communism, but So the so how do we navigate with what you're saying is again the same problem that I mentioned again is that You you tend to think that you can stand outside of this And then you can say how do we like who are we and where are we standing that we can decide? Which patterns like which religion is better and every that's not our experience of reality our experience of reality is that we are the product of a story and we are the product of Of a world and we live in a world and we live in embodied existence and so The solution to making christianity better notice where embodied how late embodied comes in In jonathan peugeot's. Okay. This is emanation from above Notice stephen. This is emergence from below There is to be a christian and to make it better Like there's no Like it's not people that are that people that are standing outside and are telling christians We don't know where they're standing from and telling them like here's something you're doing wrong Here's something you're doing right and we don't even know what their telos is like what they're aiming at Don't start with christianity Start what i'm a christian, but don't do that because that's not your identity. Where should I start from? The fact that you're an evolved primate and that you have this all of this wiring in your head this psychological evolution And you don't know which parts are bugs. So don't have this assumption that christianity is bug-free. It's not it's very likely not Why do we know that because no ideology is bug-free now again? Um, this gets really complicated very quickly. Okay, what parts of christianity when john calvin for example Rejiggered the christian teaching on on lending money at interest What was john calvin doing right religions do this all the time so It's just religious systems are different ways of assessing Many of the smaller conversations nested goals within the greater goal is just stop doing it Right, what scale are you using to judge the bug from like where are you like I said same as you The same as you no because I have a pattern which I which I participate in the world You're an evolved primate, right? Correct. Let's go that's definitely not my first category No, it's no because I don't have that experience you have the experience of being an evolved primate Okay, your yeah Our experience would necessarily be that like when you wake up in the morning you have that experience like I had the experience And what's really interesting too and to bring in some vervecchian Relevance realization why primate? Aren't there just a host of other? Aren't there a host of other creatures all the way back to? I haven't blown them up for a while Mr lobster that are in you as well. What do you mean in me? Well, the wiring is in me and look at the whole conceptualization. Um, why why are we not evolved lobsters? Why are we not evolved and i'm by no means an expert in evolution but Why the primates because we look like them? That's that's a conscious consideration that's not the same as experience like if you want to say You know when I wake up and I might i'm not actually scared of spiders But you know you see someone that's quite scared of spiders that itself is a testament to their evolutionary cycle And What's interesting is and I don't know see this is the thing we trade in these things without doing the research well is is is fear of spiders a learned or a um Or or something that's coded in us genetically now There's the argument about you know, you have the cucumber and the cat trick you have the snake and the chimp trick or why They these are this is this is this is your arguing point Psychology they are an evolved primate on this spinning earth and Everything on the spinning earth again all of this stuff gets nested in that they think they know Goes back into this evolutionary psychology all of it And so we have to navigate from that starting point or at least have to we have an art in there Have to in order to what? At least a starting point that's way beyond christianity the starting point is if you say that christianity is a starting point Then I can't now you're you're just I can't I will never get through to you because it's the same as Well, here's the question can these two talk It's going to be interesting. I hope they try again someone that says no islam is is the the primary motif There that's where the starting point is game over. So if so, let's say you say i'm an evolved primate That is on this spinning earth That to me that's a secondary consideration. That's an abstraction. It's an abstraction from from knowledge that people have developed and theories that people have developed and and and it's something that you It's like it's like you it's just like people who say that who talk about the solar system The solar system is a total abstraction it's an abstraction from an experience Forget the earth forget the earth thing. I know what you're saying. I'm just trying to express a point But it's the same with the with the evolved primate thing. It's an abstraction. Okay. Okay. We'll forget that bit I I just find that I i'm conscious and I experience the world around me. That's good. I like that one Okay, and then yeah, and then the next thing I realize is that my consciousness you're an evolved primate No, no, no, no next one will be next one will be I mean, that's just the way of describing it, right? um, but but it's a way of describing this sense and that is the The way that you'd put that in simplest terms, I guess lowly Lowly There is no again, there's no purpose in this there's no The there's no there was no purpose in the lobster in that system to to arrive at the primate Why lowly? I need more time to put this correctly, but it would be i'm a conscious i'm conscious And the next thing I recognize is that my my intuitions are not arbitrary They come from an evolutionary background, which is why I was saying it But if you want to get technical or they come from my brain or they come from my environment I mean, it's the stuff gets really complex really fast. That's that's that's where the starting point is So then what we have is these ideologies these religions and they're not arbitrary because they are Substantiations that have these the same substrate that have these metaphorical truths Okay. Now we're getting to how peterson invaded his his His anthropological stack have these young an archetypes and motifs in them and we have to figure out which of them are bugs which of them are features because they can't all be correct because many of them are mutually exclusive and then more importantly And and the difficulty you're going to have is okay, so let's say your your telos is kindness your telos is minimizing minimizing the the conscious suffering for as many people as possible but even if you Articulate it that way. So let's say you have Let's use these numbers. Let's say five percent of your population is Is uh, determinedly and irrevocably same-sex attractive 95 of your population is not Well if you're basically trying to assess suffering by the number of people let's say okay, let's say 45 of your population isn't bothered by Same-sex behavior, but another 30 of it is that 30 of it is going to be annoyed by your haranguing them about the sexual Predelections of five percent of your population that doesn't even make any sense so what's going on in terms of The goal that you have well we can reprogram Oh, you can reprogram that 30 percent of of religious people who are resistant to it Well, but we have all other Goals with these people that we want to reprogram okay, but They're trying to reprogram you and you're trying to reprogram them. How are you going to say which programming is better in terms of? This is the I mean and this is this is part of the point that jonathan is making We have to figure out whether or not they are applicable to the environments that we're in now Which we simply did not evolve for we haven't escaped our evolution in its entirety nowhere near we never will Okay, we will always bear the lowly stamp of our origin as charles darwin put it However, it's it's undeniable that the environments that we have today are vastly different to the environments that we evolved in And we have to be able to recognize the sum of our and and this gets into point Cs. Lewis makes both both miracles and the abolition of man. We have to here's our mission Where does that come from it seems that you've you've established this Okay, well name it the kindness telos just give it a name let's examine its credentials Let's see what what is rational with respect to that telos, but if you have no dominating telos that you at least have to name Well, and and again kindness and again another point that lewis made kindness and love are not the same thing Peugeot mentioned. Okay loves at the top of your value hierarchy Love and kindness not exactly the same thing Intuition some of the motifs that are in our intuitions are going to be today chaos where they were yesterday at order I mean like I I think I think this is probably where we reach the end of the conversation because I I think that you can't We are handed something we are handed A story we're handed a story from our family from our nation from our ancestors And we live in that story and and again, I would adapt that and say this is our first draft. Okay, we we We absorb this first draft. Well, what do I mean by a first draft? Okay well if you've ever been married or started a significant romantic relationship and suddenly you brought you didn't even know you were bringing Assumptions to the relationship until your romantic partner said I'm not your mother or something like that saying Where did those assumptions come from and you have to stop and realize? I just had them. Yeah, but I don't have them. Oh Well, we absorb we and the story the narrative it's all built into us and So this non-dual materialism versus this non-dual theism, I mean except Peugeot has done a lot of work in terms of developing and rearticulating and refining his story and That's part of how he's that cake is baked the way it is so and and again young and peterson sort of fit into fit into Fit into Stephen Woodford's stack and and I think this is a really helpful video on that because when I think about Many of the people that I've talked to with respect to these ideas That's exactly what's happened. Peterson is sort of fit into the stack there And so well, this is a way that I can sort of keep my non-dual materialism But the problem is the longer that lives there in the stack The more you begin to realize that No, you've got a lot of you've got a lot of emanation coming from these other ideas Maybe not all the way up at the level of god But you've got a lot of downward emanation and you're beginning to notice it more and more and more and more and that's beginning to lend credence to well Where did the laws of nature come from? Who was the lawgiver? What was behind his giving of these laws? I can't help but use all of this impressive machinery in my mind this relational machinery that has afforded us this competitive advantage over other primates to Relationalize and conceptualize and do all of this and very quickly i'm living in this other world Is there a way forward for these two? Woodford would need to reconsider his assumptions about Peugeot's belief. They've had the crying game moment and I think that's the only way forward When the revelation happened Jonathan had but had uh had um machinery there that that took stefan by surprise Understanding the implication is not a smaller quick task. And again, i've been listening to jonathan for about three years now. I've had a number of conversations with jonathan and and we at least start more on the theist side And um, you know over time and i'm sure many of you will cheer I know there's a good number when's paul going to become roman catholic when's paul going to become orthodox? um, you know jonathan's impacted me and jonathan has Has taught me a tremendous amount but again all of that happens with more and more time together and sharing at different levels and so it's going to take a while for the crying game moment to Um To sort of trickle down through all of the levels and so, you know it's a good conversation it was frustrating because they both keep repeating each other because they're not They're not connecting at the way we wanted to see them connect with respect to this video The debate about the super thing is quite pointless because it's not what peugeot believes anyway Okay, then What do you believe? Well, that's going to be the work involved It's very difficult to figure out what to talk about without that much common ground. So Well, what does stephen want? Well from the world. I mean he wants change religion is the corruption of archetypes and again I think it's not a good point but it's a very common point no no religions change too and They're in very interesting conversations with many of these archetypes All right surrender on points that we've already won on and this is in a way The enlightenment gets its fuel from the totalitarian Practices of the medieval and early modern roman catholic church in europe and Let's I think most of us cheer The victories of the enlightenment At the end of the council of dort the losers lost their lives I'm involved in regular religious Convocations these days at the end of none of them have the losers of votes lost their lives That's important The losers of the council of nicaea didn't lose their lives So so one might argue that well, is this is this a progressive thing? No, there've been times when they have and times when they haven't There are many types of human meetings where the losers lose their lives and so Yeah, that's we can talk about that. But in terms of american or canadian or british politics You already won on the patriarchy and gays so Why the fight continuing? Because you will not rest until it's been banished from all of our thoughts or at least all of our expressions or all of our imaginaries I the the comment the red belt. It's kind of a that's sort of bible belt meets red state now again We have a brit and a canadian talking here, but it's always amazing to me how much u.s politics figures into these debates We didn't debate the queen you share a queen. What's the deal? Talk about her. I've been watching the crown. I've been watching i've been feasting on Royalty stuff lately. It's like oh boy. Where's this going? drive mission and meaning Parasitically and again jonathan I think one of my favorite videos from jonathan péjot was the parasitic storytelling video. I think that video really Nicely packaged and summed up a good many of the issues that he's bringing forward and I thought it was it was Terrifically helpful and this shows in some ways the weakness of jordan peterson's meaning as Gyroscope within the iron box of secularism that Okay but a lot of wokesters who are a lot of people are deriving a lot of meaning by resisting and calling out and denouncing jordan peterson they are and well, be careful when you do that because that's sort of what Woodford was doing but now he's well He's imbibed a lot of his adversary. It's a very common human dynamic same with christians So which is why it's worth talking to one another so drives mission and meaning parasitically You sort of have to keep The opposition around and you almost always have to inflate them in order to parasitically continue to feed Off the mission and the meaning of getting rid of the holdouts And and we see that with you know, some of the arguments about white supremacists in the united states We keep hearing people talk about these white supremacists and it's like wow There's you're really hard pressed that doesn't and this is to say that racism is gone racism will never go away bias is simply too common and necessary in terms of our programming and Skin color or other racial attributes are simply too handy that when we're looking for cause to Advantage one group against another Racial issues or cultural issues or religious issues or Or other kinds of tribal issues are almost always at hand. That's simply a function of how human beings compete So Must not rest until all conscious torment is abolished except that which is necessary in pursuing our mission. So it's okay to It's okay to alienate the 40 percent of religious people in your population for the sake of the five percent Well, how does that math work? Well, it's obvious because we're right. Oh Well, I thought we're having a debate over which side is right not how to annihilate the wrongs Well, fortunately, we're no longer or at least not yet Killing people who have the wrong ideas But we're gonna bully them and harangue them and shame them and and try and knock them lower onto the social status hierarchies In order to maintain our imaginary. So then again, we're back into top versus bottom Okay So what you're telling me is that the culture net that the the mental imaginary the symbolic liturgical dramatic? Imaginary is in fact what shapes everything below including human beings Including human beings then you've pretty much just given the argument back to jonathan péjot We must keep the opposition alive and all-powerful in order to maintain the meaning of the mission But then you have the meaning crisis and this is where tom holland douglas murray jordan peterson all come in Fundamental meaning crisis doesn't support the meaningful mission that if you keep digging into non-dual Materialism and the purposelessness which you must assert in order to keep all of the subservient mechanisms around You lose meaning because you've got meaning at too high a place in the stack You keep digging beneath it in terms of the stack and you lose meaning and again meaning eats happiness for lunch The meaningful mission is borrowed from christianity as christianity recedes So will its coalition building power and the kindness motivation will be undermined Kindness is the disposal kindness is the disposable income of the stable affluent and secure Until it isn't And that's the fear the anxiety that comes up in tom holland and douglas murray and jordan peterson your kindness is a luxury good and If the competition gets too high if you if in terms of your mental equation You can no longer afford kindness against your adversaries and we're seeing this increasing in terms of the communal chatter No violence is required in order to end racism. Well, what violence do you mean? Silencing de-platforming and killing the opposition. Oh Well now we're back into a new game kindness cannot sustain its place in the hierarchy. What about love? Well Why is it that jesus tells his followers to love their enemies? That's the only way love stays at the top of the hierarchy If love only works with some of the people then there will be something else above it in the hierarchy But love and kindness are not the same and we act that out when we play that all all the time Kindness is an insufficient tell-off just like happiness Even meaning is insufficient and this is where love And all of the stuff around love comes into the picture What can prompt sacrifice now usually we sort of rewire this And this I learned from tim keller with respect to a lie You don't be want to be the kind of person who lied you don't want to be a racist You don't want to indulge the patriarchy you don't want what are you doing? You're using basically status oriented pride with respect to the group I'm going to demote you in terms of our group status if you think these ways make these sounds Encourage these people you have to sort of get the the second class of people out of the system and in some ways a lot of that has been what's motivated the the Anger against jordan peterson It's it's hard to say jordan peterson is a bigot or a misogynist if you look at his life, but He affords aid and comfort to people for their right and this is exactly what came out recently in the employees of penguin Canada, what was their charge against peterson? Well, it's a second order charge and if you want to purify the culture you must Basically use status hierarchy hierarchies to demote these people de platform these people Delegitimize these people in order to wait a minute. I thought Yeah, see it's the same game all over again. But again, it's a mental imaginary game And you're basically back in peugeot's direction instead of from the bottom So a second talk I'm really interested in what they will talk about if they talk again He's learned that jonathan peugeot is not a jordan peterson surrogate surrogate Jonathan peugeot has an entirely different worldview that he is working from than jordan. Are there commonalities? Sure but It's a very different stack coming from jonathan peugeot. In fact, it's not a stack from the bottom It's sort of a reverse stack from above because it's emanation not emergence Can jonathan peugeot find quicker ways to explain himself to non-dual materialists and protestants well In some ways that's what i've been working on my entire three years of my channel looking for language testing it out trying it out So it's a good You know in some ways this is a good um This is a good pair because no they can try out language on each other and now they've had their crying game moment They've figured a few things out. So I hope they keep talking Anyway, as with most of my videos, this was entirely too long entirely too rambly probably of very little Assistance to much of anybody But it is what it is and i'm putting it out today. So thanks for watching
