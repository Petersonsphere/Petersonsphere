 Are you there? All right, we are, I believe, on the internet. This is our usual Friday morning question and answer, but we're playing around with the format a little bit today. Those of you who've been following the channel know that I've been playing around with Thief in the Night live streams and part of that has been, let's say, here we go, part of that has been trying to find other ways of discussion. So when I first started doing questions and answers, hi this is Paul that's right, when I first started doing questions and answers I did it in the Discord because I didn't want to do sort of the Jordan Peterson, Jonathan Peugeot thing where I have this enormous list of questions and I just sort of ramble on about them which is exactly what I've done for the last six months or so. And I want, I did it in the Discord space sort of again as an estuary, we're not just out on the internet taking anything that comes in from the open sea, it's buffered by the culture and structure and community of the Discord arena and what I had hoped for was a little bit more pushback discussions on the questions that I work through. What wound up happening is that most people stayed in the PVK Q&A recorded voice room and didn't actually get involved in the conversation. Now there are a lot of good reasons for that. Part of the reason you try things with experimentation is you learn things that you thought you would know before but you really don't. We, our imagination sort of reach into the future but we are too small, we can't know enough and so there are always things that happen that we can't anticipate. Sometimes they're good things, sometimes they're bad things. So what we learned by doing the question and answer in the format that we've used for the last six months or so is that you know 30, 40, 50 people will congregate in the room and most of them will stay muted and silent the whole time which is normal because you can't actually have a conversation with 30, 40, or 50 people. The downside of that is that a few brave and trepid souls would in fact, would in fact come in and offer a little bit of feedback and some rebuttal. That was more of the goal of doing it in the discord rather than just saying taking a list of questions from patreon or sub star or internet forums or whatever and just having the expert or the celebrity or the the talking head pontificate which you know there's a certain appetite for pontification but part of the reason I've been playing around with the thief in the night live streams is to mine, that sounds terrible because it makes you so impersonal, but to mine the wisdom in all of you because I know full well that the wisdom in the community is greater than the wisdom in the individual and individuals harvest wisdom from the community and it actually takes something like an estuary to be able to sift and filter both the the power of the freshwater coming in from the mountains but also the nutrients that are that are in the sea and what happens in an estuary is that the the the nutrients and the and the fertility of the soil congregates in one place and that's what makes it such a dynamic bioenvironment so again the question-answer format is fine, Peugeot uses it, Peterson used to use it, many people use it. I can there are plenty of videos out there of me talking off the top of my head and that's cool but for me the real advantage is to listen to you so we might not get through as many questions there might be some opinions that some of you don't like that's all part of the process and so I've expanded the impromptu livestream room to be a little bit bigger so more people can be in it and this is what I'm asking if you're in it that if you're in it and you want to talk or address something turn on your camera so I know that you want to address something and if you're just going to lurk you can just follow the live stream on YouTube and you can hear all the content and that's fine and one of the things that I've learned is that a good number of people come into the PVK recorded voice room for the question-and-answer to just listen which is absolutely fine because they're listening at work and then often there's sort of an after party in that room where some people leave because the show is over but others stay and usually the conversation goes depending on what time zone you're in either well into the day or if you're in the UK well into the night it's raining in Sacramento and my attempts at avoiding a homeless encampment out my office door have failed miserably and someone is smoking a cigarette right outside my office door I swear anybody who would visit my office would walk into this room and say the pastor has a smoking problem no it's the people that are sitting outside my door have a smoking problem and the weather stripping on my doors insufficient so that impacts none of you because none of you can smell what I smell but I'm sure breathing it in anyway so Rick continues to have his day job he is in the YouTube comment section moderating that and I'm sure he'll bop in and out of the discord server too if there's a problem in there but this is how we're gonna try it this week and it might be a disaster it might be a success it will probably be somewhere in the middle we might try this for a week or two maybe it'll be a disaster and we'll abandon it but I look forward to the feedback from from many of you and I see a good I I recommended that if someone in the discord server just basically share the live stream in that PVK recorded room then those who gather there can listen also in the Friday live streams section in the discord server there is a there's the real-time text chat with which you can come in Sam part of the fun of the of the discord server again as an estuary is that you find a community and you find wisdom among the people in the community that is more bite-sized for you it's better than I can give you and that again is why the wisdom of a community always is more than the wisdom of an individual and I see that I'm going to have to do a lot of learning myself in this well that's interesting let's say this is let's just lower that one there we go and I'll move my camera and yeah this is this is gonna be rough and messy but here we go and I'm gonna pull up the questions that have been accumulating I haven't done question and answer for a few weeks so here we go my father just died I arrived about an hour after he passed and held his still warm hand before the funeral took him away will you help me pray for him I've prayed for him I hope you will too thank you my name is Bradley let's pray Bradley Lord you know all things and you know Bradley and his father and his family you know you know both of their stories and their intersecting stories better than each of them or both of them can and Lord I don't know I know almost nothing about the situation but you do and what's important is not what I know it's what you know so Lord I pray for the situation entire that you would that you would be with those who are mourning those who are grieving those who are frightened and I pray Lord that you will watch over them all and give them your peace this I ask in the name of Jesus amen so Kodai I'm sorry to hear about your father I see that that was in the middle of December I hope despite COVID you've had an opportunity to to do some grieving and yeah I pray that God blesses you okay yes and no is Matthew what are the similarities and differences between reformation and deconstruction reformation with a small R R so I did a conversation with Roger and that will probably be coming to the channel Friday or Saturday or Monday conversations that I have that aren't particularly time-sensitive I usually hold for a gap in my stock to just kind of keep the channel as level as possible I know I've been putting out a lot of content lately content might accelerate I've got some more ideas and again YouTube and discord are places for me to play around with things so one of the things that I talked to Roger about he commented he said that Twitter was they commented on Twitter said upcoming conversation he thought what another one no I've been reading CS Lewis's pilgrims regress and I'm sure Jeff who was in was in the impromptu live stream room would be quite excited about that I read pilgrims recess years and years ago and remembered very little from it and now looking back at who I was when I read it and and understanding who I am now I've got a much better grasp on the book than I had so I'm loving pilgrims regress right now and one of Rogers comments to me was isn't pilgrims regress basically a story of deconstruction and reconstruction and I think that's right another thing that I I picked up this morning on Twitter if you really want to live stream into stuff I'm reading and doing you can follow my Paul VanderKlay dot me or lean church.com great little quote from Henry Wallace on Twitter deconstruction is the transformation of ideology into faith and I think he's playing with Jordan Peterson's idea of ideology as crippled religion so in program in pilgrims recess I've been thinking about you know how am I how could I bring my enjoyment of pilgrims re recess regress not recess re regress pilgrims regress onto my channel it might help if I get the title right the the the book starts in Puritania and I love his treatment of the landlord and the steward and the steward's mask and the little boy and the board of rules and I think there are a lot of similarities potentially between deconstruction and reformation I think the difference between them will be the telos or the end point or the destination Tim Keller said said quite a bit that the let me let me phrase it in another way in modernity people like to imagine that when they leave Puritania that might be evangelicalism it might be it's basically the religion of their childhood when they leave Puritania they are escaping a tyranny or an oppression or something of that nature Tim Keller has for a long time asserted that the best metaphor is and I'm adding words to elaborating what I believe he was saying a better metaphor is not so much let's say leaving the cave into the light as let's say Plato's fable of the cave allegory of the cave I think it's much more a matter of changing rooms because what you're really doing is swapping different ideologies and different religious systems and probably changing around some presuppositions now you don't have direct agency over your presuppositions by definition but your presuppositions are definitely formed in you and Jonathan Haidt talks about this with his elephant and the rider and the path in many ways the path are the presuppositions and if you want to remake the elephant change the elephants heard so the difference between deconstruction and reformation is really destination are you getting now I'll bring in some of my bounded set centered set talk are you moving towards the truth are you moving away from the truth so I am NOT a relativist and I am NOT post truth but I am in fact a Calvinist who believes that all of us have problems with the truth and when I say problems with the truth I mean both problems knowing the truth and problems agreeing with the truth I think that's what total depravity means it doesn't mean that we are as depraved as we could be in terms of vertical it means that horizontally we are horizontally depraved meaning that all of our life is touched by both limitation but also will for rebellion so I I like that question and I think we should continue to work on this deconstruction theme because as I've said before I don't think it's a wholly bad thing for people to necessarily leave puritania the child's view of the steward and perhaps even that child's father and mother and uncle there's a delightful scene of a funeral in puritania Lewis captures what Andy Kivenhoven used to say about there's much lying at funerals captures a lot of that yet when now I haven't gotten to the end of the book yet but I assume that when John returns to puritania or at least if he doesn't do so in the context of the road and the dream but does so in terms of his mental remembering puritania will look differently depending on whether the person stays in deconstructive mode or arrives at reformation Lewis also said the point of seeing through something is not to continually see through it one of the points that I I gathered from watching James Lindsay is that in many ways he didn't say this but this is what I learned from watching his migration is that your God is the one thing you will not deconstruct and so if you take on the religio of ever deconstruction then you will never arrive anywhere the point of seeing through things is to see something and to see something through the other things and so perpetual deconstruction is in some ways just closing your eyes and ears we want to be able to understand things which sometimes means some deconstruction but we do so in pursuit of reformation so I see we've got one person in the room and you don't have your camera on I don't know if if you had a comment to make or if you're just in here listening so all right next question all these short questions all right Mathias Mathias who's deep in the German estuary in 2020 when in 2022 will you go on your European tour with John Van Dock well that depends on a few things this is this is an aspiration that I have but I haven't set up much there's a variety of things that we could do I should probably talk to my deacons I don't want to give my deacons any extra work here at Living Stones because I'm down to one I've got one deacon standing right now and in fact I've got two elders one of which is in Africa at the moment visiting her her missionary son and her daughter and son-in-law and the other deacon and elder team are a married couple and so Living Stone stands on the precipice of just Living Stone stands on the precipice right now so I can't put any more on my one deacon because she's already doing what she can just to keep just to keep the church up now hopefully in the next couple of months we will bring in one or two more deacons to keep the church from the edge and at some point then I would probably want to do a little bit of fundraising and then plan out the European tour with John Van Dock but we have no plans yet but it could very well be 2022 might be the time to do it after a visit to the Netherlands with a stopover at Job's house a side trip to Heidelberg Castle including a historical guided tour around the roots of the Heidelberg catechism is highly recommended would love nothing better so when I don't know let's try and put this thing together okay Zito what are your thoughts on the absolute either or that Christ requires Matthew 12 30 now he's forcing me to open up my Bible software and the salvation promised with it particularly in relation to the hesitancy of popular post-christian post-aesthete post-atheist like Peterson and vervekey perhaps it is symptomatic of the late modern phenomena that David Bentley Hart at one point called the desire for transcendence without transcendence or maybe the West has just reverted from salvation to the merely therapeutic and or the tragic excluding transhumanism the hero's journey stoicism Buddhism are very much are very much tragic and therapeutic not triumphant and salvific what is the symbolic significance of the fact that it is the Magi pagan astronomers there are more than just astronomers they were court magicians you find the first Magi in the Bible in the book of Exodus that's helpful to keep in mind and shepherds who first found and worshiped Christ and not members of the Jewish Orthodoxy that's I don't know about Jewish Orthodoxy comment I think that's a little unfair it's also anachronistic if you followed my sermons on Mary and Joseph these were highly observant can consistently devoted people to the covenant that comes clear in the Gospels particularly Matthew so in many ways saying something like Jewish Orthodoxy is an anachronism because you have to sort of weigh in Tom Holland's ideas about Judaism Christianity and the framing of these world religions within secularity that's also an important thing to think about when you ask a question like this because all tribalism is necessary now let me say that differently tribal isms are inevitable but tribal isms are insufficient is there something inherent in Orthodoxy that's that's a little vague large o orthodoxy would be the orthodox segment of the church small orthodoxy would be orthodoxy in general but given the context of Jewish Orthodoxy in the previous sentence it's hard to know what you mean by that word in this case orthodoxies in general as sort of a categorical I'd have to sort of read it in that vein so something inherent in Orthodoxy that binds the church from seeing the signs of Christ what does this mean with regard to the second coming okay let me just quickly look at Matthew 12 30 let's look at it in context then they brought him a demoniac who was blind and mute and he cured him so that the one who had been mute could speak and see all the crowds were amazed and said can you see um can this be the son of David but when the Pharisees heard it they said it is only by Beelzebub the ruler of demons that this fellow casts out demons he knew what they were thinking and said to them every kingdom divided itself is laid waste and no city or house divided against itself will stand if Satan casts out Satan he is divided against himself how then will his kingdom stand now there are a lot of layers to that verse because in it I think Christ is also saying that Satan's kingdom is divided against itself it can never be otherwise and so it cannot stand if I cast out demons by Beelzebub by whom do you do your own exorcist cast them out that's a sharp that's a sharp jab therefore therefore they will be your judges and Jesus is so good at this but if it is by the spirit of Eric Weinstein asked Ross Douthat if Jesus were around today would he just simply be memed out of existence if you want to see the skill with which Jesus navigates a culture war read the Gospels and understand that the Gospels are books that bear witness to previous culture war that was very hot indeed but if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons then the kingdom of God has come to you or can or how can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man because that's what Jesus is doing he has bound the strong man and he is plundering the hostages in the temple or in the home of Satan then indeed the house can be plundered whoever is not with me is against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters okay and this is where you get into part of the issue of the book of because the book of Proverbs famously answer a fool has two Proverbs next to each other that seemed completely contradictory Jesus basically also will also say the inverse of this which I think really locates this verse in some ways as a proverb and you know I know people have wondered about my calling Jordan Peterson the un the unauthorized exorcist which is I think in my mind if you want to somehow locate Jordan Peterson on a map derived from the Bible I think that's the best way to see him he is an exorcist he has been casting out spirits he cast out spirits from a whole generation now once the spirits are cast out either you fill the house with a stronger man or you leave it vacant sort of like every time I clear off the foundation of the Lord from a homeless encampment every time I clear them out new ones come now just recently one very regular member of the community I put in the mental hospital over the holidays which was probably the best for him he came back out manic and manic happy and so he's been cleaning up garbage and sprucing things up and I asked him this morning have you how when's the last time you slept oh three days ago I thought yep he's in his manic phase two or three days from now so his manic happy phase is about 12 noon two or three days from now he's gonna be about three o'clock four o'clock six o'clock is total depression his dangerous phases are four four and five and seven and eight and so two or three days from now he's gonna be four and five and seven and eight and he's stronger and he can get really nasty when he's at four or five or seven and eight and he's gonna clean out a lot of the homeless people you say well Paul how do you know this because I've watched it time and time again there's this great saying in Spanish el diablo no es diablo por ser diablo the the devil isn't the devil because he's the devil the devil is the devil because he's old and he's seen a lot of patterns and he knows the patterns and once you it's part of the reason everybody loves Peugeot because Peugeot is able to tap into and same with Peterson able to tap into very ancient patterns and able to apply and map those patterns onto the dynamics we see today and wow you're brilliant well yeah they are brilliant but they're watching the patterns and they're just saying it's all there it's all there to see you can see it too so therefore I tell you people will be that tell you people will be forgiven every sinner blasts me but blast me against the spirit will not be forgiven whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come and I'm sure at some point somebody's gonna ask me again about verses 31 and 32 but in many ways those verses exemplify the kinds of issues that are raised with questions such as divine election issues of the the binary versus the I the binary versus the analog that's the metaphor that I often use there is binary and there's analog your world has both your world has to have both sometimes the Bible speaks in antithetical terms thesis antithesis read first John the book of first John where you get introduced to the spirit of Antichrist it's all black and white black and white black and white black and white you cannot understand the world without understanding black and white you have to also understand gosh the smoke is just horrible I hang on a sec I gotta tell somebody to stop smoking or move away from the door I'm drowning in here guys got a smoke further away all that smoke it's under my office door I can't stand it and the local drug dealers truck is out back there making a delivery so you know we're just in the full swing of things right now so there's always both and so when people want to oh good good when people want to talk about the black and white things are they in or out and I turn to nuance and analog they get frustrated I want to know in and out and I will have to say I don't know in and out do I know categorically how to categorize them no I'm not God I don't sit in his chair in the process of time it's very difficult to see categories now we're so trained by modernity to imagine we can easily do so and so that's when people get categorical and judgmental and I think run the risk of playing God because none of us know where things go so that's my answer I we might we might now categorize post-Christian and post-atheists like Peterson and verveky five years from now are Peterson and verveky going to be in the Church of Jesus Christ I wouldn't be surprised so I'll say that all right let's let's go to the room now yeah something you want to say oh okay let me let me up your volume a little bit here go ahead speak up yep oh hang on a second you're gonna have to repeat what you said because I had actually muted the room to get rid of distracting so now I'm gonna go ahead to get rid of distracting so now so go all the way back and say the question again because the live stream didn't get the question so I was interested in the second half of the question and the Jewish leaders and we recognize the Orthodox bit it's at a time and NT Wright knocked that one pretty much on the head I think as well but it was interesting that you've got the Magi and the Shepherds who are the top and bottom society the most educated the least educated the smelliest the most beautifully smelly and so they represent every man between them and everyone comes to Jesus in that sense but the Jewish leaders it was quite interesting when he said that I thought to myself alternate they were warned that Jesus was coming they had the star in the sky don't look up comes to mind at this point of course and they also had the Magi coming and they actually had the answer they knew the prophecies they knew what the prophecies were about Jesus so the Jewish sort of intelligence here and hereditary had that warning but they said to the Magi who were foreigners and non-jews oh you go off and have a look and if it actually turns out to be something worthwhile we'll follow on they weren't actually willing to step and say oh we're gonna come with you that's what interested me I it's a great point and I think that scales for all of us as well and and I think that in some ways it one of the things that you learn as a pastor is that people need why does God give us time why does God give us agency I mean agency and time are deeply connected and they don't they look much more live in the world of analog rather than the world of of of binary because agency is change and flow and you know look at it with Nicodemus we meet Nicodemus in John 3 and he's coming at night and he's asking tentative questions and he's trying to you know he's trying to hedge his bets and by the time Jesus is crucified he's willing to step up with Joseph of Arimathea both high status individuals with wealth and say we'll take his body and in a sense that says to all of their peers we stand with Jesus and in a culture war as hot as that one was that was no small thing so yeah and an authoritarian society to say yeah I'm gonna just ask for the rebels body that's pretty brave yes it really is all right wonderful thank you and thanks for jumping into the room and because this is this is exactly why I'm playing with this method for answers like that because you all get these questions provoke ideas and you which is what makes this game fun and I will miss things and now and you'll have things that I disagree with and vice versa but that's what that's what that's why I want more conversation and let's just monologue so not that I don't like to talk so okay let's say back to the list and now I can't find the list there we go oh we got quite a few that was Zito Kaleppa by the way John and Kaleppa had a really cool over two-hour conversation on randos united about psychedelics and I thought it was I thought Kaleppa's story was really helpful so just a little just a little ad curious what your thoughts are someone's smoking again I got it I got to deal with this sorry talking about psychedelics first it was tobacco and now it's it's the pot yeah I told it's so funny I told them I said you know we're building a fence oh that's a good idea and it's like you say it's a good idea but when that fence you're really gonna be angry and I said you know someone gave the money to build the fence because they're tired of seeing an encampment against their church oh gosh this room was so full of pot so if my questions if my answers get a little crazy today it's because the it's because the drug dealer made his stop and is hanging out with yeah all right I'll try to clear my mind curious what your thoughts are if any on David Brenner writer of Desiring God's will David Benner design good I I think I read some of those books 20 years ago they were really hot then but I don't really have any thoughts right now so oh Manuel's in the room he doesn't have his camera on so we'll keep going did you out did you want to say something well do I want to say something well I need to get caught up in the context first okay so here's how this room works so the room is exactly you know for people like you who when I make an it when I answer a question that you want to have input in so unlike a lot of the other rooms in the discord keep your camera off and if you want to talk then turn your camera on and that way I know you want to talk so that's how we're gonna that's how we're gonna work that room all right is it PVK is it it is it ask PVK a question day it wasn't on Christmas Eve but it is today that was an easy one Shane the non fungible person the answer the question is it okay for Christians to go into VR while waiting for Jesus to come back yeah I think so oh Chris Pacow can you do a live reaction video to the short ecumenical promotion quick this this video was a fun one Chris did a pretty excellent job trying to advertise Jacob made an appearance we have some Roman clips and then we have we have Chad the alcoholic with his dance and Chris would like Chad to be Pope so that's what that video is about there you go there you go Chris free advertising right on my channel all right Tmart in reference to your discussion of the Brockman tweet I have a blunt and I think difficult question why shouldn't all of the psychological evidence he has amassed simply be taken as supporting the projection theory the Brockman tweet Brockman himself seemed almost giddy in talking about the wondrous effects of praying to the Father God as if God existed and you wholeheartedly supported him in this oh it's referring to a Twitter conversation that I am not recalling why shouldn't we see him as knowing and gleefully hoodwinking himself fooling yourself is not always a bad thing because if the part of you that is deceived is fooled in reverse it might be taking you in a better direction but I don't remember the Brockman tweet that you're talking about here so and one thing is important to always keep in mind to always keep in mind when you're on Twitter you're on Twitter it's it's it's by definition shallow which is why I am so I do I have a sub stack and I use the sub stack for trying to make deeper points than Twitter can hold all right Teddy M on yesterday's live stream prediction for 2022 father Steve he is on the discord because he got into this court of course he is mentioned that American Orthodoxy is starting to get momentum from the immigrants that came to the US in the last 30 years and maybe the future of the Orthodox Church will be an example of how to bring different nationalities together under one dominion in similar fashion as Catholics but without the historical baggage with its conflict with Protestants my question is which of the three Christian Christian churches Orthodox Catholics or Protestant is more suitable to incorporate in its fold Christianity's smaller sister Islam wow oh what a question what what a question and here is the questioner himself in the room why don't you talk a little bit more about your question Teddy and yeah I I wanted to give my neck to the chopping block and you live in Israel so wow yeah yeah that's that's why it was so interesting to me because I think I don't remember where I read it I think in Tom Holland that part of what Christianity doing is embracing other tradition and making them their own and and if if I remember correctly is was part of the way how incorporated the German tribes that there there were a warrior Jesus and a fighter that that can conquer other places and and I thought it was very interesting that maybe because there are so many similarities with Islam Islam and they're both as Jordan's saying is the people of the book all the free major religions and and I thought that with time maybe we'll still have our own small culture and languages but there'll be some kind of unification I don't know maybe that that's just a scientific and science fiction question but I don't think it is I take your question seriously now and the the analog that I use for that is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints when I read Tom Holland's in the shadow of the sword which is Tom Holland stab at the history in a modernist sense that gave rise to Islam it makes a fair amount of sense of course it does it's from modernity and so it would make sense to a modernist so the Mormons are pretty clearly an offshoot of Christianity that has a great deal in common with Islam it's just a number of centuries later Mormonism might have become Islam and might still perhaps if it can let's say I don't know take charge of the American government and use American military power to to bring Mormon teaching throughout the world now there are issues with that there's lots of issues with that but if you get a sense of CS Lewis in his in his answers to show his letter to Sheldon Van Auken talked about the fact that in in some ways Christianity is universalized Judaism which there's a lot of truth to that and he says in some ways Buddhism is simplified Brahmanism okay and then he says Islam is in some ways simplified Christianity and so if you look at Tom Holland's in the shadow of the sword there's a lot of fringe Tom Holland basically says if you look at what put Islam together there's a lot of the stuff that was pushed to the fringes of the late antiquity Christian church stuff you know the their particular brand of monotheism and stuff so there's a lot of stuff at the fringes that then basically comes in and so in some ways Islam is simplified Christianity and Judaism and the Mormon church the LDS church in many ways is sort of simplified streamlined 19th century folk Christianity because if you look at the burned over district in upstate New York where a whole bunch of groups came out of you know the LDS church is one of the churches that really took off now of those churches that left the burned over district you've got Seventh-day Adventists Seventh-day Adventists are already well on the way to becoming part of the Christian mainstream and in many ways they already have you've got the Jehovah's Witnesses you know they're still sort of out there but if you look at Jehovah's Witnesses and Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Islam there are interesting similarities between all of them even though Islam is from a very different part of the world in a very different century and one of the things that Richard Mao who was a professor of mine at Calvin College he was president of Fuller Seminary it's kind of a guiding light in the Christian form church he for a while now has been paying has been trying to get Mormon scholars in dialogue because what he has noted is that as Mormon scholarship develops there he sees the he sees the drift back towards Orthodox Christianity and so even though the Seventh-day Adventists they're further down the road the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons are still a little bit further out Richard Mao thinks they will at some point also come in but remember religions move slowly now Islam given its size its breadth the success it has as achieved in a whole variety of ways that will that might take a very long time but I love your question and I think you're right I think at some point it will come in now in terms of the question of orthodoxy Catholicism and Protestantism maybe that was ignorant that the freed aspects of Christendom that's Catholicism and orthodoxy and protestism because you managed to break it down much much in smaller pieces that maybe I don't see yet well but I think I think it's helpful to understand differences between orthodoxy Catholicism and Protestantism Protestantism is boy I'm surprised I don't get in more trouble for what I say but I'm a Protestant and and and Protestants Protestantism is in some ways the the the the ragged fringe of the Christian Church there's Protestantism is all about fast modernist experimentation and experimentation in deep in deep conservatism such as let's say the Amish and its experimentation in wild rootlessness like in how many different things so I I would imagine that even though there are ways in which just by virtue of geography and history orthodox and Islam can probably understand each other better because they have so much joint history the Russians and the and the Muslim countries have very good relationships yeah yeah they can understand additionally yeah and I just that's it sorry no go ahead I actually I think I probably disagree I think Protestants and actually the more less sacramental Protestants would be more in with the the Muslims because I think well I would say that more more than Christianity is Islam is more influenced by Judaism I think because you know that one God you know that's there the one God right and I think and you're finishing my sentence because I think in terms of how they would actually go they'll come in through the Protestant door also because um of the deep impact that Protestantism has had in the world via colonialism so go ahead John I'm sorry you can finish your finish your thought no no it's fine I guess I would say that it's a sacrament and it's the one God and I think they're closer to Judaism there but obviously definitely still Christian influences but then sacramentally I would say they're very you know low church Protestant I'm from a Pentecostal background actually by the name I'm now a Baptist you know church now and I can see Muslims who are against sacramental who like you know how can God's grace be in a sacrament I can see them going to a more Baptist rather than yeah yeah yeah yeah I could see that too go ahead anybody else if you can turn on your camera it helps me remember you better John but you might have reasons for keeping it off which are fine but yes sorry I'd rather keep that's that's part of the reason I I encourage turning on cameras on the discord because once I see your face I know you as a person better than Winnie the Pooh and an avatar but there are good reasons on the internet to stay anonymous I get that too so go ahead we appreciate the questions I'm having worked in having lived in a Muslim country for a decade or so the excuse me which one Uzbekistan so yeah I'm Russian speaking as well as English speaking and Uzbek speaking and so um it's really interesting that I think what the the on an institutional level the Orthodox church there which is Russian which had been the colonial power and Islam worked reasonably well together that there was no honor clashes between but that's because they very clearly saw this is my community and that's your community and we don't see any sort of interaction or drifting between to a large extent um but the Protestants had a different issue that they of course were seen as more aggressive by Islam but I think also the people who were leaving Islam were coming towards Protestantism rather than towards orthodoxy that makes sense quite a lot of friends who made that journey I it'll there's so I mean part of the thing to remember is that religions are so broad and so deep that what actually emerges will always be surprising interesting complex and you know I what you said you know because I look at just you know because there's in some ways the you know Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I mean many ways they're polytheists when you sort of look at the trajectory of their that they don't like to hear that but the trajectory of their their narrative is very polytheistic in a sense but sorry for us who don't know they like the Baham religion no no Mormons oh gosh no I know Mormons but you said something oh they the Mormon isn't the name they prefer Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints okay that's the official title of their church thank you for clarifying and and one of my best more one of my best homeless friends is a truly devout Mormon and so he's always lecturing me on um how I've really got to improve because he before the restraining order against him he um he would come in and listen to sermons and and he'd give me a little bit of critique how how my sermons were falling short of the Mormon faith but some of when I look at Mormons and I have I have very little connection with with with too many Muslims but there's some real interesting similarities especially in terms of their approach to the book it's it's fascinating so I don't know you guys probably know way more about this than I do but anyway that's it I say keep going sorry yeah I know you did a commentary on the moment I made a jab conversation with Jordan Peterson and I was just so struck at how modern modern monesty was and maybe that was him just being a university student but he's quite traditional he is very because I used to follow him quite a lot you know listen to his popular videos because I listen to the other side David Word and those sort of videos which are very polemical very controversial but I was thinking maybe Islam is quite modernist and that is why they would be more fitted to a prostitute church like a Baptist church something like that but obviously they want to get back to the Islamic texts like prostitutes want to get back to the book but yeah thank you for answering my question it was a great question Sam did you have something you wanted to say in it or did you just want just want in on the feed I want in on the feed what in the world are we talking about is it the Trinity I've got some stuff got some thoughts no there's something about Islam right it's which branch of Christianity will absorb Islam the Orthodox the Catholics or the Protestants um Protestants the there's there's too much bad beef between the uh the Orthodox and the Catholics and the Muslims right like people people forget this people are like man the Catholics that was so mean of you guys to go on crusades and stuff like that the Byzantine Empire had an active wartime border with the Muslim Empire for almost a straight millennium like it like the number of Muslims killed by Catholics is like this and the number of Muslims killed by Orthodox is just like off the charts but the Muslims got the last laugh because you know Istanbul was once Constantinople as they say um but I think for I mean Muslims all Orthodox Christianity into Islam except for the tiny minority refused to change right right yeah and and Islam is mostly made up of former Christian lands and people also forget like Iraq in 1900 was something like 70% Christian right you know a lot of the lands that we think of as the Middle East and solidly Muslim lands were Christian and even for a very long time after the Muslim conquest the Muslims are oftentimes just the the elites and the the rulers and then it slowly kind of made its way down into a mostly Christian population from there so Islam for the record has stolen a lot more Christians than vice versa but I I would find it unlikely that Muslims especially if they have a very strong and iconic you know upbringing you know not trusting images and stuff like that I think they would find Catholicism to be a hard sell in the same way that Protestants do but they get that beaten into them even more than that and I think someone else already said that Muslims are so scriptural and so text focused that they would find Protestantism more familiar and more compelling probably in that sense and also Protestants still send a lot more missionaries like what percentage of the missionaries that are undercover in the Islamic world are Protestant versus not Protestant I bet it's like 10 to 1 at least maybe even like 100 to 1 you know Protestant missionaries to non-Protestant missionaries so that would be that would be my thought on that subject. Although you know you may say so and I couldn't possibly comment on that last bit Sam I think the other interesting thing is the way that people go from Christianity to Islam and that's also a big thing I mean there's a lot of it I think it's probably less now it seems to be less now but there was a lot of it just after 9 11 and a lot of it was about I want to be actively doing something that's against my society the way my society is currently. Well there's a lot of there's a lot of conversion to like just in the same way there's like ortho-curiosity going on there's a lot of Islamic curiosity going on in the West and I actually think that part of YouTube seems bigger than the ortho-curious part of YouTube the Islamic channels in English that have a lot of Islamic converts from Christianity or just kind of secular Western backgrounds those are that seems to be a bigger internet space than sort of ortho land and I've been sort of dabbling in that I have you know I've had four or five Islamic guests on my channel and it's easier for a Unitarian to talk to Muslims than Trinitarians which anyway Sam's gonna go Islam I knew it I knew it Sam come come while you have the chance don't dally they'll suck you in when you're the bridge between two things you don't know which way the traffic is going to necessarily flow uh you know is it I how many how many Muslims might be open to Christianity if they knew there was a non-trinitarian form of it that's sort of part of my point but um but I can also I mean I I kind of like Muslims that I I enjoy talking to them and I'm I I don't find them nearly as offensive or as wrong as most Christians so uh but uh you just ruined your relationship with Anselman it's toast now Sam it's toast he he still watches my channel and he knows I have Muslim guests on he knows what I talk to them about so I love you Anselman but uh I I just don't see I I think Islam is basically just a minor heresy off of Jewish Christianity back in back in you know the Arabian Peninsula there was still active forms of Jewish Christianity that were Torah keeping and um followed the law thought Jesus was a human and you know God was one didn't like the I the semi-idolatrous practices of ortho-christianity and I'm pretty sure that Muhammad was pretty strongly exposed to that form of Christianity and I think he originally thought that he was a prophet in that tradition and sort of slowly over time had a slightly stronger and different identity as being apart from that and really I I think that Islam like Jewish Christianity has gone extinct and or it's the second biggest religion in the world and so I I don't think of Islam as different from Christianity as most Christians for obvious reasons but I I don't know I I I hope that the Christian world and the Muslim world can get along better and I don't think that we need to defend that propositional border as partially as we do Wow anybody else on this? Oh come at me if you if you think I'm wrong come at me. Go ahead Teddy. There's still a problem because that Tom Holland mentioned that modernity and the West developed in Christian countries and Muslim countries stayed behind and there is a lot of resentment and well I don't know if it's a question or just I'm strengthening Sam's point that there is a lot of historical baggage. I hear Teddy in Israel saying you can't handle the truth Sam on this. Well well yeah like it's it's difficult like you know it's it's difficult it's difficult to to have them across across the border and it's difficult to fight but I think it's difficult to fight with any people I don't know. I take the go ahead go ahead I'm just telling like a small story that I told before like when I went to the military I was an infantry and in basic when you train to be to be a fighter they tell you thank you they give you like small jobs and go to protect some small community on Sabbath and I think I was like three four five months into the service and they sent me to Hebron and I remember just as we arrived our bus came to the place yes bye and they sent me to the post and I standing there in the post and I heard it was at evening and I heard the Moazin and it was something that I never heard before it was all across the city in in a huge huge war war roar and I was I was terrified I was so terrified I just I was standing there with my gun and just looking all around thinking that I'm being attacked or or like the wrath of the Arab world would crush on me there and it was it it was unnerving but it's it I got used to it first I just started to get annoyed because it didn't um it interrupted my sleep as a soldier and it was really really annoying when they started to chant at five in the morning but now when I'm a little bit older I see it as something of extreme beauty I see it as the same thing as the bells that we hear sometimes in Europe the big big bells that rock and and you feel the sense of awe and that's beautiful I wish they don't do it with the recording I wish there were a guy who go to this this green tower and just shout it from the gut of his of his of his body and I wish it was like that but they still play a recording and it's still pretty it's still pretty and I don't know it's just a small story to add to that that's good yeah well I mean obviously the situation is different in the Middle East or especially Israel where there's a lot of ethnic tribal and national identity connected with militaries with weapons pointed at each other whereas in the U.S. like my wife and I went out for Pakistani food about a week ago and drove down you know about 20 minutes to the Pakistani neighborhood and it was delicious and most of the people in there are Pakistani and a fair amount of them are wearing headscarves and such and then we go back home to our house right and you know no one's pointing any weapons at each other or anything like that and there's no national animosity and a lot of this I don't know I guess people being attracted to Islam is happening I think it's especially common in the UK for whatever reason and then there's some amount of it in the United States and but it's interesting you know Muslim Islam won't be able to come to the United States or the UK without being affected by the strong acid of secular Christianity and then the more overt forms of actual Christianity but I'm generally optimistic that I don't see why there would be any barrier or reason why Muslims couldn't be a well integrated cooperative part of a country like the United States or that we really have anything to fear from them at the end of the day and on the contrary I think that a lot of Muslim immigrants are very grateful to be in the United States and to be escaping often forms of tyranny and oppression because we forget the most common oppressor of Muslims is a different sort of Muslim in their own country and a lot of the most common form of violence that Muslims experience is from other Muslims and the most common target of Islamic terrorists is other Muslims right and then they can come here and they can come to the United States they can leave that behind and they can make restaurants that have delicious food and that sort of thing because the the neighborhood that has the Pakistani restaurants I was talking about you drive two more blocks and it's the Hasidic Jewish neighborhood you know like the those sort of animosities are not there so I don't know I guess I'm unusual among Christians and conservative Americans and being somewhat pretty Islamophilic philia or something like that I don't find them as weird or as dangerous but Anselman you are right that they ignore the cross and they ignore the atonement and I agree with you on that Anselman so I'll throw that down like and like I come from Europe from Flanders so we have a bit of a different experience with Muslim populations here on the continent it's a lot more hostile most of the time it's like to the United States you usually get more immigrants that can better integrate here we often have have the problems like ghettos are real in certain places in Brussels you don't want to go to for extremist reasons it's it's a different experience that we have here it's not all that easy so it's it's it's different than than what you have in the United States it's also here a lot more tribal to a degree also in the sense that a lot of them are third generation and they are usually the worst in a certain way because they don't have an identity they are completely they are cut off from from being Flemish but they also no longer Moroccan Syrian or the like or Turkish especially so they they live in that in between space and that creates a lot of it creates a lot of conflict here between the whole whole piece why do you why do you think that in the US we don't have the problem with it's what Paul said it's what Paul said on the video with Elon Musk the the the piece that he he brought from the conversation the quote that in when you have culture that is not confident in its values then it's a problem and Europe is not confident with religious problems as the US and that's the difference that's a very true there is no there is no driving force here to really integrate and to make them to make them part of of of your country there is nobody they don't want it we don't really want it the third like I said the third generation doesn't basically doesn't have a real identity so it's a real real conflict that's fascinating so I would agree with that as an Englishman it's very similar here but it's almost like the Church of England is very passive and before it would have been evangelical like really passionate about it but it's almost like going back to my comparison to the Protestant Islam is the Protestant religion it's like the evangelical religion now is it's not the evangelical religion before not Protestantism it's now Islam and obviously as as we've been talking about that's causing conflict anyway I'm going to duck out now thank you nice to speak to you. Oh thanks John thanks for for John any any other on this I want to go to another question so maybe I can like a friend of mine is a Muslim but he's probably going to convert like he's really doubting it he converted from being a Jehovah's Witness to to Islam because of problems with like he could no longer hold that position but the thing is like Islam itself has a problem with really integrating somebody and with it's it's a lot of the time is like you say the Shahada you're part of of the you're now a Muslim but they don't go the extra miles you're left to dry like a lot of converts they western converts they they leave after three between one and three years they just disappear like and he converted with a few dozen other people none of them are left here's the last one last convert left in that in that town so it's it doesn't have that like it even Islam here does really have its own like real identity like real strengths of of conviction it's it doesn't go it's skin deep like that can lead to to sometimes to the radicalization to the degree that they do terroristic like acts and the like but it's it's it doesn't go deep into them they just don't don't trans and they just don't live it in the way that you that they do it for example in Egypt or the like it's that's yeah it's very unstable footing there they are wrong. Can I ask a small follow-up question Paul if you don't? Yeah yeah. So do you think that part of the fact that America can integrate Muslims well is because it kind of stood up for itself do you think almost a weird ironic legacy of the war on terror where America was very much kind of fighting against Islam for a while helped it seem self-assertive in a way that almost paradoxically helps it integrate Muslims in that way that it also in general you get a bit a much better quality of immigrants to the United States and we get into Europe a lot of the the popular like immigrant populations where we call them guest workers, like especially from rural eastern Turkey like the more conservative parts the more rural parts and they just don't integrate that well like usually with western Turks there aren't many problems but it's those eastern Turks that's that's really whole and then of course we have like the Moroccan like organized crime is also usually led by Moroccans or Turks there are a lot of conflicts here in the harbors in Antwerp or in Limburg like it's that's also another factor that they're also quite involved in in our own organized crime it also makes it a lot more more difficult and gives us the association also like with them and crime it's like like for example I know that in British Columbia like for example there you have the Somalis and they are there they're associated also with crime because they're also the organized organized crime and here for us here it's the the Moroccans and the Turks and that also creates more conflict also another another way for them to get into to travel into conflict with the law like I said there are areas in Brussels where like you have a need police to protect the police and they go on and assignments in those neighborhoods so it's just a lot of a lot of problem and also we aren't that confident in our culture we don't really have a culture anymore it's very like there is nothing assertive there is no no drive for example almost all our political parties they don't celebrate Christmas in a way like they don't do a statement like Merry Christmas or like of Happy Easter they do it for a Ramadan they do it for for a Hanukkah but not Christianity it's it's just like you don't speak about it there is no no assertive drive to say like we are Flemish or we are Europeans and we are proud of that fact just gets ignored it just gets just goes quiet hmm we need to save our father from the well we'll need to bring the alteration back Unwound history you jumped in did you have something you wanted to say I mean it would be tangential now it was just it's similar it's very difficult topic and now I'm on the stage right so it's how do I enter all right all right well good well this was this was wonderful and this is it's it's what happened right here right now which is exactly what I was looking for by opening up this room and playing around with this process so again part of the reason why we're doing the question and answer for those of you who have come later here in this room rather than the usual room with no cameras and just me on camera yada yada yada is because when there is a question especially if you're present in the discord when I when your question comes up you can fill in your question a little bit better and then as with you know there's a lot more expertise there's a lot more lived experience there's a lot more information out there in the community than I have and it's our ability to go deeper on a question like this which I think we just had in a productive way which is why doing a question and answer let's say in the context of a community is more is better than just doing it with a talking head and a list of questions and me yammering on the internet because yammer is what I'll do so all right good I am going to I'm going to go to the next question and again as I said if you're going to be in that this this room is limited to nine so if the question isn't of any interest to you and you don't anticipate having anything to add it's best to leave the room if you are going to stay in the room turn your camera off and then I'll know when someone has something to say they'll turn their camera on and then I'll get a chance to call on you and bring you into the conversation that's that's how we're working this all right next question I have to find the questions again okay oh boy the questions have stacked up so it'll take us a little while to catch up with the questions that's a great question teddy vw our wv pilgrim what type of hole is the hole in the culture left by the church as in a hole in cloth maybe from a rip or moths a hole in the ground which may have been dug a hole in the ground which may have been dug intentionally or resulted from erosion or maybe like a hole in the doughnut a space sacrificed for expansion of the dough the kingdom is like yeast boy it's a great question so I did a little so part of what I'm experimenting with on the channel and kind of in conjunction with my clips channel is we we're doing more and more of these long hodgepodgey less thematic less organized videos and so I'm taking snippets out of here and if I think they're if I think they're clear enough for my channel at least I'll throw them up on my channel and if I see them as just pieces of something I might want to use at a later date I'll throw them on my clips channel along with other clips that I reap from other channels and that's so the clips channel is not let's so it's only got 500 subs it's not monetized I will probably never monetize the clips channel and that way I can just I could just take raw clips from Jordan Peterson or something else just throw them on the clips channel doesn't matter the clips channel is in some ways my workbench and my this channel is a workbench too it's just it's a little more refined than the clips channel so it's all part of sort of a process and so a lot of again why and how I use my channel is as a process area where I can sort of like this estuary I can throw things into the water here and some of you will swim in and interact with what I've thrown in the water and that improves our knowledge and our wisdom so all of this is in in a sense about a process and as I was trying to digest the the Four Horsemen of Meaning video it was dawning on me that again most of us religious types will assert that a culture needs a cult every culture has a religious foundation and every culture needs a Christian or every culture needs a religious center you know and and with Kanye West who is on obviously his own journey with over religion you know this land he bought up in Wyoming this town he wants to build he will have a worship space he will have his cathedral his church his church at the center of his town in a medieval society you have the church at the center of the community in American cities we have these we have these commercial buildings as the downtown the center of our cities and and that's that's fairly religious and so as as modernity recedes as modernity recedes there is a hole left in the as modernity recedes and I think as as Mark noted the other day in the in the impromptu live stream there's there's a hole that's left in the middle and what kind of hole is it I think it's see and this the image I have is much more of the high point and and it dries up but it's got to be inverted and when water recedes it stays in the hole so it's it's a hole it's not like a donut erosion is is more of it because it's a process so in the Christian Reformed Church we have these we have these puddles and Ripon California is a puddle and Grand Rapids is the deepest puddle and Chicago is a fairly deep pond when there's a drought in an ecosystem the fish gather in the deepest coolest parts of the pond and other parts are evaporating and right now what's happening in the Christian Reformed Church is that the the the the ponds that were world-class cities world-class cities northern New Jersey where I grew up Chicago but that's close to Grand Rapids and it's also Midwest in our classes which is a region of the church the the churches in the Bay area are dying quickly our attempt at planting churches in the Sacramento area was in some ways an attempt to go in and and dig a little dig a swimming pool dig a little artificial pond a cement pond as I said on the Beverly illbillies here in Sacramento and I'd say that our our results are middling to poor and as time goes on and so the whole left in the culture is definitely a whole left by a recession it's exposed by the recession of modernity but it is also the recession of the church so it is it is it is a spot where in order for the entire ecosystem to function properly you need a living vibrant community now that community will have institutional aspects but you need you need something operating there and you know it's interesting what was said about what was said by Ayin Hershey Ali that I mean in the clip I played from the Jordan Peterson conversation where she asserted in frustration you Europeans aren't enculturating the immigrants in a sense to a degree of irony you're not colonizing the immigrants like you should to your religion you're not converting them your religion is too weak and so in some ways perhaps the hole in European culture is is leading to others filling the hole and I know in in Europe there's an anxiety about Islam about Europe becoming and is another Islamic continent because at least the Muslims believe in their religion and I think again back to of the videos that I released the videos I released last week were quite a bit more popular quite a bit there they were they were they got more attention than usual and the Elon Musk one took off like crazy now sometimes when something takes off it's just kind of because it's a it kind of hooks into our limbic BSing systems but that that Elon Musk the end of the Elon Musk interview clearly hit a nerve and remember when I started this channel I wondered why anybody would bother listening to me and some of the people friends that I've made in the process have said well you still believe oh how do you know I still believe because I'm willing to go on the internet and say I believe that Christ physically rose from the grave that when I profess the Apostles Creed I continue to believe in a second coming I continue to believe and he will come to judge the living and the dead I am a I am a crunchy creedal Christian and if I'm a crunchy if I think I were a a mainline pastor who was little more than quiveringly available and affirming and and and for this reason I have I'm having a conversation with a church that's leaving our denomination and I'm trying to obviously encourage them to stay but my assert their fears that the Christian Reformed Church is going to go full affirming of same-sex relationships and I don't think it will and I don't think it will because not not because of the rightness and wrongness of the issue although that is not arbitrary arbitrary but because of the fact that at least those who oppose it show more life than many who are sort of floating along with the program and I think that's at the heart of Tom Holland's point about the church and COVID now I'm not a COVID skeptic I've been vaccinated in church we wear masks although we're not hard-nosed about it at the same time those churches that have been antithetical to the issue demonstrate something in their in their rigor of opposing it and opposing the national narratives now to the degree that they have audience capture about the antithetical I mean you can be tribal in two ways but at least they demonstrate that perhaps there's something alive underneath that is willing to that is willing to inconvenience themselves and take social economic and relational risks in order to achieve something because if your religion is such that you are not willing to risk anything for it then the entire world knows you don't value it yourself and it's for that reason that generally speaking countercultural religions do better unless there is some kind of disastrous tyranny that is going to physically kill them which of course happens and it's the risk of that that actually energizes the interest and attention in those crunchy religions and I think in terms of Sam's point about all of the Islamic curious people well here in the United States to identify as a Muslim is in the very broad mixture and it's a very complex mixture because you'll get you'll get points from the progressives and the woke for identifying that way unless you stand up and say and I keep my women at home in a hijab and I don't let them drive the car well suddenly the the wokesters are gonna be reeling a little bit so there's a lot going on with this but the whole in the culture left by the church is is is a whole left in some ways the inversion of a drought that in a drought the deepest puddles maintain the water and the fish the whole in the culture is because of water has the the living water has gone away and you know Peterson has other language for it you know we're continuing to feed from the corpse of our dead ancestors and if the culture is going to continue there needs to be new living culture made that energizes so that's the best I can answer that question I'm sure there's people want to jump in on this so so I want to jump in and like address the the question a part of the question that said was this dug intentionally or resulted from erosion I think this was dug intentionally like the enlightenment men they knew what they were doing and many of them were freemasons and freemasonry comes from alchemy and alchemy in a way is this same modern fantasy that you're gonna somehow reach god through the material means so in a way this like this replacement of religion for modernity for scientism is is in a way the first hole that left that led us into post-modernity in a way I'd say that modernity is inherently fascistic because it proposes a view of truth that will never ever lead to truth so it's like it's like god without god god without incarnation god as a as a story god as an objective description of the world but I think in this page is completely right you don't get to fly by with just a description you need god to actually be there and and heaven and earth meet okay good yeah and what I also was going to say like the opposite of love is not hate it's apathy and that's what's like especially here and about like people my age like 21 like and a bit higher and younger apathy is like the best description of of most people people just don't care it's like whatever like like this this gets me a bit angry for history reasons but historical reasons for example language is very important in in belgium and flanders like Flemish was an an oppressed language for a for a good while of of belgian history of Flemish history like there and but there are today people who say like I prefer like why did we learn a stupid language like Flemish why couldn't we like learn english when we are when we are born but why do we have to deal with with something like this and it's that whole like attitude of like not caring about who you are in in the world like where you where you come from also in in in flanders because like we kicked all of the dutch calvinists out during the the counter the counter-reformation so they're now all up in in zealand and in utrecht and the other places up north and flanders and belgium in general the southern netherlands we were in like a catholic heartland for the lot for since the country counter-reformation like québec ireland and flanders were like the catholic places of of the world and the church had up until the 90s it was an an institution with power that's like it's hard to describe in the sense that for example i come from an in a catholic like family in the sense that you had the the concept called pillarization which means that society was and you probably know this about the netherlands had kind of the same society was ideologically divided it was in a vertical pillars division of society you were i was a catholic you could be a liberal or a socialist if you were a catholic or in the christian pillar you were you were of course you went to church you were baptized it's everything you did in life was within that pillar within that structure your bank was a catholic bank you read catholic newspapers you went to a catholic youth movement like a scouts you like your cultural associations were catholic every aspect of society like your your union was catholic your like small business employee association was catholic everything was catholic was catholic everything was structured in a pillar you had the same with the socialists with the liberals so our society was very rigid and structured in that way like you know all the things you you got to do catholics went to the catholic universities liberals and socialists went to the social they went to the government universities it was very structured but that started to to fall apart fell first apart in the netherlands about the 70s pillarization basically went away here it lasted till the 90s but from that moment on it was basically a free for all we still live in the remnants of those pillars like for example because of my family backgrounds i did all those those things uh like i like and also but of out of habits we go to these organizations but slowly but steadily they lost their um they lost their their identity as being a catholic or a socialist or a liberal association they started to come really like broadening their like not no longer ideological no longer philosophical that's really started to dissolve our society so since the 90s we don't really have an identity anymore like what does it mean to be Flemish these days there is no nothing to hold holds you to there is there is no structure anymore i it's all been washed away and here it's especially that hole that exists of course there are like elements like Flemish nationalism but also had their history and the like but in general it's it's just one empty hole of nothing you could say just some governments like just some remnants where you live in nothing nothing more than that's interesting thank you that's very interesting because the the Dutch Calvinists who came to America in either the end of the 19th century wave when my family came about this about them willing their own unions and like like it's like it is here in the Netherlands you had the Catholic pillar the um they're like the Protestant pillar and then he had also the secular pillar yeah like socialist pillar didn't really exist there but the thing is also with these the like these pillars were extremely totalizing in a sense like for example the province where I live West Flanders up until I think the 80s the Catholic the Christian Democrat part or the Catholic party got more than 50 60 percent of the votes here for example in Catholic provinces in the Netherlands up until the 70s the Catholic party got 80 percent of the votes in those in those provinces like that's and it's it's all layers of society from from your loveliest labor to your highest to your highest businessman everything was integrated in that way it was a completely totalizing totalizing thing yep yep anybody else anybody else in the room I see WV go ahead go ahead Teddy and yeah the question was that when the church left a hole but maybe maybe there's a little bit different problem um because I usually when when I listen I'll listen a lot to Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan used this argument quite a lot like if if we just were three of us in you me and Jamie in in Ireland then there will be no problem I won't say that don't smoke weed why should I say to to Jamie and we can all get along and the problem is usually is because it doesn't scale it doesn't scale to to to incorporate society to incorporate a lot of people because when we have a personal connection I can deal with your problems but if it goes beyond the number number it's difficult so we build structures to do it we build countries we build kings we build like however very cool it the psycho psycho technologies we develop those and maybe the church and other things one of the problems that we maybe encountered during the last 100 years that we grew up in scale so much and maybe our old institutions did not cope with to deal with that and it's not the problem that the church had something wrong with it it just we stumbled upon a new block of of scale and now we need to adjust and and the the combinatoric explosions is crazy we we don't know how to even to to decide which cereal to buy yeah yeah yeah that's true so that that's that's that's maybe a point of view that I don't know different a little bit okay good all right anything else on this question go ahead Al yeah so I was kind of thinking it thinking thinking of it as um you know maybe the church kind of had a certain way of thinking and there was no um I guess what science brought was was a different way of thinking which is like a proof that you need to have where church started with some answers and work that way but once once science came in it became so useful that it kind of took over so people were so the hole was kind of left by um you know people passing away and and you're kind of born with a round hole and then church is this this square peg that doesn't fit into that hole so it you just I think science is useful we can't think we can't think of church in the way we did before science because now we have this new kind of way of seeing the world so we we need to incorporate both of them in some way um but those are my thoughts on that okay but those are my thoughts on that okay thanks all right go ahead ash so there are two things that I want to highlight as an immigrant to the U.S. I know that it's not very popular to say this um by um a lot of Christian intellectuals don't like to to hear that you know America is a Christian nation and they reject that they're like no it's not and and sure on paper I would agree with that but the problem is that the the rest of the world the non-western world views America as a Christian nation and it still does even today with with all of the fragments and so on and it doesn't understand like you know a Muslim person in Egypt doesn't understand Baptist uh CRC OPC PCA they don't care about this stuff they just care that well you know what all the ethic of what America is is is very Christian uh the problem is they're really bad at it so um so that's that's one point and the second the second thing is that you know I think Teddy was uh kind of hinting on this a lot of a lot of what was the responsibility of the church was was taken over by government so you know things like hospitals let's say mental illness facilities and so on I mean one of the most fascinating characters uh in in for me as a founding father for the U.S. is Benjamin Rush Benjamin Rush a Pennsylvania a Pennsylvania guy and uh he was he was one of the first guys who modernized for at least that time uh how to how to treat mental illness uh used to be that he would put them in dungeons and hide them and not deal with them and he would say don't have a conversation with them talk to them let's see what we can learn from these people give them a give them some sunlight and fresh air and proper food and let's let's see what happens um that came from a very Christian ethic that and he used um he used money through the churches and he um he didn't say that governments should do this he was doing it through the church and so but but then over technology and and things getting more complicated and and making things more homogeneous and streamlined and so on we said you know what let's let let's let our taxpayer dollars do this so that everybody gets the same treatment well took away a lot of the reasons for church and this is some of the stuff that you talk about paul about how you know what was the point of going to church then i can just get involved in politics and get my job done a lot quicker all right uh wvw you got your face on here now so uh it was your question is a great question you got any any further responses to it um well i i wanted to just to second on uh what was just said about um um the church uh kind of surrendering a lot of its um place to the gov to government institutions um a lot of this is that's so the part of the question is is sort of an ongoing thing and and um i've commented and passed on some of your your videos about how even back in the 80s when i was in school when i was in college um i read a uh paper about the rise of the pastoral counseling movement which was sort of really taking off in the early 80s um and how the church um was was sort of seeing itself as a therapeutic agent um and through the 90s as the the therapeutic state became the the idea um of all of that sort of gets shifted over to the government and i can think in one of my problems in re trying to re-engage the church um i'm i'm i'm deconstructing my none and done status um but i'm i'm i'm almost needing to do kind of a truth and reconciliation process and try to figure out how much of this whole and i i think that's the best um explanation what's holding me back from from re-engaging is intentional how much was how much of it was simply accepting a government model of community as opposed to a religious model of community that's really good that's a really good question and and that yeah that's excellent thank you cassidy did you want to jump in thank you cassidy did you want to jump in well yeah i just find the whole idea of sort of how do we frame church and how does our governments and the way that we see the structures that have been laid out in front of us affect the way that we participate in community and religion that's something i've had to struggle with myself and i've been through mental health systems they're not very good they're not very holistic and and they i think they struggle with um trying to separate science and religion too much um and i think there's just a whole western frame of like the rationality is king that has made it hard to integrate big ideas into life and what it means to live meaningful and that's why i personally found eastern orthodoxy to kind of be a more reflecting way to to look at life and has given me a more holistic way of of living life and it's broken sort of those western categories of how do i integrate faith what does it mean to come to two answers about those things and you know in the faith or so in the faith question of the truth beauty and goodness like what place do those things have in you know the pursuit of faith and how we do those things and i think it's all kind of integrated in those ways um those are kind of my thoughts i don't know if exactly that was the way you were going but that is what i was thinking hearing all of it okay maybe to add one thing to it it's like we have a lot of like a lot of people today and this also goes to living in apathy that i mentioned this we live here in the heads and not here in the hearts and that's the the big the big problem we hold all those ideas in our in our head but we don't live them true like we don't act out what we believe we don't live and that's also can you can like also see here in europe in in general we just don't live out what we what we believe we just play some video games or just do some some random things but we don't like really engage with the world and i think a lot of that that's like there is nothing also to like drive us to engage into the world and that's a bit of the problem with with no church or no central institution or thing that draws us together and draws us um to the sky basically to heaven i could say like and that's thinking i think also a problem like that we we don't like really live okay good thank you any any mike you jumped in here did you want something want to say something i can't hear you uh discord well one thing to just bounce off of uh what vollev just said i you know i listened to the uh lord of spirits podcast um probably a couple months back but the first episode talked all about this idea of like what we live that live out versus what we believe and you know their whole premise was you know as eastern orthodox christians we don't believe in a materialistic world but how often do we act as if the world is materialistic we're far more often um willing to go to a doctor first before we we go to prayer or some other type of thing um and you know not in eastern orthodoxy is very sort of embodied where the physical and the spiritual are very linked so it wasn't like doctors are important but it was something to say like it says something about what we truly believe about the world and i think they called most of us of recovering materialists and i found that true for myself even though i would never have called myself a materialist um ever in my life um i acted as if the material world was all there is far more often than was congruent with what i actually believed okay did you get your mic picked up uh worked out mike i i think i did do you guys hear me i hear you yep wonderful okay all right so um i'm in the same boat as you cast i would also call myself as a uh recovering materialist in a way and i want to go back to the initial question where you um it was asked that what was the hole left from the church and all i could keep thinking about was i wanted to invert that and say maybe the church was filling multiple holes for any given individual once um right uh somebody mentioned that in one area the church was filling you know it was involved in government involved in social activities all of these things and um now that the church isn't so involved in people's lives and especially now that the internet has kind of accelerated the creation of technologies and and ideas and how to fill those holes right um the church is having an especially difficult time trying to fill all those holes it once did for people there's definitely something to be said for the church is one unifying thing that fills all those holes at the same time for any given person um but um materialism has kind of eroded the trust that the church can do that effectively or at least you know people people don't believe the base assertions of the church so therefore they think that the church can't fill those holes without having some sort of contradiction there yeah right and that the internet really ways of filling those holes have really exploded whether people know they're doing it or not yeah and people have no way of evaluating which way is better than the other yeah right where the church has this unifying it's like okay it fills everything yeah everything we have a we have a thing for every need that you spiritual need that you have whether you know it or not and well and before the internet the marketplace sure yeah yeah and and people have been i mean pastors have noted you know grazing so i do small groups at this church i do worship at this church on only the certain weeks that a certain pastor preaches or when the worship leader is there and but i i i listen to pvk and um i get i get some things from a dutch calvinist pastor who doesn't quite fit into some boxes but then i get my mass over at the orthodox church and and people are sort of but you're right that there's not a ideally religions have a a certain amount of tension and cohesion because the various aspects are are knit together at least with some thought and and some intentionality whereas people are sort of ad hoc-ing it and salad barring it and picking as they go so that's good point make for a really gross salad if you take all the things right so thank you thank you wd pilgrim great question and i hope i hope what was here was helpful we are thank you we are um nearing the end of our time here and i'll have to boy i can really see i already know that rick is going to be well we need you got to get through more questions that you hardly got through any questions and that's that's true um and you guys added more questions i will have to look at some of these questions but also give me some feedback on this way of dealing with questions again part of what i'm trying to do is experiment and we have the tradition of the youtube celebrity answering questions for the audience and you know people are oh he answered my question or he answered my question the answer was horrible or he talked for 30 minutes on the first question and didn't get to the rest of them and gave the rest short shrift so um we'll keep playing around with this but you know some really excellent questions and obviously it's more fun if you're in the room when i answer the when i address the question because you know as was the case both with teddy and uh wwv that must be west virginia maybe pilgrim when i see your face and when you flesh out the question it really helps me and when i know i mean this is just pastoral care 101 when i know you more than just i have the question the question is too thin a thing and and once even just the little fringes of of getting added to it helps me i think address you and part of why i want to address you is because there's lots of you's out there not identical not the same but the more particular i can get it the probably the better the answer and the more helpful so all right that's going to do it for today so thank you those of you who joined us here on the bridges of meaning discord and thank you those of you who are watching and i look over there because that's where our computer is for you who are watching online and contributing to the chat thank you rick and anselman for having the wrenches and moderating the chat room thank you the moderators and authorities on the bridges of meaning discord and thank you all the bridgers who are on here doing your thing and now the live stream ends right now but on the bridges of meaning discord server the after parties continue one of the beautiful things about this discord server is we can create you know any number of rooms for conversation and as i have often encouraged on the server is when you're having conversations um turn the cameras on because the degree to which we can we we have more of each other even in this virtually not alone implementation we have going here heightens the capacity for more community for more knowledge for more wisdom and you know so cassidy just by the luck of the draw was the one who was left in the little window here so there you go cassidy but you know i cassidy's been around the server for a long time she was on the channel before that she has her own channel and when we had the little west coast tour that was interrupted by covid you know i got a chance to meet cassidy when i was in tucson arizona and just the opportunity to meet someone physically just heightens the resolution on my knowledge of that person and therefore our capacity to actually um go back and forth and i you know i really appreciated um wv pilgrims fleshing out of his question because these i mean these are it some sometimes people ask oh why why do i keep mentioning grim grizz and his his little project this little channel with 600 subs because grizz is on to something in terms of the internet that that we we want to not be alone and deep inside of us we want shalom we want healing we want we want kingdom come i mean we don't want anything less and you know augustin you know our hearts are restless until our hearts find their rest in god but you know that that sounds way too god number two ish because in some ways god is when when we have god we have everything and again that sounds so cliche but it's this is this is what we're all working on so all right i i can't tell rick to end transmission i have to do it myself and last time i did this i i didn't actually stop the stream and then rick was texting me you didn't stop the stream you didn't stop the stream don't do don't do anything embarrassing you know oh i ended the stream so i'll i'll pick my nose now and you know the memesters will you know memorialize my nose picking so anyway so thank you all for joining me pardon the nose picking reference um and i will end transmission and i know now that i have to check both of these boxes so and stick around in the discord server for more conversation after the stream and
