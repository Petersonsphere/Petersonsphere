 Hi, this is Paul. The Christian Reformed Church is currently embroiled in its same-sex marriage crisis, crisis as I noted in the video I did a little while ago may result in the separation, breakup of the denomination as it is doing in the Reformed Church of America. I've gotten emails from you about the United Methodists, various other denominations. It's a difficult thing. Part of what a lot of conservative people discuss is they say well this really isn't about the issue, this is about the hermeneutic and in the case of the Christian Reformed Church the Reformed hermeneutic and we've been having a conversation on CRC Voices, which is a listserv that I participate in that focuses on the Christian Reformed Church and this is often something that comes up and of course usually the conservatives bring that up and the progressives usually bring up well what about the lives of these people and as we were going back and forth on that on CRC Voices one of the things that occurred to me is the question what is this Reformed hermeneutic for? It's a Reformed hermeneutic, a hermeneutic is basically a rule by which you should interpret scripture, but that interpretation of scripture is of course nested in a great deal of context and assumption about who are we? You know all things just go down deep pretty quickly and so the CRC conservatives note that changing the rules on something like same-sex marriage they argued this 25-30 years ago with respect to women serving as deacons, elders and pastors signals a larger slide in the church on more foundational matters and in the Christian Reformed Church a generation ago those who were advocating for women in church office, you know breathlessly promised that this wouldn't arrive at a question about homosexuality or same-sex marriage and now of course not only is the CRC there but many many people who advocate for the change of the Christian Reformed Church towards same-sex marriage argue that well it's in fact linked and I've seen that on a number of I've seen that intimated and sometimes said expressly with a number of people who are within the Christian Reformed Church and so the conservatives then basically feel betrayed and they say yep it was always about the Reformed hermeneutic and we let it slide a generation ago and so Local options and these kinds of things no Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me, but now To me what that set up is the question well what exactly are we doing? What exactly are we looking for from the Bible? and And again if you if you really push that thought You're going to discover that Hmm, it's it's not quite so obvious. Are you looking for a good life now? in The Christian Reformed Church molded by the hyper catechism you might say misery deliverance gratitude We're looking to please God with obedient grateful service but I'm also preaching through John 13 14 15 and Jesus is also pretty clear if you love me. You'll keep my commandments. Okay. What what are the commandments of Jesus? How do the commandments of Jesus relate to the commandments of Moses is the Bible sort of this bag full of rules? And if you pull out the rules and apply them to your life, then you please God. Okay, pleasing God means what exactly? Means having God hear your prayers Jesus ties that in in in John 14 and 15 And that's that's there. So is it you know, what exactly are we looking for and then you've heard me many times deconstruct The Bible went or deconstruct certain readings of the Bible when people say things like well if you do this then you'll get that now again read The last part of the book of Deuteronomy. It's pretty clear If you keep my commandments, you'll have all these things and if you don't keep my commandments You'll get all these curses covenant blessings covenant curses. Is that how the Bible works? But then of course in the same-sex marriage controversy people then bring up things like Clothing of two different cloths or eating shellfish and then they pretty much Do sort of what say Sam Harris would do but not at that level and say well if the Bible is somehow this magic answer book then It doesn't seem to work and then of course Christians come back and say no well there's ceremonial law and then there's dietary laws and Jesus put them aside and You know and the thing is if you push a lot of these things a little bit harder and a little bit further you'd be very Quickly begin to discover that it's not really necessarily a one-for-one Biblicism, but it's it's people doing theology They read the Bible and they they come up with answers and they apply those answers and the church is doing this now The skeptics again continue to press on and say yeah, but wait a minute You're doing that that process of theology is picking and choosing between chapters And so it's not directly from the Bible And so well how exactly is this Bible supposed to work and and work to what end? I mean Jesus said things like you know if you know they'll hate you like they hated me and I will sometimes remind people that well if you live Jesus way you'll probably die Jesus way and then the promise is that you'll be raised in Jesus way and No, but wait a minute I wanted a successful business and a happy family and a gratifying marriage and I wanted all of these things here and now and of course the in the first century when Jesus was doing his ministry The Pharisees wanted the Pharisees and the zealots and the Essenes wanted the Romans out the Essenes wanted a good number of all the wobbly people out too and Many you know some tolerated the Romans because and that's about the best we can do and others thought well the Romans are showing showing the way to to really live in this world and the Romans surely must have the The Romans surely must have the endorsement of the gods because the Romans are winning You know I've I've been watching the last kingdom You know as I said I really liked what Vikings better But there was this scene in the last kingdom when the Danes lose a battle and the Romans lose the The the war leader of the Danes basically says well their god is with them and then you know next season early That war leader gets baptized One of the things that I do want to get into at some point is the the question of It's its basic religion in the world where where outcomes reveal the will of the god or the gods Because that actually is is deep within this conversation now It's it's it's pushed back against in Job and it's really takes a beating with Jesus but then the resurrection comes around again and and what we have are these models and you know, we need models, but all models that we construct are of limited value and so We're dealing with all of these questions and in many ways whether I get a I get an email from someone It was very very nice email very appreciative email but he said basically, you know if you want to if you if you want to really process the question of same-sex marriage in the Christian Reformed Church what you need are same-sex attracted people from the Christian Reformed Church on your channel and that's fine with me but That we've been pretty much playing that game with with all of these decisions and having people For whom their same-sex attraction is their first-hand experience is certainly valid data but the people who Are all over the map and other ways also have valid things to say because the question is not What exactly is the question that's what this question about what is reformed hermeneutics for or you know put in your orthodox hermeneutics or roman catholic hermeneutics and and obviously the the protestant Reformation is a big player in here because in many ways the roman catholic church would say thus says the church but That's taken a beating too pretty much from the reformation so there's a lot at play here Let's let's move on to the next slide I bumped into a video so i've been kind of keeping my eye on the god is gray channel because Let's see. This will come out after the little short video about deconstructing I Keep my I try to keep my eye on different I can't keep my eye on everyone but I try to keep my eye on different voices that express different aspects of the community And so god is gray I noticed had pete ends on and pete ends some of you know exactly who pete ends is and You know, I know Who you are because we've spoken about it via email or in private conversations Peter ends was a professor of old testament at westminster east And he had a controversy over a book Um inspiration and incarnation and and actually I read that book and I really liked the book But that book stirred up a controversy at westminster east which is a seminary started by the orthodox Presbyterian church, which was a split off of the presbyterian church of the usa A conservative split off and the orthodox presbyterian church is more conservative than the christian reform church Uh, they do not allow women deacons or women elders or women pastors. They're arguably more conservative than the The presbyterian church of america. I know this is very hard for some of you to keep track of and don't bother Presbyterian church of america is tim keller's denomination Which is also in some ways more conservative than the christian reform church because the christian reform church does allow women serving in church office So pete ends wrote that book while he was on staff at westminster east and It didn't go well and he lost his job and now he's teaching at eastern college And it's been very interesting sort of following the path of pete ends in some ways He as a you know, a legitimate old testament scholar Has been kind of being the voice of progressive biblicalism, uh, I remember his conversations with rachel held evans his conversations with Just a variety of people and so and so pete ends keeps writing books about a bunch of the hot top button issues and he I didn't know that he wrote this book how the bible actually works and um in which I explain how an ancient ambiguous and diverse book Leads us to wisdom rather than answers and why that's great news In some ways the casualty of the book is the good news And i'll have to talk a little bit more about that because And this has sort of been Typical of what i've seen in this camp and and there certainly is Uh an element of this camp that's in the christian reform church Oh now the element of that camp, you know four years ago might have looked at me as perhaps even a leader of them because um, i've not been a um Rock-ribbed conservative in the christian reform church in its own little ongoing culture war But I've read a number of pete ends books and this one was actually I guess now amazon prime i'm an amazon prime member now I can Read certain books on amazon prime so I didn't even have to buy it I was just able to open it and go through it and books like these that are that are geared to a popular audience Can often be sort of had with a good skimming There there's I gotta be careful here. They're They're pitched to a broader audience. And so the book has plenty of illustrations and hey, I do that to him a preacher That's what we do and I know that's what communication demands But if you're you're just sort of trying to figure out where he's landing in the playing field Well a good skim will do it And you know again, some might hear a lot of the things that I say and say well in some ways you agree with pete ends And that's true The bible is not a magic eight ball Uh, the bible is not a rule book. Although there are rules in it The bible gives wisdom. I agree with with all of those things Um, the bible doesn't address some things like we want it to like, um, brett weinstein's known nuclear refinement the bible The way that the bible addresses many of our contemporary issues See and this is where This is a lot of what i've been Doing over the last three years. It's really easy to say the bible doesn't address many of these issues that we're wrestling with directly That is right and pete ends is right in that But that doesn't mean that we don't gain anything from the bible and pete ends would say that's right. We're supposed to gain wisdom but then when I look for Really a deep dive into the kind of wisdom we need I don't find it in here now. Maybe it's a popular book. Maybe if I Had a longer relationship with pete ends and really pressed him on things because What I tend to find is that it sort of makes the bible rather useless What do we need a reformed humanitic hermeneutic for what do we need the bible for how is the bible supposed to work? That's a very good question And I think that there are answers and in some ways my channel wrestles with those questions and Works on those answers and you do that together with me I had two randos conversations today I don't know if either of them will be published and I know a lot of you are like I I can't find a slot I know you can't it's I I just have I Can't just if I open up all the slots I I won't be able to have my day job and I won't be able to do these videos and I won't be able to Do some of the other conversations I should do so it's a balancing act. So I Open up slots almost every week So not every week and there'll be a couple weeks towards the end of the month that I won't open them up again because I've got some other things going on. So that's the way this thing goes, but The question is well, how does the Bible work? So then I listened to some of his conversation with God is gray and Basically the first 20 minutes of this video is sort of all about I don't have to self tyrannize about premarital sex or gays That's basically what it comes down to and it's a lot of people who feel that they were Tyrannized by their church and they have all this Post-traumatic tyranny built up into them and someone comes along and says no, it's it's blurry. Oh Good, it's blurry then I can do what I want. I You could have always done what you wanted Oh Yeah, but I was raised by a church that that that had well I was in our culture with you know, I was raised by a church that that that taught me in a certain way so I internalized the tyranny and And that gave me a lot of anxiety and negative emotion. Of course, Jordan Peterson and big five person I'll say well, you're probably higher in neuroticism and negative emotion, but Don't use the neuroticism thing But and and okay I get that but then the same group turns around and starts You know reforming a new self tyranny about privilege and whiteness and it's like now. Wait a minute Here's the funny thing about freedom It's selective. I mean it's it's I mean, it's it's Dear you're simply not gonna care about anything and you know, you're gonna be a thoroughgoing libertarian Well, you're gonna have to live that out and you know, I point this out to to people all the time They're like, well, I just don't think we should police sexuality really why all the hand-wringing Why all the hand-wringing about Governor Cuomo and his and his dating life and Well, no that well, okay you have new rules and That's why I turned to a website like Everyday Feminism and it's like okay all those old rules have to go but here are all the new rules and it's like That's the point you need rules. And so progressive evangelicals try to blunt reported childhood trauma by blurring things but Other things they don't see quite as so blurry and and many of the other things they don't see quite as so blurry are Surprise surprise Seemingly the product of new formation in new cultural moralities and again, I'm not Condemning them as I do that but I just want to point out that you've just switched one set of tyrannies for another and Maybe you're happier with your new set. Okay but you know that you just set up this narrative of it's You know in some ways tell it to your therapist Because that's what's going on here The world has changed and you're changing the rules and you want mommy and daddy's approval with your new rule changes and you want them to stop and Okay The far deeper questions are why are the rules changing and should the rules be changing and and what exactly are we doing with this? And you know all the really bigger questions that I tend to find my new conversation partners Are actually dealing with what I think are these deeper questions with then you know, what should gays do and what you know, what can and can't women do and Well, why where's that all coming from? And if you look around blurry lenses make for weak communities You know the church has platform At least the main line there they've been the ones blurring lines all along and it's done nothing for them as organizations it's done nothing for them as communities and so God is gray in some ways is way more successful than mainline churches and Probably has exactly their audience and an audience of evangelicals that are deconstructing. That's the platform She's your priestess I know you wanted one whether she is you know action is decision and People want to know what to do. And so if you actually look at churches Who will tell you exactly what to do? they do pretty well as communities and this observation was made a long time ago by a lot of sociologists that Basically recognize that a lot of these communities Function you have a community Because you are countercultural you need the community to maintain your belief and you seek out a community and you're committed to the community And you give money to the community and you do all of this in order to maintain the belief Now a lot of the dissatisfaction with mass media and news outlets has been well they the the the narrative to the narrative to reporting ratio is off and now partly because of Pluralism and diversity it's increasingly difficult for Mass media to sort of hold their hegemony of narrative and I think that's very much analogous to church And I thought in Jordan Peterson's question and answer, but he had a lot of good questions and answers in that video You know one of his one of his arguments about the media was well, what about social media and echo chambers and Peterson said well But what social media has also done is sort of diversify The amount of information out there what it's actually done is diversify the narratives and in many ways that that's very much What's happening in churches? Because Well people might you know, you might blur the old answers and you might blur the old the old ways that the community and what was the reformed hermeneutic for it was So the community could guide itself according to the Word of God there. I could say it that way But guide itself towards what and and what's interesting is that? Kind of the genius of that traditional approach was it guides itself towards the community come what may You know many of them hoped that God would bless the community for their obedience Which of course sets up a a lot of Soul searching when you don't seem to be getting blessings and Soul searching when you don't seem to be getting blessings and Parents who baptize their infants deal with this all the time But I don't notice that people who got baptized as teenagers deconstructed any lower levels than people who baptized that infants So they get to deal with it, too So, you know blurry community blurry lenses make weak communities or Or at least they bring the proliferation of platforms because the truth is Fact and narrative will always go together And a lot of the question is how much? How much counter narrative facts? How much dissonance can you really tolerate and not lose your narrative? Because ideally the narrative, you know, it's the whole center set bounded set Dynamic a bounded set is sort of bounded by a bunch of facts a center set is sort of the narrative But they actually move together Because well, you're you're always interpreting facts by narrative and you're always adjusting your narrative by the facts It's a little bit opponent processing. It's sort of migrating together Now I just started Tara Isabel Burton strange rights and I often listen to audiobooks if You know if I'm going to sleep because I Need something that has just the right amount of interest to draw my attention But not to it too much interest to keep me awake and this one kept me awake that's unusual because I Drive my wife crazy because if I if I actually pick the television program that we're watching Something that I'm interested in I'll invariably fall asleep to it and then she's stuck watching what I was wanted to watch And so I usually just hand her the remote Don't tell her I said that She knows I say that If she says all Paul's been talking about you in your videos and I'm in trouble kidding and What what we've been seeing and what she what she documents quite? Interestingly is sort of this buffet personal religion and it opens with this You know this this interactive role-playing Theater type thing that I had never heard of any of this stuff that was going on in New York and I guess all over the world and And she rightly I mean of course she has a degree in theology from Oxford, so you know she's she's at least well educated with respect to religion and It's You know not unlike the fact that people often go into the therapy profession because they want to heal themselves Just because someone has a divinity degree doesn't mean Yeah, that's Now maybe someone can do a response video and say Paul Paul doesn't trust his guild very much either A lot of this arises because of institutional skepticism and And usually when that happens so so now we're skeptical about what's coming from the outside Then we sort of turn inward and this secret sacred self You know we sort of look down the well and see a foggy reflection of ourselves and can't recognize ourselves and there's the revelation but we're blind to the formation and but as this goes patterns emerge and we can we can look around at other people and say I'm not sure it's divinity talking and it's probably their childhood it's the tyranny that they had from their evangelical upbringing or it's the It's the lack of structure that they had because their parents were hippies or if you actually know their parents Then you can have a higher resolution view and and and and Patterns emerge, but not me. I'm not formed by my environment. I have the truth. Everyone else is formed by their environment And these buffet personal religions are a little bit can be sort of like drinking salt water to quench your meaning crisis thirst It it in order for it to be compelling again the whole facts and narratives dynamic It's it's got to be true out there and it's got to work in the physical world and and religion is always Doing this self checking back and forth back and forth back and forth now Paul Rossi's The end of that video which was You know again, it was very interesting, but I've heard it a thousand times Thousand maybe not a thousand but a few hundred times and many of them are on this channel and especially the earlier videos a Blurry vision won't help you much in a meaning crisis and so, you know, he was an altar boy raised in the Catholic Church left it all behind and then Jordan Peterson's new psychological genus Concordism kind of said hey, maybe there's something to the Bible and well Why do you go back to a crunchy church tradition? Why do you go back to a church tradition that says? it's just all kind of data out there and you've got the Bible and you've got Shakespeare and You've got these other books and I'm not saying that's what Pete and believes I think Pete and Would give the Bible. I don't know what Pete and would think a Lot of ways the question is how privileged Do you make your Bible with respect to other books and You know, you've got vervekey and company with written are with a religion that's not a religion and so They're in many ways trying to address blurry vision and of course vervekey's project is is very focused on weeding out bullshittery and and bias and all sorts of other All sorts of other mixed signals and in some ways, you know John vervekey's really taken a very broad scientific approach to this too, you know It's it's obvious we need something that serves as religion And again as Jordan Peterson said in his religion question You're going to go out and do it and find it So you might as well do a good job with it and you know, if you go back to Jordan Peterson's conversation with Michael Shermer Peterson makes the point that most people are really bad at this. So actually you're better off if you inherit it you know, it's sort of the difference of if your company would hand you your retirement money and say well Here's your retirement money do something productive with it or as in my case there's actually a a pension fund that the pension money goes into and they're going to You know in the Christian reform church that's still well, you'll get this pension for The rest of your life no longer how no matter how long you live as long as the money's still there as opposed to here's a You know a defined benefits and or defined contributions the two sides of it Give people there if it's a divine contributions you give people their retirement money up front. Well, they're like well good I'm in charge of it. Well, how good of a money manager are you and for me in the Christian reform church it's kind of well, I'm glad that I'm glad the denomination is taking care of it for me because it probably wouldn't be a very good one So, you know upon retirement, there'll be a it's not a big pension They'll be there'll be a little pension for me and hopefully with that and Social Security and some other things will be okay so that's that's what you do and So blurry vision doesn't really help blur blur is just signal to noise and so I find this progressive evangelical approach to the Bible just blurry and Yeah, okay, it's feeling better now I get that now that pressures off in terms of oh my parents told me this about gays and women and and premarital sex and You know and you know in a letter I you know I responded to someone who who asked that question about we'll get a lot of same-sex attracted people from the CRC on your channel That's that's an element of the data But it's by no means the whole picture because in the Christian reform church, there's all sorts of changes that have happened Sabotarian practices, you know 30 40 years ago in the Christian reform church if a Christian form church family went on vacation They would pick a vacation spot where they could find a Christian reform church nearby Because they're not gonna maybe a reform church in America church, you know if push comes to shove but you know, they're they're gonna go to church on Sunday vacation or no vacation and It should be a Christian reform church That was the culture of the people now Now you can say well did they get that rule from the Bible well, that's sort of how it felt to them But this is where the whole rules thing gets complicated too because Is the Bible a book of rules? Yeah, there are rules in the Bible and if you say well There are rules in the Bible, but that's not really what the Bible is. So don't worry about the rules Well now you've just sort of taken something away from the Bible that actually You probably need because you do need rules because rules are helpful and important but then the question is well which rules and how are they to be applied and and You know to Pete ends point, you know, you look at someone like Naaman and Elisha. Well Naaman says hey, you know when I got a kneel down in the temple of Dagon to my master How's the Lord who took away my leprosy gonna heal it think about that Now again a lot of blurriness just says well, that's just kind of a story. Okay, it's just kind of a story But if the story is going to do something for me, it can't just be blurry. It needs to be crunchy and and that's the point of the resurrection of Jesus because If you just simply mythologize it you sort of mythologize it away and then it's of no use to me And this I think is is where some of the strange magic of Jonathan Peugeot comes in because and And Peugeot clearly gives mixed signals on there signals that people don't often understand I certainly had that experience with him early on rationality rules had that experience But you know his you know his his his movement has been growing strong What's with that and you know, I just did my conversation with Mark and you know I sort of located mark in the verveky camp. He says not really in the Peugeot camp Yeah, you're not going to an Orthodox Church you're not even going to Catholic Church, you know We had I love my conversation with mark and marks a fun guy to talk to I know some of you don't like him But I do I always have that with some of the people I bring on and I was telling one guy, you know I'm not gonna stop until I bring on someone on the channel who's probably gonna reliably annoy and anger a Certain demographic of my population. I mean, that's just the way it should be But I've been thinking more I've been focusing more on the question. Okay, what's going on in the Peugeot world here? Not just what's he saying and what's he thinking? But what's the world around him because again, you know with Jordan Peterson, there's the Jordan Peterson phenomenon, which is a big thing But there's the Jonathan Pizzo phenomenon too. And you know Carl who unsubscribed from the channel He's quite famous in the comment section for a good while Carl who unsubscribed from the channel, you know, it's I'm listening to Jonathan Peugeot now. It's like Because you know Carl's big complaint was too much. God number two and Okay, and Yeah, you hear a ton of God number one through Peugeot, but then you have the crying game moment with rationality rules You're not one of those Christians that actually believes in in a God up there Symbolism memes nailed that one exactly. I should play that Most people just simply really do believe that conscious being called God exists That is looking at who he sleeps with and on what position you don't have that position you from my understanding you don't even believe that there is a conscious being called God out there those people just simply really do believe that conscious being called God exists That is looking at who he sleeps with and on what position you don't have that position From my understanding you don't even believe that there is a conscious being called. God knows Wait, wait, wait, wait, I- I- I- Most people- If you haven't watched- If you do- If you're not subscribed to this channel, you're really missing out. Here's another favorite. And my pattern! Pageant! There you go! There you go. Let the meme guys get ahold of that one! Let the symbolic memes guy go. pattern pattern pattern ... Danke набה P HASOUI So you know there's- Just like 3 years ago And in some ways I asked myself well, what's going on around Jordan Peterson? Something's happening with that. You know, it still is, but you know, something's going on around Jonathan Pigeot, and it's worth looking at. Now, blurry skepticism feels like freedom if your first draft still governs. I'm always looking for language to talk about things like this. And I think with someone who has, again, these things move multi-generationally. And so someone like God is Gray, who was raised by, you know, going to church, and when she talks about her, you know, before her deconstruction, how she was, you know, she sounds like she was a, you know, evangelical Bible thumper. And then this big change, and now, of course, she's, you know, having a YouTube channel gives you all sorts of reinforcement in hers, I think hers is double the size of Pigeot's. So, you know, YouTube gives us numbers that'll give us a sense, but will she, will her impact be twice that of Pigeot's? I don't think so, because these things don't sort of work just according to the analytics. But why do people, why do religious people look for basic pattern and substitution? And that's sort of what we're talking about here, because that's really how narrative, religious narratives work. It's pattern and substitution. The genius of Pigeot is that in an age where, so again, you used to have sort of God number one and God number two fully integrated together, at least ideally in the faith, or at least not fully integrated, but somewhat integrated together. What happens in deism is that God number one sort of, there sort of was a divorce in the church over a number hundred years, and one party got God number one, but it wasn't God. It was just the impersonal world of laws of physics and such, and the other party, well, eventually, and this is quite recent, Charles Colson, born again, doubled down on God number two. But if you have God number two and not God number one, it's sort of, you sort of slip into a polytheism. So why do religious people look for basic pattern substitution? This is what religion is for, and I don't mean religion in terms of supernatural stuff and church stuff and religion-esque, like secularity, but religion worldview. It's the same way the Greeks were religious but didn't know they were. It's the same way Tara Isabel Burton notes that people are religious, but if you ask them, see, even that's changing. If you ask them, are you religious? No, but I'm spiritual. Other people, you know, ooh, I've got to, I've got to make up something brand new out of that, so I'll be religious but not spiritual, and round and round we go, and of course, I don't think anybody talks in a more compelling way about some of those dynamics as Jonathan. He's got a good way of sort of laying it down because he spots it all the time and he brings it up and he brings it out in his videos. So, yeah. Pattern recognition and substitution. In some ways, that's religion. And this is the pattern that the world represents in the story because the story's a massive compression engine, and you are an agent in the story, and somehow you go into the story and you pursue an outcome in the story. That's pretty much how religion works. That's also how technology works in many ways. That's, this is basically how people work. We, you know, we, our identities are quite malleable. And, you know, I really enjoyed this universal history video that he just put out. Boy, that was good. That was, I listened to that video and I just, I just took my phone and I drank that video down. Now the meme guys are gonna do something with that. Why? Boy, I've only begun to think about that video and it's gonna take a little while to really digest it because there's so much going on there about how we are and who we are and how we operate and what religion is and what religion is for. And they didn't talk that way directly, but that's what that video is about. Now I think about it in terms of, okay, that reformed hermeneutic, and I look at some of these people and there's one woman here pictured who she lost her husband when she had, what was it, four, five, six boys, all sons. Living right over in Patterson Prospect Park. And she was often a babysitter for me when I was a child. She and a bunch of these older women, this was during the 60s, 50s, 60s when people were moving out to the suburbs, the Dutch who had been in the New York, New Jersey area were becoming economically successful and African Americans were moving up from the South to sort of continue to work in that area. And so there was some white flight, but some of those women and her, a widow, who never remarried because she didn't want, she didn't trust any other man raising her boys. And her boys loved her, her boys would do anything for her because they know what she sacrificed so that, I'm sure she pinched pennies so they could go to Christian school. The whole nine yards, that whole package of what the Christian Reformed Church was in the 1950s and 60s. And then when her boys are out of the house, how does she spend her time? She goes down to the North Side Gospel Mission. And she pours herself into the African Americans in that community, in her own way, her and Angie Vogel, same thing. But that's what she does. And that Reformed hermeneutic, well, what was that? That was how you please God, that was how you live your life and you draw that from the Bible. And I should grab a book. So in the 1960s, the Christian Reformed Church would put out books like this by Thea Van Halsema and Reverend Richard DeRyder. And this was probably someone outlining their little scarf thing from their cadets and calvannettes, you know this, because there's entire subculture around this. And basically what books like this would do would be to tell the history. And you'd have the Bible, the church in the Old Testament, and the church from Noah to Abraham, and the church from Moses to the prophets. And the church from the prophets in the Old Testament, the place of Christ in the church. And then on to the Holy Spirit and the church. And you know, I mean, Peugeot and Richard, I forget his last name, talked about Constantine. And yeah, this is how it went. So explaining the Apostles' Creed. And you just jump from, I mean, the Christian Reformed Church has deacon and elders because you find deacons and elders in the Bible. Now there's a lot of history that came up through there, but the Christian Reformed Church is one of these denominations that, you know, it's a sort of a restorationism, pushing back against those city elites in the Netherlands. And then they immigrated to the United States. And so then you had some of that frontier ethos that Mark Knoll wrote about in a piece that I'd read a number of times. You know, the church, our church government, I mean, it just has all of this stuff here. And reading this today feels so undeconstructed. Well, here we are. This is, now of course, looking at it today says, well, it's kind of CRC and it's kind of 1950s America too, isn't it? Yeah. But, you know, they didn't want blur. You know, then of course, the Navajo mission and Johanna Wienstra in Africa. And we've got symbols here on the back. People with a solid first draft privilege can sort of surf, surf the blur. And the Bible gave people a draft from which to work with. And again, I think about Jordan Peterson's comments of Michael Shermer. I mean, that's what happens with these videos. I watch these videos and you kind of watch them through and you don't really know what parts are relevant, relevance realization. And then you're talking and, oh yeah, with Michael Shermer, oh yeah. You know, they need a draft to work from and you need a hermeneutic and you need a rule. And blurry doesn't help. You know, you've got privilege if you're gonna surf the blur. Because if you don't have that privilege and you're surfing the blur, it feels like chaos and lostness. And you're probably gonna find a place that's less blurry. And when I look at the rise and interest of the Orthodox, yeah. You know, because it's ancient and because here it is. And because it's instantiated and it's instantiated in the mosaics and the tiles and the paint of the building that you're in, if you have enough money and enough people to kind of do one. And you know, and so it's not surprising to me that you sort of have this strange amalgamation between immigrants from Eastern Europe that of course have been coming over and refugees from the meaning crisis and the blurring that's been going on for the last 20, 30 years. Blurring in order to deal with the radical changes in our society and the disruption by technology. I might do a, you know, I almost did a commentary video on the Benjamin Boyce Peugeot video. That was an excellent conversation. But I might do a conversation on Jonathan's interview on history because there's so much and what I really wanted was a Tom Holland commentary on that video. It was good. You know, and to look at these people outside, they're very proud of their North Side Gospel mission and this army surplus tent. I remember those tents. Now the tent was gone as the main church building by the time I had memory or I could at least auto, biographies my life. But you know, these people, they meant well. They had a surety. They had a confidence. And again, we might look at them as sort of naive but let's own a little bit of our privilege there, boys and girls. Sure they had their doubts, but they pressed forward and they said, well, we got our doubts, but we're gonna mean business and we're gonna do that. And it doesn't mean that they didn't continue to do the fact narrative dance. I wrote a sub stack. You know, again, I said, I've started this sub stack and you know, usually when I have a smaller thought or not enough time for a video and I just wanna get something down because again, all these videos are getting stuff down. They're all rough drafts. They're all first drafts. But you know, I was watching the Peugeot boys video and you know, had some thoughts and still might do a commentary video on that. It's so weird what I, you know, this afternoon I had a little time, thought I got a little time to do a video. You know, I feel like Mr. Incredible, you know, and early in the Incredibles when he's driving around and you know, he's heading to his wedding and he's like, I think I get a little time to, you know, to rescue this cat up in the tree and I get a little time to stop this bank robbery. For me, it's like, I get a little time to make a video. What I'm gonna make it up? What I'm gonna make it about? And then because during the course of the day I have four, five, six videos that pop into my mind thinking I wanna make a video about that. I wanna make a video about that. But I don't have an hour to sit down and talk to this machine. So maybe I'll just run to Twitter and you know, have a little three or five tweet thread and now I'm incorporating that into the sub stack. So that's sort of part of my process now. But maybe I should read some of that. Part of the ironies of evangelism is that, you know, we don't really quite know what we're doing with all of this. And for someone like Jonathan Pageot who, you know, again, when people start listening to him and they think that they, you know, doing a lot of projection on him and they do a lot of modernist projection on him and it's like, you don't understand how deeply conservative in many ways this stuff is. And you look at him and you know, he's cool. He speaks French so well and you know, he's a good looking guy and he's got art and he's nice and he's got a fun laugh. But the dude is serious. And that's why he's got a following because if he was less serious, he wouldn't. He was more blurry. He's not blurry at all. Neither is Jordan Peterson. And so, you know, when people begin to sort of figure out what this all means and entails, they get a little nervous. I'll just read some of what I had and comment on it. I've been spending three years pondering Jordan Peterson's impact on the world. Jonathan Pageot's conversation with Benjamin Boyce got me pondering Pageot's growing evangelistic influence. And my John Vervecky thoughts, that didn't make sense. It's a problem with a lot of my writing. I don't edit it and it gets screwy. You know, so this video that I did with Vervecky on why relate to a personal God or why relate to a God personally, you know, kind of ran through that argument. And at the end, John rightly says, you know, you're not making an argument about his ontology. No, I'm making an argument about what you need to do in your meaning crisis to survive. If you don't have, you know, a lot of first draft privilege, if you can't, you know, surf the blur, you need to engage with the world seriously. This is why people join cults. And, you know, John would very quickly, I mean, John's such a good conversation partner. He keeps me honest, you know, say, yeah, but you know, people will join all sorts of things. Well, fair enough. But we have to use the spirit of finesse. We engage the world with that spirit of finesse. We engage the world as if things sometimes that we know or quite likely know are not personal. We treat them as if they are because that's the right mode of relationship in order that we need. And likely, historically, Darwinianly is the most successful. Adam Frenden constantly reminds me that part of why he liked Jordan Peterson likes is because he stays on the side of the natural rather than the supernatural. And so Adam, a lot of times would say, you know, Paul, if you, and basically, if you'd give up on the God number two stuff, and that's exactly Carl's complaint. And VanderKlai doesn't give up on the God number two stuff. You know, a deep part of modernity is post-deism, arenic, and personalism. There's something for you. Post-deism, arenic, and personalism. What does that mean? It means that the universe is dead. And, you know, it's, again, people, you have this, the new atheists would talk about this overactive agency detector, but, you know, they can't suss out the truth of the universe any better than we can, those of us who see the universe as an agentic arena. God number one is arenic, and God number two is agentic. The agentic God has been thoroughly attacked in modernity. In some ways, that's the point of modernity. I think partly because we, in our quest for the monarchical vision, we slide ourselves into that slot. I have to think about that more. Now, Jonathan Peugeot uses a persuasive universal impersonal pattern. Remember, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, mushroom. Pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern. Well, a pattern is sort of a halfway house there, because it's non-threatening to talk about a pattern, because it's a pattern, and we've got terrific pattern agency detectors, and so when rationality rules, you know, here's Jonathan Peugeot talking about patterns, well, patterns are not conscious, they're natural, they just lay themselves out. The reality lays itself out. You'll hear Peugeot say that again and again and again and again, and so how are people hearing that? Well, that's comforting, but what does Jonathan really think? And he doesn't hide what he really thinks. They just hear him in a certain way, and we project on each other madly about what we want and what we need, and so his pattern sort of becomes a halfway house to God number one, and the arena has patterns. You know, modern skittishness of the arena, God number two. Oh, God number two, a conscious God, a choosing God. Oh, can't have God choose, dread Calvinists have God choosing, God sucking up all the agency and leaving none for me. That's what we fear, right? So impersonality is colonized by agency. It always is. That's why we love impersonal things, because agency by definition colonizes the impersonal and that which can be colonized. Jonathan Peugeot sort of lures them in, hey, it's just a pattern. It's just a pattern, nothing to be afraid of here. You can stand, you can watch it, you can see it in the movies, you see it here, you see it there, you see it everywhere. It's pattern, pattern, pattern, pattern. Much room. There's the psychedelics get their thing in there. But I think Peugeot knows more than people are hearing, and of course, that's what's exciting about him. You come for the patterns and you stay for the God. You come for the patterns and you stay for the church. You come for the patterns and you stay for the love. That's both where all the, you know, it's the infatuation of first falling in love ends with the exciting horror that there's a person on the other side of the projection that you've been crushing on for how long. One of my favorite titles, Rationality Rules Crying Game Moment with Jonathan Peugeot, Superthing Theism Debunked, Dum Dum Dum. And I ended that with this great piece from C.S. Lewis from, of course, his book, Miracles. Men are reluctant to pass over from the notion of an abstract and negative deity to the idea that they are the same thing. They are reluctant to pass over from the notion of an abstract and negative deity to the living God. I do not wonder. Here lies the deepest taproot of pantheism and of objection to traditional imagery. And see, again, now we're 70 years since Lewis wrote that. And so the objection to traditional imagery that, you know, we're like this giant or psychological organism. Young. Ha ha! There's this giant psychological collective organism and we have collective feelings and we're all these little nodes of it, but that's what's processing. And, you know, in the 1950s, they were still, and of course it depends where you are in a culture. We're more reactive to Christianity, but now that it's receded, it's just a little bit safe. It's, you know, as Christopher Mastro Pietro, it's the dying glow of this sun out there. It was hated not at bottom because it pictured him, capital H, as a man, but because it pictured him as a king or even a warrior. The pantheist God does nothing, demands nothing. Patterns. Well, patterns, you see, again, they're sort of in the middle here. He is there if you wish for him, like a book on a shelf. He will not pursue you. There is no danger at any time. Heaven and earth should flee away at his glance. If he were the truth, then we could really say that all the Christian images of kingship were a historical accident of which our religion ought to be cleansed. It is with a shock that we discover them to be indispensable. That's what Peugeot was doing. They're indispensable. And so, well, the reformed hermeneutic. What is indispensable? That's what we need to know because indispensable is indispensable. Should women do these things? What about divorce? What about Sabbath observance? What about finding that CRC on your family vacation? What about having to send your kids to Christian school? What about tithing? You have had a shock like that before in connection with smaller things. When the line pulls at your hand, when you're fishing, you had five kids take them out to a pond, throw the rod in and, huh, huh, I got one! How big's a fish? It's always shocking to me at life where we thought we were alone. Look out, we cry, it's alive. And therefore is the very point at which so many draw back. I would have done so myself if I could, Lewis says, and proceed no further with Christianity. An impersonal God, well and good. A subjective God of beauty, truth, and goodness inside our own heads, better still. A formless life force surging through us, a vast power which we can tap, best of all, the force. But God himself alive, pulling at the other end of the cord, perhaps approaching at an infinite speed, the hunter, king, husband. That's quite another matter. There comes a moment when the children who have been playing at burglars hush suddenly. Was that a real footstep in the hall? There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion, man's search for God, suddenly draw back, supposing we really found him, capital H. We never meant it to come to that. Worse still, suppose he has found us. Comment. Last paragraph of C.S. Lewis quote reminds me of Slavoj Žižák's commentary about why the fundamentalist is mocked. What a fool we cry, he dares to take his faith seriously. These hermeneutics change. Len Van De Zee, who's been on the channel, wrote quite a good post. He said, you know, that reformed hermeneutic didn't stop a whole bunch of other things going on. Rightly so. What do we want from that reformed hermeneutic? Well, we want everything. Well, the only way to get everything is to get God, or to have God have you, to have God have you. To have God marry you, for him to be the husband, for him to be the colonizer, for us to be the marry, for him to come at us, warrior, king, husband, lover. That's when the real fun begins.
