 Hi, this is Paul and part of having my own channel sometimes means getting to do what I want to do and this is something that I have wanted to do for a very long time. Now Rod Hugin has shown up on one of my pre-synod little things I did in my denominational work once, so some of you might recognize his face, but Rod is one of the people that if I needed to have a pastor I would want Rod to be my pastor because he has been a pastor to me. Rod and I met when we were both serving on a board together and we were both flying in from the west coast so we'd both not be able to sleep at night because of the jet lag and so we'd hang out together. Rod pastors a little church called The Village in Tucson, Arizona and again if I had to, if I lived in Tucson and I was looking for a church there's frankly only one church I would think about and that would be Rod's church because that is very much how much I think about him and how deeply I respect him, but don't tell him that because it'll just make him big and he's already too big. Yeah my head is pretty large as it is. So the reason I got Rod on is he wants me to write a little blurb for a book that he's doing and I said I would only do that in exchange for a conversation with him online so I'm paying in advance of the thing that I'm supposed to do. So Rod I am so pleased you're here today and I don't know, I don't see Rod and I have talked so much over the years it's kind of hard to know where to begin, but one of the things I wanted Rod to do was read something that he wrote on a little form called CRC Voices that I participate in and Rod often posts things like this on Voices. A number of years ago I applied to be editor of the banner which is our denomination of publication and I didn't even get an interview which probably shows the wisdom of the denomination, but I promised Rod, I said Rod if I ever become editor of the banner you will have a weekly column which is difficult because the thing comes out monthly, but I I because I think nobody I don't know anybody who communicates faith in writing better than Rod in the way that he does it because he does it through the lives through his life and the people around him so I've just I've just raised expectations terribly high Rodney so now we're about to disappoint. Yeah this is the funniest guy I've ever met. I always meet those kind of intros that's oh great this is this drivel that I write and then you're going to turn it into something. It is not drivel my friend it is not well do you have anything to say before we jump into your story about your mother's best friend? Yeah I just thank you for what you say I love to write writing is escape for me and it's a place where I can I had I had a instructor in high school my high school English teacher who later became a wonderful mentor for me in writing he he would he said write fiction because then you can write the truth and if you write non-fiction you're writing lies and I being the being the obstinate one that I am and being the contrarian that I am I said no I want to tell real stories and tell the truth so I've been trying to do that I don't always succeed but yeah I I love I love words I grew up loving words my dad discouraged me from being a writer because he said you couldn't make a living at it and so which he's right and which he's right I forgot to send me some money I don't know but it's but it is a I just love words I love to play with words I love poetry I love writing in general so and then and then in dealing with my issues and dealing with my own struggles in life writing becomes the place where I can tell the truth and so yeah well part of the reason Rod I am I really want to to whatever degree I can promote your fame I want to do so because you need to read your own audiobooks because you not only are an amazing writer you he's got a great voice for it so and a great face for radio is if you ever meet Rod see the first impression people who watch my channel then they meet me in person they always look at me and say oh you're taller than you are on YouTube well you know what Rod's a lot taller than he is if you think I'm big you've never met Rodney the six eight and the it's the 325 pounds that goes with it that's the problem but well well Rod why don't we why don't we begin with what you wrote on voices and we'll just take the conversation where it goes after that all right yeah I just wrote this um I'll read it Ruth died she was my mother's best friend and the wife of Pete who became something like a dad to us kids after our dad died back in 1969 Pete would come over most weekends and do things like fix a leaking faucet or replace a water pump on mom's 88 oldsmobile or help mom with balancing the bank book it was the stuff of everyday life Ruth would most often come with him and she and mom would chat while mom ironed clothes or mopped the kitchen floor or fixed bologna sandwiches for lunch Ruth would pitch in as needed I remember them sitting on the couch in the living room with Ruth knitting baby clothes for the latest baby at church while mom was asking for a seven letter word for whatever clue had stymied her and her latest crossword puzzle they would chatter away about the recent news from Pella, Iowa where they had both lived before moving to Phoenix or how to get grass stains out of a kid's dress pants or some convoluted story of the antics of one of the dozens of stray cats that Ruth took in throughout the years or any of a myriad of mundane day-to-day topics that crossed their minds they were also the kind of friends that could just sit in silence for long periods of time occasionally they'd get into a snip with each other and somehow they'd always work it out they loved each other she and mom were best friends a childless woman and a young widow with four orphaned kids found a deep bond and a million things to hold in common Pete and dad had been best friends back in Pella as well they were in the same class at school mom and dad Pete and Ruth good friends all around when Pete died back in 2003 I had agreed to conduct the funeral it was a very difficult thing to do I struggled with what to say and the emotions were completely raw and ever at the surface and they kept choking me up having to minister to others when I just longed to be ministered to was rough and I decided then and there that I wouldn't do a funeral like that ever again but when Ruth called a few months ago and asked if I would conduct her funeral when the time came I agreed to do it how could I say no I couldn't say no Ruth died last week on Tuesday and her brothers and sister planned the funeral for Monday they flew in from the Midwest and we arranged things over the phone and through emails I drove to Phoenix on Saturday evening to pick up my sister and brother at the airport we all slept at my son Justin's house we reminisced late into the night on Sunday we spent more time talking remembering laughing crying and telling Pete and Ruth stories I worked on my funeral sermon in little scraps of time that I found throughout the day the message I wrote was taken from one Thessalonians four verses nine through 12 where we're asked to make it our ambition to lead a quiet life to love well to work with our hands to not have to be dependent on others the verse talks about the simple peaceful quiet life that was so exemplified in Ruth of course I also wanted to include a few comments from John from James 1 verses verse 27 where James reminds us that true religion is taking care of widows and orphans Ruth did that and so did Pete no big splashy program put on some by some mega church to help widows and orphans adjust to their new realities just simple quiet behind the scenes acts of love and kindness throughout the long hard days after our dad died Ruth was a practitioner of true religion Pete as well I asked my sister Miriam if she knew why Pete and Ruth had moved to Phoenix just a few short months after our family had moved from Pella back in December of 1960 Miriam looked at me in shock and said you don't know that story obviously I didn't so she told me what mom had told her our dad was very very sick with emphysema back in 1960 and it was a rough winter in Iowa the doctors had warned him to move to a warm dry climate or he would soon be dead they doubted he would survive the winter so with the help of neighbors and friends he passed on he packed everything up and moved us to Arizona dad and mom's best friends Pete and Ruth helped send them off it was a sad day leaving the family and leaving friends lots of tears were shed a few months later Pete sold his Hudson car dealership and Russ's auto service and sales and he and Ruth packed up their earthly possessions and also moved to Phoenix Ruth told our mom that Pete had wanted them to move as soon as possible so that they could be near our family and help in case something happened to dad Pete wanted to be near us in case his best friend Ray died Pete and Ruth gave up their lives in Pella to be able to help their friends in Phoenix it's a crazy story I don't know why I had never heard it before my siblings all knew it I didn't who does that who lays down their life and livelihood for their friend but that is exactly what they did and help they did a million tiny acts of kindness and generosity throughout all those years a million simple offerings of love day after day after day faithfulness they took care of a widow and her orphaned children the end of my message I couldn't read James 127 I tried I gritted my teeth and willed myself to do it I started but it was impossible to see the words from my tears I started and stopped and started again religion that God accepts as pure and faultless is this but I couldn't finish I couldn't stop sobbing and after a long long time I could finally choke out the words to look after widows and orphans and their distress and that's what Pete and Ruth did what amazing people they were that's it you know it just you know I read that and and I just thought the truth you know and we have this Christianity has this crisis where it watches people walk away from the faith and our answer is better apologetics and smarter people and better arguments but what what Pete and Ruth did for your mother and father and for you and your siblings that is the that is so often the most powerful witness to the gospel that we have and and and I would say anyone can do it but that's not true right I you know they had no children of their own they were they were why they would do that of that act of love um and with that intentionality right I I find myself sometimes getting irritated because I have to bring somebody a meal because you know they had a baby or there was a death in the family or something and then you got oh I guess I gotta bring some food like they one little act of kindness is is sometimes hard and then to realize they did that over and over again and you know they were as much a part of our life like we don't um at the graveyard mom and dad are buried next to each other and when dad died um Pete and Ruth bought um plots at the cemetery from for dad and mom and then bought the two next to them for themselves so all four of them are are together and at the graveyard so um yeah just um that's a that's a special kind of love so no I don't think everybody can do it um I think everybody could strive to do it and I think people could um I don't know um the love of God in them is phenomenal and um so and to see that play out um so sacrificially I I think I often look at I have a church full of young people and I think what do you sacrifice what what do you submit to what do you lay down what do you give up not you know and I know when I was in that stage of life it was what can I acquire what can I get how can I succeed what um but God's kingdom is an upside down kingdom and in that upside down kingdom none of that stuff matters and what Pete and Ruth did you know I I just imagine you know I mean Billy Graham's I'm sure in heaven but he's sitting out there in the crowd somewhere and I think Ruth is probably sitting up there next to Jesus and at the banquet right I mean I really do like that like I you know we we think of the fame and we think of the and I'm not saying anything bad about Billy I admired his life but but I just see that kind of small and yeah were they sin free and no they were they had their ugly sides too and they had they had their difficulties and you know some of those um are I mean those are as real too and so I don't want to paint them as these perfect saints who who never screwed up but they their life was a life of goodness and kindness and my little sister has cerebral palsy and um and she sustained horrific operations when she was a little when she was little and and so she would be in a cast from waist to toe um both legs um for an entire summer um and after they went in and clipped muscles and did all kinds of surgeries on her and and um so we always had my sister Ruth so we'd say you know sister Ruth or the other Ruth and and um and when we talked about them and and my sister Ruth um you know was five years old and yeah people would come and they'd bring toys for her to play with and stuffed animals and things like that but Ruth and Ruth knew how much she loved kitties and so Ruth brought over some kittens that they had gotten she was like the original cat lady she always had cats that they had rescued and she would bring the kittens over and let Ruth play with them and and pet them and um just thinking like that it wasn't um she would write me notes um when I moved down here and she'd always include clippings from the newspaper or some article that she had read or and later on with emails and she'd send some link to something that she thought I would enjoy reading or would know about um so everything was individualized there was no she wouldn't send out a Christmas newsletter she would send out 50 letters each individually written for the person for the recipient uh it's crazy I she she was matter of fact we went to her house after the funeral on on Monday and in the one closet there's just boxes and boxes of envelopes and thank you cards and and no cards blank that she with envelopes so that she could continue to send them out and even um even with the advent of email and everything else and she would still send personal cards which um always light and breezy and full of information and newsy stuff and you know um and I don't know encouraging when when things were really hard planting the church and starting the church you know they would all of a sudden there you know there come this little note and hey just was thinking of you today and wondering how you're doing how's the church going and you know that kind of thing so yeah pretty amazing I love that you included that you know when her and you know when her and your mother would say get in a little snit that you know right because that's that's so important for people to know because people don't understand that they're just people I mean we say stupid things we get sideways from each other we offend each other we have soft spots in us and they would go a couple weeks without talking you know like you know I'm I'm at a roof well what did she do I you know she said this or you know she said this about me or I think she'd you know or you know Ruth would be I'm not happy with your mother oh well what did she do well she offended me by whatever and but they couldn't maintain it right you can't maintain a snit it's just not possible like it's and when you think about it they didn't have I mean other than Palo Alto growing up they didn't have a lot in common I mean how does someone who's got four orphan kids and a woman who's never and they and they weren't I think they were what seven years apart in age so it wasn't like they had exact age and stage stuff either like it was they didn't have a lot in common oh we used to laugh that they had eating disorders in common my mom was so skinny and tiny and so was Ruth and Ruth was just this health food nut and I mean and before it was fashionable and so she was always I got in a whole thing with her about honey she was telling me the benefits of honey and all the honey was the greatest thing in the world and I said well it's still a sugar right yeah because she wouldn't eat sweets and I said well I think you're eating sweets if you're eating honey I said no no no and she'd argue with me and and and finally you know and I said well yeah I get processed sugar it's better than processed sugar I'm fine with that but it's still sugar and she was like no so she would send me newspaper clippings and length the things and and and finally I said okay Ruth you win honey's great you know and then it's like she kept like for years a matter of fact probably two years ago she still sent me something about the benefits of raw honey and okay you win you know you couldn't so yeah she wasn't like I said she was quirky as all get out I mean those are the fun things about about her as well like at at the memorial service people were telling those crazy quirky side of her and I love that like that's that's who she was but yeah they would they would she'd get angry or um and the whole food thing um my friend Marv used to go over and visit them and one at you know first my mom was and he said my he says your mother would complain about Ruth not eating unless she had an eating disorder and she was anorexic and she should put on some weight and she was gonna not she wasn't doing well and he says then I go over and I visit Ruth and Ruth would say yeah Bernice is just in bad shape and she doesn't eat and she is so skinny and that dress just hangs on her she she needs to put on he says so I got them together one day I said you guys take each other out for a steak for crying out loud you know but they there was no way so yeah it was just um yeah and those are fun things well and what you know what I love about your writing rod is is exactly that is it's you just like you said earlier you did you say that before we started recording or not I don't know I think it was after we started recording about the about the telling the truth and yeah you said that after we started recording but because and even though uh Wayne ribbons who will who we will name says that uh says something about the your story the stories you tell contain a kernel of truth okay but but it is but it is and and you and I part of what we both enjoy together is we both pastor churches that I it's so funny when when people people complain I don't finish my sentences can you believe that or my thoughts uh but but Pete we both pastor churches that are full of authenticity but not the kind of authenticity people say they want well I want it to be authentic like what like Instagram no I want you know you want to see authenticity you know go to the village and you'll see authenticity probably someone in Tucson will watch this and think oh I gotta go visit that village they're gonna walk through the door they're probably gonna be horrified by what they find right right yes yes I yeah absolutely to address the kernel of truth thing um Mr. Kelly my English teacher also said the truth is not always in the facts right um and so I I hang on to that but I actually but these are really true I the other thing that I've learned is it is perception right we can all be sitting in the same room and we see things very differently I um and we hear things very differently and one of the things like hearing nuance of words and how people say things and and all that and so much of that gets lost in in writing and so it's hard to capture some of that stuff but I but I I do laugh about um because Wayne will say you know I was in the same room and it didn't happen that way and but then I think yeah because you didn't you weren't listening for the same things I was listening for and then we also often get hooked right I get hooked by um well even this story like all of a sudden I realize wow I missed out I my siblings knew this mind that pete and ruth had moved there and I think if I had known that 20 years ago or 15 years ago or whenever they found it out I I don't know would I have done something different would I have thought differently about them Pete I pete and I worked together um he he was one of my first bosses so I worked at a auto parts warehouse and he was my he got me the job matter of fact right after dad died he he said you have to go get a job because you're the man of the family now I was and so I um and my dad I was 16 when dad died so um shortly after the funeral matter of fact I wasn't yet 16 um is that right um so but anyway I went and he said you know you're gonna have to apply for the job well I never applied for a job and I didn't know what that was gonna look like and I was terrified and so he said well you know so I put on a tie and put on a good shirt and you know and went and I had to meet Dow Batson the boss and and um and I just remember going in there trembling and scared because I didn't know anything about auto parts and this was an auto parts warehouse and I didn't know what I was doing and I was you know so um and Dow said oh you're the you're the guy that Pete's talking about and I said yeah and he said okay you're hired that was my interview you clearly clearly an unjust hire bias and preference all over that hire exactly and so but then Pete and I worked together and then I went back to school and left there and went back to school and then afterwards went back and then he by that time he was a president and general man or he became president general manager and I was chief financial officer of the company so it was definitely and then we had our falling out then a falling out over the business stuff I was an elder in the church he was or we were deacons together matter of fact somebody at the funeral was just saying you used you guys used to count the money at church like nobody's business it was so incredibly fast and we were all just like wow you don't even know what they're doing um but um yeah so it's an awkward thing to not have a father um but have somebody who plays a lot of that role but not you can't play all the roles and I think that was it was hard for me it was hard to lose dad at that age and it was hard to um it was hard to see Pete in that role like um I would never have thought to call him dad or would have even and certainly not Ruth I we were talking how Pete was always in the background like he was always quietly helping um and um and Ruth was even quieter and further in the background like there was no bigness about them there was no I don't know I have a big huge voice and I have a big huge presence and so do you and um and so I can walk in a room and take it over and dominate and you know that was not them they wouldn't they couldn't have done it if they wanted to but just those quiet servants make it your ambition when I talked about that at the funeral like make it your ambition to lead a quiet life when I think of ambition I think of everything but a quiet life that that phrase has always stuck out to me in scripture like because I think of ambition I think man getting ahead and doing it right and amassing a fortune and getting the right girl getting her to marry me or whatever like I'm gonna succeed life is gonna work out really well um until it doesn't and then I'm gonna regroup and succeed I don't you know we're we're so into that so ambition I think is that I don't know it's a big deal and to see somebody like Pete who made it his ambition to see something like Ruth who made it her ambition to just be behind the scenes and not be noticed and not care and and it doesn't mean I mean like I have a million stories of of the ways in which like we did do things I Pete wanted us I think he wanted us boys to have you know fishing trips and all those things but he wasn't a fisherman and but I know they built a Glen Canyon Lake Glen Canyon dam up in Page and um and so uh Pete also like he never swore he never you know you like you never heard him say a bad word ever like not once um he'd say shoot you know that was about as close to uh uh when he got frustrated but I remember we were uh we were working at Charlie Jones Battery and Electric Company in Phoenix and I um and he said well we'd been working on mom's car week after week and we finally got it all going he says now that we got it working good why don't we go up to Page and we can see what's going on at this lake and so he's telling the guys at work yeah we're this Saturday we're gonna drive up to to Page and we're gonna take the damn tour and and Pete and everybody's shocked that he would say the word damn you know and then he's actually embarrassed so that was like the coolest thing like you got to take the damn tour and then we one time we were like he couldn't figure out what there was a squeak coming from the back of mom's car and so we're driving it around he's at um you know I got my driver's license so I'm driving the car and he's listening for so he's first he's got the window open and it only happened when we would turn right make right turns so we're just going around the block making right turns and and there's this lady she's out watering her lawn and she watches us go by several times and then the first time you know we're all sitting in the car second time we're all sitting in the car third time Pete's got the back window open and he's kind of leaning out the window and he says I think it's coming from the back wheel or somewhere by the trunk and so he's leaning out the window to try to listen then he's we we stop he tells me to stop the car he gets out gets in the trunk pulls the lid of the trunk down and he says okay drive and then we drive around and we're at the corner where this lady is out watering and he lifts the hood up I mean the trunk lid up and he leans out and he's listening by the as far out as he can listening at the wheel so for what's happening and uh guys I that lady drops the hose and goes into the water running out on the street she's searching on the couch I never wondered about the crazy neighbors I it was that kind of stuff it just they were fun and you know quiet senses and they'd laugh at themselves and I mean they you know when I tell that story they would just roar because that was and you know quiet wonderful beautiful people just scarily wonderfully beautiful and the world you know I wouldn't I don't quite want to say the world is full of them but I don't probably shouldn't say the world is lousy with them but it's I mean that you you we we meet these people we know these people they are you know that they are the saints among us but I you're so right they we we don't even notice them we don't value them we and and perhaps that's part of God's economy to to say that well it's it's Christ right I mean it's the beginning of the gospel of John the world they didn't they didn't know him too busy with the darkness to bother with the light right the other thing that I noticed about that matter of fact he taught me this he taught me a lot about investing and doing all kinds of things but he said early on he said I want to teach you how to give so that people don't know you're giving so he said did you know you can call the gas company if somebody's gas turned off you can call them and you can just pay the bill and they'll never know who paid the bill or the electric company or whatever they'll never know he said and the great thing about that is then you have to give glory to God they can't you don't get any credit for it but God does so people get all excited so he would do that like he would just um and he would go to like we went to Christian grade school and he later on I became the bookkeeper or one of the I mean it was part of one of my jobs when I went to business for myself was to keep the books for this little school and he would just come in and say here's the check for next number of dollars and I want you to apply it to the oldest balance on somebody that you're about to dismiss from the school just give it just put it on their account but it's anonymous you're not allowed to say who it's from I just blew that but um but he's not around to complain so um but that kind of thing of giving targeted giving to solve people's problems and you know after dad died we went to Christian schools the tuitions were steep we would say my mom said you know I can remember saying well you guys aren't gonna have to go to the public school because and you know leave your friends because we can't afford this and um and then we get a call from the school hey someone's paid your tuition for the year for the kids so they're in and that went all the way through high school um and my sister went away to college and I she was saying she said you know she had gotten scholarships and all the things you get she was she was the smart one in our family um and so but there was still this 400 balance or something left on her account at the end of the semester and they were after everything was paid and they you know there was a deadline for her to pay that and um and so she had mentioned to mom she said I don't know where I'm gonna get that I guess I'll have to work you know I'm she was working part-time anyway but she said I'll I'll have to see if I can work out some sort of arrangement with them and you know she went in she got a notice from the please come to the finance department and those are always terrifying letters and they said your account's paid in full and by the way next semester as well so that kind of thing you know I know it was them I you know I can't imagine it wasn't them you know but um but that because you don't know like you really don't know and so you do say thank you god because um yeah Pete used to when I started the church um every month every single month Pete would get in his car drive 125 miles to Tucson from Phoenix buy my lunch turn around drive 125 miles back just just to encourage me and he said I'm so glad we had all that kerfuffle at the uh at Charlie Jones at the end and I chose the other guy to be the chief financial or to be the next president and he says I know it got we got us into a struggle and I know I hurt you and you hurt me and then that on all that but he said I'm so glad I did it because if I hadn't you would have never started this church you would have never left and god would have never used you the way he's using you now um and that that always struck me but every single month you know here here you come and I'm buying your lunch and then later on towards the end when he couldn't drive he he got somebody else to drive him down um because you know and just a few months before he died he was still he had him as well as my dad so that was hard to watch um and you know I'm struck by you know in the gospel of John where there's you know one of my favorite stories in the gospel of John is the man born blind because I just love the way he deals with the religious leaders there and the way his parents deal with them but you know the the disciples ask Jesus who you know who sent he or his parents and Jesus gives this answer which is completely offensive well this is this is just so you know God could be glorified and you say what how does how does someone being born blind glorify God and and your story is just dripping with this because you know one thing you know God blessed you with lots of stories and all of those stories are you know are tragedy you know your father dies and your family uproots and these crazy people go to take care of you know your poor mother and her four children one of whom has a very significant illness and you who's got your own issues and and you noticed yes yes well I mean I've read your born blurry which is something we'll have to talk about at some point too not today but another day but you know all of this tragedy in your life I mean and and your life your life continues to have tragedy and I know that and you know your your son was in the hospital not you know not that long ago and wondering if he'd make it and you're you're in a church full of tragedy and there's never enough money I know that and I know the ridiculous sums of money that you get paid for that church I get supported much better by my church than you've ever been supported by your and you you know back in the days when this is some CRC inside baseball when you know they're handing out article sevens all over the place and some people decided no no more article seven so that Rodney's a evangelist and then then commissioned pastor and I mean all of these things I mean Rod you you just if someone looked at your life they'd say boy this this guy you know this guy doesn't just didn't just get one losing lottery ticket he got one after another but out of all of this you see this you see this glory that God has made and it's not in any way the kind of the kind of stuff that this world is ambitious to collect but you don't know God's grace until you desperately need it right like I was born pretty blind um almost legally blind so and they didn't know so they just thought I was not bright which there's also that um and I was you know so I was then they were going to put me in a special school but then they decided to send me to a doctor first and they discover I'm blind as a bat and so um so then well now then they put and I love the story of the blind man too but for different reasons it's like do you think that's a joy like that is not you all of a sudden you can see you're processing information you have never processed in your life like my brain blew up I had massive headaches it was so hard to use glasses those first months days weeks months years um I would rip my glasses off my face and I still do I often take when I get nervous um or scared like you go to that calm place where everything's blurry and and so you um and then then you find out you're severely add um and so you can't focus on anything in the classroom and um so they're having conversations with you about he doesn't pay attention he doesn't do his work he's do his work he's staring off into the you know out the window he's riding the tractor with his dad when he's supposed to be doing math you know and so um so you get and I didn't realize I recently to deal with my sleep disorder which I also have I I don't sleep well at all and so I went to see this specialist she's a psychiatrist psychologist um and she's a specialist her specialty is sleep disorder I just saw her last week so it's interesting to talk with her and then you know tell me your story and so you start telling the story and she's asking all these questions and you know tell her about dad dying and some of these other things and she says wow you had significant trauma in your life um and really significant trauma and I kind of bristled she says why are you upset about that and I said because I've seen trauma and I got I am a blessed man are you kidding me I've seen real trauma I've seen people that are abused and beaten and mistreated um I've seen people that are you know were shot at and stabbed and like when I think of trauma I think of the whole like what I went through is nothing compared to what they went through and then she said that's not true you know that trauma trauma is trauma but then I realized I had pete and ruth and I had family and you know I had God's love God sustains you through all those things and that's why like there are times when I get frustrated um there are times when I start to doubt God's goodness and then I go back and go look at your stupid life like look at how God's maintained you and held you cared for you and sent angels um sent loving kind godly people to yeah I lost my dad but I I've had I had other people who stepped into those roles in amazing ways and you know now I'm at the village I got all these young people and then like they they want dad advice from me and I'm going what the heck are you asking me for dad advice like
