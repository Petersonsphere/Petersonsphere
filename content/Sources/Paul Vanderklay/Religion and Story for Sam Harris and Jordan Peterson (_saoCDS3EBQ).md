 Hi, this is Paul and if you've been following my conversations, you know that Saturday and Sunday night were the big events with Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris and Some people wrote me and said do you have a do you have a recording of it? No, I don't I don't live in Vancouver I wasn't there. I don't have a recording I've read a few reddit posts about it some friends have forwarded me some some takes on it There's some stuff on Facebook on it. I do have a friend who went and he shared some thoughts with me and he was Pleased by it. He thought that it wasn't that that I wouldn't be surprised given the comments that I've made about the event In terms of what happened Jordan Peterson tweeted out that it will be eventually released But and most most of most reports are that people are pleased but it went as expected As expected and So I was this was rummaging around in my head and as you know last week I was struggling to get out a video on this on this word religion how it's clearly a trigger for the likes of Sam Harris and Matt de la hunty and and this community and And I can understand why it's a trigger It's been associated with some very large long-lived power structures that have dominated Western civilization the Roman Catholic Church is Very old very powerful institution and has been for a long time it probably hasn't been as In the in the 20th century it dramatically lost a lot of power and a number of places in the world But that doesn't mean it isn't still formidable in many ways now. I'm a Protestant so You know Protestants know a little something about the the power of the Roman Catholic Church because Protestants have been fragmented And we're all in these tiny little denominations. I'm in the Christian Reformed Church, which is about 250,000 people way back in the 1990s. They would hope there are the 1980s They thought they'd grow to 400,000 by 2000 and now we're struggling to keep 250,000 by by 2020 So the church has obviously been a dominant powerful Institution in the West and Christianity certainly has and of course Peterson has spoken on this quite extensively with respect to Nietzsche it's overthrown the West has been the focus of the last 200 years really and One of the things we should pay attention to our time frames because length is important here now Sam Harris's definition Sam Harris's definition of religion tends to include a number of things he's got problems with stories as being authoritative in our Culture and in our behavior and he'd like things to be fact and reason based He's got a problem with supernatural content. I still haven't done a video on natural versus supernatural because I think that This is an area that could be looked at with quite a bit of Benefit when we think about if I would just ask you What would something have to be for you to consider it supernatural? That conversation gets interesting pretty quickly Now implicit in a lot of this is is authoritative and sometimes Authoritarian Sam Harris's complaint is that religion tends to lead to ignorance to suffering and to Immorality dogma is a big word for Sam Harris Dogma and what he means by dogma are things that are supposed to be permanent and not allowed to change Now this is I always I always I'm always chagrined at these definitions because then you've just created a new dogma This is just the way language and people work we have fixed points and we have flexible points and we go back and forth We might call this the triumph of the secular frame or think about Charles Taylor's Book a secular age where he maps the last 500 years And so in some ways, this is the triumph of the seculars we've had a we've had a series of large and small social and political Experiments going on in the West and I want to pluck out the Oneida community I read a book a few years ago on it fascinating study and a book that sheds a lot of light onto far larger communities in the 19th and 20th century communism Which was more successful than Nazism? Science-based progressivism that's currently the dominant paradigm in the West Now now all of this is wanting to make life better. I mean very few people are saying I'm gonna go out there I want to make life worse for everyone Usually it's I want to make life better for me and those I care about and if other people it makes their life worse Well, I'll worry about that second So so most of these most of these initiatives and experiments have been trying to make life better And equality is a common goal in this and if you watch it just this morning I watched Jordan Peterson's Conversation in the Oxford I forget what it is the Oxford Commons or something like that a good conversation. I thought Peterson did well Just got a text from my wife I thought Peterson did well I Thought his answers were clear and I I think he's continuing to make progress in Articulating his position succinctly and Contextually, so that was I thought a good a good video to watch now. Let's let's talk a little bit about the Oneida community It's it was it was it's it's well known for being utopian for being liberal when it came to sex and It was a very industrious community it thrived it was communitarian. It was a communal living. It was a religious community but but the religious aspect was very much a Hybrid of you know typical 19th century late 19th century a lot of optimism about religion and Science working together to yield a great new utopia had amazing equality of the sexes women You know that the gender roles weren't terribly fixed. It was science-based It had what they considered to be a highly evolved religion according to the standards of its day it was enormously prosperous and sexual satisfaction was a high priority by all members and This book that I've got on the screen Oneida by Helen Wayland Smith who herself is a descendant of that community was just a fun insightful Profitable book to read not just if you're historically curious about this strange group of people The subtitle of the book is from free love utopia to a well-set table Because one of the interesting things about the community is that over time they had to morph and change themselves into different With with different values to match the different times and so it's it's a very interesting study on the late 19th and then into the 20th century into the Cold War period The community at its notable height Was was at that point under really a religious authoritarian rule it was a it was a dictatorship by one of the religious slash scientific gurus who Basically had unquestioned authority and and tried to govern the community that well and they were Again for a period of time very happy and very prosperous Individual liberty was tempered by communal needs one of the interesting aspects about the community was that They made they very much guarded against sticky relationships as they called them They didn't want people pairing off one to another Because and they practiced basically in the late 19th century They practiced the withdrawal method to to keep the women from having children they didn't have terribly reliable birth control and So actually what what wound up happening was a sort of a night late 19th century upstate New York utopian brave new world first the the control of sticky relationships also became an Interesting eugenics project because the leader of the community was trying to breed the the great new humanity that would Continue to to follow their teachings and would someday overtake the world Difficulties it had is it couldn't insulate itself from the broader pressures both social and economic and those kinds of pressures Eventually made the Oneida community change now if we contrast Let's say the Oneida community with communism some interesting things emerge Communism seemed relatively successful and by that I know this hold on hold on By that I mean a number of for a number of decades millions of people around the world Saw it saw it as hope for an alternative to capitalism some of the hard edges of capitalism were Were being felt by people and so communism was seen, you know quite possibly as a fair alternative and I think a lot of people today that that that glow of communism endures and we We hear it in society today if you ask many people especially on the left about communism They'll say oh, but what happened in Russia and China and Cambodia and Cuba that that wasn't that wasn't what could be We could do it better than them Despite the fact that millions of dead Millions of dead many still want to adapt and try forms of it. It's it's still a living Conversation in our midst and it's important to note that it wasn't defeated as much as simply found Unsustainable it collapsed from within and it succumbed to corruption I'm old enough to remember the fall of the communist world and I'm about Jordan Peterson's age the fall of the communist world and What it was like living during the the 70s and 80s in the Cold War and You know, I remember as a schoolboy We'd have these big debates over who is the bigger bigger army the United States or Russia? Who would win in a war and the truth was everyone would lose in a war And so then when when you know, it was a variety of things brought the fall of the Soviet Union You know pressure from Ronald Reagan With you know, the arms race upping the arms race, you know continued Continued strength of the coalition of NATO to to keep communism from spreading You know even the Korean and the via Vietnam War both which were by no means Successful by the West so communism was more or less contained and Left to complete collapse of its own of its own corruptions now, obviously the Soviet Union fell communism in China China remains a communist country, but they they clearly changed their brand of communism to a Rampant form of capitalism underneath it which again begs the question as to To what degree was communism and overlay over other layers of Chinese society? I'm not an expert in Chinese culture by any means so I won't speculate but communism again here we had a late 19th early 20th century 20th century Utopian version of how to organize human beings and it and it failed and then one of the lessons from this is that time tells The United Community in its radical form didn't last long at all It eventually changed and became a quite a successful capital capitalist corporation from which you might have silverware communism grew far Larger and lasted somewhat longer in its idealistic forms But elements were clearly at odds with some basic facts about human nature and it showed that cruel Aggregates which I would call markets were in many ways smarter than reason again the idea of central planning was that Was that you know smart people the elites were going to sit down and have all the information be able to Plan out the society and and we should remember that in the 20th century This was very much tried in the United States in the middle part of the century though The way to get out of the recession was well, we're going to work our economics We have the science and we're going to get out of it this way Well, it kind of took a second world war to break it and this in a sense This in a sense affirms some of Scheidel's Observations that you know what brings what what levels inequality well disasters war plagues all these kinds of horrible things Well, it made the United States the you know, the top dog in the world in many ways Now Peterson again in the Oxford video that just came out loves to talk about the rise of the individual and in that video he talks about the sovereign individual instead of the sacred individual or the divine individual and You know, this is what's celebrated in the West and You know there's We could have quite a bit of we could add quite a bit of nuance to this when Peterson brings this up in his complaints about collectivistic tendencies of the contemporary left, especially in the University This is the context in which he's bringing up individualism Jordan Peterson sees some of the dynamics in the rise of the of Christianity in the West But Christianity has within it a lot of subtle interchange between individual and group Jesus of course is a single man who dies for the rest of the world Arguably the most famous verse in the New Testament John 3 16 for God So loved the world that he gave his son for the world and so you've got Individual and group and they go they tend to go back and forth and So in the West you've you've both got this determined Humanism which springs out of the Judeo-Christian imago Dei and That's intention in a sense with the expressive individualism that Robert Bella I mentioned his his important book before there Robert Bella Sociologist that towards the end of the 20th century brought up individuals have individuals however have a Perspectival challenge now we're gonna get into more Sam Harris consciousness stuff See consciousness can become the tyranny of the moment and I always kind of chuckle when people are like live in the moment I'll say yeah, I see a lot of people who live in the moment I know a lot of drug addicts who live in the moment I know a lot of homeless people who live in the moment on one hand we say live in the moment But save for the future and save for eat right and exercise well, you know if you're living in the moment You're not really eating right and exercising these are kind of two parts of the mind that are working together We say live in the moment, but eat right and exercise Because obviously the the height of living in the moment is short happy cocaine dead We are short-lived creatures and this makes our rationalist capacity This compromises that ability and so we're always working on the moment and the lifetime Well, what is an individual? Well? For quite a few years now I've done a lot of thinking about this in many ways yourself the thing that you call you the thing I call me It isn't so much this body I've changed dramatically in the last 20 years I used to have a full head of dark hair and I could eat anything I wanted to and didn't gain much weight and you know I now I'm in my 50s So I have to go to the gym just to just to maintain and my hair Flew the coop and you know here I am Well, what is me is it this body is it this thing and and I think the best the best Argument in terms of the best image of what we are is in a sense a story The cells of my body change the circumstances of my life changes my ideas change my interest change And I'm in my 50s now And I think I know more than I knew when I was in my 40s And I thought then I knew more than I knew when I was in my 30s and so on and so forth and so we're Remarkably difficult moving target to try to figure out and So in some ways one of the best ways to conceive of ourselves is in fact a story We are clearly not simply our physical bodies cells change. We're highly programmable We're we're deeply influenced by whatever's in our environment, you know I've been looking at Jordan Peterson for a year now now. I've been deeply influenced by Jordan Peterson ten years ago I was spending a lot of time listening to Tim Keller I was deeply influenced by Tim Keller the decade before I was deeply influenced by someone else and before that before that and of course when I was When I was just a kid growing up. I was deeply influenced by my parents first and then my peers You know What is me and almost the best way to figure out what I am is that is that I am a story? Now is that story material now? Obviously that story has material manifestations and that story is colonizing material and changing the material world but is Am I? fundamentally Material when people are unable to maintain a cohesive story, we call it an illness I know a number of schizophrenics and it's a they have a terrible time with that many of us know people who've had Dramatic transformations in the course of their lifetime and You know, this isn't I'm not saying this is a bad thing or a good thing Augustine. There's a famous story about Augustine He obviously had a pretty dramatic religious conversion in his younger life He was a pretty active sexually a pretty active young man and he met one of his lovers and and she came up to him and he completely ignored her and She said to him Augustine it is I and she said he said yes, but it is not I in other words Augustine considered himself a new creation. This is this is deep into Christian theology and Christian Christian ideas about what and who we are because these stories impact one another and these stories change one another We've got this moment by moment consciousness. It requires a story I think in fact to experience meaning we've seen movies and read stories and heard accounts of for example people who can't form new short-term memories and and we look at these people and We pity them. Why well They can't do all of the things that we consider Meaningful they can't form long-term Fulfilling relationships so we have moment and we have memory and so moment and memory together Create story because again as we know about memory We and we think that we are just remembering in a sense We think that we are remembering the world the way it sometimes seems Sam Harris wants to say we are Experiencing the world but we know that our memories aren't aren't anywhere near that objective In fact, I like many people when my children were young We made a lot of videotape of those kids and we lived a long ways from from my wife's parents and from my parents So we've got all that videotape and sometimes it's fun to pull out and watch sometimes it's painful to pull out and watch because I have to see myself through my 50-year-old eyes looking at my 20-something or 30-something or 40-something self and Now I know some of what that self back then didn't know and I lament some of the decisions that that self made and Well, how am I to think about this experience of looking back on myself and Critiquing who I was and this is an enormously complicated thing So again, we have the question. Well, what am I? Well, I'm a story but I'm a I'm a really interesting kind of story I'm not like a story that's been that's been written down in a book like a novel it's a story that keeps changing and this gets interesting in terms of Christianity and ideas of what Christians usually term salvation because What finally does God save? It's it's also very interesting in terms of some Eastern religions where they talk about or they talk about reincarnation because You know what actually gets recycled so so in Christianity we have this theology that says well, first of all, it's we anticipate a resurrection that I'll be given a new body and As Paul says it's a spiritual body that doesn't mean immaterial. It means that it is it is a body that is Driving its life More faithfully From the Spirit of God then my rebellious self is doing now So this business about what I am what is an individual is is by no means a simple easy thing Now When we look at humanity and we look at the technological Progress that allows me to sit in here and talk at this computer and this will get uploaded to Google servers And I will colonize all your brains as I do this Someone said I should do my I should do my Scott Scott Adams. I should memeify my Scott Adams Hypnosis thing because I'm influencing you and you're inviting my influence if you're listening to me now Maybe you're inviting it to reject it or argue against me or maybe you're fighting Parts of it useful and so on and so forth Our success as a species, however, is that we've been able to construct Civilizations now we might ask well, what is a civilizations? These are extended multi-layer stories that allow us to transcend our short little lives and If you read the Bible You very quickly get the sense especially in the Old Testament The worst thing that can happen to a person is that they will be cut off That they will have no descendants for example when when Babylon invades Judea and brings the king to Babylon He first kills the king's sons in front of them and then plucks out his eyes Why that is about the worst thing you can imagine doing to someone in that culture? Hannah at the beginning of the book of Samuel is just beside Because her she's in a polygamous marriage and Penina has many sons and Hannah has offered her husband no son, but Elkanna loves Hannah the most and Elkanna basically says is not my love worth more than seven sons And she says no it isn't And people really don't understand And People read the Bible and say oh the Bible the Bible doesn't respect women There's no strong women in the Bible, and I think you don't know your Bible at all Hannah Hannah in that moment completely rejects the the the love of her husband and says you know, I need to produce sons, but then she goes on and God blesses her with a son and what does she do with that son, but she gives him up Back to God not in human sacrifice of course, but Samuel then becomes a servant of the Lord first via the tabernacle at Shiloh And then as in many ways the last judge and so civilizations are these multi layered stories that are so multidimensional but yet over time develop into language and words and memes and Monuments and statues and and Typical stories that that that mold us and shape us and and create who we are You know there's always weather and there's climate and and so what's happening in the moment is like the weather But what happens in climate is like the culture and the civilization and we both Contribute to this and receive it and it's this constant It's this constant cycle of of these large stories just accumulating and growing and there's economies and forces and all kinds of things going on in this context and and that's really what civilizations are if you listen to Yuval Harari, you know, he makes the point that that the main thing that the main Adaptation that we have that allowed us to transcend I Would say colonized genetics is in fact our capacity for story and now this is really interesting because You know Sam Harris, I'll hear him say things like well story is story is nice story is Profitable story can be useful but fundamentally it's about facts and data and I think story eats facts and data all the time We it's our again if I put up it's Peterson. It's our Hierarchies, why do we listen to Sam Harris on facts and data? It's because of where he is in the hierarchy where he's come into the culture where he's come into the story And I'm looking forward to listening to this this conversation to see if Peterson was able to push him on this a little bit because When I listen to Harris, I think I don't know I I don't I Don't know if you're taking seriously enough the way that story and data Work together now someone sent me Someone sent me a very interesting video. I didn't even know Brett had his own channel. So I subscribe to his channel I'm probably gonna listen to some more of his videos but he has this very interesting video on marriage as an evolutionary phenomenon and so here is here is Brett talking about You know all the ins and outs of you know, he's a he's a biologist, of course and so that's the that's the focus and as I listened to him, I would I was thinking of all the ways that Peterson would say yeah, but you know the Selectivity and the hierarchies You know, let's imagine Let's imagine you strip Donald Trump of money, which is a fiction of Anything that any story might afford Donald Trump and reduce him to a 70 something year old man, you'll have to strip him naked and because clothing communicates culture and You strip him naked and well, we can't have a meat Kentucky fried chicken because there's too much culture in that But anyway, you get my point would he be able to be president of the United States would he be able to Be a third time married Often, you know straying husband would he be able to again? He has no money money is money is story That's what money is money is this this contract that goes from one generation to the next it's this ongoing story and you can see this criticized if you watch something like The Walking Dead where the the the money story breaks down and gold isn't worth much what's worth a lot food and guns and You don't have to be an expert in anthropology to Recognize the story and understand why things slide the way they slide But now here's here's Brett talking about very interesting video on marriage and and a number of things But you know, basically it's the software stupid and what what this really suggests is that yes pair bonding is Valuable in many circumstances and the universe keeps telling us that by producing it in different taxa that aren't related to each other Even just just notice how often story comes into How we talk about science the universe tells us Well, if that's not metaphorical, I don't know what is and marriage is this Elaboration of these pair bonds in the context of a creature that picks up most of what it is behaviorally as a software update after it's born and so the idea of parents who have this repository of humanness that they carry around in their minds rather than their genomes and then they pass on to offspring in a way that can be Augmented and modified for changes in circumstance or new discoveries. That is an amazingly powerful phenomenon And it is not in any way incidental Human beings are all about the software monogamous pair bonds that raise offspring are all about transmitting that software to the next generation and To parents raising children together is the ideal way for that to work Yeah He doesn't get into some of the more doesn't get into some of the more Controversial aspects of a statement like that, but This is who we are and it's it's all together You cannot have a human child being raised Not human I mean we without our touch They fall apart. They need our stories. They they need what comes from parents children need parents without a civilization without a story civilizations crumble this This news hour I like to watch Shields and Brooks and listen to their commentary Brooks is making the point that part of what's happening in our culture is we had a dominant story in the culture and Now we have a different story in the culture or there's we're in between stories And so all of this chaos that's currently happening in our culture now is because we're we're in a sense trying to We're dealing with the The handoff of stories and the handoff isn't going well And what does that mean now according to Harris here, we're supposed to navigate by reason Part of my skepticism with this is that right and wrong and Jonathan Haidt demonstrates this over and over again right and wrong are far more intuitive That rider on the elephant is very post-hoc and if you talk to people they'll they'll very quickly say well it just feels right And it feels wrong and if you look at the work of Christian Smith and his soul searching and his books where he was interviewing hundreds and hundreds of Teenagers to find out their religious their moral their ideas This is this is the kind of thing this is the kind of thing that that he noted It's interesting also that that when I talk to People more on the same harris Side of things, you know consciousness and the time problem. Well, we've got moment by moment Consistency is very hard for us as human beings because we we do live in the moment So we're dependent on memory and we're dependent on the memory of the human being For us as human beings because we we do live in the moment so we're dependent on memory So we've got this this interchange continually going back between moment and memory and moment and memory And it feels like reason will guide us But memory is dicey and and even the way we talk about it feels like reason will guide us Well, how do we know reason will guide us and again scott adams wants to talk about predictability, but that post-hoc rider You know predictability in in how many things and how close now if you have a fairly binary, you know Who's going to win the election trump or? Or clinton. Well, you got a 50 50 shot at it, but you know Predicting other things is notoriously difficult predicting meaningful things is notoriously difficult for us But to give you an idea of just how chaotic this world is so individual rationalizations Accumulate in stories and the story feeds back into memory and reason and then again this is part of the this is part of What they have looked at in terms of memory and how memories form the more times we revisit the memory the more re-editing we do in that memory and In what ways are we redoing that memory Well, we are usually redoing that memory along the lines of the narrative or the story That we would like to believe of ourselves. And so this is part of the reason human beings are Are Are not very good at being objective. We're not very good at relaying history But we're we're the best we've got and we're the audience for what we've got I was just and so then then when it comes to One of the things that that I hear often when I listen to like Sam Harris Just just or Brett Weinstein for that matter. Listen how many times they say better or worse? And the difficulty you have is better or worse on what standard? So there was a very interesting article that was in the Guardian about too smart too successful Mongolia's superwomen struggle to find husbands And so you had a whole bunch of ngo's after the the collapse of communism in Mongolia you had a whole bunch of ngo's that were very concerned about the Education of women and so there are a number of women who are very well educated And what they discover is that well, they're they're aren't suitable mates. Well, why aren't they're suitable mates isn't And How do women choose suitable mates? They want suitable mates chosen for their world and we find this again and again in the stories that we have We're going to improve something so we weigh in with our rationality because we think we have a pretty Clear idea of that which is better and that which is worse And so then we weighed in and start tinkering and what we discover is that well, there's all kinds of Consequences I didn't understand and again in Peterson's Oxford Interview that he just did he made the made the point that if things are 85% optimal, let's say To get it 5 better is very very difficult, but it's very easy to get it worse. And so Part of what we have going on right now in our society is that there is so much technological disruption There is so much there are so many new things For us in our history on this planet The population is large technology is new the pill. We have no idea how that's going to change things So so you've got situations like you have here in mongolia where these women are Can't find husbands. Well, what about japan where they're not getting married and the government is panicking Why won't why can't we do what humanity has always done in terms of Let's have pair bonding and how let's have them produce children and let's put them forward Not too long ago. They they tried the kabut system in israel and having children raised in communes And again, I started out talking about the onida community where they were practicing you know where they were trying to genetically engineer by The the leader of the community they were doing eugenics to try and To try and create the best human beings they could This is the kind of stuff we do and the truth is We monkey around in things that that we don't really know what we're doing But we think we know that what we're doing until we discover well, we've done something that we we didn't anticipate I also this read a very interesting article in the atlantic on the mars simulation and There's a very interesting story about how you know, how hard should it be for four people to live a semi-isolated? life in In the hills over hawaii. Well, it's it's hard if they don't want to break The script or they they don't want to break the fantasy of that they're on mars Which is what the whole experiment is about and this article talks about Just how hard it is. There's so much we're dependent on that. We are simply not Conscious of there's so much we assume that we simply are not aware of one of the easiest ways to To figure this out is to do your own simulation Why don't you pick up stakes and move to another city or better yet to another country where? your language the language that you grew up on isn't spoken and just begin to learn what it means to be an alien what it means to not know anything and Just see how much We simply assume within our own cultural bubbles and now again, where are we going with this? We have the question of story or facts, okay, simplistic simplistic dualism well Story is just through through through through through through all the way down to the bottom usually in ways We are simply not conscious of To live as a human being in this world is to be a participant in normal genocide Now what I mean by general genocide All of us die 100 by the age of 100 100 100 years from now, I'll most certainly be dead and Probably everyone listening to this video. Will this video be available 100 years from now? We have no idea Every generation dies taking with it what it learned when you think about The cost of this I mean we we we pause when a celebrity dies and we think We will no longer have the fruit of what this person had contributed to our culture, whether it be writing or music or stagecraft or Whatever. We will no longer have their experience and we recognize this in a family when my father died Five years ago and my aunt died A number of months ago. We realized how much of the family story is just lost And now I talked about this a little bit in my Sunday school class I did Sunday on on second john on the salutation to second john and you might say well, how could you spend an hour on just? Two john three. Well, if you look at all these words that are in there, they're huge words, but we talked about the fact that well All of this knowledge that my father and my aunt took with them now most of you might say well, that's not Important knowledge because that's knowledge specific to my family to my heritage to our history But it is knowledge that is gone because without those people that were remembering it the number of sources written sources that are available for just ordinary people like my My grandparents and my great-grandparents and the stories that were handed down Stuff is just it's just gone. It's this it's this genocide that happens every day in our world, we always have a transmission problem partly because of Interest so maybe my father or my aunt were interested in some things but not in other things the things they were not interested in gone and and so again if you think about reality as You know this this near infinite Accumulation of facts within which I sit I even take in just this tiny little portion of it And now we're going to talk about right and wrong and and the problems just get a whole lot worse And and and what we can't escape it seems when we talk about right and wrong is this monarchical vision that well This is right And this is wrong and now we try nuance well, it's right in this situation and wrong in this situation but if you push us enough we will say things like well What adolf hitler did and what the communist nations did they were wrong? Now we'd say they're wrong But but we're always arriving at this and and it's who what when where? and then you have the the horrendous question that Materialists have to face is that does it matter? Given the normal genocide does it matter? The details that my grandmother took to the grave with her or my father took to the grave now Most of you listening to this won't matter at all. You didn't know these people. They're not a part of your family It's just gone and and who cares? Well, it matters to me. Well, if it matters to me, does it matter? And so and so then we have right and wrong and we have right for us wins over Right for me Well, why because us is stronger is way stronger than me So now suddenly we have a collectivist filter that says well there's it has to be right for all of us And again, this gets into jordan peterson and piaget now we say well We have to be right for all of us All of us and again, this gets into jordan peterson and piaget now we say well Not only via violence, but also because we are riders on elephants and the elephants are deeply social human beings are deeply social animals and One of the worst things you can do is lock someone up in solitary confinement I just noticed a trailer for papillon. I remember reading this book in my youth I think it was steve mcqueen was in the old movie papillon and and they're gonna re-release it. Well, this is the prison colonies in french guiana where they mastered solitary and so much of that book is this Individual just trying to keep their sanity being all by themselves What does that say about us well we need each other and in fact This life this thing that I call me which is very much a story It must be intertwined with other people's stories and I find meaning intertwined with other people's stories And I find purpose intertwined with other people's stories and while we look around our world and we say Oh life is so much better now because we have antibiotics and we have the internet and we have Entertainment and amusements. Well read bowling alone We're also lonely Well, why are we lonely? Well Do we are we lacking are we lacking people to be with the world has never been more crowded? Well, why do we push each other away? Well read the beginning of c.s lewis's the great divorce where hell is a place you can have everything you want and you go into this dark city and You realize that it's just street after street house after house and most of the houses are empty Why because people are building themselves new houses. Well, where were they building themselves new houses? Further out into the suburbs to get away from their neighbors. And so here we are Our life is a story We're riders on elephants. We need each other greatly, but we can't stand each other And we recognize this all the time when it comes to marriage you you stand up and you say You know, i'll love you to the day I die and just a handful of years later You'll think i'll do anything even kill myself to get away from this person This happens all the time. Well What a strange thing that is what strange creatures we are yeah I I don't find a lot of Understanding this understanding about what we are within the description of this materialist fact Universe we're supposed to be living in So the individual has meaning Agreement or contrast within the group, you know Some people derive their meaning by being the enemy of someone Some people derive their meaning about being within the tribe of someone of course central to a lot of jordan peterson's conversations Is the tribalism? So history Is in many ways story evolution history is the story of civilizations competing and and um It's really more stories competing ideas have us we don't have ideas stories have us Um, and the stories we have are often serving the stories that have us You know, so what what we had in this world was, you know wars in many ways or were civilizations of competing stories Communism wasn't really defeated militarily nuclear weapons made that kind of warfare obsolete And if you don't believe me, it's something that of course north korea figured out a number of years ago Story war is the way civilizations compete Okay, and you can see this with let's say the greeks and the romans the romans the romans Conquered the greeks but the greeks colonized The romans now if you go back and you look at my last video about truth Maybe that'll be another example where you can see my point about truth and colonization rome conquers greece Or did greece conquer rome? well roman armies took charge roman armies took control well What happened in then let's say after the fall of the roman empire in the transition? to the Medieval period in europe the barbarians came in to conquer rome But guess what? What do all those barbarians for centuries call themselves? Well, they're the holy roman empire Well, well what happened? Well First rome tried to conquer christianity roman soldiers crucified jesus, but eventually christianity colonized rome and and then this amalgam of roman christianity That came out of the late roman empire colonized the barbarians who with their swords and their horses and their spears defeated the troops of The de facto roman empire Or whoever was pretending to be the empire whoever was pretending to be the emperor now these weren't genetically These weren't genetically Italians as we would call them to get again all these labels get slippery but again, if you see history what you begin to see is that That which conquers is not necessarily what you would imagine in other words stories seem to conquer All of the things that we imagine are actually doing the conquering and and in a sense we saw this with the The second iraq war where the u.s. Could the u.s. Roll into iraq sure and supposedly what the bush administration told us is that this invasion was to yield a bright and shining A bright and shining example of democracy in iraq. Did it? No Not at all The the the sunnis and the shias continued their war and so now again we see this large overlay of That was we see this large overlay that the post the end of the ottoman empire and the end of the first world war Redistributed the the middle east with jordan and lebanon and you know 1948 you've got israel and iraq and and turkey and well, but there's the kurds up there who don't have a homeland and so History is this amazingly complicated Story competition civilization competition between these stories and and whereas we might say that That western culture continues to dominate and this in fact was what motivated al-qaeda They they originally started attacking american targets because american troops were in were in saudi arabia and they didn't want the The infidels, you know having their military bases within the holy land but overall globally they were also trying to resist well baywatch and american What was considered corrupting influences? On their culture this wasn't in in that many ways different from let's say what the pharisees in jesus day Were trying to resist in terms of greco-roman influence in Their holy land and so, you know history is the the story of these competing stories and And all the different clients that these stories have now when you look at it this way and for example, you look at a Something that I deal with on a on a regular basis Which is the story of the bible and you begin to read the old testament you begin to understand that You know whereas in the ancient near east these little Tribal nations and then even on scaling up into empires imagined themselves to be the clients of the gods Okay, but isn't that just clients of stories? Think about that so Story war is the way civilizations compete the story verse governs everything At least everything that we know and competing stories try to outflank each other So as competing stories try to outflank each other things get archetypal fast if you want to prioritize a secular reading Well in polytheism gods were proxies for the the civilizations were actually proxies for For the gods and their values and but polytheism begets henotheism when when some gods conquer other gods and henotheism Begets monotheism and he'd say well, well, how can you know this i'd say well This is all written in the book that is in public domain and is the most translated the most studied book in all of human history I was doing my class on Ezekiel and you can find it in my church channel if you want to sit down and listen to I don't know 30 some 30 some episodes of the class of basically the story of ezekiel Is the process of the hebrew prophets obviously within their religious context trying to Part of the difficulty of longer videos is just have more interruptions and then try to keep my train of thought through them What's interesting if you look at the world through let's say the the lens of something like jarrod diamond where you see well Human civilization is is kind of a one long train and and whereas branches Yes, but they they they come back and forth into the train so the those who came over the land the Bering Strait land bridge get isolated in the americas and they don't have the The animals that the the animals for domestication. They don't get the diseases. They establish their own civilizations Jonathan height had a very interesting had a very interesting piece on the skulls of the of the aztecs and the um the massive scale of of human sacrifice in the aztec empire and Yeah, it's a it's a crazy thing human history is And 1493 makes some of the same points and then somehow the world gets stuck back together with columbus And so where there's a normal genocide all the time There's there's in a sense a one world war that's going on all the time between between all of these stories And story war is perpetual and it governs life and death and sometimes we kill each other um in fast obvious ways, but the ultimate always is in is in play and Again, do we use the word religion for this? There was an interesting article that was written a couple of years ago in slate or one year ago I guess in slate star codex how the how the west was won where he Scott alexander let's go up to the top two years ago Oh, is this the article I was looking at Yeah, I think it was so so a couple of years ago when he read uh, he read a post on How traditionalists underestimate the western civilization? and Now this obviously has a lot to do with jordan peterson's Anxiety about the state of western civilization given what's going on and so but so he begins to talk about universal culture because you you tend to have this colonization happening so Rome conquers greece, but in a sense greece conquered rome and the barbarians conquered rome But in a sense roman christianity Conquers the barbarians So i'll just i'll just read some of this I'm pretty sure there was at one point such a thing as western civilization I think it involved things like dancing around maypoles and copying latin manuscripts at some point thor might have been involved That civilization is dead. It's something It summoned an empty entity from beyond the void which devoured its summoner and is proceeding to eat the rest of the world There might be some nicha behind that an analogy naturopaths Like to use the term western medicine to refer to evidence-based medicine of drugs and surgeries You would get at your local hospital. They contrast this with traditional chinese medicine or hyurvedic I assume that's indian medicine Which it has somewhat replaced apparently a symptom of the westernization of chinese and indian societies But western medicine is just medicine that works It happens to be western because the west had a technological head start and so discovered most of the medicine that works That works first, but there's nothing culturally western about it There's nothing christian or greco-roman about using penicillin to deal with a bacterial infection. So perhaps points for sam harris and you know in lowering the the the tint of christianity in anything that happens in the west The question of course then comes around back, but would this have been developed if it had not been for christianity So western medicine replaced the traditional medicine of europe Hippocrates for humors before it started threatening the traditional medicine of china or india So-called western medicine is an inhuman is an inhuman perfect construct from beyond the void summoned by westerners Which ate traditional western medicine first and is now proceeding to eat the rest of the world Western culture is no more related to the geographical west than western medicine People who complain about western culture taking over their country always manage to bring up coca cola But in what sense is coca cola culturally western? It's an ethiopian bean with mixed with a columbian leaf mixed with carbonated water and lots and lots of sugar sugar comes from Indonesia, I don't remember An american was the first person to discover that this combination tasted really good Our technological economic head start ensured that but in a world where america never existed Eventually some japanese or arabian chemists would have found that sugar-filled fizzy drinks were really tasty It was a discovery waiting to be plucked out of the void like penicillin America summoned it but did not create it If western medicine is just medicine that works soda pop is just refreshment that works and now I'm reading this but as i'm reading this you can probably sense Well, yes, and no yes, and no yes, and no as we read through this there scott scott alexander is making his point that there's something deep and There's something deep and built in from the bottom that is giving all of this stuff energy and you hear that and brett winestein And you hear that in jordan peterson, but but there's also something incidental and And storified it was the story of american corporations which were gotten from the britains which were gotten from the the The dutch it's it's these stories that have come through and it's not just the components of the of the carmenated water and the sugar and And the bit from ethiopia and the bit from columbia It's it's what brought this together in terms of science But also in terms of economics and you know, it's all of these things and so when we talk about story it's this it's this almost inconceivably Intellects thing that's moving through the world The same is true of more intellectual products Kaplan notes that foreigners consume western gender norms But these certainly aren't gender norms that would have been recognized by cicero st. Augustine Henry the eighth or even voltaire their gender norms that sprung up in the aftermath of the industrial revolution And its turbulent intermixing of the domestic and public economies they arose because they worked We've got pragmatism in there now, too The west was the first reason to colonize and realize that these were gender norms that worked for industrial societies And as china and arabia industrialized they're going to find the same thing a lot of news accounts this week of women driving in saudi arabia Kaplan writes a big part of the west's strength I hasten to add is its openness to awesomeness When encountered when encounters competing cultures it gleefully identifies competitors best traits then adopts them as its own cultural appropriation By the time western culture commands the globe it will have appropriated the best features of asian and islamic cultures Certainly, he's pointing at a real phenomenon Sushi has spread almost as rapidly as coke, but in what sense has sushi been westernized? Yes, europe has adopted sushi, but so has china and india and africa Sushi is another refreshment that works a crack in the narrative of what's going on in westernization In any meaningful sense Here's what I think is going on. Maybe every culture Is the grad is the gradual accumulation of useful environmental? Adaptations combined with random mimetic drift But this is usually a gradual process with plenty of room for everyone to adjust and local peculiarities to seep in The industrial revelation caused such rapid change that the process became qualitatively different a frantic search for better adaptations To an environment that was itself changing almost as fast as people could understand it The industrial revelation Revolution also changed the way culture was spatially distributed When the fastest mode of transportation was the horse and the postal system is frequently ambushed by the huns Almost all culture is local culture And again to bring up amusing ourselves to death Postman again and again goes into the railroad The telegraph the photograph the newspaper television radio Television his day cable television and of course by the internet today And rapid communication even at the level of a good postal service And the and the equation begins to change in the 17th century philosophers were remarking in latin the universal language About how d'ecart from french had more in common with Leibniz from germany than either of them did with the average frenchman or german Nowadays, I certainly have more in common with the With his blog readers in finland than I do with my next-door neighbor whom i've never met improved trade and communication networks Created a rapid flow of ideas from one big commercial center to another things that worked western medicine coca-cola Egalitarian gender norms sushi spread along the trade networks and started to out-compete things that didn't It happened in the west first, but not only but not in any kind of black and white way People were inducted into the universal culture as proportion to their participation in global trade Shanghai was infected before a west carry Dubai is further gone than alabama the great financial capitals became a single cultural region in the same way that england or france had been a cultural region in the olden times Gradually converging on more and more ideas that worked in their new economic situation and again You can see this kind of thing happening in the american political discourse Let me say again that this is universal culture in some senses scott Alexander here is is picking up the baton from jared diamond This is universal culture though. It started in the west It was western only in the most cosmetic ways if china or the caliphate had industrialized first They would have been the ones who developed it and it would have been much the same now We might ask why it was western europe that industrialized first And we're going to get more into these ideas the new sodas and medicines and gender norms were invented If the new sodas and medicines and gender norms invented in beijing or baghdad would have spread throughout the world And they would have looked very familiar the best way to industrialize is the best The best way to industrialize is the best way to industrialize and again That's a simplification for the sake of argument, but That's a simplification for the sake of argument, but This again gets very much into the notion of colonization And and what we might ask scott alexander in the process of this is okay. Well, are we starting to find truth? And he goes on it's a it's it's well worth it's well worth reading Reading And he starts talks about strong culture and weak culture And and how the combat between these cultures happen and how this goes around the world It's again, it's it's well worth reading Takeaways Again back to religion It's a word that seems to give sam harris and matt dilahunty rashes Seems to make them, you know want to scratch and cough and and you know have Fits well, you need a common word big enough to talk on this level now. You can use culture scott alexander was Maybe culture works, but but culture lacks the aspect jordan peterson really uses religion world view Is a word that's been around a while, but it's always a story And and even the even the experience of of coca cola and what you find in marketing and branding is Coke adds life. I'd like to teach the world to sing Coke is it we're a pepsi generation even sugary soft drinks get transformed into story so that They can they can have meaning in this I did a a funeral for a friend and And one of the one of the things that his daughter Just remembered he and his daughter used to go to the movies and as he would always buy his daughter this big old cup of soda and so Coke for her just had this sense. It was into her story. It was into the western story It was it was in a sense into the world Story is how we experience our lives and even the the things as incidental as a sugary soft drink Become incorporated into these stories. It's it's how to link the moments not unlike how we link tweets all to make sense We had eric weinstein talking about the intellectual dark web as an alternative Sense making well, what's going on with the intellectual dark web? They are trying to compete with the dominant story That's everything that jordan peterson is doing and the reason that this picks up resonance and catches fire Is that there are elements of it in the broader story war? Which is the culture war going on in the west, but our stories are all nested and our stories compete now Sam harris's pleasing consciousness Um doesn't work for anyone Doesn't work for anyone who matters and and even for sam harris I mean that's a over perhaps an oversimplification of what he's trying to say Because of course you can cocaine yourself to death and and sam harris suffers In order to make trips to do meaningful things to debate jordan peterson to write books to sustain his marriage to Sustain his daughters to save money for his future There's nothing particularly fun in most of those things, but he is doing those things. Why? Well, they're part of the story now. You'd say well, it's not religion. Well, it's not far from it Meaning trump's pleasing consciousness and I think this is one of the reasons peterson gets it right is that that meaning we will sacrifice We will we will embrace suffering for the sake of conscious of of meaning and And we will we will eagerly grab meaning with suffering then live without meaning And pleasure and we see this worked out in the west right now all the time And this is part of the reason why jordan peterson is having such a big impact on people Saying I need more meaning in my life and how this translates into I need more story in my life Story is the conveyor for all of this And again, if there's no story I don't think you're going to have meaning and I also don't think you're really going to have right or wrong Because right or wrong almost always implies a telos a purpose and so meaning and morality go together easily and this posture of viewing reality Once we weighed in with judgment we storify it And competing stories just keep getting larger moments beget lifetimes lifetimes beget families clans and tribes tribes beget nations Nations beget empires and civilizations civilizations beget gods gods beget God and eternity god begets science and and is nature right that that you know That western civilization kills god nature begets supernature the the problem That peterson often points out and that one of my friends watching this said peterson didn't make the point Didn't make the pointer didn't make the point clear enough in vancouver was that That When people become more rational it doesn't mean they get less storified in fact The only way to understand the energy and determination and passion as c.s. Lewis says um CS Lewis says in miracles that that that these men enter the fray for their tribe for their Their atheist tribe is Story and so when they enter the fray they enter the story and so it's really hard to say Well, I don't think story is very important. Well, then why are you spending your time? Suffering well because I enjoy it. Well, why do you enjoy it because you find it meaningful. Well, there's no meaning without story I Have to be honest about our storied nature if you don't like some words you can pick others philosophy have been doing this the whole time It's the nature of the evolution of language, but story lurks behind everything named or unnamed The percentage of the population however that prefers abstractions that will watch my videos or or pay good money to watch jordan peterson And can manage abstractions is a minority And this might indulge some of us in pride and to elitism But but be careful because there isn't any demonstration that this level of abstraction will necessarily In a darwinian sense improve the prospect of your tribe um Abstractions keep getting storified You almost can't write about a book with abstractions without turning it into stories for even your other abstraction loving people to understand Watch the jordan peterson Um sam harris fandoms talk about who won. Oh winning is about this The bulk of the herd will continue to major in stories. They will watch lord of the rings They will watch star wars unless star wars continues to Continues to kill themselves. Um, there's a perpetual struggle between individuals and the herd these things continue I just in fact saw solo last night with my wife and You know generally enjoyed the movie. It was it was fun to fun to watch the thing But you know there again at the end comes this comes this storyline. It's like oh all the reasons All the reasons christian movies are so often so bad star wars is following the Evangelical christian movie script and they're going to do it to their own destruction it appears You know, we have these oppressed enslaved victims who use power to rise up and take What they demand Take what is owed them take what they deserve and then you don't start into this very deeply and already you're knocking at the door of this objective standard, but this objective standard you cannot Appropriate without it being appropriated into story and this is exactly the difficulty that sam harris and the The materialist have in terms of as thomas nago keeps saying incorporating the mind Into the material world into the physical layer as I would call it And and this is this is publicly in a way that is publicly knowable. So Okay, you've got these young and oppressed slave are they're oppressed peterson says it again i'm oppressed you're oppressed Everyone's oppressed throughout history If you find you cannot help but find ways you have been oppressed In fact, your mind is linked to being very sensitive to this and if you feel slighted even in a relationship You will feel it and you will object and you will feel wronged not subjectively wronged But publicly wronged and objectively wronged and again, this is why I have doubts about This is why I have doubts about materialists because they don't seem to they seem to feel themselves wronged as much as Any storified religion person does it's publicly knowable. Um, they're looking for a way that's publicly knowable and that's obtainable But but how are these young oppressed? People going to in fact make the world right well Listen to the who? We won't get fooled again. If you've too young to know this song Look it up on youtube and listen to it with the lyrics. It's the story of humanity So then what is religion it's just the stories with the supernatural in some ways practically now I'm taking this from below as you might have gathered I'm pulling all of my christian Maybe not all of my christian punches, but i'm pulling a lot of my christian punches religion in many ways is a ulysses contract It's odysseus and I got it wrong the first time I made this illustration in a video. It's odysseus telling his his um compadres strap me to the mast because I want to hear the sirens But all of you are going to have your ears plugged in a sense Because we live in the moment Because we live in the moment because we are such bad judges because we need each other In fact in order to make judgment what what religion does is give? Our ancestors a say in our in our decision-making process now you might say well I don't need religion to do that. I can read history and I can read philosophy and I would recommend that you do these things But religion tends to do it in a more disciplined way and these are exactly the ways that Sam harris is objecting to in his complaints of dogma and I've made the point before in other videos that His realization of dogma. I don't think is exactly how it plays out because del honte says religions don't change and I think If you visit a church in 2018 in North America and you go into a time machine and you visit a church in medieval europe and then you visit a church and Um, you visit the let's say the axe two church in Jerusalem. You are going to have three very different Experiences and you will notice that religion is changing all along. Well, how is it changing? Well, it's always updating Well, you might say but there's drags and you know, that's exactly right You have the same economy you tend to have people who are Temperamentally open you have people who are temperamentally conservative and they're having conversations, but what they are doing is having conversations Within a in a sense a controlled environment. And if you look at my sola scriptura video What the buy how the bible functions is is hopefully keeping things together And and keeping people more or less on the same page I had I had two emails this weekend from from a couple of my the people who i've been having ongoing Conversations with since i've been doing these videos that had that had bumped into that had bumped into You know One joined a religious chat group and another one was thinking about church and they began to realize Oh my goodness. These churches are these Isolated little communities that have so little connection to the bigger outside world Well, yes and no different churches have different connections to the outside world and part of the religion is Modulating those kinds of connections. So for example orthodox are very buffered roman catholic Perhaps a little less less buffered and protestants are ready to change everything You know because they've always got their Nascent insecurities about keeping up with the world partly because they've got their Post-millennial mindset at least some of them and and the democratic party just seems to be evolving according to the the kingdom of heaven According to the kingdom of heaven faster than the church can and so if you read mainline liberal blogs They're always complaining about how behind their mainline liberal churches compared to the world and a lot of people Apparently have been reading their mail and agreed with them and so given up on church and just joined join the pepsi movement I got everybody wanting to say something to me My wife's on vacation now because she's a school teacher and it's it makes it hard to get work done during the day because The kids all go off to work. Well, then it's you know, where are you when I need to talk to you? Well, i'm at work So what is wisdom Transcend your individual moment without losing your individual self and you know, we always do this in our minds We have consciousness, but then we have this self that kind of sets apart from consciousness And Sam Harris talked about this in terms of in terms of his In terms of his Consciousness now i'm having trouble focusing because my wife has just decided to text my phone like crazy Transcend your tribal moment without losing your community identity without making your elephant too nervous And and again, this isn't necessarily Religion as such a lot of people try to do this without religion. That's called secularity Now is this process itself religion? Well, you can argue about the word if you want but it's the same process How to prioritize the best data when your ability to discern Is compromised and again peterson talked about this in the oxford video in terms of the american The american system of government where the founding fathers set things up in a way that they assumed The united states wasn't always going to have the kind of presidents that the founding fathers would hope that they would have And so what you want to do is build into your system Things against you and now people do this all the time And I bet you sam harris does I bet you sam harris tries to eat right and exercise And he has his disciplines of meditation and he wants to read history and he wants to read philosophy He's doing all of these things and now he'll say well Well, these aren't religion because i'm i'm keeping myself clean from these Supernatural and I think oh, okay But you're also just kind of Not Availing yourself of any wisdom that might be there and he might say well, there's no wisdom there I'd say well, how do you know this is in a sense kind of the complaint you have against christian people that live behind their church walls And never go out from it and and that those kinds of decisions are always hard to make if you're an alcoholic Do you go down the the wine aisle in the supermarket if you're? If you're a married person do you have a If you're If you're a married person do you hang out with your old girlfriends? If you're struggling with drugs, do you when you get clean need to make all new friends? I mean, it's all these kinds of decisions that we make about Well, I what do I know about myself? I know that I am not always 100 in control of myself. So therefore I will make decisions about my life I will short I will cut off some of my freedoms in order to have The life that I want. Well, there's your ulysses contract. Well Talk to anybody trying to get sober and they'll say, you know It's a lot easier if I do this with a group because if i'm my own judge I'm going to undercut myself and we see each other with a little bit more objectivity than we see ourselves Especially if we can focus on something that's let's say sobriety So together I can do this and okay, so now we're including all of these things And so basically what you're trying to do is what the humanists have been trying to do and say well We're going to have church without god But never seems to do very well. Well, that's because we haven't tried. Well now you're sounding like the communists We even need to critique the winners and again This was a this was a terrific thing and we've got this terrific article and we've got this idea of universal culture and And in a sense truth is that which colonizes and so the truer culture we imagine on a big scale and a long time scale Wins, but here's the problem We only live, you know 50 80 100 years And especially if you're a materialist, this is your only life now And you spent the first 20 years, you know, just trying to learn something you spent the next 10 years. Well Probably trying to figure out relationships and stuff and get into a career Then you spend the next 30 years trying to build a career and then you're too old Well now I can understand sam harris saying well, I want my best conscious life now Because life is short and i've got to get it all in but now you begin to understand the complexities of the issue Because you're embedded within all of these stories and your life itself is a story and you can't even trust yourself And if you think you can trust yourself Live long enough and you'll probably learn you can't Well now i'm starting to sound like jordan peterson So we need to critique the assassin robot Well, how do we critique the assassin robot? Well, we need each other and our stories critique the assassin robot now brett weinstein wants to say yeah But we've got to critique these stories on what basis do you critique these stories? How's that going to go Well, I can talk to people around me Well, and this is where jordan peterson comes in and in a sense brett weinstein too when he talks about evolution and marriage It's really helpful if we can magnify the amount of test cases by looking back in time and reading history Now every one of those people was contextualized. So whenever you read history you begin to discover. Oh my goodness There's so much I have to learn even if I just want to follow the history of the world There's so much I have to learn even if I just want to follow this one thread. Yeah And we thought we knew everything when we were 15 years old and the nice sociologist came and asked us Is it right? Is it who do you who should you have sex with and you just make up an answer because of everything that your Watchers have filtered and there you are And then by the time you become 50 or 60 70 you might have a little bit more wisdom But then pretty soon all that wisdom is going to die And you're going to take it with you and just a little sliver that you leave if anybody has ever paid attention Besides your immediate family most of whom will forget you and die within a couple of generations Wow gets nihilistic fast In a sense what you need to do is dethrone yourself and a lot of those a lot of you out there who've been practicing Meditation and working on buddhism. Well, this is familiar language you need to dethrone yourself. It's not It's not unfamiliar language to christians either christians have a real issue with themselves Well, can you really do this by playing? What if? Well, I don't know. Well, what if god exists? I don't know as long as i'm saying what if god exists I'm not really giving myself to it fully. Am I i'm still sort of playing a pragmatic game? But but what really is deep at the basement of my heart saying why I want to do this because it's constructed You know tim keller has this very interesting thing on divine election that some of you have been asked Well, what about calvinism? What about election? I like tim keller's answer. He said any decision any decision I make leads to a world of unforeseen consequences And so if I didn't believe that god was was loving and sovereign You know, I could dare get out of bed in the morning But if i'm playing as if with my free will i've got free will And I don't really believe I have free will then why get out of bed in the morning Oh, you get out of bed because you're programmed to get out of the bed. Oh, thanks But what do I do with this little sense of self that I have consciousness? Well, you can meditate and get rid of it. Okay, but why am I playing this game at all because I believe what I am is a story and I want my story to matter and I want my story to be interesting And i'm always trying to modulate between having a having a pleasant experience of conscious right now and having a meaningful story right now And often these things are in competition with each other And if I want to have a meaningful story, i'm going to have to embrace suffering This is jordan peterson's pick up your heavy cross and pull it up ale But what if there's nothing on the top of the hill? and so one of the individuals So some of the people watching my videos when they go to the jordan peterson events they they write back to me and And one of the persons who went to the event basically asked him Okay, and he his question got selected and said okay, well What if there's no Nothing at the top of the hill that you're dragging your heavy cross up Is there something up there? And that's when jordan peterson gives his Resurrection answer and says i'd have to think three years before I would know what's up there and it's like Okay, then you're really still playing this as if game If you really want to play it well, well who wins the gold medal in the olympics? the guy who is training as if He's going to the olympics or the person who knows Believes they're going to the olympics Well believing in that sense means something it means something motivationally it means something at great depths of your soul that As if i'm going to the olympics There are days when well i'm training as if i'm going to the olympics but boy That ice that ben and jerry's ice cream really looks good. Well, if you're really going to the olympics You train in a different way If this is the only game mao stalin and hitler got away with it And maybe you will too and will you be able to divorce that from the back of your mind? Or will in some way and again watch my sunday school class from this past week Did lee harvey oswald get away with it? Well, it depends how you figure about jack ruby shooting him But you know, what is getting away with it? What is justice? Can can justice be done? How on earth would justice be done? How on earth would would mao be called to account for the millions dead or stalin or hitler? Adam smith, you know a lot of people look at adam smith and say well that was economics. Well What adam smith really worked on was moral philosophy And and adam smith essentially said it's the hope of trading for another day that keeps you from cheating now See we look at capitalism with you know with Moral scruples now, but adam smith basically was saying Capitalism makes people honest why because they want to get wealthy. Well, what do you have to do to get wealthy? Why? Well, you have to develop virtues virtues and so you want to keep trading honestly So people will keep trading for you with you another day Now you've got piaget and panxeps rats We want to play another day. We want the the Equilibrated game I mean and so well what happens if this is the only game? Well, then you're tempted to think in other ways you say well Even though I really believe it's the only game. I'm going to live as if it isn't and I know peterson keeps saying well belief, but Really believe you know if I really believe that jordan peterson is going to come this wednesday night If I really believe my my wife may or may not agree to come because she's like I don't know if I want to sit and listen to this guy He's generally disposed to him, but you know doesn't know much about him and I said well We'll go to the vip thing. Well, I don't want all kinds of people coming up to me and meeting me and I'm almost a pretty private person. So, you know Live as if well, I believe lord willing Christian phrase I believe jordan peterson is going to be in sacramento wednesday night And I believe i'm going to be in that theater and I believe i'm going to meet some other people in sacramento Or peterson fans and I believe it's going to be a good time I believe i'm going to go on vacation this summer. I believe I believe a lot of things Well, this belief is important I'm going to live as if i'm going To see jordan peterson wednesday night Well, even that little as if Brings me off it. Well, then you might say well, how can you believe this stuff about the resurrection and about jesus? Well, you know we've already talked about it my story is embedded in all of these other stories and just like the Just like the alcoholic that wants to believe there is a higher power that can Deliver him from his alcoholism and so keeps going to group Well, I want to believe in the resurrection. So I keep going to my group. Well, what is my group? My group is the church It's not hard to understand how this stuff works psychologically. Well, how do you know you're right? Well, we've all got that problem If this is the only game miroslav volf i've made this point in other videos too Kill the evildoers here and now because this is the only judgment that can come But if you're trying to get heaven by bringing justice, you'll drag up hell as well And that's what the civil war and the balcons that miroslav volf lived through This was his observation that people who no longer believed in an afterlife wouldn't even live as if there was an afterlife Well, you know, we've got to bring judgment upon our enemies And so we're going to use any means necessary to make their lives miserable and kill them because they've hurt me Well, isn't this implicit in the in all of these, you know Little star wars people who are rising up to to get their weapons to take down the empire Well the who meet the new boss same as the old boss around and around we go If you listen to my sermons, this is a big theme in my sermons in terms of In terms of what jesus does jesus interrupts that process of revolution And says i'm not just going to be another revolutionary I am going to undermine revolution by doing the unthinkable By i'm not going to be a suicide bomber that goes into harrod's palace and blows himself up I am going to become harrod's victim and I am going to not just offer the sacrifice I am going to be the sacrifice and then of course the resurrection comes around and if you lose the resurrection This crucifixion really doesn't make a lot of sense So reason and rationalization post-hoc reasoning looks bad none of us will want to believe this is post-hoc reasoning Well pastor you're just saying these things because you're a pastor pastor You're saying these things because your parents raised you this way pastor You're saying these things because people on patreon are giving you money to say these things pastor You're saying these things because the church pays you to say these things Is there an element of truth of truth to that probably? we're mixed bags, but There's an element of truth to all of our tribalisms and all of these beliefs and all of the ways we are Working through stories We've got reasons to believe this is an illusion well What do I mean? This is an illusion that reason is an illusion. I mean part of the most part of the most interesting thing to me about the Sam harrison dillahunty, which is exactly why C.S. Lewis wrote miracles in the way he did Was they keep appealing to reason? But if we are completely constructed All of my Experience of reason has to be an illusion. It's it's of no It's no different from my experience of being hungry or my experience of itching or my experience of my shoulder hurting It's all just experience. Well, why do we prioritize it with reason? Well, we say we do because we can see that it works Well, how do we know that it works and this is where you get into dillahunty and slick again You're using the same mind to evaluate and so you you keep having this problem in that unless of course reason is something that actually Colonizes nature And isn't simply the product of nature and and that essentially is their argument Well, we know there's something to reason because via reason we can colonize nature We can make the atomic bomb we can build the civilization We can build the internet there must be something true of reason Well, where is that coming from and why is it there and what has the power of colonization? Well truth Okay. Well again go back to my last video on what is truth We suspect it to be true of others But we disagree with it Oh sam harris is not going to give an inch when he meets with jordan peterson Jordan peterson is not going to give an inch when he meets with sam harris And this is why we tend to buy to value people that feel honest to us. Well, what are our What are our metrics of feeling honest? Well, it's by the tone of their voice. It's by how sincere they look Then again, there are celebrities in our culture our actors who are paid to misrepresent Well to represent other people's stories And what do we have well hand wringing for a hundred years You know when when is religion going to give up the ghost? it ain't in fact the The degree to which you can help people clarify their systems It's the fuzzy that suffer It's not the religious It's not even the atheist why? See, I would argue atheists are religious too. Now, of course sam harris says atheism is nothing Yeah, you're doing a lot of argument for nothing The story is here to stay and this is why you know, so watched a video from Amy k she had a couple of video commentaries and after seeing the vancouver event and she's you know She's a sam harris fangirl and she loves sam harris And if I was sam harris's wife, I'd probably wouldn't be so happy about amy k getting too close to sam harris So maybe sam harris's wife is a very secure woman. Uh, jordan peterson's wife travels with jordan peterson They've managed to stay married for 30 years probably because they have all of these agreements and their love is Built within a storied context story is here to stay Part of the reason I don't buy The harris dilahunty frame of life or maybe it's because i've been constructed this way but because I just find story to absolutely powerful and pervasive And even if sam harris is right His way loses because As long as we have human beings, they're going to have stories and if you I think jordan peterson is dead on right here. If you take people's religious stories away Filling in with new stories. I was in a hospital. I was in a hospital waiting room once with a family and A member of that family was dying sometimes As a pastor you you get to be around Dying people And this individual was dying in the hospital in a very in a way that was very hard to watch his body wasn't His body wasn't giving up and there was just spasms and he's and Terribly emotionally difficult for his wife to watch actually it was this was his estranged wife and um And I remember in the in the being in the waiting room and his estranged wife and her brother embraced and they began to sing a song and it was a kenny rogers song and it was nostalgic and sappy and Really a silly little song but for these two well The freedom from religion people would say they find meaning and wonder in a kenny rogers song Good for them, but that's the point This is how we are made We are Tribal as brett weinstein says and I think we are religious to the core And I think the real difficulty you have if you're going to maintain this atheist position Not that I I can understand if you say well, I can't believe in a god. Okay, I understand that The difficulty is that you would imagine that somehow you will not be What we would call religious. Okay, the word gives you hives Have a worldview have a philosophy of life But what you will not be divorced from is the power of story and the power of stories that have been Going all the way back in time. Now, is it only judaeo-christian stories? No, but judaeo-christian stories have had this power that we've seen again and again in human history of them Triumphing over and now the story warfare is going right now and there's the as scott adams scott adams scott alexander calls the universal story and then there's you know christian stories and and islamic stories and and Well, wasn't it recently that that iceland? They they have a a new temple to their norse gods and What you'll probably hear is wow, we're getting rid of the christian gods. Okay, and we're really atheist deep down Okay, but we're gonna have this norse temple and it's like Track record track record track record look behind us. What do we do as human beings? We do what we've always done. Well me i'm gonna do differently Yeah, a little 80 year old self that has been developed through all of this time If you're a materialist you can't help but recognize all of the layers of construction and Story is built into everyone so Looks like an hour and 45 minutes Don't know if it was my best video or not. Uh, just a couple little end notes. So yeah today is monday I'll post this later today Jordan peterson is coming to sacramento on wednesday. So I will be there If my wife decides to go she'll be there with me. Otherwise, i'll find someone else to go with me And i'm going to the vip event. So we'll probably have 30 seconds to shake jordan's hand and get a picture So i'll get my picture with him and i'll probably post that in a video. Why not? But what'll be more fun about the vip event? Will actually probably be meeting others of you who go to the vip event and um, or Meet before after our jordan peterson meetup is the next night and so Yeah, uh if you're around tomorrow or around wednesday night In sacramento love to meet you
