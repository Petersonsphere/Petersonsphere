 Hi, this is Paul. I wanted to do a little bit more commentary on biblical series 5 So we'll just call this commentary on biblical series 5b I might give it a different title for the YouTube and I'm continuing to piece together Jordan Peterson on sacrifice and in biblical series 5 It's a pretty important element fairly early on about minute 17 And a bunch of a bunch of his ideas come together in this and the same for his Easter Same for his Easter video. I have a small executive airport near my house, and that's why there are planes flying overhead Bunch of ideas bundled together here what what in what Christians call the fall often in Genesis 3 This is where Peterson of course talks about he talks about this in some of the earlier biblical series We discover the future. This is where we go to die and as a response we sacrifice now I'm probably going to talk a little bit more I have in my past videos about why there is no There is no altar in the garden and you can find that in my in my video on the symbolism of sacrifice So so as a response we sacrifice and now for Peterson, this is all bundled together with delayed Gratification in other words, this is acted out as the literal practice of offering animals and now they're in the ancient world There's a lot of offering food to the gods and it's very transactional It's very much an exchange if you treat that if you offer food to the gods If you if you feed the gods if you give the gods what they want then the gods are going to give you what they want You're reading any ancient mythology and many of the gods are transactional you can hear a lot of those themes in my sermons in terms of The Jew-israelite distinctiveness in that area and how the and how the Lord Changes How the Lord works on those themes in terms of covenant and how broad the covenant was for the Israelites I offer, you know, he he wants obedience more than sacrifice and the covenant The covenant cares about details of your life some of which, you know Sam Harris will mock Actually, there's a lot in the Bible about masturbation There's Onan but what the great sin of Onan in the book of Genesis was that Onan failed to impregnate His dead brother's wife so that his dead brother's line could be carried on. So anyway As a response we sacrifice and we delay Gratification and this is acted out in the literal practice of offering animals you offer animals food drink child to the gods That dumb plane just wants to fly right overhead and And this is this is bound together So in other words first we act out in drama and you'll hear Peterson repeat this again and again first we act out in drama we We act out in drama and this this gets built then into our lives and we can speak it and then after time the sacrifice gets abstracted and you find that in Christian churches in a sense the the sacrificial part of a Christian worship services It's right there in the language the offering So if you come to Living Stones, there will be about midway through the service There'll be time for the offering where we're in a sense you offer your sacrifice and you're not bringing a dove or a goat or a or a bull you are Offering a check or cash or something and you put it into the plate and the priest In Protestant tradition, we call them. I call myself a pastor that gets into a lot of the fight of the Reformation But but this is how that that very early thing gets abstracted into present practice and the Christian practice the Christian discipline of giving tithing in many traditions, which is ten percent Christian denominations vary on Should it be ten percent must it be ten percent? But the idea is that it should be a sacrifice It should be it should be delayed gratification. You should be offering something to God which is costly now the the point that Peterson makes is that this this Gets this strength in certain things for us conscientiousness rehearsed and strengthened in religion now often You'll hear Peterson and others slip into the global historical Darwinian We we've been doing this we've been watching each other for 3.5 million years or we've been doing this for Hundreds of thousands of years or we've been doing this for thousands of years this we obviously doesn't mean us as individuals means us as a Collective us as a species. So we have watched those who sacrifice succeed This is Peterson's this is Peterson's assertion. And again, you have what does he say in the same video? You have conscientiousness and intelligence as being the the two traits that are that relate to success Overall success and now this success is in you know, very much in the secular realm. We're watching this You have the marshmallow test those who are able to delay gratification can actually succeed in the world and so here you have the idea of What is this isn't Peterson? This is me from the book of Ezekiel What is true in the temple is played out in the streets so if you are a society or if you are an individual that cannot degrade Delay gratification that cannot save that cannot sacrifice that cannot practice these things then you basically lose in the competition of life against those societies that can or if your family does not Delay gratification does not sacrifice for each other does not stick up for each other does not Put the needs of the of the group ahead of the needs of the individual Let's say and this is where Peterson's individualism gets complicated Then you are outperformed by the groups that do in the secular realm now he part of the implicit point here is that What you practice in church gets played out in the rest of your life and as a pastor I see this all the time it's Don't want to rat anybody out, but it's often the most not always but often the people who Are most faithful in church the people who are the most faithful in giving the people who are most faithful in showing up every week for worship those who are most faithful in Service giving themselves for the well-beings of others now these are some of these practices are lauded as a society when we see those who Who faithfully serve at the soup kitchen or those who faithfully show up to? To help even those in the broader secular society are seen as rightful objects of benevolence or mercy These are the people we esteem and the people who practice this and the things of their life Practice it in in all aspects of their life and Again and again and again surveys show that religious people give more not just to their specific religious charities, but to other charities and other causes as well religious people practice Sacrifice in their lives Now this this is this is complicated. So so the skeptics question comes along and says well, can you keep the secular trait? Build the mental muscle and if you watch that will Schroeder video that I mentioned in the first one Can you practice that can you keep the secular trait and discard the wool? which is of course the the metaphysical claims the the traditional religious stories the the mythology Now a big part of this question is how mysterious are we to ourselves yesterday? I posted a video I don't have my whole office the problem with doing a Saturday morning video is that Saturday morning Student pilots try takeoff and landing and keep buzzing around the executive airport Which is why we get a lot of a lot of little planes coming through So now Sam Harris might wait in and say well you can keep the secular trait while discarding the wool you can discard the mythology the metaphysical claims all of these things But this gets into the question that I thought was was beautifully illustrated in the Ocon The Ocon conversation between Peterson and Yar and Brooke because Yar and Brooke to me expressed an incredibly naive Anthropology about how people work he says well, you know, I've been formed and he just took it back as far as his birth And as Peterson said earlier, there's there's no there's no serious psychologist who would who would accept that and the more we learn about epigenetics the more we learn about successive generations the more we see that the decisions made by your grandparents grandparents great grandparents affect each of us psychologically Biologically in many many ways that we are deeply tied to our Ancestors in ways that we as modern secular people have completely lost touch with now Ancient people and traditional people around the world Recognize this and practice this and live this usually embodied within their religion and this is the way in which religions That this is this is the entire you know This is the big contribution of Peterson where he's he's making Peterson isn't alone in making these claims that Generationally these these religious traits get into us deeply in a Multi-generational way so the decisions that you make with respect to religion will impact your children and your grandchildren Whether or not they're conscious of it whether or not they're going to church Because this is this gets built into us at a very deep way at a very mysterious way and as Again as one of my dogs making noise And again as as Peterson notes. We are just the thin Realm we're just this thin film on top of this giant this giant creature and and you know you think about Jonathan Haidt and the elephant in the rider the riders not that not That aware of everything that's built into the evidence and into the elephant now if you go back to my Melanie Brewster video A number of videos ago ago as you know why as groups? Why are religious people happier and more generous and now Melanie Brewster in her video at skepticon? Psychologically studying Atheists I mean she she makes this plea for you know can can atheists please organize and act like church people Well, here's the question. Can you do that without the mythology to what degree does the mythology? support and able and and really allow church people Multi-generationally to succeed I believe Sun Tzu and his art of war makes comments similar to this basically Wars are won and lost in the temple long before they you know they are practiced out on the battlefield and And I I believe this in terms of what I've seen in like now you might say well of course you believe this you're a pastor And you're you have stock in the religious marketplace But but I think it's I think it's far deeper than that and again. I think We especially in our culture in our Western American culture. We have so little Appreciation for generational wisdom and generational realities that we And I think in some ways Sam Harris's the philosophy He's promoting is incredibly susceptible to this because okay I'm going to judge things by by my conscious well-being well if a human life is 80 years conscious Well-being is a moment and you might say a series of moments and and Sam Harris isn't that naive he he he widened it, but what religion does is religion looks at hundreds and thousands of years and takes all of that into account to build its system and I'm not going to you know so in a sense That's what many religions have in favor of them, but all religions are not the same so different religions will Obviously preach different things assert different things here comes the airplane again It's the same airplane that just keeps buzzing and messing up my video Got a house full of people, so I don't want to I don't want to Do this and bother them because I am kind of loud So so these are these are the issues that are going on Peterson will also go into the the issue of Israelite self It is that same plane just up and down up and down up and down. He's learning I should I should be more kind and generous to him And maybe I should practice Israelite safe blame right now and say well well dummy Why did you do a video outside in your backyard on a Saturday morning? Well, it's because I had the idea in my head and when I have the idea in my head It's easier to do the video because if I get busy with the rest of the day the video might not get done So one of the things that Peterson brings up again and again is that the children of Israel blame themselves and you see this built into the Old Testament again and again because the story of the Old Testament is is Rise and fall and rise and fall rise and corruption and the Israelites just keep getting knocked down They they're a small nation in the midst of you know trying to cut out a living between Egypt and the Mesopotamian empires and so they you know They're just their their bottom lobsters in some ways and they keep getting knocked down But instead of doing what has become the fashion in American culture They take responsibility onto themselves and this is the opposite of a lot of contemporary counsel, you know blame Blame the other gender or blame the other race or blame the other blame the government or blame someone else or blame your parents and Well, yeah, you can do that that might make you feel better that might give you a sense of conscious well-being But what it's not going to do is Actually help you to do better in your life and as Peterson again and again notes There are things that you can do to improve your situation And if you practice this liturgy this religious liturgy of blaming others You are not going to make those self-improvements in your life So this is in alignment with this take responsibility math message and and if this doesn't discourage you It can lead you to pick up your heavy cross and struggle up the hill which I think is the heart of Peterson's religion and and again you can see Peter Peterson illustrate this in the story that he tells of he's gonna square off with one of his friends and have a Have a little fistfight as a as a grade school kid and his mom is walking by and she sees this and she just keeps Walking because she thinks yeah, son You're gonna have to learn to deal with your friends and if you get a if you get a bloody nose or a black eye Or you get pushed around and you you know Your your friend is able to show himself as stronger before the the little girl that's on the ball team That's messed up the the boy culture that you've got going on good on you You might as well learn this when you're you're 8 or 10 or 12 rather than being an idiot when you're 20 or 30 This of course raises now my dog wants to get in the video this of course raises the good without God question Are we wired in such a way that those who practice religion Outperform those who try to embrace the secular abstract now if you remember again Don Hoffman he talks about the tricks and hacks that we have we don't really see and Encounter Physical world directly we see it we perceive it through the tools that we have it to me This is just obvious there are radio waves going through me My PC is connected up to my house Wi-Fi. I don't see those I don't have the kind of senses that can that can actually experience the radio waves But I know those weight those radio waves are real And if I didn't have a computer or my cell phone in order to to measure that Wi-Fi signal I would be oblivious to it and so we are oblivious to much. We are only Conscious of that which our senses could take in and so we work with these tricks and hacks Well, maybe there are selective individuals who can go without woo-woo, but as a group religious But as a group religious humans outperform Even with archaic Bronze Age stories now again Sam Harris and others want to say well we can get rid of those stories and we can we can just fashion this on our Own and this actually has been tried over and over again in the modern realm You might have to eat it but that then leads back to the other question with the Aaron Brooke thing Well, how conscious are we how much do we really know and even if you apply a scientific a scientific Metric to that we would have to say well We might not know as much as we think we know and if you actually want to play it safe You probably should keep practicing that plus you have the multi-generational factor now Maybe that the secular children of religious parents continue to maintain Habits and traits that are built into them and therefore succeed with those habits and traits But I would say and and often in my experience people People go to Sunday school when they're a kid in there They they throw it off in their early or late teens and they they pray they live as secular people in their 20s and 30s they get into their 40s they have a divorce they have a bankruptcy things start getting dicier Complexity grows they get into their 50s and 60s their body starts to break down and what do they do? They start going to church you start facing they start facing what comes next and they say well I I don't know what comes next but you know, it's it's Pascal's wager What if I do go to church? I've got that on my next slide What if I do go to church Maybe I should pay attention to God Here comes the plane in other ways in other words You don't really know how well those Bronze Age stories are working for you And you don't really know the ways in which the religion actually shapes you because you don't you just know a thin thin film of who you are and And this makes it interesting why it's a psychologist Jordan Peterson as a psychologist is bringing this stuff forward Now you also have the is as if strong enough if you're playing the mental reservation game now the mental reservations game says Well, there seems to be evidence that being religious can give me and my children and my grandchildren a Darwinian adaptive advantage to out-compete our competitors So therefore I'm going to be religious or I'm going to live as if God is real and I'm gonna live as if Christianity is But that's a mental reservation game because if you're always playing that game And you're not actually deep within it if you're not actually living within a constructed world Where and this is basically if you want to think psychologically what a church service is Well, you go every week and you have the myths reinforced in you and you rehearse the practices again If you go to the will Schroder video The better way to think about the brain another analogy the brain a computer really isn't a good analogy for the brain because My computer doesn't need exercise but rehearsal Reinforces pathways and so all of these practices of religion of rehearsing of You know of I do this ritual every week we sing praises to God You know secular people might come to church and say why do you sing praises to God? I am strengthening those neural pathways. I am building delayed gratification. I am So this is this is one of the one of the doubts I have about Peterson's game and that By not going to church and say I type those all the time in my in my PowerPoint by not going to church How are you missing out? You are not basically living into? the Here comes another airplane by not going to church. You are not building those neural pathways. You are not living into Basically, you're not building you're not building it into yourself now again if you look at Peterson's Darwinian view of religion Well, why did religion why did religion develop it offers an adaptive advantage? Why is religion nearly universal well the product offered an adaptive advantage? And now if you're a secularist you say well I can forego this adaptive advantage while you do so at your own peril But again the as-if the as-if game. I'm not sure that's strong enough now This isn't to say that Christians including myself don't always have nagging doubts Charles Taylor in the secular age says basically at this period to be a believer And he was a Roman Catholic to be a believer is to is to live with doubts, and I think that's true But I remember an Amway salesman who was a member of my church when I when I came to Sacramento And I didn't know this about him, but one day he says pastor. I really need to talk to you And I thought okay something must have happened Maybe I had a fight with his wife or maybe one of his kids are in trouble or maybe He's in trouble with something so I cleared my schedule and sat down with them and then he tried to sell me Amway which which kind of ticked me off because You know I know all about Amway, but but then he explained to me says well You know I started going to a Christian Reformed Church because well the founders of Amway grew up going to a Christian Reformed Church the I talked to Javan Andal or rich DeVos and I remember which one you talked to probably rich DeVos and and rich DeVos said well if you want to Be successful there comes that darn plane Rich DeVos who's a tremendously wealthy man he owns. I think he owns the Orlando Magic he Incredibly wealthy man's basically said well if you want to be successful you should go to church So this guy starts going to church, and he says what time we kind of a church Did you grow up in a Christian Reformed Church? So he finds the at that time the only Christian Reformed Church in Sacramento and starts going to it And he was a he was a fine man had a lovely family a faithful member all of those things Little I'm a little chagrined to know that he was doing this in order in a sense to serve the God of money But what he learned in the process I'm sure was quite a bit about What sir the shortcomings of serving the God of money? So what is your true God and does it matter and I think it does matter and then you have the multigenerational question We all know the power of childhood religious formation that one was definitely a student pilot It was a little wobbly, but we all know the power of childhood religious formation It gets in deep into our neural pathways and and how much does the faith of your father's your mother's your grandparents impact? Their performance the delayed gratification of subsequent generations again Peterson's point is that these things are bonded together in us And that sacrifice delayed gratification our knowledge of death in the future these are these got into us Evolutionarily and this is part of the reason why you're not going to eradicate religion It's just too deep into us. So sorry atheists It's not spoken, but it's it's not just spoken It's lived out and what is true in the temple what you do in the church gets played out in the rest of your life And of course, this isn't let's not look at this in a simplistic fashion There are plenty of there's always hypocrisy in church. You know, we're we're not only in competition with each other we're in competition with our with ourselves in many ways and and but all of this is is Brought into religious language in terms of struggling with sin Why do religious groups create laws that they can't actually fulfill or comply with? Well, this is this is all about self-improvement and striving Struggling uphill and so on a in a secular perspective all of this religious stuff makes sense So it's evolutionary competition as a deep longitudinal study In other words when I look at all the studies that we do well, we we study these things Well, have we been able to study for a thousand years or for a number a few hundred years in effect? What life is is this grand experiment on this huge scale? But we you know social scientists try to study well social science hasn't been around that long And so in a sense what historians try to do little little props for my history degree here What historians try to do is look at those and do comparisons on a far on a far larger scale and this again is why the the cheap critique of religion by many by many celebrity atheists is is so shallow because They're not that they're not really appreciating The game religions are playing why you have a Canonical baseline why you have a confessional layer that gets changed and morphs why practices morph and and how religions by keeping that baseline or by keeping that holy text are actually playing games over a hundred and thousands of years trying to refine and perfect and You know Always keeping in mind well is God blessing and this is why again, if you listen to my previous videos where we talk about you know the difference between a religion and an idea out Ideologies and ideology is a very short-lived thing that's been playing its game long enough to actually Compete over the long haul whereas religions are competing over the very long haul and religions are multi-layered So on one layer you can say the law of sowing and reaping we say well, you know What you sow you shall reap so if you if you eat lousy and never exercise you will You will you will have bad health, but if you if you you know if you look at why Christians in Latin America have That while they have to call the evangelical bump because many evangelicals in Latin America the men stop drinking they stop smoking They use their money to devote to the education and the welfare of their wives and their children and their children therefore grow up better educated More disciplined better able to compete they've seen their father model Family practices in the home and this then goes generation to generation and this is why many evangelicals as opposed to nominal Catholics not necessarily Observant Catholics but nominal Catholics who well they might go to mass once a year at Christmas and Easter But for the most part they live their life feeding their indulgences feeding their appetites where Christians by virtue of the religion start to start to Reign in their appetites and get disciplined about their life and this has a multi-generational effect So then you have the agnostic question. Can you know for sure now again? My read of Peterson is that he's an open agnostic. He doesn't practice Christianity He says he lives as if it is true, but he's making this up as he goes along Whereas if you're a religious person you're standing on the shoulders of Generations of religious people you inherit the religious traits now again Not all religions are the same and I would have I will of course embrace mine but what happens with different religious sub traditions like Christian Reformed Church and reformed Christianity and Protestant Christianity within confessional creedal Christianity, you know, there's there's there's degrees of awareness and so Protestants continue to learn from Roman Catholics and from the Orthodox and vice versa and there's a very alive Conversation lived out intentions between all of these groups on a massive scale over long periods of time These are not the kind of things that you're gonna sit down one afternoon and just say oh, I think I'll do this Well, yeah, you can but that's Evolutionarily Darwinian Lee that's a really dumb approach Doesn't someone have the the Darwin Awards they give every year to to stupid ways in which people die and take their genes out of the pool and what's interesting is for example if you listen to Jordan Peterson's take on gay marriage He takes it. He looks at it as a Darwinian. It says, you know, why? You know same-sex couples are sterile Why do they need marriage now? He's looking at long views of marriage not the not the the secular The secular American romanticized we do marriage in order to Have equality with other people or make us feel better Well, what is marriage for marriage is a long-term Multi-generational game that allows a family to compete well against its rivals that allows a nation to compete well against its rivals Again all of these things are built into religion and all of these things are practiced and sacrifice and that practice of sacrifice has done in churches and other religious institutions the practice of submission Is this is this is all built into a very, very long game. When you look at, for example, the way marriage is going in the West right now It wouldn't be surprising to see that in two or three generations the only people who marry will be the religious and the wealthy the wealthy marriage and marry in order to preserve their money and the religious marry in order to Practice their religion and practice, you know sexual restraint and all of those things that are built in religion and are Are quickly dismissed and mocked in fact from outside groups So you have the agnostic question. Well, do you really know how much you're doing? Can you really know how deep this stuff goes then you get into paschal's wager? Well um if religion has a if religion has an adaptive advantage against competitors, well, what if Religion is right about divine judgment. What if and actually divine judgment is something that's very Very much goes across religions. You have the the egyptian book of the dead and again and again Almost all religions have a judgment day at the end of your life where you're called to account for what you've done And paschal's wager basically says hey Do you really want to be unprepared for that test even just risking whether or not that test will come? Why don't you play it safe if you have all of these reasons to be religious? Well, why don't you do it when here comes the plane again? So then the question are you going to bet against history is secularism the apex? Or is it the flush before the corruption in terms of the religious arc? so in other words, maybe you've given up religion and and you're You're basically still inheriting and this is very much niches point that God is dead and as peterson says they're they're feasting off the decaying carcass Of their parents or ancestors. Well That carcass continues to decay and maybe you will you will be okay But your children aren't and this very much gets into the the competition that sam harris is thinking about well You'd better not why would you want to teach your children all of those things? Why not just give your children the secular version of morality of today? And this is where I think sam harris and the celebrity atheist arguments really fall short because as peterson and many others you don't need to you don't need to be very smart to realize that the the version of rational morality that is being portrayed is basically just the One version of the contemporary outlook of it. It's the morality du jour and if you look at If actually you have a religious background or you study history you can see that Moralities change dramatically and what what religions do? Is actually provide a platform in which you can critique changes and you can assess changes because you're holding a baseline the part of the problem with this supposedly rationality based morality is You're probably not holding any kind of baseline because you've got a monarchical vision of your reality of your moral reality and you say well We know this is moral well a hundred years ago. They thought they knew what was moral secularly and a hundred years from now they're going to think they know what is moral and if you're not actually in a deep rich conversation with your Ancestors and ancestors going back not only hundreds, but thousands of years even from a darwinian perspective How do you know that which will help you adapt and succeed and compete? And that's not even taking into account pleasing god, which is the religious perspective and this gets into What I think was really the contribution of peterson in the first vancouver conversation with sam harris where peterson and i've wanted to do a video on this more directly where peterson basically Fleshed out the much older broader view of god upon which let's say the evangelical view of god Which it's that specific slice that sam harris and many of the celebrity atheists are really complaining about But that little slice sits upon this marger less larger More dominant view of god That basically says you know god is in charge of everything and to one degree or another now This is highly nuanced in religions But to one degree or another Everything that happens can be ascribed to god and this this is still fairly richly represented in my slice of protestantism, which is calvinism if you go into some penicostal groups, they might see much more of a Middle Spiritual angelic good versus evil if you read frank paredes novels, for example on this present darkness Those things came out in the 80s and 90s and caused quite a stir because they were dramatic novels that imagined That just behind the veil of what we see in human perception There's angels and demonic and spiritual warfare going on now I'm not denying spiritual warfare because that is in fact biblical but kind of that rich way of representing it that's that's With the penicostals i've had penicostal people come to me and say well Well, you know when bad things happen, that's because devils are doing it and when good things happen That's because god's doing it and god and demons are always kind of in this in this competition and there is a layer in the bible that talks about that so i'm not getting rid of the layers, but what a truly well-formed religion does is be able to Manage stack up all those layers see all of those layers integrate those layers and manage those layers Because that's actually what is in the bible that all of those layers are present and they're integral and managed And it offers lots of different language and lots of different means of interpreting because again This system has been built for thousands of years through many many cultures and many many contexts And all of that wisdom is built into it and to think that Me who lives 60 or 70 years is just going to sit down with my rational mind and outcompete Thousands of years of millions of human beings working through this in terms of how many different life experiments Think about that rationally and think about which system is smarter me all by myself with my tiny little slice and view of human reality or millions of people thousands of years hundreds of cultures cultures both horizontally Horizontally and vertically so thousands of years hundreds of cultures all being poured into and expressed in the bible in theology in conversation Expressed in denominations expressed in subcultures all of this constantly working out and this is in a sense what religious people especially pastors and theologians work on now if there's a blind side that the intellectual dark intellectual dark web has is that they don't have enough theologians in the conversations or historians because And this is a cultural american weakness now. I'll give you an example. There are some sacramental has a has a fairly robust and and pretty Long-term japanese and chinese population and many of these chinese business people They've been in america You know since the gold rush days their families have but they continue to maintain their culture So a good number of them are actually christians, but they have very long-term perspectives and they They play the long game americans tend to play the short game americans tend to be full of themselves Well me and my little brain right now I can think of everything I need to know and i'm going to make my rational decision and i'm going to do well Well, you might be doing well in the short term, but are you going to do well in the long term? and and this goes Yeah, this is not a unique argument to me, obviously but this simplistic dismissal of Religion is a very short-term game now Brett weinstein will say well we we have to kind of You know take it apart. Well, yeah And and this is the point that i've made before that you know religious people Do change over time and religious people do adapt over time, but what religion offers them is a framework Through which they actually Measure and track and adjust and Work on all of those adaptations for example right now the one of the two of the hottest adaptations being played with Especially in the protestant churches because protestant churches tend to be on the much more adaptive side and your more ancient traditions like the orthodox and the roman catholic they tend to be more on the You know, they've got this large institutional And weight that they're dragging behind them that makes change very slow Now there are adaptive advantages to both respects so two of the big games that are being played out in terms of the church in the west are women's roles and now same-sex marriage, so you'll have Left you'll have left Protestant churches far on the left that are always jumping on the bandwagon. Okay, so they're playing out that game and Again and again, you'll hear in those conversations Well, you know if we want to keep the youth we should be You know adopting women's roles and you know contemporary women's gender roles and same-sex marriage This is what we should practicing and we're not going to police the sexuality of of individuals. And so Okay That's the game that churches on the left are playing more conservative churches say no god is against this Okay So they're employing the tradition as a bulwark against change and so you have some churches playing this experiment Some churches playing this experiment some churches playing this experiment don't ask don't tell and so you've got actually with all of these churches You're all modulating all of this change and we're doing this live and we're doing this multi-generationally So what's going to happen? Well churches that are changing fast are they succeeding well Look at the stats probably not but it's Multi-faceted because there's many many many variables going on in terms of whether or not churches are doing well Or not doing well. And in fact, this is multi-generational some of the most successful churches recently have been christian Heretical churches that the creedal churches would call heretical the jehovah's witnesses have a are not trinitarian and the latter-day saints church is arguably atheistic but yet they see themselves as christian and their christian adaptations they've been doing very well now The question is how long will they keep doing very well? And this is the same question going on in terms of churches that are keeping you know churches that are resisting ideas about evolution and You can see that these things get played at multiple levels And so again and now this isn't just happening here in north america or in the west You've got churches in africa that are flourishing or declining. You've got the church in china has been an experiment You've got churches in india And what happens in religious contexts is we are tracking all of this stuff and you can do this because you actually have a baseline and again Religious people are not doing this Intentionally now i've just articulated intentionally and i'm not the only one who who pays attention to this and i'm doing this in terms of a voice to framing this in a secular realm so that secular people can understand the game religious people are playing But religious people are not playing this as a secular game. They are fully nested within their religious framework Which is obviously the only and the best way that they can play this game if they're fully within it And you know this even if you play computer games we have language for it. I'm into it Well, what does that mean? That means that when i'm playing my computer games I sit in my special computer game chair and I have headphones on and I have two or three monitors up and I immerse myself In it and the more I immerse myself in it and i'm not distracted by other things the better I can play the game Well, this is happening in religions all over the place. Is it irrational? No, it's not irrational at all religious people are using rationality within That which they are nested The thing that rationalists have a difficulty understanding is that they in fact are themselves Nested in a reality and they are rational within that spectrum now. I think a lot of rationalists It's it's natural for us If you're going to be embedded into something to embrace the naive perspective the naive perspective says Because I am going to fully be immersed within what I am doing But if you look at I think again think about don hoffman all of this are tricks and hacks in terms of our interface with the world and So even if you adopt a darwinian perspective Well, who is going to out compete? Well, how long is the competition? The competition is open ended Now secularists might be saying ah, it's the religious people that are in denial of climate change and environmental devastation that are Going to cause the downfall of us in the world Well, maybe but you'll notice that there are plenty of religious people including the roman catholic church The pope is on record as as talking about, you know creation care and there's plenty of There are plenty of resources within the christian faith that talks about creation care And look at look at an environmentalist like john muir now he had Theologically, I could critique his theology a bit, but he had a robust christian He had a robust christian environmental perspective Okay, so and this is how religions have within them Adaptations that when called upon these adaptations tend to flourish So I didn't play any of the biblical series five but biblical series five in the first about minute 17 and on Peterson gets into this and peterson returns again and again to these themes and this is the long-term game That's being played that for the most part secularists aren't paying attention to And I would argue in fact that the conversation within the intellectual dark web Is deficient in these realms because here's a fact Most i'm not i'm trying with the with the exception of ben shapiro Nobody in the intellectual dark web seems to have much of a theological education That's a deficit Because as I would argue that basically the case I made in this video that's probably i'm gonna have to go into the naming of it Religious people are playing the longest term relit the longest term darwinian experiment. We know Why would you ignore it? Why would you not participate? There's my plea There's my video
